Keep in mind that we're talking about the raw protocol, the skeleton of what will eventually be a robust and effective system.
I would not be surprised to see another layer of functionality built over top of the base network that facilitates quicker transactions below a certain threshold.

So we all know one of the biggest problems with the current world economic system is the corruption and lack of transparency. Many see Bitcoin's transparency as a new beacon of honesty and integrity that will trump sleazy, backdoor dealings once people realize the genius of it.
If I'm to understand, Dark Wallet seeks to obscure the paper trail of Bitcoin transactions. How is removing Bitcoin's transparency (and hence accountability) going to help it in the long run? Maybe I'm just not understanding the technology?
I see a short term boost of privacy, but a long term degradation on the reputation of Bitcoin through shady underhanded deals, just like in our current day banking system, with no chance for cyber watchdogs to keep powerful criminals in check.

@_date: 2014-03-10 14:53:40
I can address  for you. Your coins are always sitting on the blockchain (distinct from blockchain.info). All coins always reside there.
What blockchain.info and your wallet are doing when they show your balance is scouring the entire transaction history of the blockchain and adding up the balance from all transactions that have gone to or from your public address. Both are just tools for reporting to you your balance in a more user-friendly way.

I think the point is, we always trust a potentially untrustworthy 3rd party with all our dollars constantly. The alternative to that is mattress money if you still prefer to work within the fiat system.

I've speculated a lot on this issue, and keep in mind that this comes with no real knowledge of macroeconomics, but the answer largely lies in who is Satoshi, where is he, and will he eventually redeem his coins?
All we know is that he has them and they have lay dormant for a coupe years. Here are a couple scenarios:
1) Satoshi is dead/kidnapped/in Guantanemo, etc. This is the more tinfoil-hat-wearing of the scenarios, as it implies that the banking cartels may have sought his downfall and done anything within their power to him to get him to buckle and give up the "secret password" or whatnot that would make Bitcoin conveniently disappear. Needless to say, there is no such password, and by the time the banks got to him, it was too late and Bitcoin was out of the cage. After all of that, letting him simply go would be too much of a liability.
2) He's in hiding and biding his time to dive in and change the world. This scenario largely depends on what kind of a person is and how he would see the world changed. If he is the evil dictator sort, I think people would flock to other currencies, negating his power to an extent. This is the beauty of the self-regulating market of VCs. Otherwise, he could be a great guy and really leverage his power for the benefit of mankind, in which case, he could solidify his power not through owning a large portion of the world's currency, but through gaining the respect of the masses.
tldr: He's either gone (moot point, no one gets the coins) or he's waiting (the type of person he is dictates whether people flock to other currencies, or stay with Bitcoin)

Sure you are.
You're probably thinking of the disparity that will exist still when the early adopters become the new 1%.
What I believe you may be failing to consider is that someone who is poor will have a much easier time separating the rich from their money if they are talented, work hard, etc.
Right now, the rich are propped up by easy money creation, but that won't last forever, and then money creation will be in the hands of the network, not the elite. This is what I mean by a true level playing field.

This is an important psychological phenomena to address in the community. I've encouraged friends and family to get involved and usually what they'll say is "a bitcoin is $400? I can't even afford an entire bitcoin!".
It's at that time I remind them that there are far less bitcoins than people in the world, but they don't seem to care.
"thinking" that you're getting a lot of something will seriously help adoption. Why buy 0.04 bitcoins when you can instead get 40000 bits?

If you take a look at the current banking system, it relies not only on anonymity (for the top players, Federal Reserve shareholders, etc), but also zero transparency. Money gets shuffled around all over the place and the public is none the wiser.
In Bitcoin, now everyone has anonymity, not just the big corrupt players. On top of that, there is complete transparency. Money getting shuffled around by bad eggs can be tracked and found out. A good example of this is how publicly serving cyber-detectives were able to warn the community of Mt. Gox's insolvency ahead of time.
@_date: 2014-11-19 14:58:17
Which would be completely valid if the general population had no experience or bias towards either direction.
We're used to dealing with large numbers and trailing zeroes. Leading zeroes are unfamiliar to most, since when dealing in currency, the most decimal places anyone deals with is two.
This also helps for small, common transactions like buying a coffee. Let's say it costs 0.00001123 for a coffee (in a future where BTC are worth much more). The user has to type those trailing zeroes and check that there are the right number there.
Compare that to paying 11.23 uBTC, or bits.

I believe there was talk a while ago of moving the decimal place two spots to the right. As Bitcoin continues to increase in value, it would make a lot of sense to shift the decimal place essentially "splitting" Bitcoin, much as a stock splits to keep the price low.
This would change a 0.03 BTC coffee to a 3 BTC coffee. Easier to instantly see and valuate on the spot.
So to answer your question, it is absolutely possible if the development team decides that to do so.

Ayn Rand doesn't often distinguish between authoritarianism and leftism, because under Stalin's government, the two were so inextricably interwoven.
As a consequence, she knee-jerked towards far-right libertarianism, in which you discard bloated and ineffective government for sociopathic corporatism. It's like treating burns with liquid nitrogen.
Her message also tends to get misconstrued in that people who believe her tenets blindly trust in the rich, instead of the innovators that Rand lauded.
Surely, we're now seeing the epiphony of Rand's ideals in that corporate bonuses, bailouts, lobbying and dirty money far exceed the paltry sum that goes towards "handouts" for ome people's much needed social assistance.
I would personally like to see a more centred, evidence-based policy. Things tend toward right-authoritarianism currently worldwide.

I tend to see human progress as 33 steps forward, 32 steps back, due to (as you say) our flawed physiology, greed, etc.

I think having a constructive discussion on this is a great idea, but I haven't heard many cases made for uBTC or mBTC.
I personally like bits cause it's catchy, and fits in with existing accounting software. Already, small amounts of BTC expressed in mBTC will still be in the decimal places. It's much easier to make the jump now to working with uBTC (bits) instead and using large numbers to express large quantities of currency.

Is there something keeping Circle from doing the same?
@_date: 2014-11-19 15:45:30
I would say no, taking small steps like that would only introduce confusion. Make the jump to the denomination that will eventually be used, and you eliminate all of that confusion and then software doesn't constantly have to readjust the way the currency is displayed.
As bitcoin is an inherently deflationary currency, prices will drop over time. We'll see the price of a coffee go from 12500 bits to much less than that. Easier to work with that way.
Lastly, using uBTC, or bits, will allow the denominations to fit handily into existing finance infrastructure, which universally uses two decimal places.

Agreed. The dollar was doing well on the gold standard, and in 1971, the printing presses started after Nixon severed that tie.
By disassociating the dollar with a commodity, it allowed as much of it to be created out of thin air as the bankers/government liked. I think the one out for the banks this time is to forgive debt, but that's not likely something they're going to do.

I'd like to point out that Ghandi is an example of a libertarian socialist. He believed in personal freedoms, but also in economic regulation to prevent the rich from oppressing the poor, as was seen in Britain at the time.
So often, leftism gets lumped in with socialism and authoritarianism, but they are all unique concepts.
A good site that illustrates the differences is  In this, they have a 2 dimensional political stance, with authoritarianism opposing libertarianism, and left-wing opposing right-wing (layed out kind of like D&amp;D alignment). You can take the quiz and see where you lie in comparison to other world leaders (note the distance between Obama and Romney...)

Good points, and an interesting take on it.
I should point out that correlation does not equal causation. Because war is getting cheaper respective to previous generations, that does not mean it was the introduction of fiat money that did so. I would wager that technological innovation was the key driver of that price change.
In any case, the relative cost of war is moot when it is funded through deficit spending and inflated away. It is demeaning to the brave men and women who put their lives on the line and then the money they were paid for it is consistently devalued.

You're right. People will need credit, but one of my hopes is that eventually mass refusal to continue to participate in the current debt-based economy will encourage and enable people to survive without credit (i.e. buying only stuff they can afford rather than selling the farm to get a shiny new TV since the debt will be inflated away eventually)
I'd love to see an Etherium or sidechain based distributed credit union where people can invest and others can borrow. No fractional reserve, no middlemen, and credit scores are built and kept much in the same way ebay vendor reputations are.

When inevitably things start unravelling, the banks will use the only trick in their book to keep things afloat. They will throw money at the problem.
When this money starts gushing down onto the public from bank balances it becomes very possible that it may cause the spark necessary for hyperinflation to occur.

Thanks for the answer. So is that like buying a house with a hefty fire insurance policy, betting that the house will burn down?
Why would someone else want to buy a negative yield bond from you at a higher price when that will just make them lose even more money than you?

yuuuup. But wouldn't it be nice?

Agreed. Stuffing thousands of dollars in cash into a bag and giving it to some random dude in an alley for "safekeeping" isn't a good practice.
If someone does that, we don't blame the nature of cash for its deficiencies.

I LOLed when I saw this because I came here to make that exact comment.

I am an expert. By March of 16, Bitcoin will be trading for $2000 a share.

Any federally centralized cryptocurrency will need to compete with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has set the "gold standard" if you will for cryptocurrencies.
People will need good reasons to store their wealth in an inflatable, seizable fiat-crypto, rather than in Bitcoin.
Some reasons I can see why this may be:
- Governments will accept tax money in only their cryptofiat.
- It would be insured and regulated by government bodies.
- Traceable and freezable (yada yada terrorists, freedom blah blah)
It will very likely happen, but these cryptofiats will be kept in check by Bitcoin. If they get too out of line, people will always have non-governmental cryptos (ie Bitcoin) to fall back on if governments get too greedy.
