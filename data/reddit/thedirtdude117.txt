So we could technically boost reddit karma &amp; boost money?

Well you only lost $300...
Yeah just don't sell that coin.

My advice
Buy low, sell high

How much for a red one shipped to Georgia USA?

Damn man! I did the same thing but with roughly 56 bitcoins in June &amp; it sucked! I just tried every password I have used in 10 years &amp; no success
But that should be about 140k correct? I'd cash out half of it &amp; keep the other half in.
I'd also WRITE DOWN THE PASSWORD

I've also seen those QR codes on some vehicle's rear windshield. One guy had 6 BTC donated in a day, but he also drove a Camaro.

He was waiting until Black Sunday so he could get that 20% off deal for donating.

Make sure to put a QR code sticker on your car.

Can you also use a debit/credit card instead of a bank account? I just don't feel safe giving my bank account information.

I doubt his intentions were to panhandle reddit. I myself am in similar shoes except I'm 22 &amp; don't know much about BTC. It's people like you that ruin the internet, if the kid wants to know about something that other people could answer then why the heck not post on reddit.
I'd like to have someone give me a crash course in BTC.

Damn, it would've made things much easier. LocalBitcoin needs more people in my area.
