In case of if I die, my family will get my bitcoins. I think the easiest way is to use a multi-signature wallet and assign it between family members and a lawyer. Anyway, how do you think when it’s time to write the final will taking into account that an accident might happen with you? Straight away after you have purchased cryptocurrency? Because now I’m confused. I don’t know when I should do it before it’s too late. I think it’s a crucial question on how to assure the secure handover of your crypto heritage to anyone you want without compromising a private key. There are too many bitcoins were lost forever due to the accidental death of the bitcoin owners. If we wouldn’t care about it, the greater part of bitcoin supply can be lost without a possibility to restore them. On the other hand, the reduced limited supply would mean higher demand and price.

Nobody will refuse to take a bar of gold as well as private keys from the wallet with several thousands of bitcoins in it or Lamborghini or a cottage on the shore of the ocean, etc. Don’t make an illusion that you would deny any of these options. Everything has a value, which is established by people themselves. Until people believe that bitcoin has value, it will have value, the same refers to gold. Both have their advantages, but bitcoin and gold are from different categories that can’t be compared, though they have some features in common.
