That's more tricky than it sounds. A typical transaction has 1 input and 2 outputs (payee and change) . If you add or increase the fee, you have to decrease the amount for at least one output. We cannot easily rule this out.
Any output maybe the payee. Thus, even if all previous TX outputs are still present in the TX, the amount sent to payee can be trivial.

This. It can happen in a simpler setup, too.
1. Create a wallet, share between two devices.
2. Spend on device A, standard fees, e.g. pay for a pizza
3. Spend on device B, standard fees, e.g. donate to Sean's Outpost
4. Have subpar internet/blockchain connection on one of the devices: Accidental double spend.

I'm not calling for the math. Others will fill this in.
So far, I'm not convinced this can be done without a hard-fork, i.e. without a majority of nodes and minors accepting a substantial change to the Bitcoin protocol. This deserves some discussion.
For this reason, it's also not exactly symmetrical. In your newly created sidechain, you can do whatever you want, so a one-way peg from bitcoin to sidechain is certainly doable. The other direction is much more difficult because you have to modify Bitcoin.

The wallet you chose is unofficially called "Schildbach wallet" and it is highly respected in this community.
The 2nd link, this paysafecard to bitcoin service, is not so well-known. I can't vouch for their reliability.
Judging from the screenshot on the play store, you are correct that the address displayed on the top of Schildbach's wallet is one of your addresses. If you sent bitcoin there, they are not lost. 
(All modern Bitcoin wallets use multiple addresses for your privacy.)
An address starts with the character "1". You don't risk your coins by copy pasting an address. Don't ever share any code that does not start with "1", it could be a private key or mnemonic (=password).
As a first step, please check the balance of the address that your friend sent the bitcoin to at biteasy.com or blockchain.info. If it doesn't show up, they never sent any coins to your address.
If it does, you are probably all good. You just have to figure out how to use your wallet. It could take sometime before the wallet sees the transaction. IIRC, Schildbach Wallet requires more internet bandwidth than other smartphone wallets.
Hope this helps.

Mind to ELI5? Or translate to either proper math or English (not business textbook math that requires a cheat sheat of definitions to parse)
If I take this definition literally, it doesn't seem sensible:
* Compute the daily Gain/Loss, i.e. compare the (average?) price on date D compared to (D - 1 day). Express the difference as a percentage of the price on (D -1 day).
* Compute the std deviation therof over the past 30 days.
Now an example: Say the USD price of bitcoins doubles every day for 30 days in a row. Then daily gainly is 100%. The average over 30 days is 100%. **The std dev is 0.**
Is this what they mean?

All the replies explain how people in some countries handle extreme volatility and inflation by avoiding using the affected currency as a store of value to the degree possible, hence gold, cars, real estate, ...
I think what OP wants to know is how people use a volatile currency (local fiat or bitcoin) as a means of payment and short-term store of value.
I've been to Bali long before bitcoin was a thing. What I noticed was that most things of daily use were traded and priced in rupiah, but some things, in particular touristy and imported stuff was priced in USD. You could still pay in IDR, so the rupiah was certainly trusted and useful, but the price would fluctuate with the USD on a daily basis.
I guess, they treat Bitcoin just like any other volatile currency. "Sure, I'll accept bitcoin. Just let me quickly check the rate." Making a small loss due to not converting the bitcoins fast enough, is something that an entrepreneur in the tourism industry in Bali was used to long before bitcoin. (It's probably harder to grasp for us Westerner who have very stable prices domestically and hardly trade internationally in daily life.)

Heres the point: If the coins are already lost, i.e. Satoshi destroyed the private keys, they cannot burn them again. No one will ever know that the coins are irretrievable. You cannot prove that no such key exists under some matress...
If Satoshi kept the keys, he/she/they have a plan. And, personally, I don't think burning them *right now* would help. It would only distract us, media will try to find Satoshi.

Thanks for taking your time to reat the proposal. My feeling is that the issue you raise exist with pure BIP0039 already and I'm trying to fix them. After reading your critism, it would be smart to require wallet software to display a short identifier together with the mnemonic phrase, e.g.: BIP0039+BIP0032: chicken butter horse append ....


Yes, that would be the case. However, if the wallet follows BIP0039 closely, it should display a warning that the checksum is wrong. (And it is cheap to check whether a different protocol yields the correct checksum).
Also, if popular clients make the Japanes-to-English transscription obvious to the user (say display the English phrase in small print next to the Japanese words), it would be possible for the user to figure out what went wrong, e.g. by posting on a forum or asking an expert.


Well, first, this is strongly discouraged to have 2 lists for the same language by the proposed standard. (So one could argue that introducing a new list after one has been established is already non-compliant)
Second, the standard suggests to use literal translations or otherwise similar words. To stick with you example (an EnglishNew word list without suicide or translations thereof):
* "suicide" would be translated/substituted in a way that cannot be confused with any other word on any of the lists, e.g. something like "bad ending". The index of any other word would not change. 
* A phrase that contains neither suicide nor "bad ending" would work with either wordlist.
* A phrase that contains "bad ending" is obvious EnglishNew and can be treated correctly. (Substitute "bad ending" with "sucide" to recover BIP0039 phrase.)
* A phrase that contains "suicide" works automatically as a BIP0039 phrase.

No. Take a look a Jane Cusomer.
1. She bought some bitcoin in 2013, with no place to spend them.
2. Now she spends them at some merchant, who immediatelly sells them for fiat to cover bills.
Sure, 1 drives the price up, 2 drives it down, but that's not the question.
Jane bought the coins in 2013 for a reason. If this reason still applies, she would buy a again, at least as much as her spending. If she does not buy BTC in 2014, she is cashing out. The question is why are all the Janes cashing out? Or in your words, why is their no consumer adaption (although (some) consumers have bitcoins and means to acquire bitcoin)?

Reply to who appears to have deleted their account (or reddit broke):
You are ~~technically~~ correct.
It's good to educate people on security risks, but don't call the attempt nonsense. OP and others are trying to seperate security concern. They are just struggling to find a practical solution.
Ideally you would have a trusted host (maybe Linux) and two guests, one for everyday web surfing (maybe Windows) and one where higher security is wanted (maybe Linux).
I don't think that's practical for consumers today due to way the user experience is bound to an OS that runs on the bare metal. (For me, Windows inside VirtualBox is good enough, but I'm not a Windows guy.)
I don't know a lot about Windows security, but it seems that compromising the whole machine has become somewhat rare (compared to the DOS till Windows 9x era). So, using Windows as the host may be acceptable. (Now, if you use Windows as the host and like the Windows GUI you will probably also use Windows for web and email.)
Now, what you relly want is that your daily Windows user account (which can be compromised) cannot read your private key. This is doable with a combination of different user accounts, encryption, and virtual machines or bootable media.
 You can create and backup a modern bitcoin wallet by writing down 12 words on a piece of paper (called a paper wallet or cold storage). This can be done by booting from a Linux USB stick. So you can easily side step Windows malware.

Does this mean, there two sets of rules:
* Which Tx can be included in a block?
* Which Tx can be forwarded to other peers?
Why would I include a Tx in block if I deem it's not even worhty of forwarding. OTH, why would I want to forward a Tx that if miners will not inlude it in a block.


So what exactly is forked? The mempool? The blockchain never forks, all nodes will consider all blocks valid.

Not at all.
 


Probably. It makes the altcoin more interesting. However, the question is what can an existing altcoin really do. I can see two options:
* Acquire a number of BTC, they (altcoin stakeholders) are willing to give up for the peg to work. Move them to the altcoin blockchain with the protocol described in the whitepaper. Change the altcoin protocol such that N altcoin assets are now worth M bitcoin where the ratio M/N is given the ratio of the bitcoins provided and the total number of altcoin assets. 
* Extend the altcoin protocol such that it can handle altcoin assets and bitcoin assets, where the latter can be created as shown in the whitepaper
 


There are always to seprate networks for bitcoin and sidechain. Different hashing functions won't be an issue.

There a 2^256 possible key pairs (2^256 private keys mapped to 2^256 public keys). Actually, slightly less for technical reasons, but irrelevant.
We could use all 2^256 public keys instead of addresses, but the Bitcoin protocol allows for an additional (not necessary) step that maps public keys to addresses and this mapping (RIPE-160) only allows for 2^160 addresses.
Others have mentioned possible advantages of the extra step:
* addresses are shorter, thus more practical
* protects against a certain classes of attacks against the underlying crypto.
Any private keys unlocks exactly one address. There are 2^96 possible keys for each address. However, the latter has no practical consequences, since it is impossible to find those keys.
Now, you could ask why we started with 2^256 key pairs in the first place, and, honestly, I have no good answer. In fact, a widely used scheme to generate keys only uses only 2^128 possible keys and is still reasonably secure.
The inventor(s) of Bitcoin went for the gold standard and that's 256 bits (or much more depending on the algorithm). 160 bits is not a common key length and thus not proven/tested to work reliably. 128 bits is orders of magnitude less secure.

Typically, it will take two steps to compromise a system: Compromise the user. Then, escalate.
The first step can occur through various attack vectors: Bugs in user software or user mistakes. Due to the variety of software we use (and bugs there within), this happens regularly.
The second step is possible harder since it requires a bug in the OS or a particularly gullible user. It's not impossible, but less likely.
The first step is sufficiently attractive to malware since it allows stealing password (including bitcoin keys), sending spam, and messing with user ("Pay us or else..."). The second step is slightly more attractive because once the malware has crossed this border, it is harder to remove, can access more resources.
It's pure speculation on my part to assume, malware authors will skip step 2 or try and fail.
If you can be bothered to setup three accounts on your computer, administrator (not used daily), regular user (daily use), and secure user (for bitcoin), your bitcoin are out of bounds from simple malware.

There's always a risk. Your computer could be compromised, someone you trick you into downloading an upgrade for SpiderOak that actually downgrades security. Your SpiderOak passphrase (or their algorithm) could be weak.
The weakest link is probably yourself. Sure, you can keep your private keys or seed on an encrpyted online storage if you treat it like the combination for the safe installed a public location that has the equivalent amount in cash/gold.
If your laptop/phone regularly connects to SpiderOak, I wold be worried.

So, basically, ..
* You provide the hardware (for free plus shipping)
* University ("operator") provides the space (for free) and agrees to operates the device.
* Operator is responsible for acquiring a sufficient amount of bitcoin.
* You set the the price from a price feed (e.g. largest local exchange)
* You charge a commission on every sale.
* The operator can charge an additional commission on top.
* Operator receives the cash deposited into the machine and takes the risk, both counterfeit bills or theft as well as the volatility risk.
Is this correct?

No. Buying will drive the price up.
Coinbase can only settle internally if they have matching bids and asks (buyers and sellers). If this is the case, their price is probably a fair market price.
One could argue that trades via coinbase/circle/bitpay that are settled internally don't affect the price seen on exchanges likes bitstamp directly, but this would just obfuscate the facts. If I was to purchase a significant amount of bitcoin, this would drive the market price eventually. Worst case is a delay depending on the solvency of the counterparty.
It is however correct that the volume reported by exchanges cannot be trusted as an indicator (even if they are honest). No one knows realistically how much trading happens outside of known exchanges. (I assume, it's negligible, but how would I know?)

The split allows any coin that existed pre-split to be spent exactly twice -- once per chain.
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:02:30
I'll assume you have those 0.21 BTC in a wallet under your control (paper wallet, Mycelium app, or any other), not on an exchange. Unless you spent them, those are yours on any chain that builds upon the current chain.
Even without a (protocol) fork, there can at any time be more than one chain. This happens if two miners find a block approximately at the same time. And this means nothing for your coins; in fact, you won't even know.  Quickly one chain will win the race and your coins are still valid on this single chain.
In January, it may happen that we have two chains using different protocol versions. Bitcoin-core will only consider "core-blocks" as valid, while Bitcoin-XT will accept core and XT blocks. Thus, as soon as a chain contains a single XT blocks, this is rejected by core. However, by construction, XT will have more mining power than core. (If not, the fork is postponed) Therefore, there will be two chains, a core chain and a XT chain.
As above, your coins exist on both of them, and, in principle, you can spent them both (and possibly to different recipients). And, it is possible that coinbase accepts your 0.21 core coins with a rate of 10 USD, while Kraken exchanges your 0.21 XT coins for 40 USD.
However, it is much more likely that one of the chains dies within 24 hours and becomes worthless, useless, or a hobby project. Unless you send and receive coins during this period, your coins are absolutely safe no matter what.

Understand the when it comes to buying bitcoin, the bitcoin community is divided as a result of the way the banking business is organized. In Europe, buying BTC from home via bank transfer is the norm. SEPA wire transfer is free and ubiquitous.
In the US, credit cards are all the rage, but no one has figured out, how to (ab)use the credit card system to buy BTC against the will of the credit card companies.
@_date: 2012-08-22 14:10:37
Well, the risk of chargebacks is a problem (or better, risk) for anyone accepting credit cards. Some business suffer more than others. Most don't suffer enough to reject credit cards.
The problem is that credit cards (while fundamentally flawed) are the only means of (electronic) payment available to a large group of customers. This a fact and the reason why the idea of paying for BTC with cards is so damn appealing.

Bitcoin uses pseudonyms and public records. If you don't want to your identity connected with your pseudonym, you have to obscure the connection.
The standard trick is to go through different ewallets. Those services receive and sent a large number of bitcoins every day. And, typically they mix bitcoins from different users. The ewallet operator knows, they received 100BTC through one or more of your personal deposit addresses and forwarded 100BTC to one or more addresses of your choice. However, a third party cannot connect the incoming and outgoing transactions. 
TLDR:, a ewallet is a large pool of bitcoin, that effectively renders a transaction untracable.

I'm buying this point. My question was meant slightly differently.
No one would mine if they didn't (expect to) get something out of it. However, there could still be a large enough community of people who joined bitcoin mining because it was fun. The profits they make may be tiny, not worth the effort (i.e. with honest bookkeeping they are operating at a loss; they'd be better off working at McD). If this is the case 'professional miners' (who are in the for money, not for the fun) wouldn't bother.
Bitcoin works either way (professional or hobbyist mining). It doesn't matter in the big picture. I was just curious whether all the miners are bitcoin millionaires or people with a strange hobby.

There are two things to be afraid about, me thinks:
1. The appearance (e.g. hologram) could degrade and others will no longer accept the coin. That means the value of the Casascius coin drops from 1.85BTC (new Casascius coin in mint condition) to 1BTC, the value of the private key stored inside.
2. The private key could be destroyed over time (e.g. by running over the coin with your car or, well, loosing it). Then the value drops to 0.
Both risks are real and I cannot judge the durability of those coins. However treating them like valuables should do the job. Whether you consider the coins a collectors item or money, just keep where you keep other valuables.

The only way to buy a ticket is to send money to a bitcoin address. Any BTC send to this address has the same odds of winning. Anyone with enough BTC can buy 99.9% of all tickets. However, there is a risk of loosing.
The lottery operator has the tactical advantage that (s)he can **once** run away with the money. If the odds of loosing are small, that can go well for some time (before operator looses and flees). So, how much would the operator make?
For any ticket invested by others, operator buys 999. Assume others always buy tickets worth exactly 1BTC.
Operator: -999 BTC
Jackpot: 1000 BTC
Operator wins: 1000 BTC - 999BTC = +1BTC profit
Operator: -999 BTC
Jackpot: 1000 BTC
Operator looses and flees with 1000 BTC: +1BTC profit
Chance of Loosing: 0.1%
Expect to loose after 500 rounds. That makes an (expected) 500 BTC profit from a 1000BTC investment, practically risk-free. OK, I get your point.
However, this is based on the assumption that the operator can invest 999 times more than all other participants together.

just make it crystal clear how the payment scheme you are suggesting works. We know the limitations of the Bitcoin protocol. Thus, a system that doesn't have those limitations is automatically "not Bitcoin". That doesn't mean it's bad.
For example, you could call the QR codes "MtGox Bitcoin vouchers" and provide a simple interface (human and API for other apps, exchanges, etc.) to buy and redeem those vouchers. Don't call them Bitcoins.
Is it absolutely necessary to have a MtGox account **and** the MtGox app?
Can you encourage other exhanges/ewallets to issue compatible vouchers? Maybe a network of bitcoin voucher issuers which will mutually accept their vouchers, such that someone who doesn't trust MtGox with his coins can still shop with a merchant that has a MtGox POS device

I cannot answer your question, but I always assumed the SWIFT CODE (~ BIC ) is the customer number (or routing key) for the bank. And all banks are SWIFT customers (with smaller banks maybe relying on some intermediate or chain).
So, I'd guess, yes, the SWIFT codes are keys in a (simple) routing table. All messages for a given SWIFT code are sent to a known endpoint for this bank. (Really just guessing) From there, the banks work it out (Maybe they have a routing table and a default route to some large international bank if they can't settle directly).

Bitcoins are kept in wallets. In what kind of wallet are do you have them?
If they are on coinbase, I suggest, you get a wallet for your phone (e.g. mycelium) and play with it. (Assuming it's a tiny amount.) Coinbase should have a "Send Bitcoin" (or "Withdraw") feauture. (I have never used Coinbase)
If you have created a paper wallet, good choice. Again, if you want spend or play with your bitcoin, get a wallet for your phone and scan the private key. (The phone wallet will then either import the private key, i.e. store a copy, or sweep it, i.e. transfer the funds to another address managed by the wallet.)
If you don't want or need a wallet on your phone, try changetip. It's fun.

Would the self-pronounced security experts please shut up.
SpendBT/QuickBT are making a weak impression. They look unprofessional. (Which is a shame because their products fill a need with the btc community.) It's fine to point this out.
But don't shit all over the thread with bold printed accusations.
Credit card numbers (and social security numbers) are concept that doesn't fit with any computer security concept. We learned to treat them as secrets, nevertheless this secret is leaked to third parties all the time. It's wise to be careful with sharing your CC number (can safe you a lot of hassle (and money)), but protecting your credit card number is always futile (unless you never use it).
Credit card security is damage control. The system was never secure (in the computer security sense). Judging from Wikipedia, [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]( establishes common sense baseline security practices. (I assume, there's more to it when you go into the details, but it doesn't read like the silver bullet and recent breaches prove this.)
The QuickBT person stated that they store the CC number in plain text for 30 days. Anyone with a slim background in computer security, reads this as plain text equivalent. I can write it to some storage backend and I can read it back.
Sounds bad? Make it better. So you want to encrypt it (at the application layer)? Symmetrically? Same problem, plain text equivalent: I can write, I can read. Just wasted a few CPU cycles. Encrypt at a lower level? Same problem: I can write, I can read.
Split the key from the data? Encrypt asymmetrically? Probably equivalent to storing the plain text on a second server. Do you think you can do a security audit from a reddit post. I cannot.
That's probably why PCIDSS doesn't mandate encryption of cardholder data but uses the weaker term protection. If you read the 12 core requirements you'll find:
3. Protect stored cardholder data
4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data **across open, public networks**
The answer by the SendBT person doesn't violate this.

This makes it clear that an ETF is not the right investment vehicle.


Interesting, but not exactly what we are looking for, I guess. Even, if the company does practically nothing but hold N BTC and issue N shares, why would the investor know that the stock price tracks N/N=1 BTC?
Also, how many bitcoins are sensible initial investment? On the one hand, you don't want the company to laughably small (by market cap). On the other hand, if you buy a significant percentage of all bitcoin available for sale, you'd pay a premium.

Basically, ETF/ETCs (also bonds and even stock to some extend) are contracts (depending on the jurisdiction). You would be buying a piece of paper that says in legalese that the holder is entitled to receive (the USD value of) 1 BTC from the issuer, some bank. Think of it as a voucher.
Practically, this contract is a hypothetical and its only purpose is to render a piece of paper valuable. You can, then, trade this piece of paper against other pieces of paper with third parties who consider pieces of paper valuable. 
It is possible though not required that the issuer or some third party does or does not actually hold 1BTC. If they don't hold any bitcoins, they are betting on the BTC/USD rate not changing in your favour.
While you, as a regular investor, will probably never exercise your right to exchange your voucher against bitcoin, there may or may not be third parties who do so. Those "market makers" can sell at MtGox, buy the voucher, and sell at an ETC exchange or vice versa.
@_date: 2013-08-13 12:15:58

Exactly. A wallet can hold an unlimited number of keys (and corresponding addresses). You can spend the funds from several addresses in your wallet at once. Indeed, there's a risk that this removes some anonymity. Example:
You have two customers. You generate one address per customer. They each pay for the service you provide. Later, you use the funds from both customers to pay your (only) employee to his personal address. Now both customers can guess:
* how many customers you have,
* who the other customers is,
* how much the other customer pays for the service,
* who your employee is,
* how much your employee makes.
However, there exist counter-measure to restore/increasy your privacy.

2. Long-term (locked away in a bank vault for my grand-children) or short-term (can be spent from my cellphone) or both?
3. Is it advisable to keep any (legal) documents?
4. Protect against theft of the coins or against loosing the coins or both?
5. Protect with a password only known to myself and never write it down? Or is this too hard and will only harm myself in a few years.
6. How likely is it that a paper wallet gets stolen from my apartment? How likely that I'll loose it? Both risks scale with the number of copies.
7. How to make a secure off-site backup (encrypted and reliable)? 
8. How offline is offline enough? My normal user account on my day-to-day laptop is probably not good enough; but a machine that never connects to any network may be inconvenient. How to print from an offline machine? How to backup? Should the USB pendrive self-destruct? What if the printer has non-volatile memory keeping a copy of everything I print? Haven't you heard about the latest conspiracy?

Well, it allows for poor-man's offline transactions/storage.
1. Generate a deterministic wallet (or any wallet, which generates a large enough pool of addresses). Store the seed or the private keys in a save place. Store the public keys (addresses) somewhere.
2. Whenever, you earn/buy Bitcoin, you use one of the pregenerated adresses. Your coins are now safe (on paper or a secure (offline) computer).
3. Whenever, you want to spend/sell Bitcoin, you take one of the private keys and import it into an online wallet (web-based, cellphone or regular (online) computer). This particular key is now less secure (due to potential security breaches), but you are willing to take a risk for convenience. However, you absolutely do not want to risk all your coins.
While you never willingly disclose any private keys, in step 3, this could happen (e.g. you loose your insecure cellphone). Now, it's important that all other keys remain private (while the coins on the phone are lost).
@_date: 2013-02-15 22:15:38

@_date: 2013-02-15 20:27:28
Exactly. The key point is that any wallet software can export or backup your secret keys (typically called your wallet file). You can import this data, in principle, into any other wallet on any computer.
Bitcoin secret keys have 256 bit entropy. Hence, you can easily write them down or even remember them in the form of a passphrase.
@_date: 2013-02-16 14:26:02
Yes, this is correct. However, the buyer can take measures to avoid being tracked. If the buyer uses an online wallet, law enforcement can only guess which website was used (from puiblic data).
Note: Using an uncommon amount is a nice trick, but this would also work with the price being 1.00BTC. The seller always sees which transaction/address was used to pay them.
There exist so-called mixing services that effectively render transactions anonymous by sending them indirectly. They can be used in a way that the specific amount 0.91918181 BTC never shows up. (Buyer pays in 1.00BTC and receives .09BTC change to another anonymous address.)

* Always use newly generated addresses.
* Consolidate the funds in your wallet in way that's indistinguishable from transactions with third parties:

Writing @ as "at" is surprisingly effective. 
If you have a long list of valid email address, substituting the @ character with something else will not stop marketesr to use that list. It's a simple sed job to get the email addresses.
However, for addresses scattered around the web, anything that does not look like an email address is ignored. Sure, spambots could have a reg ex matching /at.*dot/, but most won't. It's number game.
source: None, except that email addresses that I use, are presented like that on well-known (academic) public webservers.

It's a DPA (press agency) text. This will probably appear in other online media outlets, too.

What I was talking about was protection against someone stealing your coins (i.e. spending your funds against your will.) This could be done by replacing the legit blockchain.info site with a rogue server.
Backup is a different story. Blockchain has numerous backup options. If the server disappears, you can restore your coins somewhere else from your backup.

Wait? How is SatoshiDice unsafe for the operators? I always thought they 'forward' the coins received from all users to the winner. If one user double spends and the other transactions is confirmed, no wins anything. Does SD ever use any of their own coins?

After spending $5.6 billion -- on the day of the (planned) opening ceremony--, they realized the the airport they've been building for years practically doesn't exist. The official reason for delaying the opening were fire-safety concerns, however years later the construction site is still very much under construction and lacks just about everything a proper airport needs. ETA: unknown!

To clarify:
You have to backup ALL private keys. Whenever new private keys are generated (non-deterministically), you have to backup them, too.
Whether and when new keys are generated depends on the client. The Satoshi client (Bitcoin-QT) creates 100 private keys when you first start it. They are all in wallet.dat (but not displayed in the GUI). 100 Addresses will last a while, but not forever.
It's possible to make a client that uses only one secret key (either by reusing addresses or by creating private keys deterministically).

Transaction are not anonymous. Bitcoin addresses are pseudonyms. The transaction is public, but the identity of the users are not known.
Additionally, one can guess the location of users based on their IP address.

But, how is this going to help? The link is practically instawallet + faucet for testnet. This is nice, but people want to find out about coinbase and blockchain.info and android apps that they can use to pay for beers.

For about a year I was thinking about how to setup a secure wallet (digital backup vs paper backup; encrypt vs make sure I can recover the keys in N years). Now, with everything in place, BTC/EUR rises faster than I'm willing to change my bidding price.

Casual mining ("while having fun") may be dead, bitcoin are not.
"A good rig" may not be good enough to compete with the latest ASIC or WTF mining hardware in terms of hashing rate over electricity costs. You'll never get any profits if you don't have a REALLY GOOD business plan.

Dear sup3, it is not my intention to badmouth Electrum. I'm only worried that Electrum's implementation of deterministic wallets does not match my personal requirements.
My concern is that there exists a too simple relationship between private keys and the root key. This concern is based on studying the source of a very early version of Electrum and it is reflected by a warning found in the current version:






I have asked a related question on SE: 
I believe the developers are aware of this. Therefore, my question is, whether they have any plans to change their implementation. (Otherwise, they will have to keep the warning and everyone will be fine.)
@_date: 2013-10-19 23:04:59
Maybe it's indirect. Mt Gox is still a widely used reference. Localbtc and EUR based exchanges are often closer to Gox than to Bitstamp. This makes the Gox price a realistic upper bound people are willing to pay for bitcoin
@_date: 2013-02-16 17:12:21


Good point, but how would you do this practically? One option would be to generate the private key(s) with blockchain and then enter the private keys into bitaddress, compare the address...
@_date: 2013-02-05 20:08:27


And that's pretty much correct. (The intended interpretation is also correct. Thus, the video has no clear message.)

Maybe you can work with online exchanges catering for Singapore or Thailand (or any other country in the world with a compatible banking system). You have to figure out, whether they accept wire transfers from MY and how much it will cost you in fees.
Also, if you have used localbitcoins or OTC once, you know at least one person, who can explain to you how they acquire their BTC.

The blockchain is not an issue your mum and dad or anyone doing business with bitcoins is ever going to worry about. If the blockchain is shared between a significant number of nodes, say all miners and a number of major websites such as blockchain.info, we are all set.
Mass adoptions works via online wallets (websites, no download required), thin clients (downloads just enough data to be secure, less than 1 MB), or pruning clients (downloads blockchain but discards most of the data, keeps only relevant transactions)

Well, if you trust the merchant (enough), they could print a new paper wallet with the change. Or the buyer could carry an additional paper wallet/bitcoin address QR code for the change.

.. unless they have received coins from someone who has received them from a someone else who double spends. 
It seems unlikely, but if I buy bitcoin from a random exchange or person, I have no idea where those coins come from.

Yes. Any transaction is public. However it's only between pseudonymous addresses. Here is a typical transaction: 
Someone (17ZXu63D5Pi4JnSf2YjofC2BHYPNcGKgDa) used to have 4BTC. They send 0.0695 BTC
 to 1AaHmYKVPdGZQ32mZ5XVSfKxet9siqSJFw and 3.93 BTC to 16PQoMFELKyj4PyrDXdujohzYWygdELhpV. One possible interpretation is that 17ZXu63D5Pi4JnSf2YjofC2BHYPNcGKgDa and 16PQoMFELKyj4PyrDXdujohzYWygdELhpV belong to the same person (Bob) and Bob sent part of his funds to 1AaHmYKVPdGZQ32mZ5XVSfKxet9siqSJFw (Alice), but only they know for sure.

What? Why does a bug in 0.7 require that everyone stops using the bug-free version 0.8? Isn't this exactly against the philosophy of Bitcoin? The 0.8 blockchain is valid. Why discard it?
@_date: 2013-03-02 21:53:10
Any sensible wallet is created such that **you** can **always** recover **your** coins, no matter what. However, you should find out how this works before trusting the client.
Thin clients have all their wallets locally, i.e. on your computer. Just make sure, you understand how to make backups. (They rely on the server for everything else.) You probably want a text file with all your private keys in wallet-input-format and all wallets can export such a file.
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:47:12
Hybrid wallets (such as blockchain.info/wallet) are secure if both the server and the client (your computer and browser) are safe from malware/hackers. In principle, hybrid wallets are designed such that you do not have to trust the server, which is good, but this is only effective if you verify that the server was not compromised, which requires a special browser plugin.
