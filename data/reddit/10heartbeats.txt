I've been to China and work with Chinese people. They are just as business minded and free loving as the US. They have a strict government with rough money controls and laws, but they are awesome to be around and work with as people. My guess will be that in 25 years their culture will be just like any western country.

I can agree with that. I just like the low unemployment for those willing to try and the better outlook for citizens. I think the future seems a bit more positive for America now and will stay that way if the alt-left terrorists will just get jobs and stop trying to destroy the country. I am however going on feeling and personal experience which is just as bad as the lefties so I need to be careful on my outlook and study the data.

My core beliefs are centrist. I'm not a fan of socialism and people unwilling to work for a living so I guess that could be called identity politics. I just want America to be strong and successful, not lost in childish PC culture and degeneracy. Still though, I feel goofy talking about this on the bitcoin sub so best of luck and may the future be bright.

I agree with that. Traditional Liberalism, brittish, has nothing to do with the Democratic party or the sickos of antifa. Anyone trying to take away freedom of speech can't represent any party other than perhaps communism. I believe in personal freedoms and responsibilities. I don't like any government taking my money by force to pay for their agenda so I personally support whoever wants the smallest one with the least regulation and controls. Thanks for the info! I have reading to do and hopefully butcoin with help to put power back in our own hands and out of the globalists and banks.

So over half of America is ignorant because they didn't vote for a criminal robot with no ideas beyond taxing everyone more? I'm confused. You act as though our economy isn't doing great and that we are already in way better shape than under any socialist idealist. Capitalism works and it works well. I don't think anyone with a job or is over 30 believes that Marxism is anything more than a sick look at human degeneracy.

It's the left who loves indentity politics and to separate us by making everyone think that they are victims. If the media tells you that  all right leaning people are racist, with zero evidence, and you believe them then of course you'll think that we are divided. Not too sure how lefties freaking out at democracy is the fault of logical centrists like myself.

Just about to fly in for business from the US. I have no rupees so I'm a little worried myself as I don't know if the airport atm will work or if I can find an exchanger. I can't even imagine the hardships by all of the people relying on their savings. :( I hope it makes India stronger in the long run.
