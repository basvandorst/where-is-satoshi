well, what differentiates Bitcoin from ultrabits is that it is the original blockchain of humanity... and that will never change no matter how many people decide to switch to ultrabits in the future. 
arguing about whether or not a Bitcoin is real is about as fruitless as arguing whether or not the compact disc is "intrinsically" more valuable than FLAC files on a hard drive.

those tools were not intended to be a store of value... there are better options. 
you can't send a hammer thru the tubes. it doesn't have that kind of utility. if you were a hammer manufacturer though it would be a store of value to some degree, no?

if no one held Bitcoin you wouldn't be able to use it at all. the same goes for selling. 
some people day trade it. some buy and old. some use it to buy things online. all are valid uses and thankfully, no one can decide for anyone else how or why they should use it.

i know the answer you expect is USD but the comparison between a bitcoin and a hammer is silly, you might as well compare facebook and netflix.  the use cases for BTC are far more diversified if you look big picture instead of the fact that you can't use to buy a cheeseburger at mcdonalds right now.
