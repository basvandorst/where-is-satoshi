Hmmm, we do use WooCommerce as our platform, but I think I'll let Coinbase take their 1% until we're more comfortable with having to manage our own wallet. This is all new to us so we have to take baby steps! 
Thanks for the great info, by the way! With the Coinbase - WooCommerce plugin it made it really easy to set up. 
I think it's working, but I'm not sure, you can check us out at chai-me.com if you're interested! :)

Thanks for the tip, but we decided to try Coinbase to start out. I think it's working, but I'm not sure, as we haven't had any BTC purchases yet. You can check us out at chai-me.com if you're interested.

Well I was uncertain if Coinbase was the right choice since everyone seemed to be making fun of them using floats, but it seems like everyone recommended it anyway, so we'll try it out! Our main product is only $6 USD so it doesn't seem like too much of a risk for a trial run.
Oh and I think we're ready to go, it's got BTC showing up as a payment option in the cart. Now I guess we just need to see if it works. 
We're at chai-me.com if you want to be the first! ;)

Well, our products go for $6-$30, and we'd probably "cash out" the account pretty regularly since we are selling physical goods, so we have to go back to fiat to repurchase our inventory. 
I think it's working, but I'm not sure, you can check us out at chai-me.com if you're interested! :)

Thanks for the tip! We decided to use Coinbase because it was super easy to set up with our ecommerce platform, and the less we have to do manually the easier it is to manage. 
I think it's working, but I'm not sure, you can check us out at chai-me.com if you're interested! :)

Thank you, we've set up an account with Coinbase, I think it's working, it shows BTC as an option during checkout on our storefront at chai-me.com, please let me know if it works!

Thanks, when we were on Etsy we had 100% 5-star reviews so I'm pretty confident you'll like it! :)

I was going to make the code "BitChai" only to realize it looked like it said "bitch ai", and nobody really wants SHODAN hanging around.
