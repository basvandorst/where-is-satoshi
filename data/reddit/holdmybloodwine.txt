Wait. You’re saying a country that literally had to wash their currency because all the black money is going to crackdown on legitimate financial transactions? Of course! That will work! /s

‘Now that I just admitted I don’t have a position because I know nothing about cryptos- listen to my very sure opinion about what will happen to cryptos’
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:18:18
Just as good and accurate as 90% of TAs applied to cryptos.

Typically government and economic turmoil drives money into metals and alternative assets. Although it’s impossible to say for sure- it very well could fuel crypto prices.

^ This is a HUGE part of it. To be fair my baptism to containers was based on AWS and EC2/ELB, but Docker really has polished the art and I've been getting into it lately. Besides these benefits - just having such a portable, contained environment - makes it so easy to test, debug, and develop. It also provides a great way to run multiple isolated deployment environments. But the ability to maintain dependency control and builds is a huge majority of its functionality.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:49:38
My bad- not exactly but they are what back containers on AWS- through Elastic Container Service.  EC2 is the primary virtual machine where ECS is the logical grouping

Do NOT do this. Not only is shorting normally difficult- it’s many times harder and unpredictable with bitcoin. There are investors with huge pockets literally waiting for people to try that, in order to take your bitcoin at a discount. You will be much better off being patient and holding at 0.2 BTC.

For major recognized charities. Regardless of your opinions of them, an organization that’s goal is to exclude somebody from something based solely on their race, is literally racist.

If I had a ton of money, and no bitcoin- I feel like the smart thing to do would be: bet on a rise in futures, the do something that could in fact drive the price with a lack of bitcoin, buy a bunch of it.

As mentioned. Exact date for all trading/buying/selling, vs. before January 1st for access, is completely different.  Two people are hunting for a prize. One person gets a map of the region, The other gets a set of coordinates. Is that a fair ‘free market’ advantage?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:03:59
No, this gets asked here all the time. Bank transfers, after both Coinbase and your bank agree - are subject to transfer times like any bank wire. This is common among services that use direct bank payment for large purchases. Can also be affected by your specific bank protocol, your location, holidays, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:11:38
This is a neat! - I think the compartmentalization of software into containers for purposes like this is still highly underrated and catching up.

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:57:52
Please stop these posts. If you followed the rule of not buying more than you could lose - there’s nothing to worry about to begin with. But regardless- this is a natural movement in bitcoin. It’s volatile. Even a simple amount of research would have made this very clear.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:20:23

Dude stop. There are so many people with reasons to receive bitcoin and own far less. And many who don’t own any. Stop it - this is not the place for this. If you took 5 seconds to read the post rules you’d know that.

Hi I just spent a million dollar inheritance on bitcoin because I heard it was a magic money machine on Twitter and I have some questions:
1. It’s been three days, and the price has gone down- why am I not a gajillionaire yet?
2. What is a bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:29:06
That would likely be a far riskier move. Volatility is only going to increase with futures. You should not be investing in crypto currency if this kind of movement scares you. This sort of correction is par for the course on a normal day for bitcoin, let alone the run up to a major financial event where large drops and gains will be likely. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:00:32

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:00:41
You see- the key is to recklessly dump all your resources into a single investment, without any regard for logic. If things go south- just start calling it a scam, and blaming everybody in sight. 
The MOST important part - and I can’t stress this enough, is when a price even goes slightly down, PANIC. Start telling everybody how badly you’re sweating. And how you’re sick to your stomach. Sell it all off as fast as possible for no reason other than fear and that thing an internet guy with no credentials said. This ensures that pesky inheritance will no longer be in your hands- and is now somebody else’s problem.
Oh, also lasers. A lot of them.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:24:06
Oh I’m sorry man, my original post was just me joking along- commenting on the disturbing influx of people making uninformed, serious financial decisions without any research. I do not have nor have I ever received an inheritance. 
That being said- as somebody who comes from the school of “don’t fuck around with serious stuff you know nothing about and that could have tax implications” I would absolutely use a combination of research and consulting with a financial professional to allocate those resources in a smart way. Bitcoin and crypto currency can certainly be a part of that- just hedge your decisions with research, logic, and smart choices. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:31:32
Don’t worry! I typically make all my sound financial decisions without bothering to do research or even a single google search. But according to my 8 year old brothers friend who illegally bought 10$ of bitcoin with his parents credit card- this is all so obvious and easy to predict. We should each have 100 electric moon-lambos with Vegeta graphics on the hood by morning ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:56:34
Right. But it’s an Instagram with 666 posts. Two of them say ‘bitcoin’ mashed into random logos- (including the ComicCon symbol?) and the rest are totally irrelevant. Though I too have concerns about censorship, that doesn’t seem like the kind of content that contributes to discussion here in any way, let alone something where you lash out, name call, and start accusing people of being ‘power hungry’. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:29:48
Not allowing a minor to conduct serious legal financial transactions, and not allowing somebody to use somebody else’s bank account- seems like a pretty responsible policy actually.  
Ignoring the legal issues of you being a minor- how do they know you didn’t steal the account information?

This article is hilarious:
“It is fair to conclude that with a market capitalisation bigger than some household-name corporations, we are witnessing a digital bubble…robots may be coming to take our jobs…Bitcoin might take people’s wealth first.” 
TLDR; Some guy thinks bitcoin is the first step in the robot uprising. Also everything including stocks is a bubble.

Dude. This. 
The golden fucking rule of investing. Even if it IS for you. Breaking this rule means any position you take will be fragile to EVERYTHING. Be smart people. If you decided to hodl, or decide this isn’t for you- follow this rule and you will always come out in the best way for any scenario. 
I am by no means a financial expert, but I do try to take in a wide range of analysis, charts, opinions of all kinds: long, short, conservative, extreme- and the one thing I’ve learned in my time with crypto. If somebody tells you they know what’s going to happen. They are fucking LYING to you. If you stay smart about your investments, and mitigate your risk, you will always win.

If it’s because of their race? Actually it is precisely racism.  By the literal definition of the word. That’s like saying if you murder a murder, it’s not murder? Lol.
