Why not just use ACH instead of wire? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:41:30
Doesn't sending a wire cost money? That is super lame :( 
Oh well they take forever to approve people these days anyways

Did you end up having a fee on that?

Most of reddit is from the US

The actual tax would prob be 0 but you still would have to file it and that is a pain in the ass. 
Perhaps you could get away with not filing it if that was the only trade of the year but likely it isn't and all those tiny ones add up to make it way more work than it is worth.

Don't forget capital gains taxes.

And only a fool pays those fees as there are plenty of banks without fees and most of the ones with them have things you can do to avoid it.

I guess that I'm not the only one that she is seeing. Good lass.

You can get a bit over 7%? effective back if you deal with points and travel instead of cashback from what I have heard.

Merchants don't pay 5% lmfao.
If they go with costco for example for their payment processor it is 1.22% + 12 cents for local swipes and a bit more for online. That is just the cost of doing business.

It is illegal to my knowledge to add an extra fee for using a credit card so this is not true.
Gas gets away with it somethings with a 'cash discount' but nothing else and not all places even do that. I save ~5% by using my credit card and I never carry a balance.

Well either way your point is moot. The best you can do is misdirection.
Credit cards are  evil and a great thing  the average person. It is more expensive  someone  use crypto than even the most expensive credit card payment processor and credit cards often give the smart consumers loads of money back anyways.
Credit cards are the safest and best way to buy things online.

He prob just sucks with money or some shit.
Credit Cards are great in the right hands.

It should be illegal everywhere and places that it is not illegal it is unethical.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:32:30
It is illegal in my state.

Anyone have a youtube source / mirror ect?  
We can't share reddit links
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:30:40
Whatever Steve. You can't fool my eyes.
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:31:24
Binance still has high fees despite that though lol

FDIC is the reason that the robinhood bank thing awhile back was shit on but normal banks are trusted.

I'm fairly certain that a HDD would saturate the USB's bandwidth so that SSD is a bit overkill.
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:00:39
That isn't possible. Seriously dude go look up what FDIC is.
The US would have to literally collapse or some shit for people to get screwed with it.
