that is the whole point of the argument!
if it crashes, you lose 100% but if it increases, you gain 1000% in a short time, and much much more long-term.
the only way for bitcoin to fail long term is if someone invents something better that can't be merged into bitcoin. is that more likely than 10:1? 100:1?
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:39:19
too much dust.
but btc clients could check online databases and display warnings when you receive stolen coins, similar to how thunderbird/firefox when you visit unreliable web sites.
but deciding which transactions to flag without committing censorship is incredibly difficult so not sure what to think about this.
the US for example would want transactions from wikileaks to be flagged.
also what broughttou said.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:52:19
don't reuse addresses and you will be quite safe from that.
even if private keys are crackable, they would first have to find a way to crack address hashes.
only if both of them get compromised at the same time we have a serious problem.

if you only had 1 confirmation when you last checked it then the block most likely orphaned.
it is also possible that transaction malleability is causing an error. wait for bitcoin 0.9

you haven't lost anything unless you sold.
there is only one possible way in which bitcoin will not reach hundreds of thousands of euro per coin:
if someone invents something better than bitcoin that can't be implemented into bitcoin and then convinces everyone to switch to that better coin.
do you think there will ever be a coin whose features can't be added to bitcoin?
do you think that's gonna happen during the next couple of months before bitcoin reaches its next ATH?

well currently one of the major problems mankind is facing is that people who are affected by the technologies have too much of a say in it.
imagine if horse-drawn carriages would get paid by car manufacturers because car manufacturers drive horse-drawn carriages out of business (pun not intended). 
for example in germany [bloggers have to pay for quoting from newspapers, but the opposite is perfectly legal]( and there are many more similar examples.
renewable energy for example could deliver &gt;100% of the required energy in many countries but it's adoption is getting massively slowed down by those affected by it.

how is limiting a company in its bad actions similar to rewarding a company for bad actions?
and what clamor for bitcoin regulation do you mean?
anyway, regulation against fraud should be covered by existing laws and other regulation is imho not needed because exchanges can just prove how much funds they have if the community asks for it. let's make that a thing and it will work without regulation.
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:57:47
and in bitcoin you can use 2-of-2 signatures which is basically free escrow.
2-of-3 escrow with a trusted third party is possible too and the third party can operate at much lower costs than fiat escrows.

some keywords seem to indicate he's one of those government hired trolls, but he might just be a teenager who picked those up and thinks it's funny.
when you see such people, downvote and report their posts, maybe insult them.
it will make their work more expensive and less effective and their bosses will have a harder time finding enough staff. and in case he's just a kiddie, he deserves getting bashed for stupidity.

i have never noticed you before, and trust me, I'm one of the most notorious troll hunters around here.
however, i just looked through your history, and [this post]( is pretty much something i cannot forgive.
it is not possible *not* to notice the amount of obviously paid trolls in this sub.
you know, regular trolls create *lulz*. there is always *some* way in which their posts can be seen as funny.
however, if you look through the histories of the trolls you will notice that there is nothing but systematic destructiveness. also just read the OP of that thread, i don't want to repeat his post.
an interesting addition is that many of them also post on and (to up their karma) on various random subs. they don't troll anything else. real trolls use their accounts for trolling on more than one sub. if any real troll disagrees, please say so now.
if you really cannot see this, especially after the bitcoin is banned in china attack, then you are either way too naive or are getting paid for your ignorance and the spreading thereof.

but we will see. but then why are coins getting moved by gox?
edit: on the other hand iirc FBI contractor HBGary (the guys who offered to write anti-Anonymous propaganda bots for facebook) stored all their system backups *on the very same machine that was being backed up*, so maybe bad backup solutions aren't all that uncommon even when people should know better.
