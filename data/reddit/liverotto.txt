They don't want the **profits** he made, not even the **revenue**, they want **all the money that went through his website.**
After that the IRS will obviously convict him for tax evasion.
So he owes around  a quarter of a billion dollar to the Govt  and 20 to life + 20 to life of prison rape.
Who said the good old US of A wasn't into lynching anymore!

Thank you Shaniqua, not only racism can be funny but anti-racism hypocrites are the most treacherous and despicable people out there.

Now I mean some people could blackmail the NiggerKing® saying that they have proof that he was born in Kenya and request bitcoin payments to stay quite.

The EU answers one of the most pressing question of the 21st century.
What if Mussolini was a faggot?
The EU is an emasculating feminist theocracy.

Anarchists are not thieves, technically, but since there are no true anarchists it is like asking if a unicorn is an equine.

We like Bitcoin because it allows us to hide our money from your dirty socialist hands, the fact that there are many Euro Bitcoin fans is a symptom of this, we are trying to escape your hypocritical marxist thieving with military grade cryptography.
What is the use of Bitcoin to a statist thief?
@_date: 2012-09-22 01:55:22
Look, Bitcoin is just  cash, digital cash.
If it was possible National governments nowadays would prohibit cash, because it is the main way criminals transfer their money.
Like they would outlaw cigarettes and alcohol, but they can't because they are  to much popular and they have been part of Western society for centuries.
On the other hand new drugs get banned all the time, and that is the same thing with Bitcoin, it is cash, nothing more nothing less, but since it is in a new form Govt can ban it without an overwhelming backslash from the population because its users are the minority.
Moreover Bitcoin attacks banks interests and Govt control of people, of course they will do anything they can to stop it.
To answer your question, no protection is complete, but criminals want all the protection they can, Governments just need an excuse that criminals are using it to stop it.

Interesting idea, moreover you could do the same thing with Obongo's  birth certificate from Kenya.

Three points you might be missing:


* One big transaction can be divided into many small transactions, with many different Bitcoin accounts, that's called Smurfing
* I know this may sound incredible to you, but there are other States *outside* the United States, and in many of them they don't have extradition treaties with the US
* You can convert Bitcoins into other currencies and you can do that overseas too

You are correct Visual Studio 6.0 SP6, that's why Satoshi is probably from Eastern-Europe or Asia, that is, a non-westerner, because in our sick society developing on Windows is tantamount to holocaust denying.

That's a false dichotomy right there yellow brother.
You can do both to diversify your currency risk.
Why not  keep up the family tradition and invest also in "tentacle erotica"?

Isn't it the complete opposite?
RSA is secure on the assumption of the difficulty of integer factorization.
[Elliptic curve cryptography]( on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms.


French academic suggests such and algorithm COULD be found:
* Pardon my French but this sounds like complete and utter Scheiße.

There is a theory by a guy who's name I don't remember that allegedly proves what you said, mathematically the connection is very strong, but I have doubt about that.
What I have really strong doubts is that this article is in any part worrying.
I would compare it to those articles that announce a cure for cancer and AIDS.

I think you have it backwards.
