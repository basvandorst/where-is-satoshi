I agree with you. 9% ROI is a decent for an average person who is married, have kids and working 9-5 in an office.
I am unmarried, my age is 26, I work as a freelance software engineer, I run few drop shipping businesses part time.
I am completely independent and I can afford risks completely. I first heard about BTC when it was below $150. ;-)

My uncle is uneducated and he spent all his life in fields harvesting crops.
Last year he came to the city for his treatment and spent around 6 month at my home. I am a freelancer and I work from home. He saw me spending most of my time with my Laptop. I told him this is how I earn money. He still don't believe that how it is possible to earn money just by looking at a mirror (screen) and hitting some buttons.
Imagine what he will think if I tell him about BTC.
Education is everything.

Fixed deposit. You have to deposit X amount of money for a period of 5-10 years. You can't withdraw it before the maturity period.
My drop shipping strategy, search the products on aliexpress, contact the seller and see if he is willing to accept drop shipping orders, if yes, negotiate terms with him, build an ecommerce site, upload product images and details, run ad campaigns if you know PPC or CPC, and do SEO. Short and simple.

The most critical thing is *how to secure your BTC and do BTC transactions*. To do that you need to understand how it works.
If you lose your BTC even Satoshi Nakamoto can't help you to recover them.
Educating yourself is the first step for investing in BTC.

Its not the end of BTC. You are still early adopter of BTC. There is still time for BTC to roar fully.

I posted this few hours ago in the comments section :-) 
My intentions were only to help her and I believe she is already married because she mentioned she is planning to do the investment for kids. Since she is professional banker she knows better how banks rob us in the name of profit and security.

Lol. I don't want her to ditch her husband for a geek just for BTC.
