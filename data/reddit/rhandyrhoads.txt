Couldn't one argue that a system in which it's possible for anyone to attack it and raise costs of transactions isn't necessarily a good design for the mainstream?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:43:13
I don't know too much, but from what I'm gathering in this thread a bank isn't necessary to use as a node as you can set up your own node, but it'll be easier to just use a third-party middleman.

ARE YOU TRYING TO INSULT HIM? IT'S CALLED BITCOIN CASH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:45
Well how I view it is that in the current system everyone has to use centralized networks for long distance transactions. With Bitcoin those who are inclined to do so can use private methods. However, these are technically complicated and by using simplified, but centralized systems Bitcoin can become more accessible and practical for non-technical users.
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:55:35
I'm just saying that I feel that you're trying too hard to get the vote of redditors.  What effect could you possibly have on net neutrality or the NSA and what does your use of bitcoins have to do with your position?
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:32:38
How likely do you think the government of a country is to give up all control of the currency aspect of their economy to a currency which some countries are on the fence about making illegal, in theory could be destroyed if someone with enough money and the right hardware decided to start an attack on the network, and they have almost zero actual knowledge about.  Let's say the US decided you know what let's ditch the US dollar and switch to bitcoin.  All of your dollars should be traded in for bitcoins. The price of bitcoins would be thrown off severely and there would be all sorts of problems.  Then there's the issue of taxation.  Let's say some guy has a couple hundred bitcoins lying around in a paper wallet in a safe in his basement.  How is the government supposed to know he has that money?  Then maybe we do something to get Sweden mad and they declare war on us.  Obviously we have a superior military, but then the government could go up to KNCMiner and say hey, here's 1 billion dollars, make a shit ton of ASICs and destroy bitcoin.  The entire country is thrown into anarchy and our economy collapses.  This is all unlikely, but why take unnecessary risks?  Bitcoin is an amazing technology, but is not a replacement for fiat currency.
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:39:15
Well maybe my phone is dead, or maybe like my wallet, I like to keep it in my pocket instead of constantly carrying it around.  And someone who is unorganized and has their bills lying around in random places in their wallet is probably going to have the wallet app lying around in some random place on their phone and might not remember the pin right away.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:09:54
Yes, but you need the fiat money from the bank to pay your electricity bills to keep that computer with your bitcoins on it running.
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:02:17
In what way could it be tampered with? The physical bitcoin could have had it's funds extracted while a dollar bill's value is entirely in the item itself.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:49:59
Actually Apple is anticompetitive.  Have you ever heard of the iMessage problem?  Well Apple's iMessage results in iPhone owners being unable to text you when you switch to Android if you don't disable iMessage on the iPhone while Google Hangouts is available on both platforms.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:31:46
I did that a while ago.

wants their bot back.
@_date: 2014-03-22 23:12:37
I'm going to get downvoted, maybe have this comment removed and possibly banned from for this, but it's not an uncommon problem. Most cryptocurrency subreddits are total circlejerks where any negative post or mention of other cryptocurrencies gets downvoted to hell or removed. The tip bot still works, but people in don't allow it to verify tips.
EDIT: I'm probably losing my upvotes now, but my upvotes are proof of the circlejerky behavior on this subreddit, with people just upvoting to try to say they aren't a circlejerk whenever somebody points it out.
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:05:44
Yes, but who's to say that the coin hasn't been tampered with and it actually has the value that someone claims it does?
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:41:06
NSFW on a direct link to a porn site maybe?  Regardless, that's great to see such a large business accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:53:19
I don't think you understand what is.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:49:18
I thought this was a post when I saw the title.
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:35:59
And others see the potential for a whole lot of dollar signs and blindly follow it.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:27:33
is leaking.
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:32:52
Well that would work but it would also be a bit of a pain to manage.  The typical consumer who would consider an Apple product wants something that just works would not want to have to go through that much effort to use something that is accepted in such a small amount of places just for privacy.
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:05:54
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:03:20
It's fine, I didn't exactly come off the way I wanted to either.  Thank you so much for the large tip. Would you mind if I put that tip towards a mining rig I'm looking to build?  That's a bit over a days worth of mining for me using my gaming rig and I'm trying to get all the doge I can get with the way prices are fluctuating.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:49:51
Thank you for giving an amount that actually matters to someone.  Giving someone a tip of 10 doge seems like an insult to me.
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:33:41
What if your phone is dead or you use an iPhone?  What if you are in a dead zone and don't have service?
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:09:10
Yes, I'm just saying that bitcoin and fiat are two seperate systems yet bitcoin is completely dependent on fiat.

Actually dogecoin is down from where it was last week, probably because of some decisions regarding a cap on dogecoin.

Provide a valid reason and a way that it could be efficiently implemented to support a large country.

I think we're banned around here.
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:40:45
So what you are saying is that the entire bitcoin protocol should be changed in order to make shorter block generation times?
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:28:29
I wouldn't call the Moto X superior.  The only thing that is better is battery life.  The Nexus 5 has a better processor, better screen, and is more open to developers.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:54:09
The solution would be a portable battery pack or a battery case.  I personally feel that the Nexus 5 has increased my productivity, because I game less to keep it going throughout the day and my grades have gone up.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:00:56
I understand what you're getting at, but the way I see it is someone saying my coin is fine but yours isn't and you lost hundreds of dollars.  Here's a fraction of a cent worth of my coin.  I understand that most people don't mean it that way, but it's very easy to be interpreted that way.
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:48:44
Wait I don't remember that smile afterwards.  Please tell me it's photoshopped in.
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:32:14
So there is no reason relevant to your desired position to have mentioned your support of the NSA, or dislike of the NSA?
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:06:18
How do you unlock and root the Moto X?  For the Nexus 5 I open up Android SDK and type in adb reboot bootloader, fastboot oem unlock, fastboot flash recovery twrpx.x.x.x.x Then I just boot into recovery and hit reboot and superuser packages are installed.  In 3 commands I have an unlocked and rooted phone with a huge developer community and updates directly from Google.
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:19:47
No, I'm just saying that when the lack of acceptance is just outright pointed out, they try to pretend it isn't there.
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:15:01
In that case you should be aware that you practically made a post with this title.  They literally made a post with that exact title since they didn't need to change anything.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:29:22
I click almost automatically.
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:36:49
OK is seriously posting stuff from ibtimes? I'm so close to unsubscribing with this whole circle jerk in here. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:04:57
Yes, this is exactly my point.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:40:27
I'm looking at things on the level of someone who invested thousands in bitcoins.  That person isn't likely to see anything but dollar signs.  I appreciate any tip myself, but if I'd lost thousands from my personal funds then I would feel insulted by someone giving me a fraction of a cent.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:15:57
Time doesn't fix issues of scalability over time, it simply makes them worse. These problems will have to be solved as soon as possible by people developing solutions and more importantly, the board accepting them.
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:05:58
I don't know because I don't have your address, but if you wanted me to send you any or you sent me any I would be able to see. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:08:31
Christ I support bitcoin, but bitcoin freaking keeps a public record of all your transactions and how many bitcoins you have that anyone with your address can see.
@_date: 2019-03-15 18:13:36
Yes, because bitcoin hasn't shown any signs of volatility since 2013.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:47:10
Except for acting in a physical store.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:43:41
So let's say you want to move a chunk of money inside your bank account. You're going to convert it all to bitcoin, have the other person set up a bitcoin wallet, wait for it to sync, send them the bitcoin and then have them transfer it back to fiat?
@_date: 2015-07-12 04:43:26
I am on Android.

Reddit Sync for proper material design.

Mobile users RIP.
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:35:55
No you're not. Shut up Rachel.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:36:52
But doesn't that also decrease the overall transaction pool by that amount?
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:33:30
Ehh eth didn't fall too much.
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:37:54
Yes but then putting the money in a bank is illegal and that's the most practical way to cash out bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:36:29
So you're saying that dispensary owners should keep their money in crypto?
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:22:30
If by use an anonymous coin you mean cash it out without people realizing that it's through the dispensary then that's money laundering under federal law.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:34:41
Yes but am I wrong in saying it is illegal to directly deposit that money in the bank as although it is reported as income it is still a federally illegal source of income. By receiving a crypto currency and converting it to cash in the bank (business owners can't store their funds in crypto realistically speaking) wouldn't that be money laundering?
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:20:22
Alright it seems like you could have a valid point. Only issue I can see is that you'd definitely want to run that by a lawyer to be sure it's not illegal and finding a lawyer that understands all that may be tricky.
@_date: 2015-11-01 03:18:21
I mean for the exchange itself. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 22:44:41
Isn't trading on the margin a bad idea in a potentially unstable market?
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:43:09
Did you pay in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:58:28
That was a pessimistic number of months and also you did not give me an actual estimate.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:59:19
I believe that buying underwear would be a better idea to cover your ass.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:24:57
I am aware but at the time of the purchase I had never heard of bitcoin mining. In addition a 7990 requires three slots so if I ever went back to a two slot gpu then I'd have a hole in the back of my cases because I don't have reusable covers. At the time of purchase the 690 was the best option
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:53:23
Ok thanks I guess I should have thought of that. Would this also apply to running it in CUDA since nvidia works better with CUDA
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:00:24
I am aware but I already have the 690. Bitcoin mining isn't the primary purpose of my rig. In addition the 690 is quieter and more power efficient than the 7990 and gets better frame rates in BF3. I'm not looking for ultra fast money earning. I'm just spending a little while to save up for some case fans.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:21:55
I agree with all of your points but the last one.  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency so it isn't successful if it isn't a currency.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:01:30
I'm not paying for the electric bill :P
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:22:42
Ah I forgot to take that into account, could you give me an estimate for 6 to 7 months from now?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:22:45
I agree with a lot of your points.  However I believe that the value shouldn't be seen in the BTC to USD conversion price.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:20:43
Yes but I have a guaranteed profit from bitcoin mining while I don't have the means or resources to open a store
