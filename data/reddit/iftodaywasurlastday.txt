@_date: 2017-12-26 01:08:22
So I can't help but notice that the transactions were sent with a fee of 1430 sat/byte. That basically means, assuming you paid the same fee on the other "gifts" that you paid $1420 in fees to send a total of $125. Before the critics of bitcoin's fee structure jump in, consider:
1. A fee with a fraction of the size would have still worked. You simply overpaid in fees. Not sure if this was deliberate, but you overpaid.
2. Other coins offer cheaper transactions at the moment, simply because people don't them. But if these other coins gain popularity, they will suffer the same fee problem in the future.
3. Scaling requires off chain solutions, like lightening network. At that point, transactions will be instant and effectively free. 
Merry Christmas.

The last time I purchased a new car, I wanted to pay with my credit card (I wanted the cash back). The dealer was unwilling because the credit card company skims 2.5%. In other words, the car was priced as "cash", while virtually every other good is pre-inflated by 3% to compensate for the fee. 
By eliminating the 2.5% skim, that amount is kept by the merchant. Does that mean the customer pays the same, but the merchant makes 2.5% more profit? Maybe, but competition will self adjust this situation.
tl;dr: eliminate the credit card fee, and consumer goods will decrease by 2.5%

Of course you can buy coins for $350 at gox. There's only one problem: unlike Coinbase, with Gox you can't actually take delivery of the coins. The price at Gox might as well be $0.

So much opportunity for comedy and ridicule, but I will refrain.
It's called mining, not farming. You can't do it with a CPU, you need specialized equipment called an ASIC miner, but they are expensive. Even if you can afford one, you will likely consume more electricity than you will have mined in bitcoin value.
Purchasing bitcoin through an exchange is a more efficient method of obtaining bitcoin.

You can use your own custom made algorithm for each wallet. You start with a basic password, preferably non-dictionary (like "cryptolover"), then using the last 4 characters of each public address, you add to the password. So, if the last 4 characters of wallet  are 4FtQ, then the password would be cryptolover4FtQ.
Of course, the weakness is the algorithm is easy to determine, but at least it offers some additional protection over the same exact password for each wallet.

You can also leave it in your Coinbase account (wallet). Unlike mtgox, the risk that they will lose your coins is very low. I hope I don't regret saying that some day!
Transferring the coins to a paper wallet or Blockchain wallet puts you directly in control of your private keys. It all depends who you trust more: Coinbase or yourself.

In 1945, for 1 ounce of silver, you could buy about 3.5 gallons of gas. In 2014, for 1 ounce of silver, you can buy about 4 gallons of gas.
In that time-frame, what happened to the value of the USD? In 1945, that dollar could buy you 3.5 gallons of gas. Now that dollar will buy you 7% of that amount (about 0.25 gallons).
Your US dollar has depreciated an extraordinary amount over time, making them worth less. Bitcoin is like gold and silver, it doesn't depreciate in value because nobody is counterfitting the asset (like the FED is doing with US dollars).

Why is that *every* time the price goes up, the bears declare "bulltrap" or "pump &amp; dump"? Perhaps the price is going up because every day, about 10 million new people learn about Bitcoin and can see the potential. The smart ones invest. And the extra-smart ones have no future plans to redeem their Bitcoin for cash. They invest because they know someday a single Bitcoin will be redeemable for a car, a house or a yacht.
If you're considering investing in Bitcoin, ignore the bears. Either they stand to gain from a decline (short interest) or they feel wronged that they missed earlier opportunities. 
Bitcoin is here to stay. It cannot be un-invented.

The market is betting that they will never re-enable withdrawals. That's why the price is so low.

Bitcoin is a consensus algorithm. This is not a federal election where 50.1% of the population gets to decide who will represent 100% of the people. Under your plan, it would be the equivalent of splitting a country in two based on the popular vote. A divided country is prone to hostile attack. Same with bitcoin. Let's say the hard fork is successful, Bitcoin Unlimited should not declare victory because I ASSURE you that there are dozens of other insane groups that will attempt the same hostile takeover on you.

Herein lies a problem for mass adoption. The time required to have the transaction confirmed needs to be overcome. In most cases, a coffee shop will accept payment when it's been broadcast (even before the first confirmation) since most people won't go to the effort to double-spend.

In most jurisdictions in North America, any gains accrued during the marriage become the shared property of both individuals. For example, you own 10 bitcoins worth $10,000 at the time of marriage. At the time of separation/divorce (sorry things didn't work out), the bitcoin is worth $30,000. You can fully claim the $10,000 as an asset upon entering the marriage, but the $20,00 is shared 50% for each person.

Transaction scalability. At present, we can handle about 7 transactions per second. Some people say that we need to scale to levels achieved by Visa (millions per second). In fact, the system will eventually need to handle 100x the volume of Visa.
Just having bigger blocks is not nearly enough. We don't need to double or triple the capacity. We need the increase capacity by 500,000,000x.  Lightning network provides this ability.

The amount of fee needs to reflect the transaction size in bytes, not bitcoin. At present, moving a simple transaction that you eat confined within a couple of blocks requires ~74800satoshis (0.90 USD). In some cases, if you are moving bitcoin from an address that had a large number of inputs (let's say 50), the fee is closer to $18.00. When Segwit gets activated, all these excessive fees will disappear.

Sir: I've seen your BIP. Although I feel it's technically sound, there is no way that it will gain any amount of political support.

If the block size was &lt;1mb, then such emergency measures would be impossible.

@_date: 2017-03-01 22:26:45
The time required for the first confirmation is a function of the time between blocks being mined. On average, this is 10 minutes. The probability that your transaction will be included in that block depends on the fee you included. You are competing against all other transactions waiting to be confined and theses are prioritized by who paid the highest fee. If your fee is too low, you may be excluded for several blocks in a row. 
Remember that most blocks are now completely full (1MB limit). Until recently, this wasn't the case, so getting included in the next block (even with a low fee) was easy. By activating Segwit, we can stuff more transactions into the 1MB bock.

I don't think we will see massive inflation in North America or Europe for the foreseeable future. However, we will see many instances of failing currencies (+hyperinflation) in many smaller economies. It might affect bitcoin, but wont have a huge impact.


Yes. Absolutely. This won't be because a technical flaw, but because of special interest groups (like BU) trying to gain control, thus weakening the infrastructure - making it vulnerable to attack. 
I'm bullish on bitcoin and will continue to invest, but I'm also aware that I estimate that there is a 10% chance that I will loose everything. If BU continues to gain traction, the odds on bitcoin failing go up drastically.

There are two ways to go about making changes to bitcoin:
1. Create/Submit a BIP, have it peer reviewed and evaluate its effectiveness and risks in testnet and and ONLY when satisfied that billions of dollars won't be at risk, we add as a soft fork. 
2. We say FUCK IT, create our own version of Bitcoin, skip the peer review and testnet and hard fork the protocol.
The bottom line is that bitcoin is managed through consensus. If enough reckless people can be convinced that option  is better, then it's going to happen. But God save our souls if we hard fork. The risks are many.

Nobody is claiming that Segwit is a long term solution. However, anyone who understands how bitcoin works knows that Segwit needs to be implemented as the first step. Next, efforts to scale could include HF our layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network.

Segwit has the net effect of doubling the block size. Also Segwit is a soft fork so implementation is minimally disruptive. But the network still need consensus (51% or much more to ensure that support does not drop below half). A 2MB blocksize increase is a hard fork and is risky for many reasons. Core can't just activate it. Lightning Network is completely different animal and likely years away from implementation. 
We need block size relief now. We need Segwit.

Your fee was probably too low. What is the transaction id? You can try this:

At the risk of repeating myself, let's be clear that if Bitcoin Unlimited had never existed, none of this would be happening. We would have enjoyed unencumbered scaling, growth and prosperity. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:29:53
Fee too low at 44 sat/byte. It should be 5x this amount..After 3 days the funds will reappear in the sending wallet. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:10:15
Possible. However, if I was a supporter of big blocks, I would spam the hell out of the network while simultaneously make claims that fees are too high.

I'll sell you one for $5 (just kidding).
Old school way: go to  and print yourself a paper wallet. Just don't print it on any kind of printer that is connected to the internet.
Or install a wallet app on your phone (Breadwallet is a good option for iOS or Android). These apps manage your public/private addresses so it's wallet l easier for you.
For someone who owns lots of Bitcoin, a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger or KeepKey) is a good idea.

You get twice as many coins. Let's say you own 100 bitcoins. After the fork, you will get 100 BTC and 100 BTU. These are not interchangeable and are considered different currencies.

Try contacting Sidehack to see if you can buy a $30 USB stick called the 2Pac. The nice thing about it, is you can run it on a Raspberry Pi and it   consumes less than 10 watts. You obviously won't make any money, but you could try solo mining or ckpool and you might get lucky and solve a block. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:06:22
Your assumption that everyone wants bitcoin to succeed is wrong. You and I want this, but miners want one thing: PROFIT. This may be achieved by ensuring bitcoins long term success. Or maybe by exploiting it until it's dead, then they will move on to Dash or Monero. The point is, are you willing to take a chance that miners have the same long term motivation as you and I. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:23:16
Transaction size is a function of the number of inputs and outputs.  You have two options: become an expert on these topics and calculate the fee yourself or get a better wallet that does the calculation for you.

The panic that happens as Bitcoin Unlimited increases hash rate and comes close to a hard fork. Such an event would cause a massive loss in investor confidence. Roger Ver is trying to convince people that he's promoting BU for the benefit of bitcoin. History will show that his efforts will do the exact opposite.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:57:52
Yes, it's very possible, even likely that the CIA inserted itself into Bitcoin. It is well known that Gavin Andresen visited the CIA, and shortly thereafter began acting strange. It has been suggested that he was coerced by the CIA to destroy bitcoin from within, but refusing to do so, he intentionally withdrew from the project and proceeded to destroy his own reputation and credibility. By doing so, he would no longer be in a position to execute the CIA directive.
How did he destroy his own reputation? He began supporting projects such as Bitcoin Unlimited. Gavin feels safe supporting it, because he knows that it will never get adopted since the majority of the bitcoin community understands that BU would result in a hard fork, loss of confidence in bitcoin, and ultimately cause bitcoin to collapse under its own weight when the blocks grow to 1GB+ and the blockchain grows to 100TB+.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:52:44
Segwit, yes. This paves the way for Lightning Network - which must be properly tested before activation. What kind of irresponsible group of people would try to activate software without peer review and adequate testing. In case the sarcasm isn't obvious, I'm referring to BU.

Markets don't like uncertainty. The price is dropping due to uncertainty. However, I can tell you that yesterday's developments is good news because it's clear that BTU will be treated as an altcoin. And BTC can resume its efforts to be the king of all cryptocurrencies. Bottom line is that the future of Bitcoin looks more certain that ever because Roger Ver is becoming increasingly irrelevant in this discussion.

We can't trust miners. However, is reasonable to expect some mining power (non Segwit) supporting to shift to BTU. Activating Segwit through UASF is probably easier now. Bottom line is that Segwit is necessary for bitcoin, so it needs to activate one way or another.

There were millions of dollars waiting on the sidelines to invest in bitcoin. Many of them were hoping that the ETF would be approved and they could invest that way.

No, from the time the transaction was broadcast. But be mindful that the estimated time assumes the the mempool doesn't grow in that period. After 3 days, if still not confirmed, the funds reappear in the sending wallet.

Let's be clear, if Bitcoin Unlimited did not exist, bitcoin would have scaled properly in response to user demand. We would all be enjoying growth and prosperity. The damage was caused by Roger's vision that block size should be determined by the miners. This is the same group of people who brag about mining EMPTY blocks. If that's not evidence of greed and acting contrary to bitcoin's best interest, I'm not sure what is.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:25:07

The explanation is simple: it's not good to give miners more power. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:08:51
As I suspected, you don't understand how this works. Nodes don't choose the block size, the miners do. This will CENTRALIZE the control and miners will adjust the block size to maximize their profits in transaction fees, not to allow the network to scale. Remember that miners are the same greedy group that is bragging about mining EMPTY blocks. Is this not sufficient evidence of their greed (at the expense of bitcoin's success)?
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:07:55
The blocks have been full for months, especially during the period where bitcoin price doubled. The correlation I see now is that the transaction spam is ceasing (which was mostly likely caused by big blockers who were trying to prove a point), the mempool size is under control and transaction fees are returning to 'normal'.
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:40:32
No, but the BU people are trying their best to gain 50%+ of the hash rate. Hopefully, it never happens. If it does happen, it could take 1 month or 1 year.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:31:50
No, nothing for you to do. The only impact Segwit will have on for you is:
1. Transaction fees will drop significantly
2. Transaction will likely get confirmed in the next block
3. Bitcoin will scale, thus allow greater utility, thus increase in value

Yes, fee was way too low (10 sat/byte). See here: 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:43:15
I don't think you understand what is happening. A group of individuals created an alternative client called Bitcoin Unlimited - which had the sole purpose of handing over control and profitability to miners. Had they been successful,  bitcoin would have been exploited to the point of failure. The mere fact that a hard fork might occur is a partial victory for them and a loss for you and I. 
Roger Ver and Bitcoin Unlimited are enemies to bitcoin. That is clear to anyone with  IQ over 100.

@_date: 2017-03-17 21:55:47
Correct. And the coins you own on the BTU chain are likely to be worth a fraction of the price of your BTC coins. My prediction is that the price will go up, then the BTU "developers" will make another critical mistake, causing BTU to suffer a non-recoverable setback and those coins will be worth 0$. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:17:31

Since you are transferring between wallets that you control, there is no urgency for the transaction to confirm. If you're not clear on the inputs and outputs, try a fee of 60000 satoshis (0.70USD). If the transaction size is small, it will confirm quickly. Worst case scenario, the transaction will never confirm and the funds will reappear in the sending wallet. You can then tutti again with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:52:04
100% of my transactions have confirmed on the next block. Not sure what the problem is. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:19:19
No, you can't scale with 1MB, nor did anyone claim that we could. However, you can't scale with 16MB blocks either. Proper scaling requires layer 2 solutions.

Listening to Roger Ver promote the efforts of Bitcoin Unlimited is like listening to someone explain that you can solve global warming by leaving your refrigerator door open.

Increasing the block size is a hard fork.

Yes, it's possible. But why make blocks  more efficient/compact with Segwit when BU allows the blocks to grow to an unlimited size? The problem with BU is that blocks would eventually be 1GB+ and the blockchain would grow to 100TB+. Although storage devices might keep up, the quantity of throughput would cause bitcoin to collapse under its own weight. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:11:15

@_date: 2017-03-04 21:01:41
As you know, there are lots of good videos on the basics of how bitcoin works, but it's critical to highlight some of the videos that describe why bitcoin is important for billions of people around the world, especially those who do not have access to bank accounts. And there is nobody better at explaining the importance of this phenomenon than Andreas. You should link to some of his talks like [this one](
I think you should mention Adam Meister's (bitcoin meister) channel on YouTube for daily updates. I don't agree with everything he says, but he's informative and worth watching.
BTW, your channel is really good as well. It's a great resource for beginners so keep up the good work!
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:45:53
Perhaps you don't understand how supply/demand works. At 25 coins per block, that's 3600 bitcoins flooding exchanges every day. When the ~~require~~ bock reward dropped to 12.5, and the demand stayed stable, the price only had one way to go...up. Was this going to happen the same day, same week, or same month? Of course not. Bottom line is that as supply dries up , the price will keep going up. You will see drastic increases coinciding with the halfing events in 2020, 2024 and 2028.

@_date: 2017-03-20 01:23:22
Segwit has the net effect of increasing the block size to 2MB. Compromise with BU is not possible since they not only want a bock increase, they want to allow miners to set the block size. This is an unacceptable position for anyone who wants to see bitcoin become the cryptocurrency used by the entire world.

Yes. Other than the obvious reasons why the transaction would be removed from the mempool (like being confirmed in a block), there are two other reasons:
1. The transaction was at the bottom of the mempool (when sorted by fee per size), the mempool had reached its size limit, and a new higher-fee transaction was accepted, evicting the bottom. Since we are not a the mempool limit, this is unlikely to be the case.
2. The transaction expired by timeout (by default 72 hours after accepting). 
So, in summary, make sure that at least 72 hours has elapsed.

@_date: 2017-03-07 21:19:26
You're wrong. Segwit keeps the block size to 1MB (for now) but allows the network to stuff approximately 2MBs worth of transactions into the block. It's a first step to resolve our current situation of having full blocks. But more importantly, it paves the way for layer 2 solutions that will allow the system to have 1000x the transaction capacity as Visa. No proposal by Unlimited comes close to allowing for this level of scaling and growth.

As I expected, Brian Armstrong lacks basic knowledge on how the bitcoin protocol works. Since he spends time with the BU team, maybe he should sit with the Core developers to understand that BU fundamentally changes how bitcoin works and that it introduces risk that could cause an epic failure for bitcoin. At a minimum, he owes this to Coinbase's investors since supporting BU could lead to a failure of the only reason why Coinbase exists in the first place.

Edit: they eventually transferred me to a supervisor. Although he was sympathetic to my complaint about the delay, he said that Segwit would result in an effective block size increase, faster confirmations and lower fees. This would be devastating to the miners - who welcome the exorbitant fees. He said that Bitcoin Unlimited was awesome because it allows the greedy miners to set the block size themselves, thus insuring that they can maximize profits in the fee market.

Fees are not calculated based on the amount of bitcoin transacted. The fee is based the the size of transaction in bytes. At present, the fee should be 200 satoshis per byte.  You should use a better wallet that allows for dynamic fee calculations

Small blocks are not bad for the network. The blocks are propagating nicely across the network and the blockchain growth is manageable indefinitely.
But small blocks are hindering growth and scalability. We need to stuff more transactions into each block (Segwit) and also increase the block size. Simply increasing the block size to accommodate bitcoin's organic growth will cause the network to collapse under units its own weight.

The theory is that by increasing the block size, the volume of transactions will grow with the organic growth of Bitcoin adoption. However, you're correct because miners will absolutely restrict the block size just enough to ensure that fees stay high. In other words, miners want today's high fee environment, but at 100x the volume of transactions.
Miners DO NOT act in an altruistic manner. They act in a manner that maximizes their short term profit, even if it means that bitcoin will suffer in the long term.

Sounds like a powerful argument to activate Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:46:39
Segwit increases the number of transactions that can be stuffed into the existing block size of 1MB. It has the net effect of making the block size 2MB. It also fixes a whole bunch of other issues, including transaction malleability. It's a soft fork, so implementation is much easier and involves no risk.
Bitcoin Unlimited effectively changes how the bitcoin protocol works by allowing miners to increase/decrease the block size at their discretion. Supporters of BU argue that miners have the same incentives as everyone else by keeping bitcoin healthy and growing for the long term. Opponents of BU argue that miners are solely interested in profits, and this may be achieved by preventing growth and scaling. Some miners even brag about mining empty blocks in order to increase congestion, thus increasing fees. Not convinced? Do some research on the guy who controls the bulk of the mining power (Jihan Wu) and decide for yourself if handing over control to this guy is a good idea.
Other critics of BU argue that the network infrastructure cannot handle large blocks and would prevent the average person from running a node on their home computer, further reducing decentralization. Worst case, the huge blocks would cause bitcoin to collapse under its own weight.
Lastly, there is concern over the capabilities of the BU development team. They have introduced several bugs, the most recent resulting in the majority of BU nodes to shut-down with a simple attack. In that instance, had BU been the main protocol running the majority of the network, it would have caused a complete and potentially non-recoverable failure of bitcoin.
Edit: I would like to add that supports of BU have been critical (maybe justifiably so) that the Core developers have been slow to implement solutions to allow for proper scaling. Since the current block size is 1MB, there is significant competition for access to the block, thus the fees are driven higher. Most people (but not all) argue that fees are too high. The Core team has several solutions planned to resolve this properly, but Segwit needs to be activated first. But supporters of BU are blocking it, so we are at a stalemate.
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:22:28
By limiting the number of transactions in a block, the demand/competition to get into the block goes up, thus higher fees. 
It comes down to how miners can maximise their fees. Is it better to have more transactions (at lower fee) or restricted transactions (at higher fee).

Depends on how your exchange handles this, but in my example, I was not referring to a market order. If the market price was $4000 and you want $4100, you would specify that price with a quantity to sell of 0.3. If the price runs up and a buyer matches your price, the trade will execute.

Because the demand will never disappear and people will buy and start driving the price back up. When shorting, you eventually need to cover (buy back) and that accelerates the demand and drives the price even higher. When you see sudden price spikes after a period of price depreciation, it's often caused by shorts being squeezed and forced to buy back.

Any exchange (bitcoin, stocks, commodities, currencies, etc...) have people trying to buy (bids) and people trying to sell (asks). When the bid and ask price meets, the transaction is completed (and locked-in) irrespective of all future changes in price.
When you place a sell order, you can specify "market" or "limit". If you specify "market", then the bitcoin will be sold immediately at the highest price someone is willing to pay (the highest "bid" price). With a "limit" order, you specify a minimum price you're willing to sell at. If you set the limit price too high, nobody will buy your bitcoin because other sellers will always make their bitcoin available for a cheaper price.
Based on your post, I'm not clear if you actually place a sell order for your bitcoin and whether the order was filled (someone bought it from you).

You can't just increase the block size thinking this will allow bitcoin to scale. Larger blocksizes mean there's more delay in block propagation, which means a higher orphan rate.

Coinbase is well known and generally easy to use - however, they had had growing pains lately which have caused hardship for many customers. Until they resolve these issues, I do not recommend them. The concept of an exchange scares some people because they see it almost like having a stock trading account. They are not clear on the concept of "buy" and "sell" orders. However, exchanges like gemini.com make it easier for the average person.

Sadly, that's not true. For one reason or another, many people (mostly, but not exclusively) on the other sub don't want bitcoin to succeed at all. Maybe they missed the boat and hoping they can make a fortune with bcash (at bitcoin's expense). 
Hard forks are risky. Why would the responsible team at Core jeopardize $55B in market cap when there are better, safer methods to scale bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:52:39
Basically the same way as investing in gold. If you buy gold, then sell it for a profit, you need to report that as a capital gain and pay taxes. It gets more complicated when you spend the bitcoin. For example, if you bought a bitcoin for $1000 and then bought something using that 1 bitcoin for $3300, you still need to report a capital gain of $2300 and pay tax.

Once you buy the coins (Coinbase, exchange, etc..) you create a wallet (on your PC or mobile phone). The wallet will have an address so log onto Coinbase (or the exchange) and initiate a transfer to the address that you control in your wallet. You can also [create a paper wallet]( and transfer the coins to the address printed on the paper.
Yes, they collect a fee each time the a coin is transferred, but in order to do so, they need to run the Bitcoin core - which in basic terms means that they are helping to "maintain" the blockchain.

I have been buying bitcoin on an exchange (Bitstamp, Kraken, etc..) since 2014 and never paid any real fees (maybe a 0.25% exchange fee). Coinbase charges more, but they are not an exchange persay. In my case, I plan to hold my coins for years (5, 10, 15, not sure yet) and plan to use them to buy stuff.
The miner doesn't act as an exchange. The transaction is peer to peer. However, a small amount (lets say 15 cents) gets directed to the miner who originally mined that bitcoin. It's done that way to address your concern: that the miners would just pack-up and there would be inadequate participation in the network.
edit: also, miners won't just sell all their coins since most of them believe in the true potential of Bitcoin. So why sell a coin at $900 if you think it will be worth $10,000 some day? However, mining is expensive (equipment and electricity) so miners are forced to sell in order to fund their operation.

To trade, you need an account at an exchange. At 15, you won't qualify. That's a good thing. DO NOT TRADE YOUR BITCOIN. If you do, I almost guarantee that you will lose your bitcoin. You don't have enough experience to trade. JUST BUY AND HOLD.

If you purchase something in bitcoin from Newegg, [all refunds are issued in the form of gift card](
So I don't think that Dell is unique in this area. However, if Dell is going to accept bitcoin, they MUST have proper customer service support. Having delt with Dell support in the past, I know they are often incompetent.
Lastly, and most important, if Dell cannot fulfill the order within the specified timeframe, they need to declare the item as out of stock. That's unacceptable for a company of their size.

Worst case scenario, the transaction will stay in the mempool for a few days, will never get confirmed and will re-appear in your Electrum wallet. Also, don't store your BTC in coinbase.

Why are you terrified of a large dip? Are you intending to panic and sell of the price drops? Only to watch the price recover (as it ALWAYS has). 
I remember reading a post on this sub in 2014 from someone who was panicking when the price dipped from $900 to $600 (he said it was his life's savings). People tried to convince him to hold. Then the price went to $500, then $400. He sold it (sub $400) and said "well at least I was able to salvage *something*". Within hours, the price started climbing. Within days, it had fully recovered.
Lesson: hold

 and 
@_date: 2017-01-28 14:14:01
1. Different markets/countries have different prices due to the ability to get fiat (regular currency) in and out of the exchange. There are a few the reasons, but that's the biggest one.
2. Nobody knows the long-term success (or price) of bitcoin. Some people will tell you that the currency is doomed, others will tell you that bitcoin will be worth 1000X more in the future. One thing for sure: blockchain technology is here to stay.
My personal view is that bitcoin price will still be volatile for several more years, but as various world currencies collapse, bitcoin will be seen as a safe store of value. I'm personally very bullish on the future.

You can go to  and select "wallet details". Enter the key and see if if spits-out a corresponding public key. Now go to  and enter the public key to see the balance of bitcoin.

1. Why not just use cash? Because you cant send cash through the internet. If you do (PayPal or credit card), somebody pays a fee. If send wire transfers or remittances, the fees can be huge. With bitcoin, I can send a million dollars anywhere in the world for almost no fee at all.
2. Bitcoins are already divided in 100 million units (known as a Satoshi). If bitcoins were worth a million dollars each, a coffee ($5) would cost 200 Satoshis. Easy.
3. Miners will continue to run for purposes of collecting transaction fees. Although each transaction is only pennies, eventually there will be millions of transactions per second and the rewards will be huge.

That's how bitcoin works. Your fee is based on the size of transaction (based on inputs/outputs). You can pay a lower fee if you use a wallet that allows greater control for the user. Coinomi is an example of such wallet. Also, now that Segwit is a reality, expect fees to come down with the assistance of layer 2 solutions (like Lightning network). Right now, the situation sucks, but the future is so bright, you're going to need a good pair of sunglasses.

I think that limit is set by Interact, not the exchange. If you want to send larger amounts, you need to use a wire transfer. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:39:37
When you store your coins on Coinbase,  you are not in control of your coins. You are putting your trust in a third party. You are best to transfer them to a wallet that you control. If you choose to keep them on Coinbase, you don't need another wallet app (like blockchain).
For "trades", are you really planning to trade for profit? This is risky business and unless you really know what you're doing, you will likely loose. If you're just planning to buy from QuadrigaCX, you can transfer them anywhere you want: your coinbase account or any other wallet.
For wallets, hardware wallets are the best especially if you have Bitcoin exceeding $1000. Next, are mobile wallets like Mycelium. The Blockchain wallet is popular but I don't recommend it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:07:05
Ultimately, the dominant chain will be determined by mining power. You can have a million nodes in the Core side, but it won't matter if the mining power goes to 2X. 
The good news is that mining power will follow the price. Since 2x will lag behind in price, the mining power will stay on the real Bitcoin.

For a US exchange, I'd go with Gemini:  If you compare the price between Gemini and Quadrigacx, you will see that it's approximately the exchange rate (1.34) so I don't think it will be cheaper to go with the USD option.

Yes, the proposed workaround is activating Segwit (which NEEDS to happen for SO MANY REASONS) and actually decreasing the block size. Politically, hard forking to a smaller block size will likely never happen. So the bottom line is: Segwit and new Layer 2 solutions (Lightning networks, etc..) to allow bitcoin to scale properly and safely.

Since my last experience, I had to wipe my Raspian and start over.

When SegWit activates, there will be significantly less competition to be included in a block. This will cause transaction fees to drop sharply. Then, Segwit allows for off-chain solutions, making transaction effectively free. Anyone trying to block SegWit in an enemy to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 01:02:08
The advantage is that you can buy in CAD$. They have several funding options, including Interact from your bank account. If you buy from a US exchange, you need to wire US dollars - which can get tricky.

The transaction was broadcast, so it's I the system. But the miners fee is low at 101 sat/byte. It should be twice that amount. The transaction will likely confirm eventually, but it might take another 24 to 48 hours. If it doesn't get confirmed after 3 days, your bitcoin will be returned to the wallet used to send the bitcoin.

The previous block (463468) was mined at 18:00:33. The block in your link (463469) was mined 1 second later at 18:00:34. Basically, there was insufficient time to grab transaction from the mempool to be included in the block.
This emphasizes the importance of keeping blocks at a reasonable size because if blocks are allowed to be 8MB (for example), they will take too long to propagate through the bitcoin network, thus causing a delay with the next block. This will cause the next block to also be empty in many cases.

Yes, after 2020, you will earn half the amount of Bitcoin by mining a block, but the logic is that the decreased supply of Bitcoin, while combined with the increasing demand will cause the price to increase. In other words, after 2020, finding a block will only result in 6.25 bitcoins, but those bitcoins will be worth (in $ value) far more then 12.5 bitcoins today.

That's not how it works. More mining power means the blocks will get mined faster until the next difficulty adjustment. At that point, blocks are once again found every 10 mins (on average). Bottom line is that the current capacity of the on-chain system is the number of transactions that will fit in 6 blocks per hour.

@_date: 2017-10-07 11:43:49
Yes, if 51% of the mining power colluded to change the consensus rules, they could do whatever they want. But such a move would cause the Bitcoin price to crash. So there is no point in quadrupling the block reward if the value of those bitcoins is only a fraction of their original value. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:35:25

Transactions are included in every Bitcoin block mined every 10 minutes (on average). The fee is included as very incentive for the miner to include YOUR transaction in the next block. You can send transactions without adding a fee, but you will need to wait for your transaction to go through (get confirmed) because those who include fees get priority. 
Basically, fees are designed to incentive miners. That's a good thing.

Well, we agree there, because the current network infrastructure cannot support larger blocks. If we increase to 8 MB (for example), the average person (like me) would no longer be able to run a node, this causing centralization of the network.

@_date: 2017-05-25 02:00:24
It's hard to determine resistance levels when you're at an all time high. I believe bitcoin will go to $100,000 by 2024. And $1,000,000 by 2028.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:54:51
depends how fast you want it confirmed. Right now, if you want it in the next block, it's 270 sat/byte.  don't worry, after Segwit is adopted, fees will come down drastically.

Do you understand what "pruning mode" means? It's not a problem with storage size. I would not care of the blockchain was 1000 terabytes. The problem is block validation and propagation through the network. By the time an 8 MB block made its way through 51% of the network, a couple of other blocks would have been mined. If it backs up too much, the whole system will collapse. 
Claiming that bitcoin scaling is solved with a simple block size increase is the same as saying you can solve global warming by leaving your refrigerator door open to let cold air in the atmosphere. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:51:15

1. Bitmain backs what's best for bitmain, not what's best for the ecosystem. At present, this seems to be segwit2x. 
2. Hard to say. It's not a matter of who wins because anyone can fork at anytime. I could take a copy of the blockchain and start my own version of bitcoin today, but that would make it an altcoin. But UASF seems to have good support, so it Segwit will be activated on August 1st. We just don't know yet if the chain will split.
3. Yes, big difference. UASF simply implements Segwit without a block size increase. It's a softfork and would have bitcoin running on the same high quality code written by Core since the beginning. Segwit2x code was hastily written and could only be considered as "beta" at best. 
4. Bitmain relies on covert ASICBOOST to maximize profits. When Segwit/UASF is activated, ASICBOOST is no longer possible, so they are hoping that a segwit2x (or a future version of it) will allow them to have a mining advantage over everyone else.

I think you need to do more research on how bitcoin can be a store of value, like gold had traditionally been. Being a store of value, bitcoin is VERY much undervalued today. The recent price increase is recognition of bitcoin's long term potential to replace gold as a store of value.

I think you're asking about wallets - which store your bitcoins (or more specifically, they store your bitcoin keys). If you own a large quality of bitcoin, you want a hardware wallet like a Trezor. For smaller amounts, a mobile wallet is fine (Breadwallet is good for iOS). 
Most important; during setup, you will be provided with a 12 word seed. Write it down and keep it in a safe place. You can restore your wallet on another device should the need arise.

In order to mine bitcoin, you need to connect to a pool. The pool will send you your bitcoin after you have mined a minimum amount. They send it to the address you provide them. But with a PC, you will never reach the minimum amount. You will get zero.

Trying to restore your seed on another wallet platform is worth a try. Breadwallet does not use BIP44 like most other HD wallets so trying to recover in Mycelium (for example) won't work. I believe that Multibit is compliant with BIP39 (standard used by Breadwallet).

Spend some time understanding this website  The fees for a transaction have nothing to do with the amount of bitcoin being sent. It's the size (in bytes) of the transaction that matters. What affects the size? It's the number of inputs. For example, if you received 0.25 bitcoin to an address on 4 separate occasions (for a total of 1 bitcoin) then that address has 4 inputs. Now if you want to send that 1.0 bitcoin to someone, the transaction will be more expensive since the 4 inputs will result in a larger size in bytes.

sir, you are correct. that's what I believe.

you can't mine bitcoin on a PC. You need an ASIC miner.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:22:39
Nothing to see. Just normal price fluctuations.

BCC does not exist. If/when it does, I assure you that it won't have equivalent worth of BTC. At best, it will hold 5% of BTC's value. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:39:06
There is simply too much going on to answer a vague question like this. Just buy the bitcoin and  ignore the fud. There will be no spilt. The concern over coinbase is the same for all exchanges. You should not leave coins on any exchange whereby you don't control the private keys. If you have specific questions, post them and you will get an answer. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:35:25
You can't mine bitcoin with a GPU. You need an ASIC miner.
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:50:41
No, if Bitcoin increases in value, then that does not increase the value of your siacoin. The website is just showing you the equivalent value in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:56:22
Segwit kills ASICBOOST. However, remember that Segwit2x is a different implementation than bitcoin core. On a consensus basis, future changes can be made to accommodate anything, including block rejections unless they were mined with Bitmain hardware (for example).

Check out r/keepkey you can leave your coins in the keepkey. Both devices are BIP 44 compliant, do you can restore your keepkey account onto the trezor with your 12 word seed. No need to "transfer" the coins at all.

Good riddance Mr. Ver.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:27:22


Go spend some time at rbtc and let me know whether you have any unresolved questions whether they are "nuts"?
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:53:31
It means that bitcoin.com is no longer supporting BIP91, so their lack of support will probably prevent (in the short term) BIP91 from locking in despite overwhelming support from most other miners. When it appeared BIP91 was likely to succeed, the price spiked. When Segwit activated on Litecoin, the price increased by 10x. 
It's almost like Roger Ver and Bitcoin.com are trying to suppress bitcoin's growth.

You don't want to store the blockchain on your SD card since it will eventually fail. Also, you would need an expensive 256GB card. You should store the blockchain on an external HD connected to the Pi. 
After downloading the entire blockchain, connect the external hard drive to your PC and make periodic backups. That way, if something gets corrupted, you don't need to fully start over.

Simple, get a hardware wallet.

I agree. I'm planning to start a new car company and will call it "Mercedes Cash". The cars will look like a Mercedes except they will have bigger block engines. Then in planning to sell them using the Mercedes logo hoping that the average consumer won't understand that these are counterfeit.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:33:08
Segwit please. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:29:34
That's crazy talk. It will be about 24 months. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Sorry, we are not doing your homework for you.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:50:43
Yes, the recovery process works, it just takes time. Many people have posted here saying that the process worked for them. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:48:17
All time low? Like $0.01?
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:43:09
Search this subreddit, the question had been answered a hundred times. You're probably safe, but the best security is ALWAYS a hardware wallet regardless of the August 1st event.

Sorry, rule  of this sub. No begging allowed. Congratulations and welcome nonetheless.

No. When the block reward drops to 6.25, then 3.125, and keeps dropping, it's the mining fees that will be the bulk of the reward.

You could have the most powerful laptop in the world, even running at 100%, exposing your computer to heat damage, you will earn less than $0.01 per month. It's a complete waste of time.

simply signalling for UASF does nothing. You must install a version of the Core client that is UASF enabled. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:43:24
Telling anyone to store their bitcoin on an online wallet is bad advice, even for new users. There is nothing complicated with a hardware wallet.

You should only invest if you're willing to endure lots of volatility. Buy and hold. Who cares if the price drops by 50% overnight, provided that it recovers (which it's done every time). See here:

Of course they won't. Why would a full fledged mining pool waste their hashing power on a shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:21:18
Good point, thanks. Done.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:09:06
If I look back the MANY times I considered selling after a drop in price, history does it would have been a mistake. When I bought, I decided that I would hold until 2020, regardless of what happens. Just ride it out. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:03:54
Both. But the long term trend is growth.

What gives gold value? If you answer that question correctly, you will have explained the primary (but not sole) reason that bitcoin has value.

No, Breadwallet will generate a new address. If you have mined bitcoin to another address/wallet, you will need to transfer the bitcoin to your new Breadwallet.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:52:49
Does the address start with a 1 or 3? If it's 3, there is a chance that your multibit wallet does not recognize P2SH addresses.

Segwit please. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:50:01
Segwit2x includes all the benefits of Segwit but also includes a hard fork to 2MB blocks. All hard forks involve risk. In this case, the benefit does not outweigh the risk.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:44:25
Correct, and the prevailing price for BCC will be $0.

Yes, over at r/BTC, they are anti-bitcoin, so you can obtain an abundance of scepticism over there.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:31:47
Assuming you are wrong and that bitcoin assumes the role of some kind of global currency (with our without the support of key nations), what is the possible impact on traditional financial markets? What are the chances that bitcoin will have enough of a disruptive effect and trigger a correction in equity markets?
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:17:56
Agreed on the fees at cavirtex. For a buyer, cavirtex is still a better deal since on most days BTC is trading for ~5% more at VofS, and then you need to factor the CAD to USD exchange. At this very moment, I can but BTC for $910CAD on cavirtex, while it's $955USD ($1011 CAD) on VofS. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:22:31
re: Coinbase. I have purchased twice from them and the transaction went smoothly. Once your bank verification is complete, I would not hesitate to purchase simply because a few people are having problems.
