Weak hands for sure

I definitely don't think the instability is a good thing but of course it's going to be unstable as mass adoption is taking effect, that's to be expected. It'll level out eventually, transactions will be fixed, some people have little faith on this sub and think this bubble is about to pop tomorrow when in reality I believe it's an S curve and we're years from the top.

We've got a ton of kids investing right now that threw their extra $200 bucks they had laying around into it at 10k... This is very much the mentality, if they're not rich by next week they'll all sell out.

This guy gets it. That's why we call the noobies weak. Some aren't but alot are and leave right after getting into it. People realize it's not the magic money tree they've been reading about and get scared.

All these people here taking the bait...
The joke
Commenters heads

Amazing point. All these people against HODL aren't real believers in Crypto or adopters of the technology, they just want to take money quick riding the crypto wave and get salty when it's not working for them.

If you think crypto has peaked right now you're sadly mistaken. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:50:23
Because problems with a new technology are impossible to solve. /s

If I was insecure I'd be thinking about selling out if we keep trending down like the rest of the weak hands. I'm saying I'm holding no matter what and I'm long on crypto, if anything that means I'm more set in my investment than these day traders. I'm also not delusional, I realize every cent I've spent can disappear and that doesn't bug me.

The way me and my friend look at it is that the technology wouldn't have taken off unless people spent their coins and traded them, not everyone couldve just held them and the majority of people didn't. You can lookup the stats on the amount of BTC in most people's wallets, it's not even close to 1 BTC.

You seem to be the only one here who understands how the federal reserve works with banks.. Can't have an IOU if there's no new bitcoin being generated, it doesn't work.

There's this magical thing called technical analysis, you should look into it 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:37:44
Boy you're probably 15 and own 0.01 btc that you think will make you rich. That's probably why you've got all this free time you talk about to watch a 1 hour video in the middle of the day. I've been trading btc since 2014 lol so don't tell me about holding btc 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:01:35
I actually don't watch any TV, not to be a contrarian. I see your point though, instead of a couple games of PUBG I could skim the video but I just don't think I'd get any valuable info by skimming it, I'm sure if anything significant happens the news would be on here and summarized within an hour.

Looking at a depth chart will definitely tell you where support levels are and where you can expect a rebound. Definitely not random, I base all my trades on it and I'm still up 700% at this moment 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:31:42
Wow, much smart, so trader. Nobody cares what you do dude, that's really fuckin nice you have the LUXURY of doing crypto full time but most of us have jobs and other fish to fry on top of trying to trade so not watching an hour long video is very understandable. You sound like a sorry ass neckbeard judging by all your comments 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:15:37
I have lol. Don't act like everyone in this subreddit isn't a seasoned trader. I've manged 30% over the course of 3months in the real stock market which is impressive compared to most people's returns but I'm no guru. I'm just defending technical analysis, don't under estimate the information it can provide in a market. especially in a free trade environment such as bitcoin and cryptos in general
