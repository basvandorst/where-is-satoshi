PCs and videocards are no longer suitable for bitcoin mining. You need specialized ASICs like this  
What was your hashrate on home PC?

Can't completely agree with you. Yeah block difficulty is a b*tch but if bitcoin price growth faster than your profit drops you can make some money. I've invested about $100 in bitcoin mining at genesis last summer (contract price at fee were higher than now). Bitcoin price was about $600 at that moment. I've reached ROI this April. And I still receive payouts. As a proof check my video on Youtube  I show my contract at 9:20.
