Look at it from the mods' point of view. If someone came in your subreddit posting what you considered to be spam or inappropriate, you would stop that person coming to your subreddit, right? 
Shit analogy, but let's say someone is giving out free stickers about BMW cars or something in your unrelated subreddit about photography and you banned them. Seeing a bunch of other users arrive to post a load more free stickers in retaliation would just piss you off even more and certainly not change your mind in their favour.

How is this more intuitive than $1.00 = 2.26mBTC? Honest question, I don't get the recent obsession with trying to make everyone use 'bits'.

But if they see it as bitcoin advertising spam, then they have every right to get rid of it.

I don't understand the analogy, 'normal' people have been working with SI units and decimal places trouble free for years.

Snarky remarks aren't exactly going to get people on board with the whole bitcoin thing. If you are going to tip in other subreddits, at least add something useful to your comment rather than just throwing money around with no real contribution to the discussion, people may see it as spam bitcoin advertising otherwise.

Yeah keep spamming the sub with tips, that will make them change their minds. /s
People already have shitty opinions of this subreddit without this childish 'stick it to the man' attitude. Respect their rules. If you disagree with the banning of tippers, message a mod and have a civil conversation about it.

What is this thing with posts that are essentially bragging about how much money you have? If someone posted a screenshot of their fiat bank balance you wouldn't up vote it and congratulate them. Anyway, keep at it. At least I now know which users have an amount that is worth trying to steal.

Well, no it would not be OK and I would fight the ban because frankly, there is no way my comment could be construed as spam, an advertisement or rule breaking in any other way. I'm not saying don't question the mods, people just need to see things from their perspective from time to time.

Thanks, but I always thought it was a bit on the small side myself.

What is your point?

Misinformation is misinformation there are no two ways about it. It doesn't matter if another subreddit doesn't think it is. It is.


*noun*  
False or inaccurate information, especially that which is deliberately intended to deceive
Trolling is trolling, in the same way.


*verb*  
Make a deliberately offensive or provocative online post with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them

Please continue to ELI5, why the heck are they allowed to just take money off you without probable cause? What is the limit to how much you can carry? Is that how it works, a legal limit to how much cash you can have on you at one time? Wat? People are okay with this? Wat?

Outside of the US, everyone says it correctly. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:19:28
There is no proof. There was no spam attack.

Fuck you for wishing that anyone should OD.
