I know this guy. He's 100% legit. Head of digital assets at VanEck. He also contributes frequently to a Telegram group I manage.

Still very low.  We spiked on the break from 340\-150 but not by much.

Wall Street has been quietly trading btc for some time. CME and CBOE wouldn't have created bitcoin futures and launched them last year if their bank customers hadn't asked them to.

What do you see that adds support at 9000?  I understand big round numbers are natural support / resistance but outside of some old highs on the hourly chart that came in around 9k I don't see other support.

It'll have significant impact, for sure. I was particularly interested in the traders talking towards the end. They're all in on bitcoin futures vs. spot. No worry about wallet and general security.

Pretty much. There's been a steady narrative about the impact of ETF investing on gold and how that same valuation boost could happen to btc.

Be careful out there...

What he's really showing is a combination of disinterest and fear. I think Bill and Warren both hope this thing just goes away. They know they're behind the curve and hope that doesn't bite them.

Totally agree. Pretty sure this will drive much of what we see in the coming months. Disappointed we didn't hear much about regulatory direction at consensus.

Sounds more like a hedge fund manager talking his book.

It'd be difficult to set that up...what'd they do convince others to sell?  I think the big money is staying particularly quite in an effort to spook the market.  Volume has dried up and weak hands are nervous. Investors expected a big rally of Consensus2018 and didn't get it. The "smart" money knows they longer they stay away the more the weak hands will bail out and take the market lower where they can scoop it up in a fire sale.  This is 100&amp; theory and I have nothing to back it up.  Simply what my gut is telling me.

Just under 16k now.

Ha!  Yeah...spoofing is expensive. Just ask Navinder Sarao.

The exchanges are working hard towards offering a broader list of crypto in the futures space. Smaller denoms and different underlying coins.

Throw a flag.  That's a fowl.

It’s physically bigger than the the traditional ATM. Is that making a statement or what?

I wouldn't go that far but you can bet they've already lobbied hard in Washington and are quite sure they have the numbers to win approval of they're going through the filing process.

Sure but the security and cumbersome process of safely storing keys is technological problem and many, many players are working to solve this. It won’t be an issue for long.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:51:16
Sounds like an unnecessary layer.  Unless they're offering some level of uber security for your digital assets I haven't a clue how they can market their offering...whatever that is.

Why isn't it solved with something as simple as a fingerprint or facial recognition?
