this is the 3rd time this exact thing happened, which means they've accepted it and banned it again 3 times now

I think roger ver might be here guys...
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:14:58
Where are ppl getting these times from.. it’s based out of Chicago and I’ve only seen 4-6 PM ET or CT 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:10:27
Why is it 4 pm London time? Isn’t it out of Chicago 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:28:08
Thanks god you posted this, I felt like I was in a ghost town surrounded by bots going through those threads
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:53:27
Did you use coinbase to deposit to a poker site or something similar?
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:20:56
Doug Polk is just what crypto needs.  A lot of people probably don't know who this guy is or why he has so many subscribers already.  Doug has been one of the most active and friendly people in the poker community for 10+ years, and became one of the most successful and probably the best heads up NLH players.  That takes an incredible amount of work and dedication to poker and game theory these days.
Like crypto, poker has some shady people and ignorant people spreading false information.  Doug is one of the few in the poker world who has stayed honest and kept doing the work to improve over the years.  
He isn't just another person trying to promote himself and his sites for a quick buck.  He's someone I can trust to stay honest, unbiased and admit his own mistakes while putting in the work.  
He's also pretty entertaining

Your post history is atrocious. One big contradiction
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:29:48
Why are u so obsessed with posting fud and telling everyone the sky is falling everytime btc price falls? That’s literally your only contribution to this sub.
What is your motive?
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:41:17
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:36:46
Are you assuming that these people don't already have bitcoin?  There's a clear connection from the futures announcement and price
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:25:17
Great rebuttal. I’m sure the crash on the 17th, the price jump on the 2 futures announcement dates, and the ATH on the first futures open date was just a crazy coincidence. No causation I guess, just really random spikes that correlate perfectly with a specific entity, how strange.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:09:07
member net neutrality?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:57
Well those orders have also been hit all week... so idk your point?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:04:44
You think there won't be tons buy orders on the way down?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:04:26
Do people send btc to sob stories out of pity? This is the 3rd one I’ve seen today and they all end in don’t feel bad for me, I won’t accept donation, etc. weak bs.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:49:47
Are you saying the 90% crash was just a correction that had nothing to do with mt. gox/silk road?
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:26:18
What does being American have to do with anything? You shouldn't put everything you have into a single investment
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:41:15
It peaked right around the time futures opened.... It's def possible that it's entirely connected.  Look at the dates of when futures was announced, when it opened, and it's first close.. today.  Now compare those dates to btc prices.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:23:23
You're so right, I thought I was alone in here... holy shit what is happening this article doesn't even make sense
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:58:36
The last few articles I’ve read from this site seem like they’re written by 12 year olds. I can’t take it serious anymore 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:04:24
thats an old photo
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:41:35
Why the hell would there be sell orders below the actual price?
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:53:18
Who said?!?! u can't just say u copy pasted without any source info
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:07:22
I’ll ask again, wtf is your motive?? Why are u even here?
Your post history is toxic with no reason
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:28:00
Please keep selling! it keeps the price nice and low for us who are buying!
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:33:06
No? Wat
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:39:12
It's back over 10k!!! recycle those 10k memes again boys
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:37:38
Yes hindsight is 20/20 thanks
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:04:20
Lol because alt coins do so well when btc suffers?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:27:07
They haven't stole your money... It's still there and you know it's still there.
You should always verify your account before depositing any amount to an exchange. I'm sure you can figure out where the problem is and verify your account.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:21:57
I see a lot of posts like this... do people just not understand how market caps and price work???  Less than 1% of the market is not going to make a significant change like you're saying.  Also, double digits? LOL cmon bruh I'm going to guess you come from the bcash community
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:11:39
Idk if most ppl don’t understand how the price works or people really want to generate fud here.. How can this be taken serious
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:15:47
Let me get this straight... You're saying that if 3b gets sold at once, the entire market is going to sell like they've never seen a 1-2% drop in price before?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:11:55
Are you lost?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:32:19
I'm so confused, there's so many posts like this right now with absolutely no explanation.... Fuck up because it looked like insider trading? (I can understand that)
Or they fucked up just because they added a coin this community hates?
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:51:43
It’s better than r/btc which should be called bcash
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:17:57
OK please explain how someone selling 1% of the market would cause the price to crash to double digits then... Because that looks a lot like the dumb fud I see over there
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:41:39
I don't think people understand what lost means
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:03:19
Can someone explain to me why Roger Ver/BCH would want bitcoin to fail? It seems greedy as hell to me, if bitcoin tanks and fails it would be bad for all crypto
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:03:39
bitcoin deserves better than your shitty recycled memes
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:20:50
How is that what you took from his message?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:26:52
I'm a little confused why you think the price would tank, I could see an exchange or 2 if they used an exchange.  But isn't the price determined by market cap/supply?  
$3b is a lot but it's just 1% of the market
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:47:09
I think you missed the point
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:14:12
We need a good $200 billion market cap meme instead imo
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:14:02
What correction? Are we talking about something from a month ago?
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:35:00
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:58:43
Can't wait to hear back from you after the next rise/fall to say the same exact thing.  ahh u missed your chance for the 3rd time? Better wait till the MESS is over again
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:13:50
I don’t think that’s the purpose of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:56:23
Betcoin isn’t even around anymore is it?
Is this an article from February 2017?? Why are u even posting this
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:24:23
Why would holders sell at 6500 instead of now??? I think u missed the point entirely on what hodl means.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:26:02
Hahahah what a surprise, another salty fuckboi who got out too soon
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:30:38
I mean... bitcoin was also trading at $24k on bithumb when it was $16k here and on the way down.  I don't think there's any correlation to be made, other than Korean exchanges always has a premium
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:21:20
Made a new account just to get out all your frustrations, or just want to tell everyone the sky is falling? Whats wrong buddy
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:41:43
It did, and it didn’t hit 750. That’s the fucking point, gl with your “timing the market” it’s so ez to locate and buy the floors, ty for your expertise
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:39:25
People here are just so freaking dumb I can’t take it anymore
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:19:46
This is why.

Redditor for 0 hours. Seems like a legit first post lul
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:11:04
What? They sold it immediately... The first story was speculating that he just kept every bitcoin from the sales, which they had no proof for.  Pretty stupid story overall TMZ grasps at straws to fit in

U mean rich?

@_date: 2018-04-15 17:12:41
I’m not arguing against bitcoins longevity or anything.. it’s just funny how this same meme is used everytime, and shows the mindset of people 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:03:18
this meme has been posted and made front page every little 2% jump since the downfall from 17k
