Have you heard about fundamental analysis?

I think people who invested reasonable amount of money, i.e. money they fully can afford to lose don't have any problem today. There is simply no need to minimalize loss and sell during such moments as now if you truly don't need this money.
I can't think of more aggressive and dangerous investment as cryptocurrencies, so since planned profit is extremely high, so is acceptable lose.

It's really simple, binary matter. You either are prepared to lose this money or you are not. If you are nervous now, then you are not prepared to lose it and perhaps you should consider to retract them. There is solid possibility that it will went down way below 400$ and that it may never bounce back. 
Let's not lie to ourselves, this is a casino. Would you spent this money in real casino?

Different situation. First of all, I'm not inside burning house. Second, I can afford to lose burning house. Third, I want to take this risk and see if I can sell land without this house for more money then it was worth recently.

I know technical analysis, otherwise I wouldn't have opinion on it. 
I'll reply with counter question. You too don't need to answer it, it's for yourself. Has technical analysis gave you noticeable increase in profits? Or was it just fueling your beliefs with random outcome?

It's a myth. You can't predict market behavior basing only on history of asset price/volume/etc.

This is exactly what I wrote. Please understand what you read before answering.

There are many types of investments, ranging from extremely safe to extremely risky. Usually the more risky ones are far more profitable. Since possible profits in cryptocurrencies are crazy high, so should be acceptable loss threshold crazy high.

He cares, I too, now answer that.

Change your bank or country.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:08:14
Damn, you're funny! :)
Also, for your information, maybe you have such weird banking system in USA or wherever you live, but in Poland I own I can freely create and move my funds between subaccounts.

And you pay with them for everything you do? Bills, everyday shopping, games, pub nights with friends, etc., etc.?

Yeeah, yet another avoiding answer.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:39:13
Strange, your post still doesn't contain any numbers.

No, it has value because other people _are actually using it for buying things_. They don't hoard it to earn more, like most of Bitcoin owners.

Yeah, it was, because they got nothing in return. Before they had money for lets say opening business and after they had no. Americans on the other way first could start business paying with gold and after they could start it with dollars they got.

Why "compensate"? Just compensate. It's not "few pieces of paper", it's legal currency generally accepted and usable in place of gold in every single shop in US.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:12:12


Forfeiture? It was forced exchange of one asset to another. You try to paint "fiat currency" as something bad and evil and gold as an valuable and good "asset".

Don't play fool, this is exactly what you are doing.
