Banks used to have to pay people interest for borrowing their money. Now they can just make new money digitally. They're current'y up to 20 trillion dollars that they created out of thin air. Don't worry, the kids will pay it back. It's a system of IFU's

Money and power do weird things to otherwise decent people. We know that. He wants to win. Winning drives him. He's a meat computer. Money and power do weird things to otherwise decent meat computers.

This was kind of a shitpost. What I'm trying to say is, the more people that use bitcoin to secure their savings (hodlers) the less btc will be available for nefarious actors to pull off 25k+ btc pump and dumps. 
The best part of this whole thing is we're living history day by day. This technology will change the entire way our species behaves in society. We have to be open to it. 
So glad to be living through the digital revolution!

I do too. And I understand that there are risks involved. Making tx's smaller is still a better solution.

Why over complicate it with so many nodes this time. Only needs a few nodes to run cheaply. Also, I don't need a bunch of people arguing about updating the code. Just fucking do what you think is best.

Time for a hardfork.

Fucking meat computers spamming up the system

but a comment on r/btc  said that bitcoin cash is going to be worth $5000 by the end of the month. So, I'm going to wait and see.

Yea, a bunch of people buy and then the price goes way way up. Then the people who bought, they don't sell. So the price stays way up. Then some people sell for profit and when they do, they spread uncertainty so the other people sell. Then the people who profited, they buy low. I think the next big crash is coming at 20k. It's gonna crash all the way down to 15-16k. Imagine losing 5k in a day. Man. Better just to keep fiat. It's never going to crash that much in a day. Just slowly crashing over time. 
If bitcoin goes to a million, it could even crash 20k in a day. Better to keep fiat.

Note: Only using one arm and hasn't transformed to Super Saiyan. 
"The Super Saiyan form multiplies the Saiyan's power level by 50x times its normal amount.[32] In an interview, Akira Toriyama noted that since Super Saiyan 2 and Super Saiyan 3 are simply powered up Super Saiyans, completely mastering the normal state and the Super Saiyan form would lead Super Saiyan being stronger than Super Saiyan 2 and Super Saiyan 3,[33] thus presumably giving the hypothetical fully mastered Super Saiyan a multiplier of over 400x base."
