And it's on the front page again because it deserve more visibility, and should be stickied. 
You're fast at checking every single new post to see if it's a repost of this particular dev mailing list post.   You must be very butthurt that Mike Hearn is losing the debate, and doing your best to downvote this 'repost'.  It's strange that someone would do that... unless maybe you're Mike's throwaway account?
Very sad.....
Tell you what though, you seem to have lots of fun pointing out this particular repost,  so I'll keep reposting this with lost of throwaway accounts via many vpns.   I'll do it every 2-3 hours, so you can find lots throughout the day.  It will be lots of fun.   Hope to see you soon,  Don't miss any.

Not surprised that another Mike Hearn idea turns out to be ineffective and poorly thought out.
Good thing he will fail in his attemps to destroy Bitcoin with his hard fork Bitcoin XT attempt, and his threats to unilaterally remove all core devs from github access

You're wrong.  We had 100k+ nodes, now 6000.  
The network is becoming less decentralized. 
Bigger blocks will make this worse.  Its very simple.

No, Maxwell has it right.  You're wrong.

Mike's Repsonse to Adam's descruction post was like someone who'd been blindsided.  
Mike is finally realising how bad him and Gaving look with their antics.
Don't worry, this will be reposted a few more times.

@_date: 2015-06-18 07:20:50
For sure! Add this one to the repost I'm about to make in 2-3 hours.
It will be a great fun time!! Make sure to gather all the links about all the posts that everyone is making about how destructive Mike Hearn is being that are all being upvoted to the front page.
If you grow tired of it, you can complain to the mods that so many posts about Mike Hearn ruining Bitcoin are making it to the front page and that you think it's better to silence the subreddit and we should ban the posts instead even though they're being upvoted.
Maybe some mods are on Mike Hearn's side and they will help you ban the posts.
Or maybe not, and we'll do some more throwaway reposts about Mike Hearn destructively forking Bitcoin and telling Gavin to delete github access for all the core devs so they can take over bitcoin all for themselves.
But Maybe the mods want to help Gavin and Mike fork Bitcoin and so they'll stifle debate and delete posts that are being upvoted.
We'll see. Fun times!!

Nope.  Hearn was destroyed by Back.  Just a fact.

The drama was caused by Mike Hearn trying to take over bitcoin.
Mike hearn is acting like a psychopathic egomaniac. 
Enjoy your downvotes moron

You realize you're trying to tell the people who wrote the actual Bitcoin code how the network works.
You simply don't have the technical understanding required to be part of this debate.  Sorry.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:16:51
100% Agree.  Mike Hearn is an egomaniacal maniac who doesn't take the safety of the network seriously.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:33:56
This is it.
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:48:52
Wow.  Adam Back does a very good job of outlining why Mike Hearn is acting on emotion and guesswork rather then careful, thought out, data-driven consensus.
No matter what you think about the 1MB debate, Mike Hearn should not be threatening hard forks, threatening to sabotage the github account and revoke git access from all the other devs.  He is ruining Bitcoin's reputation and any respect anyone may have had with him with his behavior
It's also incredibly dangerous and inexcusable that he told Gavin to delete commit access to all the other core developer on github, so he can force his patch through. (  )
@_date: 2015-06-22 09:59:08
Oh really?  Tell me which modern processor can validate 8GB worth of tx's inside 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:03:06
Fully agree.  His current behavior comes off as ego-driven, anti-social, and  narcissistic...
Gavin has backed down slightly from his unhelpful rhetoric, but Mike seems to be going full steam ahead... It's going to turn out badly for him.  He's already lost most respect from people who matter.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:03:11
No. fees are required to stop spam tx's

@_date: 2015-06-17 12:44:37
Mike Hearn has lost this debate.   He's overly emotional and doesn't make data based arguments. 
"Which is why there will soon be a fork that does it."  Against the consensus of the other developers?   He's actively jeopardizing the network.
 Adam Back's last email to him was the nail in the coffin.  He has lost all respect among core devs,  only the non-technical reddit hiveming would possibly think his proposal is a good thing.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:25:27
Then don't recommend it to them.
The bitcoin blockchain isn't a payment system, it's a settlement system.   Idiot.
@_date: 2015-06-22 10:00:01
Sorry to tell you all, but simply increasing the Block size does not fix the problem.
Credit card companies process a growing number of transactions, currently more than 10,000 per second. In contrast, Bitcoin currently handles about one transaction per second, with 7tps max at 1MB. Bitcoin’s turnover is growing, and ultimately Bitcoin may become a viable payment alternative. However, can Bitcoin scale to match the throughput of credit cards, or even an envisioned world of millions of micropay- ments per second?
The answer to this question is astonishingly negative. In order to verify whether a new transaction is valid, and in order to bootstrap new peers, every peer in the Bitcoin network stores every transaction ever. The size of an average transaction is 500 bytes, so with 1 transaction per second, every Bitcoin peer now needs almost 20 GB of additional storage each year. A turnover of 500 transactions per second would require 10 TB of additional disk space per year, which is at the limit for a consumer.
A bigger problem is processing power. Checking the signatures of each transaction (mostly because of disk seek time) takes about 5 ms, so with current machines we cannot hope to scale beyond 200 transactions per second. Every node in the bitcoin network is informed about every transaction, multiple times because of the fault-tolerant gossip process. Assuming a common end-user bandwidth of 10 Mbit/s, then the rate peers can receive transactions is limited to approximately 1,000 transactions per second. Finally, while peers may individually be able to receive and process up to 200 transactions per second, the synchronization mechanism underlying Bitcoin is susceptible to latency, and does not work with transaction rates above 100 transactions per second.
*Just* increasing the block size does NOT SOLVE scalability problem and never will. Bitcoin in its current form will have a hard time scaling beyond 100 transactions per second, because of storage, processing, latency, and bandwidth. Bitcoin as a global payment system will NEVER happen on-chain. Only with offchain solutions like lightning network.
Increasing the blocksize to absurd amounts will only cause the centralization of Bitcoin.

Yeah, you don't understand.  The concern is someone hacking the pool servers which are actually finding blocks, nobody cares about the end-owners of the hardware on the pool.

What's so good about this?
3 pools make up 51% of the network.  An attacker has to only have 3 servers to take down Bitcoin.
Doesn't look good to me.
@_date: 2015-06-20 01:00:20
THIS!!!  How do people not understand that Bitcoin is a fee-based settlement system? tx's will take a long time if the fee you pay is too low.   If you pay a higher fee, it will be included in the next block created by a rational miner (all else equal).
And this is exactly the way it should be if we want to keep bitcoin decentralized.  block sizes should only be adjusted upwards to keep enough space for fees around 2-5 cents USD to process any tx in next block

There are 170,000 subscribers in this sub. Maybe 1000 of them are programmers, maximum.  Out of those 1000, only 100 people actually understand the concerns you've raised.
This subreddit is full of n00bs and crack hears who used Bitcoin to buy drugs on silk road.    They think bigger blocks = higher bitcoin price.  That's basically what's driving the Mike &amp; Gavin circle-jerk.  Uninformed morons.

Gavins response to this ignores the case where an attacker purposely creating UTXO spam.
This is actually a great idea.  If you are trying to send less then 1 penny somewhere, don't do it on the blockchain unless you're willing to pay a fee.  Use micropayment channels instead

They are either (i) doing a better job of convincing non-technical and naive people that XT is a good idea.  or (ii) there are paid shills all over this place.

Mike and Gavin are looking terrible here.  The development consensus is against them, but they've been successful in convincing non-technical naive users that running a Bitcoin XT node is a good idea.  The mining pools have all said they won't run XT.
