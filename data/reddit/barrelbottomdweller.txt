Yes, and we all know that words are never inadvertently misused, especially in the internet.

Satoshi’s whitepaper was released in 2008, so this mention, which uses “created” in the past tense, predates that by a year or two. Bitcoin was still a nascent uncoded idea in 2007, let alone 2006, so the timeline doesn’t quite fit. 
A “new form of internet money” could refer to anything from Stripe to PayPal to gift cards to World of Warcraft coins. It’s also a bit odd that the inventor of Bitcoin, who went through significant pains to obscure his identity, would have that shared as casual offhand knowledge among his rowing team. 
Not saying not to follow it up if you so desire, but there are many other possibilities other than “it’s definitely Satoshi”.

The book publication predates the Bitcoin white paper by almost two months, and the Bitcoin genesis block by 4 months, so the writing/research on it would have predated Bitcoin by longer - years, perhaps. It remained a virtually unknown crypto project for years - the first $-&gt;BTC transaction (the infamous 10000 BTC pizza) wasn’t until late May 2010. 
It’s a tantalizing mention, but the timing is backwards - so unless Satoshi discussed in detail his then-vaporware project with his rowing team, then it’s probably about some failed mid-2000’s online currency, of which there were many.

That's my gut too. Depending on how sustained the Chinese exodus is, a 5x run wouldn't shock me, and neither would a crash back to 800. I do think the floor is significantly higher now than in 2013.

Just the general feel reminds me of hitting $100, not $1000. The run-up to 1000 was pure bubble insanity - even a newbie could see that it was straining - like a translucent balloon ready to pop. The exchanges weren't mature or stable enough to handle the load or liquidity, the best mining rigs were ghetto garage setups, ASIC hardware was still vaporware, and the hype was ridiculous. 
As excited as some people are here, its a cemetery compared to the run up to the big crash.
