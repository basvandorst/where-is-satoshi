Not on Coinbase :)
It’s like watching paint dry.

Why is the return better for a smaller investment?

I’ve struggled to make sense of your poor grammar but as far as I can tell you are calling me (a millionaire - and that’s sterling not wimpy dollars) a fucking moron simply because I’m more experienced with companies limited by shares whereby you cannot buy in fractions.

Sign up to Coinbase.
US based, so as regulated and as ‘safe’ as you will get.
It will take time to get your funds so act now.

Watching. Paint. Dry.

Not this again

It would be a shrewd marketing move.
It won’t work unless the mining fee scales appropriately.

Just discussing. Asserting someone is crazy is the fastest way to lose interest in your case.

You are a person and you’re opinion of Bitcoin is as valid as anyone’s. Bitcoin was created for the you’s of the world.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:47:20
How many bitcoins so you think I’d have to buy Just to break the $10k mark? I’m game.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:35:18
This doesn’t make any sense.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:10:38
I think you may have your wires crossed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:07:32
Sign up to Coinbase

It only recently occurred to me that was the case. Had I have know I would have bought years ago.

There are so many things you don’t understand. You should listen more. You might learn something.
Waahhh a 17 year old tweep swore at me I’m going to cry in my champagne bath.

The last on won’t reach the destination.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:10:53
And the mining fees comment?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:16:34
So close, yet so far..
