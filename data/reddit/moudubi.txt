As a german I would really like to hear (or read) how it works to use only bitcoins. I imagine it difficult and think this might be worth an extra post, full with funny and not-so-funny experiences. For the non-germans here, germans like their god old cash, they pay a lot with cash in everyday life and this preference is only slowly decreasing. You still can find places, where even credit cards are not accepted. So, please, share your story.

I take this as an advertisement for an overpriced product. Just because "bitcoin" is written on it ...
Ah, why do I even care?

Quite a high price \(10.99 €\) for something you created just for yourself.

Missleading headline. As far as I see there´s no ability for **receiving** lightning payments off\-chain.

I just opened a reddit account to support your opinion and encourage everyone who is able to drive things this direction.
While wrighting there are 48 comments and I wonder why nobody mentions the improvement on privacy that comes with the ability to receive payments via Lightning. As I understand it, we could be our own coin mixer. Or am I wrong?

Three different keys to open one vault.

Not that much information. Any more? Or at least the source?

Upvoted for your dads age. Might be a kind of Customers\-age\-ATH.

Its a pity. Your post deserves a lot more discussion than the superficial bullshit it gets. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:44:16
Thanks. Will now try it myself.

ATMs? Localbitcoin? Try to find a bitcoin meeting near your place, visit it and speak with people there. It´s always good to be connected.

In germany these coins are available on "Internetauktionsriese" for about one euro without shipping cost. Maybe you should check your account there (if any). Just a thought.

I already found two versions of this list. The same words on these lists, but one starting with 1 (as you would do as a human) and the other starting with 0 (which might be handy, when you are a developer - okay, a developer is also a human, but programing). 
Maybe someone here knows, wether the "right" counting is specified in the BIP.

As far as I understand Wasabi wallet brings a trustless "coin mixer" with it. Reportedly not easy to use but it might be worth the effort.
