So basically are you trying  to change wallet without sending your coins? Please elaborate.

3rd party implementation on top of the blockchain. Phone wallets: "Blue wallet" or "Wallet of Satoshi".
The point is fast and low fee transactions.

Very interesting, thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:46:55
I'm already a few wallets away from this one, I just found out recently about the forks and thought I would collect them :) It's just a shame that the wallets doesn't deal with this private key.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:25:29
I know right, the internet is just a trend!
Oh sorry I meant bitcoin\*
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:21:38
Anxious now? Do you want to be anxious in the future because you sold everything off?
Bitcoin isn't a cash cow that plopped out of nowhere, Bitcoin was born out of a financial crisis. Bitcoin is your insurance for your wealth which the people in the 1920's didn't have. I'm not saying we are going to have a disaster like the great depression, but I'm counting on it because we have a shitty monetary system and a greedy elite.
Don't regret that you sold, regret that you didn't buy more.

 [  this is what I could find, seems like it. I'll give it a listen
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:39:24
Do I send my private key here or in DM? Or can I send you my funds directly? I have FIAT too if that's interesting.
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:37:28
I see. Correct me if I am wrong again.
Does Blue wallet and Wallet of Satoshi host nodes so you don't have to, so you kind of have to rely on 3rd party implementation?
I read something about you being able to host your own personal nodes for lightning network but it was kind of a process to do so.

I can't say wether it's good or bad, and I am not sure I am reading this right. But some big player moved Tether from a personal wallet to an exchange.
And based on Mark\_Bear's comment, I am thinking that the team behind Tether may have created these coins.
I am only speculating.

Thanks for your time.
I managed to collect the BCH weirdly enough, I do not know how but Electron cash decided to accept my private key. Though for any other forks I think my private key is too old for new wallets to support it. Some Encoding/Decoding sites says my private key is not a bitcoin address and other says it has the wrong size.
Disclaimer: I don't recommend anyone reading this to blindly paste your private key on sites. Proceed with caution and be aware that your funds can be stolen very easily this way.

Holding for now because I have lost faith in the banking system.
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:50:51
Thanks for clarifying. Apparently they burned a value of $500,000,000 in October of last year as well.

The good thing about having a 30% capital gains tax is that it's most often a better idea to hold. And besides, I'm not sure that I can see a future without Bitcoin. To me Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:40:24
Sounds like a terrible deal. I would look into Bisq.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:33:38
What kind of fees are you talking about? Where did you buy your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:59:12
Localbitcoins, it's not a wallet tho. Just like coinbase it's an exchange.
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:59:48
What is the 21m club? Anyone who owns any amount of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:42:37
Me neither, so you asking got me thinking as well. Thanks for that!
Every wallet always exists, you just generate a seed to access it.
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:29:26
In my opinion, the most accurate would be to look at the amount of transactions and see how well the Blockchain is being used. How many people there are is impossible to tell and is just a complete guess work
@_date: 2019-08-11 10:52:12
Just some points that I've encountered with newbies are:
People are thinking that their coins are stored on password protected accounts rather than wallets. Which is true for exchanges, but newbies should learn the differences.
How to get Bitcoin.
You don't need to own one whole Bitcoin.
It's not anonymous.
It's limited supply.
What about alternative coins, why not buying another coin of which you can get a larger amount.
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:27:55
Yes, until you don't.
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:39:48
 Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 08:52:21
Sounds like you have issues with your mother
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:55:58
I think you should feel really lucky holding just 1 BTC, more than just "Ok!". 
0.1 BTC is already much for a lot of people, I can't wait enough for the future :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:32:16
I think you have two options.
1. Find a program which will guess the seed phrase for you, I think there is a program which will let you feed your words into it and it will find the correct order for you.
2. Send your funds to a new wallet, like electrum. Reset your ledger and set up a new wallet in it, save your seed correctly and send your funds to it :)

Got a link?

Why is the number of wallets important exactly? I mean it's not exactly like we'll be running out of them any time soon.

Bruh, write down your private key instead of installing multiple clients on different hard drives. Your private key is most likely a set of words (12-24)
Your private key will always give you access to your coins. And yes you can retrieve your coins on multiple wallets. Happy holidays bruh
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:24:52
When you make a transaction, your wallet will be included in a future block, the blocks are history, and with history your wallet is known. I suppose.

We need gated communities with citadels for bitcoiners!

RIP in peace Localbitcoins next month. My go to exchange to buy easily without KYC bullshit and bank transfer. Bisq is a desert in my country.
Anyone know any KYC free exchange with many payment options?
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:52:47

Seems legit to me, and the RT guy have some great arguments. Do you?
