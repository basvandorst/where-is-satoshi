Are you insane? Increasing SegWit adoption and reducing fees for everyone is stupid? Are you 6?
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:18:01
Why can't you fait for that? Should it at least lower the fees eh?

Wrong, we want Coinbase to listen and reduce fees by implementing SegWit which is the responsible action.
Also, you must be a Coinbase employee.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:50:14
Because they risk of fucking someone up and also it costs them money to program it. If they aren't losing money, why should they spend extra efforts on SegWit?
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:55:56
Let's make it his top priority then:
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:45:30
Also rate their iOS and Android apps 1 star.

You are right. Kraken is not a scam. They are an ultra, mega, super scam.
Gemini is US only, doesn't count.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:57:59
Are you sick? Coinbase adding SegWit improves the ecosystem as a whole.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:22:21
Leave coinbase? And where will you go? To Kraken that is even worse? To some shady offshore exchange that will steal your money 100% of the time unlike Coinbase which only steals your money 50% of the time?

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:37:51
One thing is what should be, other thing if what will be.
Crypto exchanges won't be paying anyone out of their pocket. This is not your Charles Schwab or Etrade, this is wild west territory and if you are holding significant sums on exchanges you are asking to get robbed them. So far there have been no successful lawsuits against shady offshore exchanges and that won't most likely change, so they will keep robbing the users blind. Why wouldn't they? It is in their best self interest.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:23:30
So Lightning Network is already possible to use in mainnet?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:41:40

@_date: 2017-12-13 20:33:06
So the original bitcoin wallet does not use segwit? WTF why?

The same way gold futures fucked with the gold market.
This is bad.
ETF would be good.
But ETF will never be approved as long as offshore exchange like BitFinex can easily and legally manipulate the markets via wash trading and spoofing. SEC said it themselves, not me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:02:22


Why are you so sure BTC futures will get an approval?
Don't you think that the problems I outlaid in the post apply to BTC futures instrument as well?

BCH will be fucked by Tether just as well as BTC. It doesn't really matter, Tether has disfigured the whole crypto market. And if you kill Tether, another exchange with Tether2.0 will come up. At this point governments will get pissed off at sheeple being scammed all the time and just outlaw crypto altogether or allow trading only at state registered exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:08:54
But how do you know the underlying price of Bitcoin that you see on these futures is not caused by wash trading, spoofing and layering? You can't and it is. So why would SEC and CFTC would ever approve this futures instrument?

Where were you when Bitcoin hit $10'000?
I was tired from not sleeping so took a 2 hour rest during which I had some troubling dreams, but once I woke up it was nice to see that BTC/USD 10k mark was already reached.
This is BIG. Last incremental step was in 2013 I guess when BTC reached $1000.
Next step - $100'000 I guess?
That might...take a while.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:17:48


Yes, 16%, correct. You know what huge affect these 16% have on price movements? Have you seen Bitcoin order book? Do you see how that number can easily fill or wipe the order book in a few minutes?
I won't even speak about alts, those will get absolutely killed once Tether implodes.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:26:52


Yah, close to 700mil now.


Common misconception. It really is not. 700mil$ can have a huge affect on the market in either direction. Look at trading volumes of crypto.

Tether themselves told me. It is written black on white on their terms of service on their website.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:55:40
No, I actually was asked by family members, friends and relatives if they should buy crypto (bitcoin and what not), I always advise them to **NOT BUY**, because this shit is way too manipulated, unstable, unsafe and volatile. If you were my sister I'd tell you to put that money in index funds instead and keep it there until you are 70. Crypto is for gambling degenerates that can handle the heat. I'm one of them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:44:18
To be honest, no. But I think they will give a good fight. There are some last moment plan Bs that Core will use to prevent BCH from taking over.

No blood in streets yet. Right now people are in "this is a comfy correction mode", at 5000$ they will be "uh...you can stop dropping now", and then it will go apeshit as people lose their minds and it falls way back to 1300$.

"Interim consulting memorandum" is not an audit.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:29:04
You are not being objective in these comparisons. These internal strifes are nothing like criminal misconduct.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:29:29
Just you using such negative words as "scam artists" means you are biased and not objective.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:21:08
Don't make yourself a target, guys.
Money talks, wealth whispers.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:46:45
Everyone is greedy now.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:10:15
No, it is still bias.

"This time it's different!" - *sigh* you know that they said that during dot-com boom as well, right? Listen, if people are overly bullish in their forecasts it means a potential crash is on its way as everyone is over-invested and overly optimistic.

Easy, they can just block it and they have plans to do it if I'm not mistaken. Sure you can still use VPN to circumvent, but China is banning VPNs on regular basis. It just becomes a hassle.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:37:49
Could you elaborate even further on that? How will this replay attack steal them?
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:48:36
Actually the alts are dropping. Right now people are selling alts for Bitcoin to take advantage of the free coins after Bitcoin Gold and 2X forks. We can expect a pull back after these events and relative rise of alts.

They won't though. Amazon does not even accept PayPal, why on earth would they ever accept crypto?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:49:57
Could you give an explorer url with these stats as an example?
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:54:15
Can you elaborate how those funds can be stolen / lost / etc?
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:19:30
China does matter though.

If nobody bought the pizza to prove you can use it for transactions, then we might not be where we are today. The snowball has to start somewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:42:41
Got it, how do I prevent against this in case of the upcoming fork?
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:18:56
Just because you don't flash your money you are suddenly a "cuck"?
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:09:04


Explain how...won't one chain survive in the end?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:53:44
I'm just saying it will crash in November.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:30:30
What are the fees on this card?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:30:51
If Amazon is not even accepting PayPal why on earth would they accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:25:07
They won't though. Amazon does not even accept PayPal, why on earth would they ever accept crypto?
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:38:23


Will it though?

1st indicator that it is a bubble: People claim it's not a bubble
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:22:22
Science is not biased, it is "just facts", but Bitcoin subs are biased.

Evolution at work, the strongest side shall survive.

Possibly bitfinex doing something with lent money. This bull run could be fuelled by bitfinex fake credit scheme.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:12:41
It does not actually:
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:46:39
What if it is never implemented?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:57:57


So? That does not mean Bitcoin is discounted right now.
Your "analysis" does not hold water to put it mildly.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:50:44
After November hard fork it will crash.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:31:42
How does one protect against replay attack?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:59:03
This is way too vague. It can crash to 2000$ and recover to 4000$. Does that count as recovery?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:35:10


Why is it incredibly discounted right now? What analysis leads you to make this bold statement?
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:46:09
Don't they have in plans restriction of access to localbitcoins as well?
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:07:48
Without China we would be in 5500$+
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:31:19
This is actually not good. It means irrational exuberance is taking on. It is better to have the mainstream be skeptical and slightly fearful than overly optimistic. Irrational optimism causes bubbles and crashes.

It is a legal currency in Japan.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:38:33
*"But this case is different..."* - you literally saying that phrase means that it IS NOT DIFFERENT and it is irrational exuberance.
This will go down hard.
