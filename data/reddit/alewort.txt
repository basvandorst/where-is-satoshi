No, there is a unit of the dollar called a mil. The smallest unit of a dollar that can be expressed that is an actual unit is $0.001. One mil. Which would be doable at BTC=$100,000.

Off by a factor of ten. A mil is $0.001.

This needs to say "Just Eat It" at the bottom, with a graphic next it appropriate to the desired audience.

You can totally beat a bar of gold thinly, making a thermal blanket. REFUTED!

Not so much if you really drive them.

It's not bit coin until you see tooth marks.

What? No! Houses are worth more when you sell them than when you bought them (if you're not moving around often), cars only go down.

It does now. Retconned.

Dollars have always had thousandths. They are called mils. You mostly find them in matters relating to property tax. The smallest federally minted coins were half pennies, but businesses and lower level governments have issued mil-level tokens and coins. At an on-the-books accounting level, mils are still very much a thing.

I sold my BCH at 1750ish. I used it to buy BTC at around 6000. So I missed the extremes but I think I did all right.

There's a good chance. This summer I washed and dried an ssd and after opening it up and cleaning the board with isopropyl, it was fine.

Finally you can pay for shit with bitcoin.

Encrypted means encoded. To read encrypted information you need to decrypt it, which means use instructions to break the code. A simple encryption is to use the next letter in the alphabet for the real letter, which turns the word CAT into DBU. If you have the instruction explaining to use the next letter, you know to shift the letters back to CAT. The encryption used in cryptocurrency is automated by computer and far more complicated. It is not used to hide the blockchain, it is used to prove the identities of people recording entries into it.

How can I trust your word? You are clearly a ghost.

Those photos are very blurry and it's not clear to me what the chip you're talking about is. The only feature I can make out that might fit the bill is the centrally aligned circle. MY first thought is that it was an extrusion point from where the piece was attached to a tree of other parts like it in a large mold. I looked for pictures on Google Images and found just one with an angle showing the top. In the same spot there is a mar, much less obvious but that reinforces my hunch that it's a relic from the manufacturing process. Here's a link to the page with the pictire.

I think the most recent dip down is because the price stalled for a couple three days around 4000 and that prompted people to sell for fear of another retreat.

Wish I could do that here in Minnesota. *sigh*

They charge a fee. Borrow 100, repay 130 kind of thing. What's forbidden is interest.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:08:41
Nope. They are not (yet) compliant with state regulations. Hopefully by the time I am ready to sell.
