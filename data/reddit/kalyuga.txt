Here's a nice precedent for unfair political analysis: compare the worst instance of anarchy with the best instance of government.
And I think you'll [find]( that living standards, in the broadest sense of the term, have actually increased ever since Somalia's state-'socialist' government collapsed back in 1991. Their economy has grown, crime has reduced, the population is more literate, etc. So let us put things in focus: We are looking at the difference between one of the worst instances of government and one of the worst instances of anarchy. Now look at what the [evidence]( has to say about what fairs better. The anarchist's claim has rarely been anything more than that, for any given society, the instantiation of a government is no improvement at all.

Well, it doesn't surprise me: most modern anarchists are anarcho-communists. As a pro-market mutualist, this fact makes me sad. He also seemed to be using 'anarchist' as if it was an insult, so that explains a lot.
It's mentally taxing enough for people to even mention radical ideologies—for them to start distinguishing the nuanced divisions between them would just be too much.

You mean he doesn't want to be robbed by government thugs? Wow! He must literally be the worst of all scum.
