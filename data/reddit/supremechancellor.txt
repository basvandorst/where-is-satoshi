Active Non Mining nodes make the security.
Please try and understand &lt;3
Miners must build a chain that is validated by this greater Peer 2 Peer trust, which is cryptographically secured on every users Active Full Bitcoin Node or Mining Node.

I asked 'how would things have been different during and after the chain split?'
The BCH node is completely different to the bitcoin node.
They did not do some magic to change the core Bitcoin Node.
People chose to download that node and run it.

And here is another article for you to enjoy:
the blockchain can grow by at most 525,600 / 10 = 52,560 MB or ~ 52.5 GB per year (discounting leap year).
You seem to be under the impression that I am angry, which is wrong. I am pointing out that you are wrong about your numbers. If this is only "internet coins" to you then maybe that explains why you can not grasp even fundamental metrics of the system.
BTW, you can run your node in pruned mode with exactly the same security properties, reducing the chain size to ~2-3 GiB.
You have already demonstrated your misunderstanding of what a "active full wallet node" is.
I think we're done.
I still love you. Please don't take internet money so seriously, its not good for you.

@_date: 2018-01-03 10:20:39


What has changed is the network. If jihan attacked it, changed the code and took control of the project and my node disconnected it..
Then my node is still "Honest" or what the greater consensus of what "bitcoin" *is*
It can then be rebuilt, without jihan.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:12:21


It can. That's the whole point. All active nodes will cut invalid nodes off from themselves that feed them invalid chains.
I dont know how many more times i can say the same thing to you.
You just refuse to understand. You sound like anyone in If your node disconnects another node...
THEN THIS NODE WILL BE DISCONNECTED FROM THE OTHER NODES BECAUSE YOUR NODE IS SYNCED WITH THEM
 
WHAT EVER THE DECISION YOUR NODE MAKES, THE NETWORK MAKES - BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL THE SAME
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:48:55


Using the chain is using the node at home.
You run an active full node, you are helping others connect to the network because your non mining active node and mining nodes *are* the network.
Your Active Wallet Node also validates blocks against its own chain and will cut off nodes that feed it invalid chains
It's the whole point.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:10:13
You hold the power. You and the community. No matter what anyone does... you as a majority decide what chain and rules you want to transact on, run active wallet nodes, and run active miner nodes on.
Miners can do what they wish. There are many.
This is the point. :) &lt;3
Even if they destroyed every node except one, you could rebuild the entire network.
1 backup of an "Honest" node, can restart bitcoin.
You cannot kill bitcoin.

This breaks the peer to peer model.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:12:32
It can.
The miner finds a block that is encrypted by a POW that only the correct audit trail and rules can decrypt or validate on your active full wallet node

Because your active wallet is already validated as part of the greater bitcoin network.
If it’s invalid to your active wallet node, it’s invalid to the entire network (or the consensus right now) therefore it will act as the network and cut this node off from itself
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:53:15


Ahh you see. You dont!

@_date: 2018-01-03 09:55:50
Because you and these other nodes are already validated.
You have downloaded the software and chain. Received a bitcoin
You now are this decentralised authority
Your active wallet will cut nodes that feed it invalid chains.
Therefore every active node on the network is the security.
If your chain agrees with the majority, it is valid.
If it does not it is cut from every honest node until it is not connected to the network
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:53:59


It does. It will connect a bad actor, then whoever that bad actor is also connected to will disconnect it.
Because my node, chain and rules fit theirs.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:41:22
no. Sorry. Either read my comments or posts again.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:33:15


They don't but you are still missing the point.
We all make up this decentralized trust. It is the very point of bitcoin security.
This ensures no one party can take control by EVERY ACTIVE NODE validating the chain against their own, and cutting off invalid nodes.

@_date: 2018-01-03 11:02:39
You download the wallet. You buy a bitcoin. You receive this bitcoin in your full active bitcoin core wallet.
You keep this running.
This Active Node, now helps people connect to the network.
It received 1ish MB blocks from the nodes its connected to which are cryptographically secured by both the audit trail, and rules.
My node looks at this block, decyphers it. (or trys to validate)
If it cannot, it cuts this node off from itself.
This node will then be sequentially cut off from every other node that agrees with my chain and my rules.
Both Active Bitcoin Core Wallets Or Miner Nodes

No, it makes a difference because they are running Bitcoin ABC nodes that are not valid on our nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:47:42


If a single honest node is all that is needed to run the bitcoin network, then it doesn't matter if 90% of the nodes are own by one party, correct?
Having 100s of thousands of nodes owned by decentralized parties wouldn't matter if 1 node, your node, is all that is needed.
Either node decentralization matters or it doesn't.
In an apocalyptic scenario, this model is weak.
You are correct. Nice.

Read it again.
Say you had your active wallet running
This has been confirmed by the network as what the network is, because it is connected to you and running 
If one of the nodes that your wallet is connected to sends it an invalid chain, it acts as the network and cuts that node away from itself
Ensuring sovereignty of the network
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:29:30


Say jihan made 6billion asics and performed a "better" 51% attack. Say I had my node backed up, in a staggered backup.
Okay. So he has attacked, and everyone who uses bitcoin's nodes have been changed to whatever he wants.
I hold the original, sovereign chain in my backup.
Therefore, the original chain, and therefore the authority of that chain remains and can be reconnected.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:08:55
It wont work fine if you increase blocksizes out of the hands of the users of bitcoin.
Current active full nodes at 1MB w SW use 150GBupfront, must run all the time, and use 40-60gb a month.
But them running those wallets and them not being able to be changed without them directly changing it... means they are the security of bitcoin.
They ensure the consensus of the chain and rules.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:18:07

@_date: 2018-01-06 10:04:33


The articles you link claim it breaks the security model but doesn't explain why other than claiming that 8mb blocks and 200gb of bandwidth per month break it. But I'll let you on a little secret, they don't.
Okay. So the current nodes take 150gb Upfront to download, then 60gb per month, every month. This is at 1mb -1.8mb, 9 year audit trail.
They provide no benefit to you to run one.
There are 10,000 alone. They are in the majority of users of bitcoin
As we grow we must allow this very important, crucial part of keeping the entire point of the peer 2 peer model valid.
We definitely don't want to make it TOO bad.
200GB is insanity. It will kick so many nodes off the network and put so many in datacenters.
Again, thank you. 
(I answered this the same way, at least 25 times.... and i explain *quite clearly why its important in my article.* I have now typed it out manually again, for you. If you don't want to accept that 8mb breaks the model, It's okay. Everyone is sometimes maliciously misled. I love you. I know you now want to argue specifics. But none of them matter because of 0 conf. Good luck. *edit: sorry about being a dick, but.. come on. )

@_date: 2018-01-03 05:58:40
Very true.
The model remains, the decentralized peer to peer consensus of *what* the audit trail(chain) is and the rules *are* lie within the majority of the users of bitcoin.
Whom' some of which run regular, staggered backups. ;)
The point is, the security is in the users of bitcoin. They decide what chain \ rules are correct by participating in the greater peer 2 peer trust. They *are* bitcoin. Miners and Not.

@_date: 2018-01-03 10:26:13


The difference is.... Is that my node.. is what the consensus of chain and rules are right now.
If jihan attacked the network and changed the mining profitability alogorithm, my node would not validate this block and disconnect it.
If he successfully took over the whole network...
MY NODE STILL HOLDS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ORIGINAL NETWORK
I CAN UPLOAD IT TO SOMEWHERE AND THE USERS OF BITCOIN CAN RE CONNECT THE ORIGINAL NETWORK
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:22:52
It does.
It is literally part of confirming the chain. It holds the same rules and authority as any other node to cut off nodes.

My node, agrees with yours that the chain is this way.
These transactions were made over 9 years. It also has rules that dictate what it does.
Using these transactions and rules, a miner will find a new block and broadcast it to the network.
This block then has to be confirmed by the network as a whole.
Both Mining and Active Non Mining Nodes.
If it is confirmed by the majority, then it is valid.
Some sites only require a few confirmations. Some require more.

Yes and because your node is synced with the rest of the network, this is what the rest of the network will do.


It will because this node has just tried to attack the network with different chain or rules.
So this node was connected to you, me, sally, billy and jihans mining node.
It sends the chain to my node.  My node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesnt fit... It disconnects it.
It sends the chain to 6nf's node. 6nf's node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesnt fit... It disconnects it.
It sends the chain to sallys node. sallys node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesnt fit... It disconnects it.
It sends the chain to billys node. billys node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesnt fit... It disconnects it.
It sends the chain to jihan's mining node. jihan's mining node DOES THE SAME CHECK with all our chains and rules. If it doesnt fit... It disconnects it.
This node, and chain are now not connected to the bitcoin network.
The attack has been stopped by us ALL

@_date: 2018-01-06 19:40:09


Which is it? Is a singular honest node enough to keep bitcoin running, or is it important that 90% of nodes aren't controlled by 1 party?
Because both of these statements can't be true at the same time.
Okay. If in this example there was a sudden rule change. There would definitely be more than 20 backups by different users.
If there was however in like some apocalyptic scenario.
They just either trust 1 user, or confirm it with 2..
Upload it..
Then everyone downloads it again because they want their money the same.

@_date: 2018-01-03 09:47:11
It does because your wallet cuts it off
Then this malicious node is also connected to the network by Billy’s active wallet. Billy’s active wallet receives the chain, invalidates it and cuts the malicious node off
Then this malicious node is also connected to a bit main mining node (bunch of ASICS) THIS NODE WILL DOTHE SAME CHECK THAT BILLYS WALLET DID AND CUT THE MALICIOUS NODE FROM ITSELF
Then say Sarah is running a full active wallet with bitcoin in it. This malicious node has been rejected 3 times, it sends its chain to Sarah’s wallet... Sarah’s active node can not validate it. So it is cut off
There fore this malicious node is now completely cut off from the network
Get it?
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:45:04

The point is. That you running the software and using bitcoin is -bitcoin.
Your active wallet node can cut off invalid miner or non miner nodes that it cannot validate.
This is why bitcoin is secure.
The miners must build a chain that can then be authorised by this network, including your full node. :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:20:13
You are very wrong I am sorry.
This is how bitcoin is secure. A bunch of miner nodes and active full core wallet nodes that validate pow done.
The majority of these are in the hands Of the users
This is how not one party can control bitcoin.
This is the whole point.

Today it is 149953 MiB, one month ago it was at 144740 MiB, giving a difference of 5213 MiB = 5.0908203125 GiB. This is slightly off from my numbers because block production rate is not completely constant and there is some overhead with storing the blocks.

The users own bitcoin. We own it,. because we are part of ensuring that nothing is changed by having cryptographic ally secured audit trails that can only be modified with valid blocks.
Therefore, we decide what "bitcoin" *IS*
BECAUSE NO ONE CAN CHANGE THE CLIENT WE DOWNLOAD
THE CHAIN IS SECURED BY MATH
YOUR CLIENT VALIDATES THIS CHAIN WITH MATH
IT CUTS OFF INVALID ACTIVE WALLET NODES AND MINER NODES THAT SEND IT INVALID CHAINS
IT IS THE VERY BASIS OF BITCOIN SECURITY AND WHY ITS AMAZING
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:42:41


So you, and the other users of bitcoin have all started software and downloaded a chain. This chain is cryptographically secured using the audit trail and rules.
You are all running this same chain and rules.
Therefore if one node finds another node invalid, they all will.
The point is, is that what bitcoin "is" is decided by you and me. The people who use bitcoin and the chain.
If someone were somehow able to seize control (very very expensive many many asics), we can rebuild the decentralised trust of original software/rules/and chain.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:10:41
That's fine.
But the majority consensus of users believe that "Bitcoin" is what it was before the miners or any one party made it split.
Therefore they run those nodes.
This ensures the decentralised trust.

Yes and because your node is synced with the rest of the network, this is what the rest of the network will do.


It will because this node has just tried to attack the network with a different chain or rules (block).
Say this malicious node was connected to the bitcoin network by you, me, sally, one of Jihans mining nodes, and billy.(*this happens at the same time in real life, this malicious node will “broadcast” the block*)
1. It sends the block to my Active Wallet Node. My node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesn't fit… It disconnects it.
 
1. It sends the block to your Active Wallet Node. your node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesn't fit… It disconnects it.
1. It sends the block to sallys Active Wallet Node. sallys node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesn't fit… It disconnects it.
1. It sends the block to Jihan’s Active Mining Node. jihan’s mining node DOES THE SAME CHECK AS THE ACTIVE WALLET NODES DID with all our chains and rules. If it doesn’t fit… It disconnects it.
1. It sends the block to billys Active Wallet Node. billys node checks it with all our chains and rules. If it doesn't fit… It disconnects it.
This node, and block/chain are now **not** connected to the bitcoin network.
The attack has been stopped by us ALL."
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:56:38
You are still wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:17:19
That's correct.
Then Ben can go on the internet and say
"Oh hey guys, jihan spun up 2billion asics and attacked the network and owns it now. However my node actually disconnected itself. We can now rebuild the honest network"

then you point at the fees and laugh.

@_date: 2017-08-26 08:41:05
They are wrong because the reason the fees are high right now, is that bch is incentivising miners to switch to mine their chain. This has caused 40-50% of the mining power to swap networks randomly.
SO they basically have helped cause it, and now are shilling the destruction of what we all love.

These rules only applied when the network was all mining nodes. Bitcoin had to evolve which actually improved its security overall as hash power alone means nothing. You can't mine what software people choose is bitcoin out of their heads.


reorg is a fork if we can't decrypt it on the majority of active full nodes run by users.


because every single transaction after the rollback will be completely different on the new chain. You can't force the user run nodes to accept all these new blocks that are invalid which creates 2 networks.


Only when all the nodes were mining nodes, this was true.


Please, do. :)

No, longer chain means nothing since all nodes do not mine anymore. Chains that cannot be confirmed on the nodes run by the userbase would create a new chain.
Which is what this would do. 
Be a dick about it tho.
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:11:00


because these users would have to physically change their software. How can you convince the majority of these to change their software for binance? Again, possible but very improbable... *by design.*
This is why uasf had to be with the express agreement of the majority of bitcoin users. They chose to download the new client and sync the new chain.
They would have to do the same here, but *because binance.*


No it's not. It does re-org but with the express agreement of the **majority** of the full nodes. I was speaking in min max extremes but really its all about the majority rule.
Exchanges require multiple verifications to prove it's still the same chain.


I'm sorry, the way you think bitcoin works is basically paypal with miners as the 3rd party or centralized paypal servers. It's okay though, I talk to people all the time who have the same misunderstanding which is why I wrote my articles.
All active wallet nodes will try to decrypt the blocks they recieve and will disconnect *any other node*  that sends it invalid blocks. So it will disconnect them, and ban them for a period of time. This makes every single active wallet node a sentry and gatekeeper of the network which is the point. The majority of these would have to be physically  changed in order for this rollback to be successful.

@_date: 2019-05-08 12:21:43


If this were true, you could just make each of jihan's asics it's own full active node and just *take* the network. Their rollback doesn't mean **your chain on your active wallet node rolls back** ***as well.***
Their rollback would create an *entirely new chain* from the point of roll back making it **never ever be able** to be decrypted or **validated** on **our active wallet nodes**, which would keep disconnecting them making a seperate chain.


uh huh. that's what i'm saying. **Humans** would have to make the choice whether or not to stay with the original chain or download the binance chain, or the bch chain. But they would have to OPT IN to the binance chain.


No you are incorrect and do not understand bitcoin security. The users chose which software to download and what chain to use.
They could do it here.. yes its *possible*, but you think binance is going to really convince the majority of BTC users to roll back because they had security flaws?


incorrect. This chain would never be able to be validated or decrypted as our pow says that this bitcoin is still there which changes the entire hash of every single transaction after that.

It's just unfortunately a common theme. Many *many* people do not understand why bitcoin is amazing and what makes it secure, and are too afraid to ask.

Because every (the majority) single user run active node would have to agree.
It is possible, but improbable as it is the point of bitcoin security to share the stake of what is "bitcoin".
Those miners who chose to mine for the bailout would be creating a new chain which the current users and miners would either have to also download and use, or it would split what is "bitcoin" in two. One side with binance, the other with the current run nodes which are in the hands of every user of bitcoin.

This is incorrect. Miners are *not only* those with connections to binance, and it wouldn't matter if every miner decided to stop mining for what we consider is "bitcoin" as it would then be incredibly lucrative for *any miner* to mine the original chain.
This is the *entire* point of a distributed network. Any change that is done must be done with the full agreement of every single person who runs an active node.
edit: this was min maxing. It needs to be the majority not *every single one* sorry about that. Also did the same below, it’s the majority.. not every single one. Sorry.
That means every active wallet node run by every user would have to be re-downloaded and used. Because binance. That's why its impractical because you can't just ***will*** these people into doing what binance or 70% of miners want.
This is the ***whole*** point. If this were true, then miners are just the 3rd party making the white paper completely nullified as they are now the bank. This is not true *because* running a full active wallet node means you are participating in running the network and keeping it secure by accepting blocks and trying to verify or decrypt them, which you then broadcast to the active wallet nodes and active wallet mining nodes *you* are connected to.
If they start mining a new chain, our current active wallet nodes and active "miner" nodes (same thing except one is mining) would deem all these miners an invalid chain and disconnect them all creating 2 chains. The user base at large (so every user run node, every exchange, every market cap listing) would have to then decide which one is "bitcoin".


If he did understand how a distributed peer to peer decentralized network runs he would understand that you cant just *mine your way*  out of trouble.
You must convince the *entire* user base of all active wallet nodes and active wallet mining nodes.
