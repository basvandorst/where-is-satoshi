Wouldn't overall stability be a good thing for Cryptocurrencies though?

I mean this is literally the free market at work. This is capitalism at work. Don’t know why people don’t expect this.

How not? A business, not government, is withholding someone from using their service. This is allowed in capitalism because the business is private. Capitalism allows for this to happen.

Completely agree.

How do you assume that?

You support Pence and the things he believes in?

Trump has nothing to do with this other than the fact that he is going to deregulate banks and more. Thats why those companies want to meet with them. To continue to screw over the little guy. Isn't that the point of why you guys like Bitcoin, to help the little guy rise up? That's not what Trump is doing. The markets doing well is not an indicator of good things too come.

Clinton won't be going to jail at all. He never wanted to do that. It was a lie. and people are afraid of who is picking for the cabinet for the wrong reasons. His picks are scary if you care about Americas prosperity.

Not really. This is the only of positive news in awhile.

This is sarcasm obviously but whenever someone tells me to relax even if I am relaxed I instantly feel a little more on edge which is ironically what is the opposite of intended.

I do have some of that too actually! Why is coinbase unreliable? I’ve heard that but obviously until yesterday, two years ago was the last time I have had any experience with it.

I honestly hope we never have to see this again, as great as these are.

I’ve used Crypto for actual currency, like probably a lot of other people here.
