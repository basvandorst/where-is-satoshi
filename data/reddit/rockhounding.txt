The creator didn't even use his real name.  It's owned by no one.
Select   Then basic search for bitcoin = No records found.

What program is he using?

Either way, I'm done with mtgox.  This is quite possibly the final nail in their coffin.

There are some that did and then immediately withdrew them.  How in the FUCK do they roll that back? A minority get a huge payday while the rest of us get screwed.
There is no way they can roll this back and make it okay.  There will be many losses and quite possibly a class action lawsuit.

exactly... this is what bitcoiners in the first world don't realize. A penny is a lot in many countries.

More early-adopter, elitist Bitcoin propaganda.  
The market is speaking.  The market is choosing Litecoin as number two.  Stop flapping your lips and listen.  The Chinese sure aren't listening to you.  They are buying LTC in droves.
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."
You Bitcoin hardliners are at the fighting us stage.  
Edit: BTW, Good luck with your "BTC GOOD, LTC BAD" circlejerk.  China doesn't give a shit.

I'm being realistic.  China is buying litecoin.  China will use litecoin.  Don't be willingly ignorant.  There is plenty of room for two.  And so far China is picking LTC.  The "Market" is speaking.  Deal with it.

Sorry Erik,
Truth is a true market requires competition.  The phrase, "All your eggs in one basket," does even still apply to bitcoin.
I don't need to do convincing here.  In fact you've convinced me that Gandhi is right.  And that I am right being in Litecoin.
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."
You are at the "fighting" us stage.  We are about to win.  Truth hurts.  
Oh and go tell Max Keiser he's wrong.  He was right about bitcoin.  He's right about litecoin.

Wow, thanks man!
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:22:36
Yeah that Max Keiser guy is full of shit with his $50 litecoin prediction.

I'm a little concerned that if Gox adds Litecoin they'll mess it up like they have BTC.
We are due an announcement and they do need to address it though.

Looks like you got schooled... Congrats on believing the rest of the world lives like you.

blue horseshoe loves litecoin...
