"we are auction the best files"
Idk... sounds like doge may be behind it. (Much files. Very exploits. Wow.)

Yes, but is he willing to die for your PINs?

My point is, if you were to go back and read from his first post about bitcoin to his present, you would perhaps see for yourself that the dude's not scammy. He is opinionated,  but never claims not to be and the fact that he doesn't write on bitcoin alone, but on currency markets and stocks and yet includes bitcoin, is a good thing. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:31:08
Ahhhh...I see. I know nothing of that. Let me look into it and get back to you.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:18:20
That scammy looking dude has years of experience in several foreign exchanges and the fact that he's even willing to blog about bitcoin is a positive thing for bitcoin.  And he writes about the markets in general,  not bitcoin exclusively.

I don't imagine either of these trends will be slowing down in the coming months.

Well said! I'm still in. (The game; not Gox.) And I'll say it again: If you don't gamble on innovation, innovation won't happen. Bitcoin is worth the risk. Seriously. Look at it.

I was thinking that as well. But do the Winklevi and any whale friends own enough to cause that big of a swing so they could launch at the bottom?  I can see why they would want to but I am far from knowing the maths.

I believe he is using Shatner punctuation. Not enough periods to be Walken.

Perhaps "kicking the can down the road" is not just a delay. If the solution has not been found, maybe it will be found in the implementation of the can kicking. Surely things will surface that haven't been thought of prior and with this being the first time in history this many developers from around the globe are working together on something, someone is bound to spot a better solution. But with the clock ticking, chances are it will be found after the kick if not because of the kick...  Just sayin'.

Ok. Checking in. I signed up to "Work Directly With Martin Now" and was told I had to complete 4 homework assignments....only the email came from Martin Tiller (not Tillier) and the email itself was signed Martin Tiller. I emailed the admin and told him and he said he would have it fixed right away, but to not let that dissuade me.
July 1: Homework assignment 1 was still from Tiller and signed Tiller. (Does this guy not proof his own emails?) I had to watch a video which, summed up, was Tillier saying: You, too, could make money now! 
July 2: Homework assignment 2 was still from Tiller and but now email is signed Tillier. I had to watch another video which, summed up, was Tillier saying: You, too, could make money now! 
July 3: Homework assignment 3 was still from Tiller and email is signed Tillier. I had to watch another video which, summed up, was Tillier saying: You, too, could make money now! Adding: We will be in touch with you soon!!
July 4-15: crickets
July 16: Some guy named Glenn emailed after 11 days and said:
This is Glenn with Martin Tillier’s Energy Trader Team getting in touch with you to let you know that we have received your application.
 
I will be conducting 30 minute phone interviews over the next 2 weeks or so; please email me back with a time that I can call you for the 30 minute interview.
 
Please Respond with Specific Day and Specific 30 minute time slot from the available times below:
 
Monday July 20th [12pm-4pm ET]
Tuesday July 21st [11am-7pm ET]
Wednesday July 22nd [11am-7pm ET]
So, Sanswork, I see your point. They actually lost me after the "Team" couldn't spell Tillier's name right that first day, but I decided to follow along anyway, just to see where this is leading and see when they ask for, like, $1200 to Work Directly With Martin Now!! 
Kinda tempted to set up the interview, just for shits and giggles.

This is gentlemen.

I, for one, enjoyed your interpretation. It was much preferred over the usual fud.

It appears that online commerce is becoming more and more reliant on feedback scores to get and keep customers. So choosing who you buy from is gradually becoming less scary and finger-crossy. 
Edit: which also means fake feedback will become more sophisticated as well.

USD has been play money since '71 when Nixon closed the gold window.

Bitcoin use is predominately on SR, but it is moving into the general market as well. Shutting down SR would be a setback for bitcoin, no doubt, but as far as making it go away...I don't know, I think it is here to stay and will build up again.

Yea, and someone should tell that Ben Franklin character that paper currency is never gonna catch on.

Could you recommend a qt client? 
@_date: 2013-09-23 09:07:02
Yes. Good point. Escrow and payment processors will factor in hugely. I just made a purchase out of China and never would've even considered it if the vender didn't use escrow. It was with fiat, but will benefit bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:33:37
Thank you! That is a start. Step 1: I will get blockchain.info and learn about it and use it before considering another. I may consider another at some point, but I just needed a place to start. :) 
I do care about anonymity so what is my best way to buy?
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:26:28
Yes, I would like to. And it seems to be necessary in order to use bitcoins. I don't just want to jump in without learning what is safest. I'm not looking to raise the lion's eyebrow hobbling about like a 3-legged gazelle. ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:30:02
I just know that you used to get 20 btc for a USD and now it takes $700 or so USD to get 1 btc. 
Edit: I do see what you are saying though. Governments are devaluing currencies through policies that are mainly transferring the wealth to the wealthy. Bitcoin is devaluing the currencies by transferring the wealth to the people. Granted right now it's just the people who have faith in Bitcoin, but our numbers are growing...
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:46:59
Agreed. Makes sense in any currency/credit/debit system. But I plan on buying physical goods so once I have them in hand, kind of hard to say I lost my currency if bc were to fall. And personally I don't think it is wise for me (or anyone, for that matter) to just throw money at bitcoin to hold. It appears the survival of bc is going to rely on its ease of use in the general population. I need to be comfortable with it before I can judge or speculate on whether it will survive in the long run.
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:49:08
I have my blockchain wallet, signed up for localbitcoins and am setting up my first buy. :) I had already read a lot on all of the suggested sites about bitcoins, wallets, and how to buy, but it's amazing at how much easier it is to move forward when even one more person says: yea, that company/method is good or I've done that and it worked for me. 
Feedback is so important when you are starting out so I really appreciate all who answered. Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-09-14 04:49:32
Thanks, but I have been to 3 out of 4 of those sites and it's just information overload. I will look into those wallets though. But then I wonder how secure they are and which one is best and I'm frozen by overload of info once again... I know if someone would just walk me through it once I'd get it. :/
@_date: 2013-09-14 07:47:34
A week? Lol I wish. I've taken several runs at this and gotten ... the wrong wallet. I've been reading and reading since bc was $65! ...I saw a post last week though, by a kind prince of a guy who was offering to walk a person through their first buy. I saved the thread (or so I thought) and now can't seem to find him. 
Everywhere I look I get 5/8th of the instructions. Go to BOA and do a deposit, they say.  Easy enough. TO WHO? ... So many that say "To me!" seem suspect...to a beginner. 
tl;dr: Me, in the future: "bc is $500? Well let me take another run at this....
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:39:17
Got it: two-factor authentication. And it is something Blockchain.info wallet offers, so easy enough.

When you clean that bad boy up, could you please correct your using bitcoin as possessive (bitcoin's) to bitcoin plural (bitcoins). k thnx bye
