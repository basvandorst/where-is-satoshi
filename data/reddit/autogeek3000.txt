You're right, but it is also backed by something. We trust the US Dollar (or whatever other fiat currency you trust) because the government says it's legal tender and the government insures our banks accounts against its loss. In other words, the dollar is backed by the government.
We trust bitcoin for a different reason... kind of the opposite reason: because there are *no* governments or bank executives controlling its rules and operations for their own benefit. Bitcoin is backed by the blockchain, by cryptography, by fairness, truth and transparency into its operation.

That's why people have so much trouble thinking about bitcoin *not* as a bubble... because they've never seen a party that doesn't end.

Richard Quest is a pretty smart guy. I think he's just asking the common questions that most of his audience want asked -- a journalism acts as an agent of common curiosity... "How does bitcoin have any value?" I get that pretty much every time I talk to someone about bitcoin.

Without getting into the technicalities, it just means starting.

How do you know that's true?

Regardless, wouldn't the risk be the same... that they could sue you for copyright?

What is the (potential) copyright violation... that he reposted their ad? Sharing/reposting ads on social media is often encouraged by companies... could they all claim copyright infringement when you share an ad?

That does suck, but it doesn't mean they are bots. The crowd that visits *new* can be very different from the crowd in *hot*.

I told them at $50 and they said, "What if it goes down?".
I told them at $150 and they said, "What if it goes down?".
I told them at $750 and they said, "What if it goes down?".
I told them at $1750 and they said, "What if it goes down?".
I'm not telling them again, I know what they're going to say.

Oh, I thought she meant 7pm. This makes way more sense now. If anyone in my timezone was texting me before 7am about anything non-emergency related I'd have a similar reaction.

So, if there's an exploit in the radio firmware of an Android device then we'll never know about it?

You can't win an argument with insults; they devalue anything intelligent you've said. Avoid them and then if someone disagrees with you, they'll at least respect you.

Your argument for why it's ok that they spy on us is the same argument the government got caught saying they're going to tell us in order to justify the spying. They lied to you and even after they got caught lying you're still believing it. Smarten up.
They admitted they haven't saved one life from this domestic spying. You're nearly ten times more likely to be killed by a police officer than you are a terrorist. 
Snowden is the one who is really looking out for you. Not the government. Not the police. Those guys are just looking out for their investment portfolio.

I wonder how many vehicle telematics systems the NSA has full access to? Everyone is worried about cell phones, but many vehicles have had built in *cell phones* with gps long before phones themselves had gps.

Nice story, looks like whoever wrote the story was pretty positive about bitcoin.

They have provided two pieces of information. A third party has provided one piece of information. It is extremely logical to side with the two congruent pieces of information that are from two different sources rather than your position which sides with one piece of information that is disputed by the same source.
