Don't understand why you're getting down voted. What the hell?
Posting the truth is like the ultimate sin in here. Up voted you.

How's that dick taste, stormsbrewing?
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:54:30
Yeah, because it's like Bitcoin was created for this reason, amirite?
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:35:20
You came here just to bash Apple and it's users? Nice. You don't have to post you know.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:07:32
Didn't they already accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:41:36
No, no they aren't. Permits are only required if you actually have a brick and mortar store.
I guess all those app developers on iOS and Windows phone shouldn't be selling according to your stupid flawed logic.
Oh, congratz on making it into this subreddit:

The minute they start accepting bitcoin, there'll be one last hurrah and then they'll go bye bye.
Just like blockbuster

WTF. It's like all of a sudden there's this group of people who hate anonymous selling yet want privacy for themselves. 
What these dumb fucks don't realize, is that Bitcoin was created to get away from all of this shit.
Looks like I'm using Coinbase only to convert BTC to fiat.
@_date: 2014-05-30 09:34:13
Too bad I can't. If you have a lower seller rating / standard, you can't close your account.
ScamPal and ScamBay.

Yet they want to publicly post your name, street address, and website on payment pages. The whole point of Bitcoin is anonymity. Coinbase defeats the purpose of Bitcoin. PayPal I understand as their dealing with Fiat.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:29:04
Could have sworn DO had a Bitcoin page.
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:36:19
And you shouldn't be buying without a buying permit.
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:21:55
Weird. They gave a reason. Apps must be legal in countries where it's offered. How is that guessing?
@_date: 2014-09-22 09:09:01
Don't feed the shills.
