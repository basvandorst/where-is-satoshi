well.. a hacker or a disgruntled insider could modify the javascript that is served to the clientside browser... this unfortunately is true of any web-served client-side encrypted wallet (multi-sig or not).
Tl;Dr - There is trust in Coinbase here. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:52:53
lmao, thought exact same thing.
@_date: 2015-12-31 18:53:34
Lol - proof of stake.
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:00:59
Tl;Dr - Most opinions don't mean anything in the blocksize debate. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 09:43:49
...general misconceptions about a lot in this piece: reads like it was written by a combination of Jeff Garzik, Vitalik, Ver and Zooko.
Not gentlemen at all.
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:27:03
This is gentlemenish, actually. The trend for Bitcoin is constant up. $100 moves could soon become blips..
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:39:46
With CT:
1) buy Bitcoin (perhaps give some identity away)
2) transfer to a CT-enabled wallet
3) transactions out of that wallet now (including payment channels) are now obfuscated by amount transferred via blinding-key... No one will know (except your counterparty) how much you are sending in any given transaction (or payment channel new-state)
This is a strict upgrade to the Bitcoin Network if the size of the blinding keys can get slightly smaller than they are now (Adam Back recently came up with a proposal to reduce their size by an additional 24%).
I am very excited to see this get included in Core.

Incredibly encouraging. 
Fungibility upgrades are equal to if not more important than scaling upgrades. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 09:06:06
There's one point I can agree with:
Coinbase, and other major companies, need to hire competent developers to help with core development
@_date: 2017-01-31 22:38:28
Promoting altcoins is not allowed in this forum - your attitude towards Bitcoin isn't one I find very engaging or optimistic either : take your attitude elsewhere
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:10:54
this is gentlemen.
@_date: 2017-01-01 04:36:42
This is reasonably gentlemen

Glad to see _Fungibility First_ on the list.

This is... Reasonably gentlemen (minus points for the whole ether bit)

And thus, a new meme was born
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:56:32
There are proposals for what you are looking for without closing or reopening a channel, called "Splicing"-- it will enable you to add to (or subtract from) a channel state. 
However, if you follow Lightning development, it is not likely that this feature will be part of any '1.0' release of the Network.
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:05:15
This is important. 
Also - a block size increase is not a goal. Scalablity is a goal.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:22:41
He's almost as bad at comprehension as Tim Swanson
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:46:58
 - pretty awesome
@_date: 2015-07-03 05:45:23
what a waste of developer time. Completely useless feature.
@_date: 2015-07-03 05:59:07
it's not, in the slightest, useful for anyone.
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:23:37
Hostile forks and the politicization of the development process is not helping.

This is gentlemen.
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:29:29
actually - he's quite good at _over_ simplifying things... partially why you think it's so 'accessible' is because he's glossing over so much. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:18:50
Do you have any idea how hard each of those individuals work to keep the blockchain from _not_ failing?
Come out from under Hearn's thumb and think for a minute - these individuals have held, strongly I might add, the same beliefs for how to build &amp; develop Bitcoin long before they worked for Blockstream. 
This 'conflict of interest' you speak of? ...maybe you should check Big Block Hearn's conflict of interest.

This is about an altcoin, and against the forum rules - paging (or other mod) to remove
@_date: 2015-10-23 04:05:18
This is off topic (altcoin) - paging @_date: 2015-10-24 18:48:51
Gemz are a priced altcoin, and as such compete against Bitcoin for Liquidity - this is a competitive thing to Bitcoin, regardless of what the creator tacks on top to make it appear less so.
Paging to remove as this post promotes an altcoin, and is against forum rules.

Statement from Gmax
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:45:03
Peter's assumptions have been debunked numerous times, and the need for larger blocks is not particularly urgent.
Let's be pragmatic about finding a better solution without resorting to a plan that presumes decentralization can handle a doubling every two years for the next 20 years. 
The 2-4-8 over the next 4 years plan is much more reasonable AND agreed to in principle by our leader Gavin.
@_date: 2016-07-29 00:23:26
This. 
Jstolfi has an agenda here, and that should be clear - fungibility first. Upgrades to Bitcoin's privacy, spendability, and anti-blacklisting capacities should be championed... Not questioned.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:07:50
You could actually expand on this to make a very solid undergraduate/master's thesis if you took a look at some of the 'macro/micro-prudential' regulation policies governments have been taking, as well as potentially expand your commentary into a more formal critique on the burdens imposed by welfare-expenditure states on growth (i.e., growth is in a race against stagnation, and minimization-of-all-risk policies by governments coupled with the burden of paying for non-economic-contributing members of society...)
You could draw our own conclusions, but that paper in 25 pages is a honors undergrad thesis, and in 40+ is a master's (Polisci/econ/sociology/Poliecon at any top 10 University)
Good luck, keep hodling.
