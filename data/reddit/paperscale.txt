So I know there's been several posts about not investing recklessly, or just buying because "OMG it's going up! Gotta buy before it's too late!" So when *should* I buy? I'm not going to invest much, at least for now. Like maybe $50 in bit,lite, and eth. So it's hardly anything at all. Even at this level of "investing" is there a reason I should wait for it to drop again before buying? If it even will? 
Like I said, people say don't buy on emotion or just because it's been going up, but why not? I mean since I'm not doing much, it's like what I'd spend going to Vegas, right?

Is there a way to do it on GDAX that doesn't take 4 days to process? It said to deposit money to my usd wallet it would take 4 days

I found some games on the play store that are like spinner or silly games with lots of ads and pays in Satoshi

Ah ok. So then I suppose the other question I had was I've seen posts about people getting charged huge fees for buying or selling or something on coinbase, but using GDAX is free or very cheap. Am I going to get charged crazy for just buying $50 in each of the coins on coinbase?

What do you use, and why?

Probably a real stupid question, but are there any legit free Bitcoin miners or games? I've seen them pop up on Google play and other places, but are these real or is it some kind of scam/ fake/ dangerous?

Yeah I just found a few. I mean I've earned a whopping 200 or so Satoshi, so hardly anything, but its basically just watch ads, gets several cents haha
