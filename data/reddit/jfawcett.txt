Because this fake filibuster was nothing more than useless grandstanding.

I come here to laugh at the moronic postings. I don't post, bit I like reading the ramblings of all these fools who somehow believe that they are all going to be fabulously rich from bitcoin. I feel like I'm watching the movie airplane remade to be made about forex traders.

I'll tell you what needs to be done for me to accept bitcoin.  It has to be far, far easier to get ahold of.  As it stands, I've been watching bitcoin for almost two years.  I am not an idiot, but I am also not very technically inclined.  I could probably buy bitcoins, but I don't because I have no idea how to protect my money once converted to bitcoin.  For widespread adoption to take place converting your money  to bitcoin needs to be done simply enough that my grandfather could do it, and it has to be done absolutely securely.  Also, if bitcoin is going to take off in any serious form, then most users will have to stop this nonsense hoarding of bitcoin for capital gains. If nobody spends bitcoin, it's worthless as a currency and will be doomed to a nerd commodity.  Lastly, there needs to be someone who will step up and insure bitcoins.  Right now the FDIC insures my bank deposits up to a certain amount.  I feel safe with my savings in a bank account for that reason alone. My savings will never be completely held in bitcoin until coins are insured.  I simply can not risk the potential loss.

For the sake of what?  Maybe you could explain why your meetup group has grown?  Was it due to the recent massive pump and dump hype?

I'll ask without the snarky comment. When did the dollar crash?

Did you read the article? Paul did not "endorse" bitcoin. Are you just reading what you want to read?

Bitcoin are not a stock and should not be compared to a stock.

Use your words, doc.

Listen man. There is absolutely no need to be rude. If you think about it, you should welcome all sides of the bitcoin discussion. If you want to live in a bubble surrounded by yes men instead of listening to reason from both sides you are welcome to do so. I for one sure as shit want to hear both the positive and negative.  Following only the loudest supporters is exactly why so many uninformed people got burned so badly this week.  On the flip side any supporters who only listen to the negative side could potentially miss out on helping something so potentially good get a stable footing.

Bitcoin is a currency not an investment vehicle.

To put it simply, you are looking looking at bitcoin as an investment vehicle.  Bitcoin is not an investment vehicle. Bitcoin is a currency.
