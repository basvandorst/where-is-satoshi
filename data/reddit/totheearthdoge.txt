Anyone know what's the final conclusion of the devs on this paper?

&lt;pedantic mode&gt;
The byzantine generals problem is proven (as in mathematically proven) to be unsolvable. What Satoshi/Bitcoin did is provide an algorithm which provides a high enough reliability that it can be considered 'solved' for pretty much any practical use.
&lt;superpedantic mode&gt;(Actually algorithms for this kind of problems did already exist, but AFAIK they weren't as practically usable as Bitcoin's)&lt;/superpedantic mode&gt;
&lt;/pedantic mode&gt;
