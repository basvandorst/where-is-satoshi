The average user doesn't have anywhere near 24GB of RAM. I doubt most normal gamers have that much.

I bought some at 18 but I also bought at 13 for the end of year sale.

If it's not enforced then it's not against the law.

I'm never in that much of a hurry and shipping is usually free or very cheap in the US.

Had no idea they price matched Amazon, that's pretty cool.

Who buys hardware in a brick and mortar store anymore? The last computer parts I bought at a physical store was back in the 90s.

With these fluctuations it's hard to not make money buying dips and waiting for it to go up again to sell. Wash and repeat

You don't have to buy at the extreme lows or sell at the absolute peaks to profit.

If the future trajectory is going up, then it's foolish not to buy the dips and sell highs along the way. It's so volatile it's hard not to end up in the black more often than not.

There was a 10+% dip this week. I bought more at $5500. I'll pull some profit at another stagnant high and wait for the next dip to do it all over again.

The Lambo would have been the cheaper option.
