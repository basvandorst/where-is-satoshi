Based upon what exactly?
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:31:54
Their customer service is god awful.  Customer support people who don't answer your question and that's only IF they even respond to you at all.  
The only time I hear a positive remark about them is when someone exposes a security risk.  Ok so they focus on security which should be a given considering their purpose.  What good is any of that if you don't respond to your customers?

Just curious to know your thoughts on how BTC can be made to be viable?  What will it take?
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:23:54
You are the ONLY god damn ninja who fucking gets Bitcoin!  
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:38:05
Which clearly isn't anything based on your unfounded recommendations regarding BTC.  None of you (including me) haven't a clue what BTC is going to do.  I can tell you BTC is controlled at the whims of the whales who own large quantities and they can easily manipulate the price.  Keep telling yourself BTC is an "investment".  
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:58:20
You're too stupid to know when your getting trolled....brah.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:41:51
Brah?  What are you...10?  Nerd.  Learn what a troll does you child.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:38:53
Please go dump your life savings into BTC.  All $742 worth.

People's heads will explode when they find out one day Satoshi is a Wall Street entity.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:10:47
Greatest pump and dump in the history of man.
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:30:33
After a month of dealing with Kraken's bullshit I gave up on them.  They have the worst "customer service" I've ever encountered.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:11:00
LMAO.  You really didn't pick up on that post did you?  $8?
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:22:47
I love how the crypto kool aid drinkers don't get the irony of this headline post.
Let me get this straight.  All of you crypto kool aid drinkers are anti big bad wolf banking system and are pro crypto so your crypto can increase in value so at some point in the future you do what again exactly?  Convert it to dollars so you can retire?  Bwhahahahahahahahah!  The irony...oh the irony.
Bitcoin will go down in history as the greatest pump and dump in history.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:29:41
I understand the block chain exceptionally well.  It has nothing to do with the tech.  It has everything to do with adoption. Crypto transactions are so minimal in the grand scale of daily transactions they cannot even be measured.  
I can advocate all day long for crypto to replace traditional money systems but that doesn't mean it will.  The OP makes a blind inference BTC is going to $100K.  If someone can give me the path to how that happens then I would like to hear it.  I've given the path to why BTC is a myth and will never reach those levels.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:15:02
Your argument is flawed and most certainly copied and pasted from some Bitcoin Positivity Forum designed to make you feel safe and secure that the 1 or 2 BTC you own will make you the next Warren Buffet.  Not happening son.  Time to wake up to the greatest pump and dump in history.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:15:49
Satoshi isn't a person.  Now go back to sleep.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:42:28
EXACTLY ! You neva go full retard!  I know who I am.  I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:22:11
Pay very close attention to the upcoming EU meetings regarding international banking laws.  They are about to get a massive...and I mean massive infusion of power.  I'm 90% certain I've uncovered who Satoshi really is.  And it's not a person.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:30:18
BTC will NEVER hit $100K.  Within the next 2 years it will literally fade out to zero value.  The upcoming EU sanctions on crypto currency are going to decimate crypto currency.  Decimate it.  And anyone thinking the fucking planet would ever decentralize from a banking system that has been in effect since the Egyptians is full retard.  Been one long pump and dump scheme.  
EDIT:  Even the irony of the headline of this laughable.  Crypto to $ conversion so all you crypto kool aid drinkers who somehow think crypto is the future are literally banking on crypto skyrocketing so you can convert digital currency into fiat.  I know all of the crypto kool aid drinkers who just read that fried some neurons in the realization they are being used.  PUMP AND DUMP.  Crypto converted to fiat.  Crypto converted to fiat.  Crypto converted to fiat.
How do you not see the fallacy?
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:46:38
This is a logical fallacy.  Adoption is what would be required for crypto to take over.  And herein lies it's certain death.  Let's say for arguments sake that crypto replaces traditional currency systems.  This means every country and every business world wide would need to adopt trading goods and services for crypto.  This would then require massive regulation of crypto necessary to stabilize price.  BTC can go through massive fluctuations in a single hour.  No business is going to accept $100 in crypto at 10 am only to have it be worth $60 at 5 pm.  They would go out of business.  So the very thing crypto advocates say is evil about the current banking system is the very thing crypto would become if it replaced traditional currency systems.  The value of "money" regardless if it is in the form of crypto or fiat is and has always been perception.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:24:24
Do you realize how ignorant you are?  Why would a bank shill make the comment I did?  A bank shill would say the opposite.  You are proof of why the largest pump and dump in history has been so effective.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:38:06
But you realize the barrier to crypto on a global scale is adoption.  Every country would need to convert their current monetary system to one based on block chain technology.  Every business would need to convert their traditional collections to crypto.  Let's say this happens.  Crypto would then become heavily regulated in order to stabilize valuation.  BTC fluxes as much as 20% in an hour.  No business owner is going to accept $100 in BTC at 10 am only to have it be worth $60 by 5 pm.  That is a business model for bankruptcy.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:37:31
My name is irrelevant and you should know this.  However, in the back of your mind this information has already been catalogued away.  When the price begins to go south and it appears to be a trend in mass sell offs your memory recall mechanism will kick in.  You will find yourself Googling "EU Banking Regulations".  By then it will have been too late.  There is someone of extreme notoriety who has been publicly (but covertly)  signaling warnings to the BTC markets.  Warren Buffet is a very interesting fellow who feels no sorrow for a pale horse.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:19:33
Huh?  Are you proving people only comprehend 60% of what they read?
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:38:04
To all you dumbasses who think you are going to become millionaires off of your ONE BTC.  You need WIDESPREAD MASS ADOPTION before BTC, or crypto for that matter, EVER replaces shit.  I guarantee 99%  of the dumbasses who believe this shit took macro and micro economics.  What the fuck were you idiots doing in class?  Full on fucking retards.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:19:06
Don't say I didn't give you AMPLE warning.  The "BTC TO THE MOON" hive mindset is very reason there has always been and will always be snake oil salesmen.  BTC will in fact go down in history as the largest pump and dump ever.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:46:37
I would love for BTC to go to the Moon.  But it won’t because there is no mass adoption.  And there will be no mass adoption because of BTC now becoming the obsolete crypto while alts with no brand recognition take BTC value away.  You guys get it whenever another fucking alt coin is either purchased or created it devalues BTC that much more right?  No none of you don’t because I never see anyone mention this.  Just idiots who think they are going to become millionaires from nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:18:44
Can you currently travel the planet across international borders purchasing whatever you need at anytime you need with crypto only?  When you sell your crypto what do you convert it to to retire with your millions?  Yeah...the irony...oh the irony.
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:09:04
It should read, "6000 you motherfuckers!"
"6000 motherfuckers!" conjured an entirely different image I was expecting to see.  Like a screen full of dudes who were motherfuckers.  
Because they had been fucking mothers.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:24:45
Lie   The block chain allows for anonymous transactions.  Goooooo baaaaaack to sleeeeeep.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:45:31
I bought BTC at $8 and have never sold any.  I'm holding until the very last BTC is mined before I sell.

"Wedocrazyshit guys"
That's hilarious.
