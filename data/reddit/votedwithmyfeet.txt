Me and my team will create a new crypto currency and exchange US dollars for the man hours and expenses we incur in doing so.  Let's assume that amounts to $1,000,000.  Let's say azzazaz buys all our currency units at $1 a unit or 1,000,000 units.  He could then in turn hire another team to create another cryto currency system.  We feel we have accepted the lowest wages a group of programmers will work for and incurred the bare bones of expenses.  What if azzazaz asks the team to create the system for just 500,000 bitcoins?  Why would that team of programmers accept just 500,000 of this new crypto?  Their labor and expenses amount to $1,000,000.  All they can convert their 500,000 units into are $500,000.  OH but wait!!! I've managed to convince the idiot masses those 1,000,000 units are worth $2 per unit?  No wait, $20 a unit?  Oh look!! The idiot masses are now buying my units for $2000 a unit!! 
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I suppose I can convince you Hilary Clinton is an honest hotty.   I guess people forget the dotcom stocks or the shoe Crocs.  People rationalized those bubbles as well.  Bitcoin is worth the number in existence divided by the the man hours it would take to replicate the system just as the lowest price an ounce of gold can go is the cost it would take to get an ounce out of the ground.  And when the price of gold falls below that amount, production stops until demand and price rise.  If new technology reduces the cost to retrieve gold from the ground, well that could result in a drop in gold prices.  How difficult would it be to clone the Bitcoin crypto currency system over and over and over?  Money is method of  exchange for labor.  Stock prices represent the present value of future cash flows are ebb and flow with the discount rate, the cost of renting money.  Cigarettes are currency in jail.  I get that.  7 billion people on the planet want to put 10% of their assets in crypto currencies.  Ok that explains the run up in price just like all the many retail outlets that wanted to stock their shelves with a line of crocs at $40 a pair drove the ultimate short squeeze in Crocs stock....until the Chinese who manufactured the crocs started making knock $5 knock offs.  Vegas wasn't built on winners folks.
