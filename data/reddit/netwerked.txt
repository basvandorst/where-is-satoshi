I think as long as you have over 8 peers, you're making a positive contribution to the distributed Bitcoin network.  Once you've downloaded the entire blockchain, your client spends a lot of time verifying transactions and relaying newly discovered blocks to its connected peers.
One good question is how much data does a Bitcoin node transfer?  For the past month, I've been keeping statistics on a few nodes that I run.  It varies greatly from node to node on a daily basis, and being connected to more peers generally results in more traffic.  If you have a very stable network connection, you'll be connected to more peers over time.  30-75 peers is typical after 2-3 days, while ~125 is the highest I've seen.  Traffic on a given day also depends on whether one or more connected peers is trying to download part or all of the blockchain.
On a node with 50-100Mbit/s bandwidth, 200MB-1GB is downloaded per day, with an average of 500MB per day.  Uploaded data is 1-15GB per day, with an average of 7GB per day.
On a node with 1Gbit/s bandwidth, more data is transferred.  One node I looked at had a 500MB daily download average, while another had a 1.15GB daily download average.  Typically 11-12GB is uploaded on average per day.
If you can upload 700KB/s, that's about 60GB a day, which is more than enough bandwidth.  If you can upload 700Kbit/s, then that's about 7.6GB a day, which is still respectable.  If your bandwidth is getting maxed out, you should be able to limit the maximum number of connected nodes.

It is bad practice to nickel and dime customers, unless your target audience is extremely cost conscious (low income households).
People would prefer a Bitcoin discount as opposed to a credit card surcharge.  A discount is viewed as a reward for taking a certain action, while a surcharge is viewed as a penalty.

In this situation, I'm not sure if Walgreens or the bank is going to eat the cost of the fraud.  Since the card holder is still in possession of the card, a counterfeit card was probably used for the transaction.  It would be unfair to Walgreens if they couldn't trust debit card transactions, where the customer actually enters their PIN.
To help end this type of fraud, the US is finally moving to a chip and PIN system in the next few years.  Beginning October 2015, if a merchant doesn't have the new chip and PIN terminal at their location, they could be held liable for fraudulent charges.  This article explains it more:

Overall, there is a constant battle of three events:
1. Newer, cheaper, faster, and more efficient mining equipment is developed, tested, sold, and brought online.  Once end users receive the equipment and put it into production, the hash rate increases.
2. Older equipment is taken offline, because it is no longer profitable to use.  At some point, end users realize that it is no longer profitable to operate old mining equipment, because it costs more to operate it than any income it produces.
3. If the price of Bitcoin increases, then previously unprofitable mining equipment can be brought back online.  If the price of Bitcoin falls, older mining equipment could be temporarily shut off, since it is more profitable to just buy Bitcoins.  
After the large 24.93% June 29th difficulty increase, it looks like a lot of older mining equipment was shut down during the first third of July.  Butterfly Labs equipment was very popular last year, and all of this equipment is near the end of its useful life.  (I sold my Jalapeno during this time.)  This likely caused the July 12th increase to be very small (3.08%).  Perhaps this continued to happen for most of July and the first week in August, since the next two increases were 8.08% and 5.3%.  Now hash rate is on the rise again at faster rates.

It's great that NewEgg is offering this promotion, but the link takes you directly to a page that offers 3 different mining kits.  Basically you build a computer with a powerful graphics card to mine Bitcoin.  Being very optimistic, let's say that the assembled $1,260 kit will let you mine at 600Mh/s using 300 watts.
According to  you will earn $0 worth of Bitcoins and spend about $30 in electricity over a one month period.
If you really want to experiment with mining, it looks like for about $499 you can buy a Prospector 200.  It uses 1,000 watts and has a hash rate of 200Gh/s.  Leave it running for 6 months, then turn it off.  Wait for Bitcoin to rise to $2,500 and you've doubled your $499 investment.

I don't think a 5 year old would really care about this answer, and I'm not sure I could explain it to a 5 year old.  I'll do my best to explain the article in simple terms.
eBay is a publicly traded company, so it issues shares to shareholders.  On August 19th, the share price was $53, so you could pay $5,300 to own 100 shares.  On August 21st, your investment would be worth $5,600, or a gain of $300.  As a stock holder, you can hold on to your shares indefinitely and sell the shares on your schedule.  The disadvantage of being a share holder is that it ties up a lot of your capital.
If you want to do some more risky investing, you can buy or sell stock options.  An option gives you the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain price on or before a certain expiration date.  For example, eBay $55 call options give you the right to buy eBay for $55 a share on or before September 20th, 2014.  On the morning of August 19th, you could have bought a 1 lot of eBay September $55 calls for $40 ($0.40 x 100 shares = $40).  On August 21st, you could have sold the options for $132 ($1.32 x 100 shares = $132).  You would have had a gain of $92, more than tripling your money.  As an option holder, you can use a little money to leverage a lot of stock.  The disadvantage of holding options is that they lose some time value every day, and they could become worthless relatively fast if the stock price moves the wrong way.
5,500 lot example:
On the 18th of August, it looks like someone bought 5,500 lots for about $38 a lot or a total of $209,000.  On August 21st, the 5,500 options would be worth $726,000.  The option owner could sell them back to lock in the profit.  **Apparently, it looks like someone knew of the news/rumors that eBay might spin off PayPal, and they used that information to their advantage.  Looks a lot like it could have been inside information, hence the SEC comment.**
Why did the price of the option triple?
1. The option is less than 1 month away from expiration.  With everything else being equal (the stock price doesn't move and the overall market remains consistent), the option's extrinsic value (time value) becomes worth a little less each day.  We know the time value was about around 40 cents a share before the big price move.
2. On August 18th, eBay stock was worth less than $55, so the option was "out of the money."  If the stock price never rose to $55, the option would slowly fade from roughly $0.40/share to $0.  On August 21st, the stock price went up to $56, so the option's intrinsic value would be worth exactly $1 a share at expiration.  The option was $1 "in the money."  At the moment a stock's price passes the option's strike price, the value of the option increases rapidly.
3. The underlying stock does not change prices very wildly.  In other words, compared to the price move on August 21st, the stock is relatively calm.  You can look at a stock's chart to see how likely it is to rapidly increase or decrease in value.  When a stock is not very volatile, the time value is cheaper.  Because the stock made a big move, the time value portion of the option probably increased in value too.
So on August 21st, the option was worth about $1.32 a share.  About 90-95 cents of that would be its intrinsic value (it's in the money) and 37-42 cents would be its extrinsic value (remaining time value).

A credit check is performed to determine how likely you are to pay your rent on time (or if at all).  It's a landlord conducting due diligence.  It does not mean that you're opening a line of credit, and rent payment history is usually not reported on credit reports.
 
If you don't pay a lease as agreed, your landlord can sue.  If he wins, your credit report will indicate that you have a public record.  When a potential landlord is reviewing your credit report, having a public record of an outstanding judgment for non-payment of rent can be a deal killer.
Utilities don't usually report your payment history to the credit reporting agencies, but they do provide credit reference letters upon request.  Generally only people with no credit or poor credit need to request such a letter.  The letter can get your deposit waived when establishing new utility accounts, but it doesn't build your credit score.  It might be considered when applying for a loan.

Running a node from home is not the most efficient option.  With the inconvenience of hitting your data caps and keeping a computer on 24/7, it's probably more convenient to buy a VPS.  They're as cheap as $19 a year, although you'll see higher quality services around the $50-100/year price level.

The amount of traffic on my nodes is very similar.  Usually a below 10GB/day with occasional spikes to 15GB/day.

Both of those locations have relatively slow 50Mbit/s connections, but that's faster than 1.3Mbit/s (or 10.4Mbit/s).  Your bandwidth is an important factor in determining how much traffic goes through your node.  In theory, you should be sending less than 7GB per day, so 4GB sounds reasonable.

As an industry, Bitcoin hardware companies have a bad reputation for over promising an under delivering.  Demand for these products seems to be extremely high, as the companies stay in business and customers tolerate these conditions for the most part.
Provenance ASIC is a new company with an unproven track record.  They have the right concept-- create a cheaper 28nm chip that hashes faster and uses less electricity.  Design the production process so that chips for hashing Bitcoin and alt-coins can be produced at the same time, as demand dictates.
There are two main risks to investing in this company IMHO.  1) Can they deliver on their promise?  Only time will tell.  2) Can they raise enough money?  The IPO has been on the market for a week, and they have sold less than 5,000 out of 200,000 shares.  If they can't raise enough money, they will have to fall back on a less profitable contingency plan.

I run a node in each of the available weloveservers.net data centers.  I'm sure I'm not the only one running a node there.  In any case, I still manage to average 30-80 connections.
When a Satoshi client makes connections to other nodes, it is smart enough not to connect to more than one node in the same /24 subnet.  In other words, if Bob's Satoshi client connects to my node on the 198.49.66.x Orlando weloveservers.net network, it will not connect to your node on that network.
Since there are thousands of nodes, and each node typically has less than 100 connections, there is plenty of "connection diversity" to support multiple bitcoin nodes within the same datacenter and even the same subnet.  Of course, if you're setting up a VPS solely to run a bitcoin node, it's a good idea to geographically diversify.

It's treated as a capital gain.  If you bought $4,000 worth of Bitcoin and later sold it for $6,000, then usually you would owe tax on your $2,000 gain.  Tax rates vary on whether it was a long term gain (1 year or over) or short term (less than 1 year).  Long term has a more favorable tax rate than short term.  If you have your Bitcoin inside of a Roth IRA, then no tax is ever due on it.
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:21:43
(Assuming this is the United States) The taxation of the $4,000 that you use to buy your Bitcoin is a separate matter.  You could have earned that money through your paycheck, in which case it will be declared as income and then taxed.  You could have borrowed the money, in which case no income tax is due on it.  You could have sold your house and moved into an apartment, in which case it is unlikely that you owe tax on the $4,000 (unless you sold your house at a huge profit).  Perhaps you sold some stocks at a loss to get the $4,000 to buy the Bitcoin.  In that case, the IRS will be owing you some money.
Perhaps you are 15 years old and earned that $4,000 from several years of babysitting or collecting an allowance.  Perhaps a relative gave you the money as a gift.  In these cases, the $4,000 is not taxable.

When Bitcoin was in its infancy, people mined them using their computers.  Bitcoins were stored in wallets on local computers, and they were worth perhaps 1 to 10 cents each.  I'm sure that hard drives crashed and data (wallets/Bitcoins) were lost.  Three years ago, a British man threw away a hard drive with 7,500 Bitcoins on it.  He realized his mistake later.  It's a similar concept to forgetting your username and/or password to an online service, but there is no customer service department to help you regain access.

I just figured out the solution, and it just happened to be luck that I thought to try something out of the ordinary.  Ultimately, I think Coinbase changed something, and they may need to fix something on their end.
Background: I initially used Authy a long time ago (more than 1-2 years ago) prior to switching to Google Authenticator.  I didn't even have Authy installed on my phone anymore for over a year.  I was still logged in to Coinbase on one of my accounts, and on the security page it showed next to my phone number that I had Authy enabled.
Solution: I went to the Apple App store and downloaded Authy.  When I first opened the app right after it was installed, it sent me a SMS so that I could use my phone with the app.  Right after that, it said that Coinbase was requesting a token.  (at the bottom of the app, it listed my Coinbase accounts too).  I entered that token on coinbase, and it accepted it!
I then disabled Authy and had to set up Google Authenticator all over again using the QR code displayed on the website.  I then verified that I could log in and out and also change security settings.  I repeated the same procedure with my other Coinbase account.

Spending Bitcoin is different than selling it.  The price of Bitcoin as a whole does not decrease when it is used to purchase goods or pay debts.  However, if someone decides to sell a large amount Bitcoins for cash, then you temporarily have more supply than demand, which causes the price to go down.  I hope this answers what you were asking.
