Arbs are pricing in tether risk.

Just speculating, but they could use tether to coordinate trades across multiple exchanges without drawing unwanted attention to a Bitfinex BTC price premium.

The theory is that bitfinex / tether has printed 100s of Millions of USDT and used them THEMSELVES to buy Bitcoin while also setting off a FOMO stampede by investors who put 'real' money into the system.

Or tether was printing USDT to buy BTC.

This.  Coindesk news release last night brought tether risk to many peoples' attention, and usdt -&gt; btc then btc-&gt; usd trades quickly drove the bitfinex btc premium from $150ish to $500ish.

I can't explain the bitstamp premium above GDAX... Anyone???

My own theory (from reading their entire post history at bitcointalk) is that they tried to make a legitimate business from the beginning, but when their banking got shut down, rather than just closing up shop the temptation to keep things going by 'cheating' was just too great.
Being in control of the USDT issuance would allow them to coordinate buys and do wash trading at every exchange that uses USDT, so as to not direct obvious attention to Bitfinex leading every rise in price.

This is tongue in cheek, but a bitfinex / tether employee posted on bitcointalk in 2014 saying they were working on a mechanism to push the price of btc over 10k.  Doesn't seem like something a person in his position should even joke about!

By my back of the envelope calcs that was about $5M of net selling on GDAX in 4 minutes.

I did dollar-cost-averaging a few years back for a short period of time, but then stopped when my job earnings and the price of bitcoin were both trending down.  At the end of 2016 I looked back at the previous two years with a sense of dismay, imagining if I had just continued DCA with a nominal $ amount each day.
So at the beginning of 2017, I decided how much total $ I'd want to invest in Bitcoin and I have been investing 1/365th of that amount each day. I am largely indifferent to the daily price swings.  If the price is up, I'm happy that my existing investment has gone up in value.  If the price is down, I'm happy my daily $ investment can purchase more bitcoin.
