I think part of the "hate" is that it's perceived as being heavily promoted by a lot of people who want to get rich from doing relatively little work, whilst most of society is slogging away at work to get bills paid. The sad reality is that there's truth in that. This leads to genuine benefits being disregarded or not looked into.

I use a truecrypt container that i regularly update and give on a flash stick to my bro and sister containing all my bank details, money locations and wallet info. The 40+ digit passphrase is stored a a copy at mine, one with my attorney. In the event of my death (and only then), family will have easy access to all my assets but no one robbing my house or any of the data holders will have access to that info. I'd hate for everything i've saved and built up not to all go to my family if i died!

I'm saying that the price increase the next day of $40 is meaningless; it's what is know as confirmation bias, it's not as if you predicted the market or something clever. The price could have gone down the net day. In fact, if you're always talking about btc then there are going to have been many times that the price will have dropped the next day.

One thing that I don't understand is why the "bitcoin will save the world" crowd don't realise that half of all bitcoin being held by ~1000 people is trading a government controlling money supply to private individuals controlling money supply. 
I can certainly see cryptocurrencies having a place in the future, but that the first iteration is the final iteration is a ridiculous proposition.

This is we come here just to jerk in a circle! No rational discussion that does not conform to our limited biases please.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:54:31
The obvious (at least i thought it was) fallacy in this argument is that you are implying that bitcoin and the pre-mass-adoption internet are the same situation. In effect, you are saying that bitcoin can succeed as computers have whilst not considering it on its own merits. The two situations are completely different and incomparable and at best is a mistaken thought, at worst completely disingenuous to suggest so. It's a clear use of confirmation bias; who's to say that bitcoin will end up like a Facebook instead of a Bebo?
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:24:51


This kind of silly statement is why so many btc proponents are perceived as being morons. Because they are. Shame it detracts from the real positive aspects of btc and puts people off something that could be to their benefit.

@_date: 2013-12-04 10:40:18


So you basically avoided qualifying this then? 
I think bitocins can be great for facilitating money flows. But proponents need to stop dreaming that bitcoins can replace everything and be realistic about its advantages and limitations. Earlier you said it was better for merchants. Now you're saying it's for buying cars and sending overseas. Now you're saying that people will still have credit cards, but will convert their earnings to bitcoins to then pay their credit cards? No wonder most outsiders think bitcoiners aren't nearly as smart as they think they are.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:50:32
And clear incentives for customers to still use credit cards over bitcoins (free, insured, ease of use, lack of credit risk, speed...)

Thank you for brining some actual sense to the BTC circlejerk. It is most refreshing. I find it frustrating that anyone coming alone to speak logically and rationally is called a naysayer. I don't know why i'm still shocked when people say "1BTC should be worth $1million" basically because they read it on some blog somewhere.

We Europeans have a proud history of social welfare. You can let the disadvantaged drown in poverty on your side of the pond; we frown on that attitude here. It's people with attitudes like yours that really damage bitcoin's reputation.

@_date: 2013-11-30 14:47:55
Yeah i'm with you. Gonna keep trading up on the alts until the inevitable crash. There is completely unsustainable growth in all these markets, so profit on it while it lasts. Just make sure you're not the one left without a chair when the music stops. Many people think they're gonna get rich quickly and easily without really realising that they're just gambling. BTC seems to have made lots of people think either that they're clever traders or that some how that typical market forces don't apply here. Not really bothered because they're the people i'm taking money from.
And don't get me wrong, i think cryptos will be important for trading on the internet and have a genuine usefulness. I just think that we're not there yet and the rampant speculation is not a strength or in their favour. Stability is a necessity for usefulness. At the moment 99% of all the moves are people trying to get rich, not people trying to pay for their VPNs.

In my country i pay tax at point of purchase and do not submit annual taxes as it is paid directly from my income. I didn't actually mean with respect to purchases, but those arguing they can keep their income unknown so as not to submit to income tax, which is the most egalitarian tax (although i think we haven't got it right and it should be weighted higher at the upper percentiles)

@_date: 2013-06-11 14:45:51
That's why you have accounts to use public (say an email address and maybe an SN if that's your thing) and separate accounts that always run through SSL&amp;TOR and are NEVER accessed without. There should be ZERO connection between public and private. That way all your browsing and interneting are still protected, but you can maintain some "public" profile. 
SN "should not be on the list" is a naive way to look at how people use the internet, but i agree that it should be used very cautiously and assumed that it is monitored. Most jobs will need an insecure email and SN accounts are often an unfortunate reality.
My solution is to have a tablet that i use for work emails, so is my public device, and a laptop and computer that run through VPNs and I never access anything identifiable through them.

@_date: 2013-12-17 07:34:56
Oh yeah i agree they are greedy, and that's partly a role the state should take - to prevent/reduce it. The point i was really making is that the *majority* of us believe in our social responsibility. I feel no guilt that this should be enforced.
A big problem is that the more money you have, the more means to hide/move/obfuscate it that are at your disposal. It is a sad fact that the ultra rich club pay a lower percentage than someone on 100k without those means. This is how it is, not how it should be.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:45:24
I'm surprised that so few people are taking notice of this. It seems to me that 99% of transactions are just people speculating. I thought BTC was supposed to be used as an alternative for transactions. Without price stability it's useless. For me to buy anything in BTC i have to convert fiat to BTC, wait for clearing, then buy. There's quite a lot of risk to that, not to mention the actual inconvenience of waiting days for funds to clear to btc.
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:18:08
They're often funded by the masses to the benefit of a few
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:29:12
Troll or blinded by subjectivity? Care to offer some reasoning to your opinions? 
Maybe BTC is easier if you are actually holding enough, but otherwise I would say credit cards are far easier because I do need to to credit any account to make a purchase, wait days for funds to clear (which incidentally is another cost i would have to bear), there is no currency conversion required, no conversion risk, transactions are instantaneous. I pay zero interest on purchases over the course of a month, allowing me to pay when i chose. Given that we are also talking in the present; my credit card offers me insurance and buyer protection, fraud protection, warranties. 
I am a supporter of bitcoin and hold some. It seems i am one of the few that is able to accept that despite its benefits, it does have limitations and will never replace gold and all currencies as some loonies seem to think. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:21:02
Yeah i guess. All extra costs a vendor has to bear. But i get extended warranties with my cards, theft and fraud protection, *instant* use around the world. All i'm saying is that i completely agree BTC has a place on the internet, but it cannot replace credit cards, only take a piece of the pie. You'd have to be blind to reason to suggest that it could completely replace credit cards.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:22:24


This is the part i agree with. 
You're welcome to keep your anti-social welfare opinions :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:51:07
The benefits are for the vendor, not the customer. Unless you are paid in bitcoins, it's far easier to use a credit card
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:40:32
I get that, but i then have a credit risk holding BTC. Which means i hold fiat, covert to BTC before buying, then buy in BTC. Somewhat pointless for me, though not the vendor. Don't get me wrong, i'm pro bitcoin. But i'd never use them to buy anything online that i could with a credit card (except where i value pseudo-anonymity). Credit cards still offer more convenience and security in general.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:15:53


It's all well and good to say that in hindsight but lots of people have got fucked because they trusted their guts over reason. BTC is great for many logical reasons and they would've been why you should've held them, not your "gut"
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:56:51

@_date: 2013-12-05 01:47:47
I never said they were worthless, or even implied it. In fact i earlier stated the converse. They certainly are well placed to complement existing systems. But they have real benefits, but also very real limitations. They are not some panacea for all that is wrong with fiat currency or the current economical systems. 
In fact the only point i was making at the beginning was that the only benefits in *shopping* with them is for the vendor not the consumer, and stated several reasons why. You replied with the opinion that this is not the case but failed to give any real reasons reasons, but instead talked about buying cars (which i can do on my card) and sending money overseas (which, incidentally, i think btc is good for), and even went so far as to say bitcoin is "better for everything" before coming back full circle to where we started, "credit cards are worse for merchants". Where actually (surprisingly) we both agree; they are worse for merchants, but only the merchants not the customer, who actually ends up disadvantaged. Credit cards are more than just IOUs and a lot of people use them for reasons other than borrowing.
I'm not being a jackass, I'm merely pointing out that your argument has been all over the place, merely statements without explanation, and not even addressed the only issue i wanted to comment on. I have no interest in discussing your singularity theory as i've wasted enough time already without having to point out a couple of flaws in your logic there.

there's rarely such a thing as free money, especially easy free money, so i just assume there's a reason for the difference. i take it there's high transaction costs at btc-e then?

I'm surprised how few comments there are pointing to this... People read the title and ignore the content. To me it says that current valuation would imply a 1% penetration in 10 years time, which is huge. It's obvious that the people saying BTC will be a greater wealth store than gold don't have much to store. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:35:54
Are you really that stupid? You are implying that you are guaranteed to make money on BTC. There's no such thing as free money
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:04:20
What planet are you on? This has nothing to do with the singularity. You really need to work on making some kind of cogent argument because you are chasing your tail.
I'm not sure if you're joking, trolling or just fooling yourself but the point i made at the very beginning was that the benefit is only to the vendor. It's not just about borrowing money, I pay my card off in full every month and only shop with a credit card, online and off, because of the protection it affords me. This protection is paid for by the vendors in their fees. Why would I pay in cash, at greater risk, when i can pay with credit at no extra cost? It's a no brainer (unless you have no brain).
From the structure of your points i'm hoping you are a troll because it's just so painful to think that this might be your actual logic.
