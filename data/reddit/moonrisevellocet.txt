I'm sorry, I just didn't read what you said properly. I was under the assumption that Bitcoin is an exchange. So, Bitcoin and exchanges are different?
EDIT: forgot a couple of words.

"Now imagine that nobody can seize it from you". However, I hear about Bitcoin hacks and people stealing millions of dollars. I don't hear about this in the regular stock market, for example.

I'm 19. It was a mistake posting on here, I regret it already. Like I said, I did not know ANYTHING about Bitcoin. All I know about is that my brother made a couple hundred bucks over the course of a day. That's all I know about it. I will read up on some of the sources that other users have posted on here, and shut up about it.
I apologize that my naiveness of the subject has caused you to speak so condescendingly toward me. Have a good day.

Yikes! Please don't call me "kid". Also, I was totally in the wrong, you're right. What I should've done is, ask, "What is a cold storage wallet address?" "Why the random string of letters?" "So Bitcoin isn't an exchange. What are the different kinds of exchanges?" Instead of just responding with just those links. I didn't mean to come across as, "OH YEAH? Well, look at this!" I'm sorry about that. Should've thought more before hitting the "save" button.
