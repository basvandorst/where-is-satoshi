I don't live in the us, so I can't speak for your papers, but I do actually think this is something that will sell copies of your paper. So any sane reporter *should* be all over it.
@_date: 2012-09-18 18:00:37
Well, thanks guys, I learned something new today :)!

What we really are to ask is 
* Do you own your private key at blockchain, or do they control it? 
* When blockchain is hit by a meteor (or some other unlikely tragedy), how will we be able to get our money out of it?
* How can blockchain or a third party snoop and get your key or password? 
@_date: 2012-08-14 08:33:29
Sure. But why would I bother? 
@_date: 2012-09-16 17:00:09
1: Hitmen are dorks. 
2: the ip 127.0.0.1 is always your own computer. 
3: Mods, can you please show this man out?

If it is done with a system, for instance you create a encryption also and decide to tell no one about it, so that it won't be attacked it will obviously be untested, and not something to trust. 
To do security by obscurity combined with good encryption and sensible password hygiene is a waste of time, and yet another chance to f$ up.
@_date: 2012-08-13 08:11:54
Yes THAT is true! This is what the kids nowadays call a brain wallet, and it's very nice. 
@_date: 2012-08-12 22:34:29
Also: have a strong password and keep multiple backups! 
@_date: 2012-08-13 07:34:58
This may seem strange, but that is actually a bad idea. 
It is called 'security by obscurity' and while it often may work well for physical things, digital things are actually more secure when they are protected by encryption, and then they can be left in public. Bruce Schneider explains theese things way better than I do, but hit google with "Bruce Schneider security by obscurity" and have a read!

If someone has their coins on their laptop instead of phone, they can scan the qr with the laptops camera and wont have to type in the public key manually.

It's the most interesting altchain of them all, because of the scrypt algo that makes it a viable choice for the CPU. 
As with doing transactions, when I buy and sell I accept all altchains, because they are very easy and cheap to exchange at places like vircurex.

The hivemind fanboyism nature of makes it impossible to criticize it, so no thoughts on that are going to be presented other that "it's dumb"
@_date: 2012-08-13 17:31:05
Use it, hopefully it will catch on. 'Bitcoin' is actually kind of akward to pronounce.
@_date: 2012-08-28 11:10:17
A novelty on Zhou? So it's basically someone who for laughs posts nice things and builds cool stuff. 
@_date: 2012-08-13 07:44:50
You are obviously free to handle your bitcoins however you please, but keeping a copy on a cloud service is a good idea. Especially if you choose on outside of your town and country. Then it will be safe from war, you know! 
A good encryption key and booting from a machine you know to be virus free (i.e a machine never connected to the internet) is what you need. 
Remember fokes, the only thing that prevents your bitcoins from being stolen is your private key. Satoshi knew that a strong key is what makes computer security work, not security by obscurity. 
@_date: 2012-08-13 17:29:13
I don't think it's the actual amount that is important, but that politicians now can get untraceable donations. And even if bitcoin is great, that is a bad thing.
@_date: 2012-08-30 22:54:19
Remember that what anyone here believes means absolutely nothing. Many in the btc community seem to be sure that the bank system and governments will become obsolete in a couple of years because everything will be dealt with in bitcoins, but it's just as likely (joke) that bitcoin will loose all momentum and be left to rot. 
It is still brand new (in relative terms) and no one knows anything about the future. Let's just enjoy some fine crypto! 
@_date: 2012-09-17 20:09:47
`bitcoind`, because of the 2009 nostalgia. 
Electrum because it's light, portable and easy to stay secure with.

Is this the Zhou from South East Asia (sorry, I am not sure enough of what country to dare guess)?
@_date: 2012-09-17 23:28:42
Because they cost much per electricity compared to nuclear. Also, coal and natural gas makes global warming worse. 
@_date: 2012-08-13 21:20:53
But the journalists would find it quite suspicious that someone magically had a lot of extra money to spend.

But GPU mining won't work if your crappy old graphics card don't support opencl. Then again, for a mere mortal to mine is kind of worthless. 
And ltc gpu is ~4x better than ltc cpu, that is not even remotely as wide a gap as cpu btc vs gpu btc. 
@_date: 2012-09-17 23:27:34


Silly me. Sorry, English is my second language but I'm trying my best. 


Well, of course! It's what we use to power our mining rigs. Cheap clean power, you know. 
@_date: 2012-09-09 10:08:40
They would google it before asking about it. 
@_date: 2012-08-13 07:45:12
Why? I havent followed the discussion.
@_date: 2012-09-17 20:13:54
Well, if bitcoins were to become the standard bearer of value the poor would have to slave for silicone and uranium to let richies like us mine. The world inequalities are not going to be solved by bitcoins, sorry. 
Still, bitcoin is super cool, no doubt about that. But it is not magic.
