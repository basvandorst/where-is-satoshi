In my edit I wrote what's the most cost efficient and Apple-hurting way than smashing your device.

Umm, what's the point of destroying device that Apple already been paid for? 
edit: Seriously, you want piss Apple off? Jailbreak your phone or sell it to China (most people won't use official appstore over there and they are overcharged for iPhones). Use the money to buy cellphone from competition.

Yeah, about that. There are videos online of people wrecking their Lamborghinis (edit: here's an example  I'm not sure smashing an iPhone still has any shock value potential.

Don't forget people who want to transfer small amounts of money without being robbed by SWIFT bank fees. They charge you the same no matter if you transfer $500000 or $1000. When one company pays another they can live with (SHAred) ~$90 in bank fees. But for small amount these figures are ridiculous. Once I wired money (few thousand USD) from China to Europe. Chinese bank charged me ~$25 but since they've only allowed SHA transfer my receiving bank charged me +$60 (there were two intermediary banks, you cannot control it). That was the last time I used regular bank to move USD for personal reasons.

Yes: 
I'm not sure if the description is correct though. From what I remember when the story broke out, he bought this vehicle used so I don't know how much Lamborghini itself was to blame for car trouble.

Now why would you import Honda to Japan?

Well, if only their prices were better.
I'm Polish, I took hundreds of flights in my life and I bought LOT ticket... twice. Both local (~300km) flights, one paid by miles, yeah.
