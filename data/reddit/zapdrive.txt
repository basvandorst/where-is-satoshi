Man I miss those days. October to December. The price would just continue to rise, day after day, everyday.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:12:15
As much as I would like the price of Bitcoin to go up, please take a moment to think about potentially millions of people whose lives would be ruined if another world level financial meltdown happens because of this.

I think his wallet was encrypted. 
However, you know, how when you erase a file, only its entry in the filesystem data gets deleted. The file is still physically present on the disk, until it gets overwritten by another file. 
So, they analysed his disk and found an old deleted unencrypted wallet file. This file had the same seed as his wallet! So basically he created a wallet, and later encrypted it. The old wallet.dat got deleted, but was still sitting on the disk.

MtGox is not going insolvent. They have, more than likely, made much more in commissions during the last 3 months alone, as compared to the money Feds seized from them. For more read: 
And this doesn't count the arbitrage that they could have done, since they had the easiest access to funds. I can't wait for the day, when an investigation opens and all the withdrawal records are made public.
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:10:08
Quiet a possible scenario. Imagine 99% miners drop out suddenly. The difficulty would be toooo high for the remaining 1% to find a block for quiet some time. But then again, if the hashrate drops, there would be a huge incentive for others to start mining.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:57:15
Not much, in my opinion. Most of the fees that merchants pay, go to the Credit Card issuing bank. Merchant's bank (the payment processor) takes a small cut, and so do Visa, MasterCard etc. The reason for the huge fee for the issuing bank is, they take the risk by offering credit to people. And, the 1-1.5% they get from each transaction, helps them offset the bad debt that they keep acquiring.

Clevelander's is my favorite place on the Ocean Ave. Mango is second. Haven't been there in a long time though, and didn't know till now that they accepted Bitcoin. Bitcoin suddenly feels more "real"!

Also on a side note, is there any upper limit for the difficulty? Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that difficulty means how many zeroes should be there in front of the hash signature. What if the hash-rate becomes so high, and the difficulty rises so much that all the digits have to be 0?

The first time I ever bought Bitcoin was when I had to buy a prescription medicine (Modafinil) online. I did have the prescription for it, but it wasn't valid in the country I was in. I still believe that dark markets and/or free markets will boost the Bitcoin price. Lets hope OpenBazaar comes out soon.


Bitcoin is not on decline. Its price relative to USD (and other currencies) is. Bitcoin in itself is flourishing, the network is strong, number of merchants accepting it is rising, VC money is pouring into Bitcoin related companies. These downtrends and uptrends will keep coming.
Just buy some whenever you need to do an anonymous (not necessarily illegal) purchase online. Also buy a little for the "just in case" scenario. And don't fret too much about the price.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:19:53

Thank you Tarandeep Gill. Can you substantiate your guess with any concrete numbers?
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:16:19
Manual processing of withdrawals is just a logistics issue, and the backlog can be easily cleared by hiring more people (even temporarily). Everybody knows this is not the case, and the most widely believed reason is that they don't have enough funds because of the Fed seizure. I am just making a point, that the delays couldn't be due to this reason. Neither the backlog is a valid reason. Something else is at play, and I don't know what it is.
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:40:55




Does it usually take 5 days for the price to drop on good news?
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:26:50
Lol. Good luck to anyone who has coins/fiat stuck there. At least with their demise, the long hanging sword would fall already.
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:14:46
Definitely something is being hidden from the public by MtGox executives. I do not believe this "technical problem" bullshit. They are just trying to stall. Remember the "banking problem" they had while processing fiat withdrawals?

Even at a 10% premium its a discount, considering the 80% drop in value of each coin.
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:26:41
That is exactly the business opportunity I am talking about. Entrepreneurs can come up with ways to make it easy to do all this without any technical knowledge, and also ways to hedge the risk. The rich do no want to park their money permanently in Bitcoin, but in an offshore bank account.

You'll never know what Satoshi did in his real life. Maybe he DID do something like that!
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:57:23
I am tired of all the Bitcoin will/won't be a success in X years comments. Lets just face it, Bitcoin IS a success already! How many efforts at decentralizing monetary transactions have seen the light of the day? Right now you CAN use Bitcoin to send funds across borders WITHOUT any restrictions! That only in my opinion is a huge success. In 6 years we will have more ways to convert Fiat&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;Fiat than now.
To answer your question, I would be more pleased if the dollar value of Bitcoin climbed to around $3000 each and then hovered there for a few years. The reason is, it will easily facilitate bigger transactions. Right now you can not easily send few million dollars without a huge slippage on the exchanges.
@_date: 2015-05-06 04:59:24
I don't think so.
@_date: 2015-05-13 08:09:02
But it hasn't moved in 3 days. So maybe the manipulators are running out of steam here. Good news these days does not have any impact on price, which is better than price drop. Slowly we'll go back to the more natural good news = price rise phase.

@_date: 2014-02-07 07:34:54
Wouldn't you think that they have made more than $5M in commissions since the seizure? On an average about $30M worth of bitcoins have been traded over there everyday, the last 3 months ( Even with a .25% fee, it comes out to be 30 * 90 * 0.25% =  6.75M. And this is just the commission from Fiat. They got an equivalent in BTC as commission as well.

The old hardware not only loses in the GHs/Kwh aspect, but also $/GHs. So it would be highly inefficient to buy such an expensive hardware and pay a large electricity bill. It would be much more efficient/cheap to just make your own chip, and make thousands of boards and then do a 51% attack. But at that stage it would be MUCH MORE profitable to just mine.
