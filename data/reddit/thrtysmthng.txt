Isn’t the value of bitcoin based on the value of paper money? If fiat money goes to zero, how is it even possible for bitcoin not to go to zero itself?

What the hell are you talking about

Can someone send me $5,000 worth of btc. I can’t use coinbase or binance. I’ve tried them ALL. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:01:45
Ok i get what you mean by that, but you call this a bull run? We’re in May, all due respect.
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:49:01
Is this really really real?
@_date: 2018-08-05 23:09:02
They don’t accept bitcoin as payment, they just give you the ability to buy and sell bitcoin on site.

A 5 percent jump doesn’t warrant the amount of excitement that you’re giving this. Just my opinion. And you’re buying as it jumps 5 percent, I’m guessing you’re a day trader?

Hahahaha hahahaha it feels good to be in crypto for almost 8 months. I’m used to the roller coaster doesn’t even bother me anymore.

The only problem I can see with gab or dissenter is sponsorship. No family friendly companies want anything to do with this. Those are the big bucks

Proton mail, huh. Good choice of server for the business that you’re in. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:50:23
Is this a joke? Jeez 
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:18:16
...Which is why I said don’t say btc. Not everyone uses btc.  
@_date: 2018-06-01 01:43:07
The bull run! The bull run! The bull run! Aaaaaaaaaaaa!

Bitcoin+Jack Dorsey should not be going together being that he is clearly not an advocate of free speech. Not going to read this article

No need for expensive mining rigs, I like.

Just because someone’s heard of something doesn’t mean they know what it is, how it works, how to get it, and what to do with it once they have it. Also doesn’t mean that they have the money to acquire it. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:45:30
I’m not going to lie, that’s the reason I got in as well, in late 2017. I had heard about bitcoin in 2012 but missed the boat because I was convinced it was only going to be a tool for criminal use and that by owning some, i would eventually be prosecuted.

Actually it was meant to be a joke, sarcastic one at that, but somehow I knew it would agitate another fellow human being into shit posting. ����‍♂️

Do you have a coinbase account?
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:11:04
They got out of Facebook and went in to crypto
