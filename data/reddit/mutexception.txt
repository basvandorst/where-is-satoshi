So if I get a pen and paper and perform computations am I a computer?
If my car performs computations when it works out what speed I am doing is my car a computer?

He also believes that taking sun light, converting it into electricity, using that electricity to charge lead acid batteries, then using that charge to power lights to grow plants is more efficient than just putting the plant in the fucking sun!

What about that above statement do you think I do not understand, or are you trying to say something else?


And what I have continued to say is that you are therefore appointing yourself as the arbiter of what is 'reasonable/moral/just and fair, you justify this stance to go on and say that you do not recognise the government because you believe that at some point in the past that government has done something you think it unreasonable/moral/just or fair. So you 'fired' them and appointed yourself, as such you are no longer held to any standard apart from your own.. 
OK, I do understand that position, it is crazy, it does not work and it is wrong, but I certainly understand it. 


So you are using the governments stance towards black people in the US as framed in the US constitution in **1789** (or someone was) for your reasoning for that morally justified stance that allows you to breach any law you so choose based on your moral stance.
I understand your logic and reasoning perfectly and I find it farcical. 


Um... OK.. SO law abiding people of historical laws that you do not agree with means that those people are 'bad'! Is that is what you are trying to say? 
Hopefully you might elaborate that point.. (OH you do!)...


First it was not legislated that German citizens were required by law to turn in Jews, it may have been later in the war but then it is a war act not a social law. 
But even if they did, you really think that example is applicable here? or comparable with money laundering, or speeding in my example? Again, when was that ?? 1940's ? what is the year now?
So another Country 80 years ago made what you judge to be an immoral 'law' (if it even was such a thing), and based on that in 2017 in the US you use that to excuse yourself of ANY laws you feel is immoral. 
Sure I understand you perfectly, and I did read carefully what you said, more than once. I understand your argument perfectly, but as Lisa Simpson says "that A pretty spurious argument"...

not at all, you see things so black and white! The world is not binary. That statement does not presupposes anything at all about other laws or 'all laws' or infallibility of said (and unsaid) laws. 
I just said 'that is the law', like them or not, fallible or not, good or not, crazy or not, they are the laws. Like them or not does not matter. 
Some laws are bat shit crazy, that does not for a second give you the right to break them. 
Very few laws are nullified, and even less because they are fallible, but again we have to abide by the laws we have no, not 100 years ago, or 100 years in the future, the laws we have today. Like them or not, agree with them or not, think they are fallible or not, does not matter. Why "cuz it's the law". 
You've gone from one law, then tried to apply that same reasoning to all laws. So if one law was nullified in the past then all laws are will be nullified in the future, or if one law is fallible then by inference all laws are, is simply wrong.
The trick is to learn to play the game (of life) without braking the rules (WE HAVE TODAY).. 
I would expect you would already know what effects money laundering has, and fully understand why it is usually done. I would be surprised if you told me you need it explained to you, or why there are laws making it illegal.

I find that somewhat amusing and very simplistic, so you are only willing to follow any laws 'if you feel like it', and that you are free to override laws if you think the decision is unjust!..
I see your type of yourtube all the time the classic "I am a Sovereign citizen or the world your laws don't apply to me", that usually ends well! 
I particularly like the weasel words of 'morality' and 'just', of course that is moral and just according to you, or if you just 'don't feel like it'. 


So I am a low life and as such your a the 'high moral person' who gets to decide what laws you choose to follow depending on your definition of moral or just.
Do you have a thing about 'black people'? Why do you keep wanting to inject race into the debate?
It is your opinion that your particular brand of morals overrides the laws of the country that you live in. I would like to see you test that theory!
All I said, and all I have ever said is that there are a set of laws that are in your society that you can either choose to obey or not but if not you need to accept the consequences of that decision. 
I made no comment about laws in general, or laws you agree with or not, about victims, or about your distaste for race or your Government. I made a simple statement that the laws are there, you either obey them or you don't and are punished for not obeying them, that it does not matter at all if you agree with them or not, but if you don't agree and don't obey them you will pay the price for that. 
But it has been an interesting conversation.

It is a crime, that is what is wrong with it.
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:45:13
So you equate reporting of Jews in Germany and slavery as examples you don't have to follow and put money laundering in the same category? (and the what particular government does it does not matter?)
So because I don't agree with genocide I therefore should not have to obey speed limits? Is that your rational, logic and reasoning?
So next time I am arrested for a crime, I just had to say "it was ok for Hitler, so it is ok for me?". (might work!)... 


At least we have some common ground there! 
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:44:21
even more even with your windows wide open you have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Certainly not as much, but you still have it. 
It is very different if you are standing in the street yelling out aloud, in that case you have no expectation of privacy. Putting a transaction on the blockchain is the same as yelling in the street, not undressing in your bathroom with an open window.
@_date: 2017-01-24 04:34:49
you don't need unquestioning obedience, just obedience, you don't even need to do that if you are happy to accept the consequences. (is that what you mean by 'free and brave'?).
If you are brave enough and willing to accept the consequences of your actions even if those actions are against the laws of your country. Then you can give the bird to the king and whoever you like. From your prison cell. 
If unquestioning obedience is not a characteristic of the American ideal, I would be interested to know what is the characteristic of the American ideal?

Very true, not everywhere, but certainly in most places that have a viable economy to protect, and with regard to crimes sure there may be crimes that should not be, but a crime is a crime regardless of agreeing with it or not. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:54:46
you actually succeeded in getting it exactly 100% wrong from what I was trying to say. I did not make that argument at all, I even stated earlier that without PC they have to ask you for a search and I stated then you have every right to say NO, and you should. But IF they have PC then you relinquish those rights. 
So I was making the exact opposite to "If you care about privacy you must have something to hide" because without PC you have a right to that privacy and the right to refuse a request for a search. 
Sure the first things the cops try to do is trick you with that line, but I never said cops were angels and not below intimidation tactics. 
But lets not get facts in the way on an argument!
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:56:08


I can read and understand, you seem more upset that I don't agree with you. Don't confuse not understanding with not agreeing.. And all you appear to be saying now is that you said something then.. I know you did...

In that case the box under your desk does not fit that definition as it is not a person.

No, I am just not arrogant or naïve to think that laws don't apply to me because I don't agree with them. Or that some time in the last millennium the laws were not the same as they are today!
Or silly enough to think there is such a thing as a victimless crime either.
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:15:43
Well you just cant really ask that question like that in general terms, you have to look at the specific applications of that act. Laws are generally not made to set a 'superiority' over you. They are there to assist in the function of society.
Again you ask "why should money laundering be illegal and who are the victims", give me an example of money laundering and I will tell you who specifically are the victims. But that is impossible to do in a general sense.
So what are you really against? the fact that there are laws, the fact that the government upholds and makes those laws, the fact there is a government? Or that you feel there are no victims from that specific law?
You also seem to be mashing the criminal act to 'crimes' they are not the same. You can do a criminal act (a crime) and there be no victims, but you cant then say that that crime is 'victimless' or that criminal act is victimless.
You can take your car and drive over the speed limit (break a law) and you can slow down and go home and post here that 'speeding is a victimless crime, therefore the law about speeding should not exist'.
But that is bullshit, if every time some sped there where never any victims you would be right. But that is not the case, sometimes when people speed they crash, they hit other people, they have a tyre blowout and die. Speeding makes many victims, but just because you 'got away' with speeding with no victims does not make it victimless.
But I expect you already understand that. 
But like the laws or not, like the Government or not, breaking laws is illegal, and not because the Government said so, but because that is the law. 
So you can debate the legality, philosophy, ethics, morals or whatever you like. It really does not make any difference.
Oh and the US Government said that black people had half the votes of white people, not that they were worth half of a white person, but I don't see at all how that has anything to do with living within the law of your country.

in this context that would be like protecting your privacy in your own home but at the same time using your home as a drug lab (for example) if that mixer is used to launder money. In which case the breaking of the law removes your expectation of privacy.
In legal terms that is "PC" or probable cause, and that is more than enough reason to trump (!!) your privacy rights. As anyone who has had their car searched will tell you. But without PC they have to ask you if it is ok... (in which case you should always say NO).. 
You may have use for mixers that are not illegal, and you may have use for a full meth lab equipment set and not make meth. But if you purchase all that gear or use mixers there is probably some reason for you to do that.

why would you have an expectation of privacy if you choose to use a public ledger? 
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:31:03
but what is 'moral or just' is a matter of perspective and opinion, what you really should say is "what I consider to be moral or just", and again, it really doesn't matter what you think.. 
That laws are not in place for only those people who agree with them or who do not have some form of moral justification against them. 


Again, that is pure opinion based on your own personal internal compass of what morality or just means. 
Why is that different to you being a simple minded sheep that lacks the ability to discern what is right and wrong?
So why should we adjust to your morals and sense of justice? and what's to say your compass is the right one?
What do you see as my 'initial narrative'? That you need to obey the laws or face the consequences of breaking those laws?
that's not even a narrative, its just a fact. 
So what don't I understand again? That you are the authority of what is right, just and moral and I am not? That we should clear it with you to determine if what I do is or is not against the law?
I am just trying to get an understanding about what you are fighting for? Are you trying to tell me the Government should not be able to make laws, because unlike yourself they do not know what is ethical or moral? But you do?
Or are you trying to say that if you don't agree with a law, it should not be a law? When you work out your stance let me know...
