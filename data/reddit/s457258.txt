I've heard people say this about different things my whole life. Like the Esperanto and open source software examples I gave. Makes people sound like a cult and other people get scared of the technology or just dismiss it. Spending money is different to other freedom projects, nobody wants to lose money so I can't see it really taking off soon unless there's a way to spend it everywhere you can spend cash :c

Yeah I understand that, was just hoping to find a much lower fee or one that only charges for deposits.
And it's different in the UK, the price listed in the shop is what you pay. Some small shops will make you pay a small card charge but you can pretty much expect shops to pay that for you these days. I can't remember the last time I paid a card charge.
I used to live in a building with a barber in and I remember the owner saying that she couldn't afford a card machine because she didn't want to keep paying everyone's card charges and would have to put prices up for everyone. It's kinda expected that the business will pay these days.

Right, thanks for making that very clear. Just looked online and there's three places in my city that accept Bitcoin. One is CEX which is essentially our version of GameStop, overprised and I won't be going there. Another is a digital media company, I don't need an app or a website. Last is a hair salon, might check them out but I'm not paying top price for a haircut just to use Bitcoin when I can go to the barber down my road for £6.50.
Is there really ever going to be any way to try and get more places to accept it without sounding like a hippie similar to someone who wants everyone to speak Esperanto and use open source software? Seems like it will never become the norm to me, just a minority who get the benefits.
