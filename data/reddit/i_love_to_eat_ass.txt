I dont think bitcoin will topple anything and that central banks will issue their own native coins.
One thing bitcoin does provide is an unbiased ledger of value. 
Governments dont have a choice because as a baseline of value...criminals can always use bitcoin as a transactional medium. So it will always have a minimum value and therefor, will linger.

I get what youre saying about centralized systems, userbase and central services offering a UI for the masses.
Importance of bitcoin is that it has a solid chance of becoming a global ledger that itself, is decentralized.
This is not a 1:1 comparison to technology like tcp/ip , the internet or email.
You clearly understand the tech but i think youre view is slightly off

You are dumber than shit to compare bitcoin to a fucking smart phone.
What makes bitcoin unique is that it is the FIRST project and it grew organically.
This isnt to say that there is no need for other blockchains but bitcoin is the protocol people will want to participate in because its truly decentralized.
One huge issue with a newly issued blockchain would be to get ALL actors to agree that it has value, and you can not because people are greedy and self preserving.

Thanks for the lesson on market cap mr reddit stranger, i know the basics of market cap and its demand. Not sure you can tell from my amazon stock example.
Ill agree with you on market cap of majority of crypto being a scam. 
Ill also agree with you on bitcoins market cap being nonsense BUT it is being used as a gauge for demand.
Bitcoin has been an indomitable ledger for 10+ years and is now firmly on the global stage and it continues to grow.

Youre talking a lot of nonsense. Market caps are a gauge of demand. Its definitely not perfect and its one of those popcorn stats.
Kind of like how people say jeff bezos is the worlds richest man. This has largely to do with his stock holding in amazon.
Obviously if he were to dump his entire amazon holding tomorrow, he probably wouldnt get half the market value due to flooding the market, which he wouldnt do.

You’re listing technical specs, which is great.
My point is, is that there are a number of synergies that have taken place since the initial block was mined that have not been replicated since.
You’re grossly underestimating hashrate.
Hashrate signifies how much involvement/interest there is in a project. Bitcoin obviously has a tremendous hashrate and it’s participants are saying:
-it is worth mining
-it is a trusted store of value (network security)
-it is a vote of confidence in the system.
If a shitcoin came out tomorrow and overtook bitcoins hashrate, it would be a very big deal

I totally get it from a rental perspective and even as an investment.
I’ll argue that a small percentage of people benefit from real estate as an “investment”. For the most part, it’s as speculative as crypto...if not more and there’s just as great of a risk buying RE.
My problem with every store of value that is currently in existence is that they are not liquid and also require a broker to find you a market.

It is and isn’t clonable.
Sure you can fork bitcoin but it won’t have the same hashrate and user base.
It’s like if I made my own bootleg google or Facebook and copied the sites verbatim. Who would use it? 
It’s not the same.
Bcash tried to clone it but that whole gamble went to hell.

I saw your other post and I’ll chime in here as well.
Not sure when it became a “mainstream” thing to say hodling is bad but I’ve got to say, it is bad.
There’s a reason why pizza day and the 10,000 bitcoin for 2 papa johns pizzas is a thing...it’s because it’s the first recorded transaction of bitcoin being used as a currency.
The term “Hodl” was accidentally chanced upon during a drunk rant by some dude who couldn’t time the markets right and lost money day trading. 
Hodling is a fucking stupid warcry that needs to go away because it doesn’t teach shit. 
Bitcoin isn’t going to ever gain the value that you and I both want it to have unless a lot of people use it.

Fiat price is a perspective. 
Bitcoin can be worth $5 or $5,000,000, as long as the network is sound, then the fiat price is a non issue and just a perspective.
That being said, I strongly believe 1 bitcoin will one day give you the purchasing power to buy a luxury home in Manhattan and then some.
Edit: shit, I just rambled without answering your question. Yes, I believe halving will increase bitcoin value.

I went all in on bitcoin when it was $700. I came across it accidentally and thought it was a scam but read up on it and was blown away.
For bitcoin, it is either going to become the world reserve or it will be worthless, I don’t see a middle ground. The only way it will ever become worthless is if the network falls to a catastrophic failure due to a hack or successful 51% attack. Obviously, as hashrate increases this becomes more and more unlikely.
With that being said, I am a firm believer that bitcoin will be the underlying store of value for all assets in the world and it’s just a matter of time.

I don’t think so.
There is information that officials spin to the public and then there are things they don’t. This remains true for any organization.
If a bunch of dumb asses on reddit can figure out that bitcoin has value, you can be sure as hell the usg and any sophisticated organization has had their eyes on bitcoin.
The trend I’m noticing from major central banks and govts is to call bitcoin a scam but for some fucking reason, these major players are quietly investing a hefty amount into infrastructure.

Definitely agree with your point that it’s in its infancy and scaling is key in getting it off the ground.

Beautiful explanation and agree with it 100%
Even your explanation of it not being worth tens of millions is spot on.
I explain it in terms of purchasing power. I too think that we will one day reach a “critical” point where the price of bitcoin will cross a rubicon or a point of no return. Once there, we will not view bitcoin in terms of fiat but rather in bitcoin and to understand this idea today...I explain it in terms of purchasing power.
During thanksgiving dinner in 2017, bitcoin was around $8000 and a hot topic of conversation. Someone asked me when I planned to sell my bitcoin and I told him as soon as I can purchase a luxury condo in nyc with one bitcoin...I’ll consider it a treat to myself.
Obviously got laughed at but I’m confident I’ll have the last laugh.
@_date: 2019-01-15 05:46:05
You do realize if everyone “Hodl’ed”, bitcoin would not be money right?
The term Hodl was began by a guy who couldn’t time the markets right and made bad trades. 
I think as a community, we need to move away from this mentality and focus on actually spending it as a currency, this is when the value will truly sky rocket.

I used my life savings and bought bitcoin at $750.
I have about $70,000 in student loans, have no savings and live paycheck to paycheck, and have been unemployed for the last 2 months. My last job paid about $100,000 and i live in a major city.
There is no fucking way im selling my bitcoin at these prices. I would rather go bankrupt, move in with my parents and deal with a whirlwind of shit before selling my bitcoin for dirty fiat.
I am convinced ill be able to buy a luxury condo with a single bitcoin in a major city in the US within the next few years and i came to this conclusion when prices were low.
Am waiting for this to happen before i consider even using one.
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:25:04
Hmm i see your point.
I think in this early stage, hashrate is king because of what i stated. Later stage, according to moores law and your stance on electricity usage determining network value...i can see that being a point.
What im wondering now is that once we do cross over that thresh hold of todays early game pow/hashrate and network effects...how will this look late game?
Hypothetically speaking, 10 years from now a 15 year old living in their parents basement could develop a coin 100 times more secure than bitcoins current network hashrate. 
Obviously, then bitcoins electricity consumption would have to be at a level which suggests complete global participation and thus a hashrate x amounts higher.
I think we are both right but I definitely see your point in that electricity used should be a key indicator vs hashrate strictly.

If bitcoin is the worlds value ledger, then yes...block rewards will be more than enough to sustain the network while providing a huge incentive

Bitcoin is recognized as being money in Australia i remember reading.
What is the average persons perception of bitcoin down there?
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:23:45
Exactly my thinking.

Lets also consider surrounding evidence and that is the institutional groundwork being laid to make this possible uptrend a reality.
I think the $300-$400k price range is reasonable but safe.
Nice write up btw OP!

Youre 15, take a risk and invest a good chunk of it. Unless you need the money for some other persona investments, youll be ok.

Electricity alone means dick.
The network hashrate means everything. Think about it as being a vote of confidence in participants trusting their value on the blockchain.
They use electricity as a means of voting.

Gold is useless, bitcoin is the way to go

Yes and no. Agree with the cost/tech ratio going lower/higher but the hashrate still is important because of network security.
This is the MAIN telltale sign that interest in bitcoin is significant.
One day, 5-10 years from now we will look back at todays network hashrate as being dogshit because every smart device on the planet could possibly be passively devoting a small minuscule percent to hashing and also be a node.
Who knows.
