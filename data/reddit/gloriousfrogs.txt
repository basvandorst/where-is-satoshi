Ok. I think I am ready to HODL, but I appreciate the advice. My understanding of paper wallets was fundamentally flawed. I am going to rephrase what I asked, and hopefully you can help me understand the process that will happen directly after my purchase.
Once I buy the BTC on coinbase (or GDAX, if you can help me differentiate that would be bonus points), I am going to receive the BTC that will be on the exchange. Everything I have read has said that having BTC left on the exchange is the absolute worst idea, because then you are not truly in control of your BTC. From there, I am going to transfer it onto a wallet, such as bread, and my BTC will no longer be on the exchange. What exactly am I going to do with the ledger? I understand that the password will be stored on there, but what is the difference between having it stored on the ledger and on a piece of paper in another location and just having two pieces of paper?
Hopefully this is clear enough for you, thanks.

What benefit does a hardware wallet provide over the alternative of just writing down your key on a piece of paper?

Thanks for an actual reply

So I would want to transfer my BTC to something like Bread and have my key on my Ledger? I’m not sure I completely understand. Thank you for helping.

This is me and it hurts inside

Looks like this is the best way to go. If my goal is eventually acquiring one coin, how much would you recommend per week?

Thank you so much.
