Unfortunately, I've been experiencing the same thing. Any chance you could look into my account details as well? I had also registered with my Twitter account and haven't had success logging in from changetip.com. It's an issue I've continually returned to, and meant to reach out about.

That's an ***S***, I'll have you know!

I'm just waiting to find the plate that reads: KARPELES

How's that working out?

Maybe had a good experience with them too? At least it's an option within the community, IMO.

At this point, you guys are just hilarious.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:42:01
Hah, you guys can name it that. I'll stick with *Jules*.

...and now discussion of gold-backed crypto. The physical wallet will be its own weight in gold.

Oh, I get it. You think the tone I wrote that with was with an eye-rolling attitude because I don't believe in the other cryptos. It's quite the opposite, actually, and I believe I know how I intended to write my words. Let me add to them for the purpose of more thoroughly conveying my thoughts:
  
"And more recently, I've heard discussion about hard goods-backed cryptocurrencies. While I don't know much about how it would function, it's neat to think their physical wallet could also be made of the currency's own weight in that material."  
  
In a community where everyone is sarcastic and ridiculing one another over minutia, I don't blame you, but please don't be so insistent when it's not the case.

I'm sorry you see that as ridicule. It was an offering of information/ideas.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:38:39
Definitely! (Also using TabCloud, which is nice to organize separate sessions)

Dear God, I think we've found the oldest human being on Earth... and they're a fan of Bitcoin!

I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to wrap-up shop once difficulty rises to the point that their sales wane &amp; their reputation completely deteriorates. This allowing them to have made a small fortune, and just walk away.
