Why would people be willing to buy or accept it if you cannot spend it?  Why would people be willing to accept it if people are not spending it?  It's a pretty logical narrative: a lack of people transacting in bitcoin is bad for bitcoin.  With gold you aren't dependent on a community to agree on how gold should be maintained.

You are correct.  But, you can only do that until your personal stash is greater than what was stolen.  Assuming you have a good cold/hot wallet balance, and the hackers only steal your hot wallet, reloading your hot wallet loss from your profit seems like a reasonable course of action.  An POR audit will uncover when hackers have reached your cold wallet, or when your profits can't cover your hot wallet losses.
Edit:  TL/DR:  an audit is better than nothing.

How can you state this with such confidence?  I own a number of bitcoin and I truly feel bitcoin will likely be the future.  But every day I see the pros and cons to bitcoin.  Bitcoin acceptance will be a rocky road.  Bitcoin's fundamentals are rocky:  all of your on-line bitcoin can be easily stolen by a single virus.  You only seem to focus on the pros of bitcoin and you're blinded by the full range of things that can possibly happen.  Do you actually think there's a 100% chance that bitcoin is the future?  I think that number is significantly smaller.

No, you don't need to run a full node to receive payments in a decentralized manner. You don't need a bitcoin core node at all. SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) is what bitcoinj uses by default.  SPV means you don't have to download the whole block-chain, but you can correctly verify that payments were made.
If I were writing btcbox, I'd use bitcoinj (it's what powers multibit and blockchain.info I think)

Same deal as gyft if you've used it.  3% back on future purchases.  Lets you use some of the same places, but there are a few things that are gyft exclusive (target, whole foods, victoria's secret, etc) and a few things that are egifter exclusive (REI, lowes, etc).
Egifter lets you purchase in more increments, for example, I can get a card for $85 to zappos.  That's not something that Gyft lets you do.

Yes.  I did read what he said.  As I've posted elsewhere:
1. Sending passwords over email will make users more susceptible to phishing in the future.
2. Passwords are sent in plaintext, so a hacker can receive the password, and man-in-the-middle the BCI conversation.
3. If any of the users have reused their password, they can expect a hacker to be able to reuse these plaintext passwords on other sites.
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:01:12
you should read this comment and the dozen others that say basically the same thing.  Email is plaintext and unsigned, and more importantly you are setting users up to being phished in the future.

I'm not sure this is true.  Downloading the block-chain over the bitcoin core client is generally limited by the speed of the network, not your hardware.  You usually won't download over ~1 or 2mbits/s which is slow enough to write to a normal hard-drive.

Hurts the network?  If by "uses" the network you mean hurts network, I guess I agree.  Mycelium isn't a full node, do you think mycelium hurts the bitcoin network as a whole?  At least SPV is peer to peer.
SPV is for situations where a full-node is undesirable.  Any situation where waiting for 30gb of data to stream over your network:  like a cellphone over 4g or a POS over wifi.  SPV was designed by bitcoinj developers with these situations in mind.
Anyways, I love full nodes.  I run one on my home machine and if people want to connect and SPV with me, that's cool.

Yes.   below:

That's true about most of the proposals here.  If I give somebody a BIP38 wallet, and then later the money disappears, I can't prove it wasn't me.
If the receiver really wants to move the money to a new key, nothing is stopping them.  I don't think it's a problem.  What's more likely to happen is you'll get an email from the gift recipient about how they lost the seed (or the key or whatever).

Sure.  Closed code, deterministic or otherwise, can have special cases hiding.  If the user does a "hash sign" (or any operation), and the thing being signed fits a special situation that doesn't necessarily come up in testing, the closed code can return a different, specially crafted, signature.  It can sign something different than what the user wants to be signed.
This is just one example, but I'm sure you can come up with others.  Especially code that has access to the time (I can only find reference to "time" in your specs in a few places), can have special cases that will necessarily not come up in testing.

If so, this would be no different from removing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and miners could use blockmaxsize as the configuration you describe.  If not, theymos is right, that would very likely shatter / bifurcate bitcoin in tons of different incompatible chains assuming you don't add some type of consensus-checking code (a-la xt).

ETFs work like this as well.  The number of troy ounces of Gold you own when you buy GLD will change in small ways.  Stocks work this way too.  When you buy 1 share of Google, the % of the company you own will change, though typically in a small and well defined way.  Shares of almost everything can be devalued (the USD for instance).  I bought a few shares of GBTC, mostly because I'm wagering the BTC price will go up more than 2% per year . . . and Roth plans have interesting tax differences.

Using your math, an 8 peer connection will use:
* **0.04 Mbps download**

Although I completely agree with your logic, the "pressure to increase" might not be enough.  The change in supply of new bitcoins will completely swamped out by the supply of old bitcoins held by people who are looking to make profit.  If there is any sign that the halving isn't turning out to be an up-day for bitcoin, there will be literally millions of BTC mined 2009-2016 up for sale.  The 2000, instead of the usual 4000, bitcoin mined that day will just be noise.  (OTOH, I'm holding in the case that the halving does end up being an up-day for bitcoin)

Aren't you assuming their costs are $0?  If they get $10 from you per month, and they spend more than $10 rendering services, won't they lose money on the deal?
@_date: 2015-10-12 02:01:23
No trust is required.  You only sign transactions where the coins never actually leave your wallet.  The coins always go from one of your addresses to another one of your addresses.

10e9 is not the same thing as 10^9.  You mean 1e9 I think.

Though why would they not try arbitrage?  They can sell at least a part of their stake then re-buy that stake at a much lower price from one of the other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:54:08
No, not "this".  and (both of his comments) are "this".  Nobody knows what the price will be, so whether $1200-$1500 is right or is wrong, [cost average]( small amounts over a long period of time is the sane way to enter a position on something volatile.

Why with the bad faith?  It's way more likely he's just a misguided rube.  I doubt he works for a company you don't endorse.
@_date: 2015-10-25 14:27:01
How so?  Which part of the premise is false?
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:26:56


No.  You keep coins in your own private (but specialized) bip32 wallet.


Very low.  When I last used jm it was something on the order of a few bits for a transaction of a modest size.


Everybody's wallets agree to the fees ahead of time (makers provide fee requests, and takers can meet those requests).  The fees are done completely p2p, between the makers and the takers.


The market maker's address, though an outside observer doesn't see it any differently than just an address.

Yeah, no kidding.  Years almost.  Q1 of 2013 people reported lots of problems with withdrawals.

All of them.  See the entire answer above.

Won't all 25 of these nodes be gone in a month?  Wouldn't it be smarter to spread out the sending of money to fullnode?  Or have a way to fund nodes per-year instead of per-month?

Taxes do not work that way

The market disagrees.

How many current active users are there of the current wallet?  (I see ~100k downloads on google play, but those aren't necessarily all of the users.  On the other hand, I'm sure not all of them are active.)
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:00:24
I've used your service and love it.  The main deterrent for myself, and maybe others, from using your service more regularly is the 2.5% fee.   (canada only) charges 1% for larger bills and I think this fee is more in-line with what users expect.  Would you consider a flat-fee for larger bills?  I read somewhere that you're planning on reducing the fee again in the future, and I'm ready and waiting for that to happen (in the mean-time, though I will continue to use your service).
Have you considered partnering with payroll companies that have huge number of bits to buy like bitwage?
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:10:51
I hear your point but I disagree with your last sentence.  I was as specific as I wanted to be.  If nobody knows about the rules, mods will have a hard time justifying enforcement of them.

Sorry I didn't mean to be so combative.  I agree with you like almost 100%.

BTW, [they updated this in their most recent filing](  They're using the same 1/10th ratio as GBTC/BIT.
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:55:09


I guess I'm not sure why that is.  Wouldn't it make more sense to put in only the hash?  Putting in both decreases the false positives, but it also decreases the anonymity.
I do remember reading discussion among a few bitcoind devs discussing possible improvements with the current bloom filter protocol.  I understand that joinmarket is a very different use-case where anonymity of your addresses is a higher priority than normal.

They didn't get the name of the ETF correct, so I'm now wondering what data they're basing "by the end of 2016" on.

Luke-jr reads and responds to the comments, but doesn't actually hear what people are saying:  his patch is controversial and against community consensus and should not be enabled by default.

As somebody who's played lots of 2048, I'm interested in knowing how your AI works.
Also, does it win every time?  2048 isn't deterministic, so I could imagine no-win scenarios.

Serious question:  If bitcoin is [property]( then does how long you hold the property matter?  I don't know if "long-term" is ever a description that describes property.  Am I wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:14:34
It's not two people.  You're assuming that if any mayhem were caused by the two people that miners wouldn't change pools.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:11:47
Yeah, the website doesn't have that information, sorry.  Just the country (or US State).
Edit:  obviously it also has the latitude/longitude information.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:06:57


You're right, my mistake.  Any property you own is subject to long-term capital gains (with lots of exceptions, but it sounds like Gold and Bitcoin are not one of those exceptions).

(obviously this asshole isn't SN, but still) Devil's advocate, if you were Satoshi and you didn't want to spend your bits because of the hoopla it would cause . . . Wouldn't you buy some bitcoins for cash so you could transact without raising eyebrows?

Yes.  Having a paper trail (and a USD amount) for a tax writeoff is important in the US.  You can afford to contribtue more in that case.

It most certainly does not.  No checking account in this decade gives daily interest of 0.016%.
If you get 6% per year from any checking or savings account, I need to get the name of your bank.

I'm generally a pretty happy guy.
It seems I stand corrected on the 0.016% number and simple vs compound.  But I see 2.5%, not 3.5%.  The twelve debit card purchases per month also seems weird, but acceptable.
