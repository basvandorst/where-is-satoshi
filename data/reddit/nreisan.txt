Shit post, nothing to do with Bitcoin or an Uber moment.

i think that assumption is flawed, if it was true we would see much wider adoption of cheaper for cash, cheaper for visa vs amex, cheaper for card present etc
Not to mention Credit Cards have a lot of other benefits for consumers

Fees paid by merchant vs fees paid by customer is hardly an apples with apples comparison. Plus some huge leaps of faith to assume if the merchant isnt paying it you get the item cheaper, sometimes yes, but most of the time no.

Maybe education isn't the right word, although often goes hand in hand. People with real world experience and understanding of how things work is actually what i mean.

That's a problem with that country with some fucked up issues.

Explain to me why the majority of people need financial sovereignty?

I think id rather pay for a lattle on my credit or debit card than pay $0.13 for something i can do for free on my other standard bank card?

Setting up a bank account under 18 is not that difficult and hardly a use case for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:10:28
No reason that can't be fixed, hardly a reason people should clamour for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:09:20
I really don't think Bitcoin is the solution for poor/disadvantaged people, low access to computers/technology, low education (bitcoin is complicated) - especially with the way transaction fees are going.

upvote for appropriate AD reference :)

Same way educated people often laugh at all the tinfoil retards who think gold standards and cryptocurrencies fix all the problems.

Money has value, created by the fact that governments require you to pay taxes with money.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:29:49
That doesn't make any sense; given bitcoin is decentralised and not listed on any stock exchanges. He cannot have Inside info on this, nor can anyone force you to sell....

Please let me buy from australia!

People store cash/money... doesn't make it a commodity...

It's basically just gambling at that point...
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:21:54
What country has adopted btc as their currency?
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:25:57
Risk reward has to be assessed on the information at the time. Bitcoin's meterioc rise wasn't a sure thing then and still isn't now.
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:29:48
It's not my area of expertise but given some of our banks have listings in America, we need to adhere to american laws aml also afaik
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:53:06
I belive its SOX requirements?
Regardless, as someone who works at one of the aforementioned banks; I don't believe there is any conspiracy to shut out bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-23 12:46:03
I can tell you there is no massive conspiracy to stop bitcoin traders
probably more like AML compliance
@_date: 2015-09-24 09:10:26
Errr there is if you want to list on American Stock Exchanges.
Its voluntary, but they do list on there so have to comply.
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:53:05
How is that worth more to the average consumer?

Second stupid proclamation Tim Cook has made within the last few weeks, first that no one would need a Personal Computer for anything anymore now that the Ipad Pro is out... and now this...
@_date: 2015-10-03 08:35:17
The second largest and oldest is coming up to 200 years in 2017... its also australia's oldest company...
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:43:44
This type of shit is why bitcoin is not for the masses.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:46:24
Well stockmarkets are closed on weekends.... so that's not a great example. During normal business hours it's pretty quick, and you will get a confirmation pretty much instantly (although it may not fully appear in your account that quick)

I'm sorry, IRA/401k investments will have some of your money in banks.
@_date: 2016-07-02 04:18:21
Errrm I don't think random consumer food business like coke &amp; heinz are considered high barriers to entry. Banks, pharmaceuticals generally are though due to regulation &amp; patents.

I guess its not really a straight comparison, well i guess for one thing, comparing a credit card to the set up you have is not really the same thing.
You could use a debit card and just use your own money the same way you just use bitcoin and not have to worry about credit limits/scheduling payments.
The main differences seems to come from this transfer money between investments or savings, which is really just the same with bitcoin. The only difference is you see BTC as an investment so it fulfills dual purpose, but arguably cash is the same.
As you said, BTC -&gt; Gyft -&gt; Target Gift Card, then you have to pay with the target gift card which is the same as any other EFT/bank card so the time taken for this transaction is going to be longer than just using a debit card.
Not to mention the inherent  limitations of where you can shop or the hoops you have to jump through~ (your petrol example)
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:20:06
Easier than dealing with banks or credit cards?
Rofl OK sure.
@_date: 2015-02-17 06:43:07
Paypal can get stuffed. People should find better options.

Well you can't without a passport which is also tracked...
