buy low sell high, that's the game, follow it, don't deviate, you will do fine.

there's nothing wrong with moving to fiat on the high and buying back at the new floor. Anything else is letting fear and greed rule you.

@_date: 2014-12-28 18:47:33
how? if you no longer have the coin you bought from them?
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:42:42
but can they track if you move it to an exchange and trade it 50 times before spending?
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:46:19

if it were swapped on an exchange which it probably was, the people trading coin have no idea where the coin came from, or who they got it from

One way would be to transfer your bitcoin to a coin tethered to the dollar or euro when you believed it was going to fall. Then trade it back after. Doing this on pumps and dips in the market to trade for more bitcoin over time. Speculating a large Bull run in the distant future.
Then there's actually short selling where you borrow coins to sell at current price under and agreement to buy them back at a later date. Speculating a price drop. you buy them back much cheaper. However if the prive rises you may have to buy them back at a much higher rate.

or $17000 gain if you shorted.

Do you know my buddy, Raul Guy, bro?
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:29:30
i increased my cash value by 33% in the last 2 weeks and my coin holdings by 45% by simply buy when it dips and sell when it peaks. the trick is to not get greedy. its easier to make $10, 5 times than to make $50 once.

I have an "all star" linkedin profile. What does it get me? In a small market it makes me the guy they avoid because I sounds expensive.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:50:15
i caught the drop, sold just before. bought back a little too soon, but not soon enough that it wont turn profit through some sideways growth
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:19:56
besides the point whales could buy up the remaining market at any point with current support levels and push the price in either direction as well.
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:30:14
good time to buy

you guys know there is no bitcoin when the grid goes down, right?

planned obsolescence. Cars depreciate, car loans are 3-7 years. these factored are built into the car market. If you dont pay your car loan, they take it back and sell it again and bill you the difference.

for a chart like this to work, You need upward momentum, sustained increase in volume. the graph to continue these other 2 factors over a long period.
