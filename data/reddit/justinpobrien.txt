It's possible they don't have the resources to implement it. Can  anyone nudge folks at coinbase or bitpay to help implement it gratis? It would be good PR for both parties.

Coinbase Commerce (r/ might be a good fit. It's a free non-custodial solution meaning all payments go directly from customers straight to you; integrating with Shopify is quick and easy ([ Also allows you to accept Ethereum and Litecoin in addition to Bitcoin.

May I ask what happened? And/or do you have a transaction ID by chance?

Coinbase Commerce ([commerce.coinbase.com]( is also non-custodial and you don't have to run any of your own servers (spinning up a Bitcoin node can take several days). It also allows you to accept multiple cryptocurrencies and integrates with all the popular eCommerce platforms.

Is it that you'd rather accept stablecoins directly?
* Customer converts $100 USD into 100 USD Coin for example
* Customer visits your website
* Customers sends 100 USD Coin and you receive 100 USD Coin

Hi there! Justin here from Coinbase. Would love to get a bit more info to reproduce. As a merchant are you using Coinbase's merchant tools to accept bitcoin? In cases where a Coinbase user is paying directly to a Coinbase merchant, the transaction never touches the blockchain and no transaction fees are charged. Would love to know more about the merchant service you're using which may help us diagnose root cause.

We do care! Also are you using the BIP 70 payment protocol or BIP 21? Would you be able to provide an example QR code and/or URI?
