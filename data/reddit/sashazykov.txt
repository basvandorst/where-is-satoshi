forklog is terrible. why don't you ever link the sources?

Fixed. Because our project doesn't require registration, captcha is the only way to protect against spam.

I am in Bangkok now, and it's really hard to find a guesthouse or a hotel accepting cards here, and it's almost impossible to find a cafe or a restaurant accepting them. A year ago I traveled to Uzbekistan, and I didn't have a chance to use my card in a month.
Two years ago I changed my bank, because the previous one blocked my card just after the first transaction in a new country. They said I can get a new card in my local bank office. Unfortunately, it was 10 000 miles away.

Hello, I am talking to  now and I have given them a link to your site. Hope it will help to convince them to accept Bitcoin. It's a very good project.
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:33:23
This happens in many countries.

You can send it directly to contributors using tip4commit  most of Bitcoin Core contributors are accepting these tips

It's not needed any more  could you please test how it works now? I didn't know that it's possible to get email address without asking read-write access.

In my opinion it also makes sense to donate to contributors of big projects like [Linux]( spreading Bitcoin outside of Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:53:33
If you login on the website ( and click "Book online"), there is now a "Pay with Bitcoin" button in the account section to top up your balance.
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:44:08
Bitcoin is not really suitable for travels now. That's why we want to promote it directly to local businesses all over the world.
btw check my flickr and guess which country am I from  ;)

No, it's not a fake, I tested the system. They accept Bitcoin to top up account balance, but you still need to connect a credit card in order to pay additional money if your ride will cost more than you deposited using Bitcoin.

BitHaub is another project, which was inspired by tip4commit.
tip4commit.com is using code from tip4commit/tip4commit. sigmike/peer4commit is an attempt to make Peercoin clone of it.

It's possible to use all osm data but the resulting database should be licensed under ODbL as well.

more than 200 of Kernel hackers are accepting bitcoin tips at Tip4commit:

swift: International withdrawals will be charged with 1.5% fee, minimum fee is $150
sepa: Minimum withdrawal amount is eur 500 
fee 1%, minimum fee = eur 100
Where did you find 0.1% fee?
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:54:22
He didn't receive 100 emails, but only one per month. (unless he unsubscribed after the first one) Moreover it's needed to enter a bitcoin address only once to get all tips.

Anonymous Ads doesn't use email at all.
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:30:22
Will you use ODbL license? If not, you are not fixing the issue.

I think it should be possible to use external usb drive instead of SD card, but will 512 mb RAM be enough?

It's not scam. Tip4commit is an Open Source project and we had an issue with GitHub API which returns non verified email addresses using oauth. It's fixed now:

We are not business travelers, so we stay in guesthouses at Khao San Road, none of them accept credit cards.
Moreover, if the bill is less than 300 Bhat, you can't pay with credit card even at Siam Square.

No, I haven't. There are some places in Singapore, but not in Bangkok. This is the problem we want to solve. We want to make travels on Bitcoin easier. Sponsors give money to travelers, travelers promote Bitcoin to local businesses. That's the main idea.

I like OsmAnd, it's a bit ugly, but really useful. iD is a very simple and yet powerful editor to start with. Every month everything around OSM gets better. Now  is available with OSM data.

Yeah, everything is perfect except they don't ship to Russia. :(

They've added tip4commit badge in the project description, so I think they are ok.

This blog is shady. It never provides any links to its sources, only internal links to other shady articles. It claims to be supported by Russian Pirate Party, but I can't find any evidence of this at the party's site.
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:47:30
I've seen several links to this blog here, and none of the articles contained links to external sources. You can check this one for example:  This blog is full of seo and bullshit, or at least it looks like that. It would be great if it was not true.

I have been in the same situation twice. There was no Internet connection in the first place and they was not be able to accept Bitcoin. (I offered to share my connection, but they denied it, although it would be easy to connect their iPad to my android phone) The second time it was a bbq joint in Seoul and the woman running the place didn't speak any English and shook her head when I asked her to pay with Bitcoin and pointed at the sticker.

but you did it wrong) I would prefer to have "bitproof" directory in my cloud drive and you to certify any file I put into it. Also, you can upload a certificate right into the folder.
1. I put document.pdf into Dropbox/bitproof
2. I get document.pdf.cert

The commit has to be accepted by project maintainers. You can read more about Tip4Commit here

Thank you!

You could support Open Source projects and promote Bitcoin among developers here 
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:46:06
These spamming pointless commits will never be approved by projects maintainers and won't be counted. It's pretty hard to add something new to popular projects, even if you are going to fix grammar or something like that.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:34:44
The explanation of how it works: 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:43:52
We've also built a project for tipping open source developers for their commits — 
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:47:39
You can also promote bitcoin by tipping open source contributors

Wow. I really like this one 
Do you ship to Russia?
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:07:46
The difference is that we want to make a "marketplace" where developers could find projects to contribute to and get some money for it. You can send money to Jeff Garzik directly, but it won't encourage any new developers to contribute to Bitcoin core. Also, we will try to deliver coins to those who don't have a bitcoin address yet. If they don't accept these tips, we'll send it to others.
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:50:01
It's interesting direction, but I don't understand how to automate this process.

 is a site for personified Bitcoin donations, for those who want to have a donor profile. It's possible to add any charity here, since the site is just redirecting money to projects without any fee.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:57:02
Nice piece.You could also promote bitcoin giving tips to open source developers:  Some of developers are getting to know about bitcoins receiving these tips. Especially those who are working on projects not related to bitcoins like Linux
