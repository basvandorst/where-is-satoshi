Currently bitcoin doesn't support micro transactions, which is part of the "great debate" that is taking place in the dev community. You don't have to pay a confirmation fee, but it you don't it could take a long time for confirmation. Changetip runs an off-chain ledger which keeps track of micro payments.

If your giftee really loves bitcoin, then s/he would probably be thrilled to sell you some bitcoin and show you how it works. Maybe get a nice card, put in the amount of cash you want to give, and add a nice note about how you would like some help to convert this to bitcoin.

In answer to your OP, I suggest taking a look at the CoinKite API. If gives you all the functionality you need to do what you want to do, but doesn't solve the fundamental problem of micro transactions in Bitcoin.

Keep in mind that this is different from OneName, which registers a single, unique name like a domain name, on the Namecoin blockchain. The purpose of NameClaim is to support anonymous identity, not unique identity. For more, read the NameClaim privacy statement.

This is an example of "collateralized identity" as described by Joe Cascio here:

"Don't clog up the blockchain" -- NameClaim doesn't touch the bitcoin blockchain; it simply references the bitcoin address that backs the name claim.
Your suggestion is valid -- use Namecoin to register a name that is backed by a bitcoin address. Perhaps that is the direction in which NameClaim will head. But for now, it is what it is, mainly because that is what the developer (me) is capable of doing.
I would be glad to get some guidance on how to implement NameClaim using Namecoin.

Sometimes we just need to be reminded about these principles. We don't always think this way all the time. Thank you for the reminder, but no thank you for the condescending attitude. I may be an idiot some of the time, but not all of the time.
