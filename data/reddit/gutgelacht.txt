Thank you but please trust me. It will. Humans are curious.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:29:26
I assume they monitor it already closely as several articles state...
Here is for example one...
I assume it would probably only happen through Paypal because they do not want to competite with their own payment provider. It probably won't happen separate, if at all.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:32:13
Sounds interesting! I am looking forward to your challenges to fill up my wallet :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:51:29
Thanks for the welcome. I wonder if there are places where I can spend Bitcoin on games? Are there places where I can use this to buy games?
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:38:54
Sorry I meant "which is why I wouldn't write this in the memo." :D typo
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:46:28
It seems he wanted to buy, not selling.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:22:01
You can't create ebay competition from one day to the other. It would take ages to build awareness for a bitcoin related ebay style action site. WOuld be much more happy to hear that Ebay allows Bitcoin usage.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:12:50
It looks more like a strange dildo
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:55:13
I'd say that is a massive tip. I always miss out :D
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:24:05
Good point. The term Bitcoin would probably trigger it, which is why I would write this in the memo.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:43:44
Life experience is valuable too, agree :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:07:07
Much appreciated! Cult? Sounds cool! :D Greetings!
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:40:46
This is awesome! Bought humble bundles in the past but with paypal at that time. Good to know that they accept bitcoin too!
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:16:08
Whoaa, that's a huge one. Are you rich or what? :D
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:51:17
Nope. This time it will work.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:14:32
Seriously... it would make much more sense if Ebay would just integrate Bitcoin. Bitcoin is made to send us all to the moon. We need major news and not minor news.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:54:41
That's cool. Never got gold on Reddit :D Now is the time? :D
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:49:46
By this math I would then basically own $645.000 in the year 2019. This seems reasonable.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:46:57
Thanks for the welcome!
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:40:14
But you don't know their business as you states 15% or whatever fee. So how can you argue about them?
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:26:18
not much. it will go to the moon anyway.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:45:54
How would they know if two person would trade paypal and btc?
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:49:33
Nope. Not my thing.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:19:18
You gave yourself the answer I think. It's probably store of value or speculation.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:20:18
Thank you greetings!
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:29:59
Lovely idea.
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:37:52
But you couldn't resist to listen to me. It's working! Just my 2 satoshis.
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:57:04
Won't happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:28:49
Do you have warez on your system? Did you click on shady Bitcoin related links? Do you use noscript to block java? I think what people assume here is right... it's your fault, you had malware on your system, I guess. :/
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:20:13
Draper should use changetip to support us spread some love.
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:40:13
And it's working! :)
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:28:19
Thank you
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:33:16
Last time I talked with him, he said that he would have a huge stack. Around 2000 BTC. He pretty much beliefs but also out of ideology, not pure by speculation.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:50:36
We should start to do that.
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:05:11
ok i will make a search
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:29:37
Yes, I never noticed it too. But then I maybe also didn't noticed it because I didn't know Bitcoin at that time.
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:28:29
Agree. Usability is good and it's solid and that stands above beauty for me too.
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:38:56
I still don't understand.
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:33:57
Not sure, but I never heard about this service, so, I wouldn't use it. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:34:09
maybe :)
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:34:43
How can I be sure that this is not scam?
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:35:53
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:45:25
Happy Easter Days. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:26:29
Could make sense :)
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:27:33
Someone just posted this: 
So, nope, you are wrong.
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:25:09
Thank you. Didn't know about this stats page. This is interesting. I just had the impression that it's slower here now as there are less submissions and less discussion anyhow. Hope you are right, maybe we are in a hole and some people take a break to come back with new infos or questions :)
@_date: 2015-03-14 19:10:45
Doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin is the most risky investment and can't be called saving at all. If I put 1000$ aside, the money will lose less value than if I would invest them into Bitcoin, because of the volatility.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:37:04
Thank you for doing this. Have a great weekend please.
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:26:51
Good point too. That bores me too :D
@_date: 2015-03-14 19:05:55
I can't get enough either.
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:31:07
To be honest, I am a little bit scared about the few news we have. I don't know 21 inc., I assume they will just put it in for speculation or daytrading to damage Bitcoin further.
Anyway, I hope you are right and things work out well over time. But I am scared, everything looks as adoption is stagnating.
@_date: 2015-03-14 19:05:30
Not sure how Bitcoin could get someone into money saving. Bitcoin lost quite a lot of value. You didn't really save money, you invested and that in an experiment. Don't get me wrong, I am here too because I like Bitcoin, however, that Bitcoin would be great for saving money, that is just a very stupid argument. You would have been better of to save your cash money. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:14:50
    1. nope
    2. that you spread love with your promotion :)
    3. dunno yet
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:23:00
have fun! :)
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:31:40
Not sure why you got downvoted heavily, because this is a fact. All metrics are dropping like crazy.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:41:38
So true :)
@_date: 2015-03-15 10:22:21
No, I do think there were pretty much more active sundays.
