Yea I totally agree with you on that statement, i just seen someone put in 10 bitcoins for 100 goxcoins. It's either he/she got guts and alot of money to loose or he/she is nuts!

Can you elaborate more on why medical supply??

Yes it is. Believe it or not they do have good internet connection in northern somalia called somaliland which is trying to recieve its recognition as a different country. To verify, that on the other hand will be a bit difficult mainly because the bitcoin community has come across to many scammers to even trust anyone at this point, were still trying to find out ways on how and if you have any ideas feel free to post them here or pm me.

I know its a close one. I think they'll both due equal amount of damage when it comes to revolutionize the world regardless of whatever regulation occurs over time.

yes and no because they both do not compete in the same industry. However when it comes to who will radically change the world more than thats when competition occurs between both of them.

sounds legit, i like this article it keeps my hop up since i lost a fortune a mtgox!

Their both fast-evolving markets and their both in their infancy stage so its hard to predict but only time will tell.

Great post iamholywood5, i totally agree. I think it's selfish the approach the bitcoin community is taking. Lets act grown and move forward and think in the positive direction for the sake of bitcoin and stop worrying about our loss and think of the bigger picture. I lost all my savings on mtgox but im still trying to rebound and bashing mtgox all day wont help!

it is .131 bitcoin, so if you use one regualr bitcoin you can than buy almost 10 goxcoins, risky tho!
