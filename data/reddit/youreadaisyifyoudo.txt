plus, i had a few bitcoins leftover in mt. gox, an amount so few that i would not have used it elsewhere. but it was ~$30, so i donated that.  
others might do the same.

well, it's a good thing donations are voluntary, eh?

So that people have a safe, accurate and thorough reference for drugs, legal and illegal. People are always going to use drugs, but they should be well-informed while doing so.

I have four questions:    
1. What was it exactly that led to the boom in exchange price that happened from January to April?  
2. Why has the price of Bitcoin not plummetted since the seizure of SilkRoad?  
3. Is there an appreciable amount of anxiety in the Bitcoin community that the US now owns a substantial portion of bitcoins in circulation? (since the seizure of SilkRoad and because it was already rumored before the seizure that the US gov't owned a large amount of bitcoins?)  
4. What would the implications be if it were the case the US gov't owned a substantial portion of bitcoins in circulation?
