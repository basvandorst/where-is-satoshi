I literally roll dice (literally) and use the rolls (100 rolls) as a seed for a brain wallet. It's enough entropy.    
I use bitaddress.org. I download it from github, read the code, make sure it's not compromised, and enter my rolls as the brain wallet seed: I run bitaddress in tails on my 486. I use McDonald's wifi to connect to a VPN account that I purchased with bitcoin. Then I fire up virtualbox (self-compiled, in tails), and connect to *another* VPN account. It's VPNs all the way down.    
     
    
I'm getting tired of this fantasy, just use bitaddress.org.    
But i do literally roll dice.

Coinbase are belong to us.    :D
But seriously, they're a good company, and I have personally had hundreds of BTC transactions with them, totaling hundreds of BTC. They rock, and it sounds like they dealt with you patiently. Why were your customers complaining?
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:42:30
meh, you're wrong. McDonald's has wifi all over the world, and it's super convenient to use them when you're travelling. Just put your connection through two vpns, and you're golden :)

I'm going to try to reply and explain this patiently, without being mean or condescending.    
A VPN is an encrypted network. It resided on top of the internet. A VPN doesn't care if you are sniffing the lower network. A VPN doesn't care if you are man-in-the-middling the network traffic. Why doesn't the VPN care? Because the VPN is encrypted! Like Bitcoin, a Virtual Private Network Connection relies on Encryption. So, unless McDonalds has broken SHA or ECC, we're good. Understand?

Do you really think the world is improving? It's not. Our population is out of control.    
Maybe you mean that technology is progressing, and i agree. But, towards what end?

too many.    
I have all kinds of existential dilemmas now. I want to help people but i don't know if the continuation of humanity is positive. Should I ease the suffering of my neighbors with gifts? Or should I try to be a politician and affect change globally? Towards what end?  etc etc  
Being wealthy with a conscience is the same as being poor with a conscience, but with more guilt and confusion.

Thanks for the reply. I was very inspired seeing a guy in NYC giving away soup from his truck. I want to volunteer like this, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to do so, and where help is most needed. This world is fucking depressing

Forget Gox. We'll know when we know, or we won't.    
You are obviously promoting your investment in Bitcoin.     
Obvious troll is obvious. This is the second time (as far as I've seen) that you are posting about Bitcoin on reddit.    
You're intelligent, but not especially so. You have a voice because you were involved with a social network, and you are an olympic athlete.    
There are many intelligent people in this sub, some with Bitcoin fortunes rivaling yours.    
Some of us are better athletes than you.      
We all like Bitcoin for different reasons.    
You are a wealthy individual. What is your motivation for promoting Bitcoin? Are you trying to pump your investment?    
What is your vision for the future of humanity?    
Are you religious? Do you believe in a Holy Apocalypse?    
Bitcoin, towards what end?
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:54:44
Ok. I guess we're on different wave-lengths or pages or whatever.    
It's hard for you to understand that cryptocurrency is unlike your current understanding of finance, and you can't follow and understand that your learning about it (cryptocurrency) is harsh.    It's a steep hill, with a great view at the top.    
I'm in my twenties (maybe), and if you don't know that the market is cruel, you're in for a difficult life. Can i recommend a vasectomy without insulting you?

@_date: 2014-02-08 03:31:55
that's kind of pessimistic. I've seen a lot of posts about lost coins, and the community has been very helpful and generous, fwiw    
I know that the bitcoin ecosystem is hard to navigate. It's like the wild west, but, there are a lot of well meaning cowboys out here

I'm not German. Be dubious. ;p You can take me at my anonymous word or not, doesn't matter to me.    
You're still talking in terms of dollars instead of btc, so it appears that you don't really *get* bitcoin.   
You are doing the newbies a disservice by ranting that coinbase DELAYED the availability of your btc, which you should never have been keeping with them in the first place.    
    
Anyway, it sounds like you may have been fucking up if your customers were complaining?    
This was a learning experience for you: cold wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:53:29

@_date: 2014-02-08 05:37:56

I'm not going to delve into your historic posts, because I don't care. You sound like a sociopath, out for yourself at the expense of others. I hope you aren't, but that's what you sound like.    
Like the kind of person who tramples others trying to exit buildings, the kind of person who borrows money but never repays because they're "entitled" to it.

transparency is a word which groups throw around when they're hiding something.   
bitcoin means you don't have to care if someone is transparent or hiding.    
you're doing it wrong.    
Look at me. I'm being obnoxious and mean, and I'm not the least bit transparent.    I'm totally opaque, maybe I'm insane! 
Anyway, the results are in and you are:
- 80% ignorant
- 10% self entitled
- 10% stupid    
Educate your self. The market is cruel
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:36:01
this is not stability. this is the market waiting. we need some closure re gox/ tx maleability.    
We're all bullish, because bitcoin is revolutionary. There's no stopping the train.    
But we might be stuck in between stations until there's clarity about the missing 800k

I bought dice on ebay. I bought 12 random d6 dice. They're all different. I roll them in a drawer lined with felt. I do this because i have a shit ton of btc. I do a bunch of other shit to be safe, and I should probably post how, for new users
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:03:45
you're spamming. I said that with the intention of *not* promoting exchanges as banks
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:26:06
I'm not incensed, rabid or blind.     
You had a customer complaint.    
Customers suck.    
You were relying on a third party for transactions with your customer.    
Your third party acted on the complaint.    
You bitched.    
    
Look at this situation as an outsider, from my view.    
Also, if coinbase was so awful, don't use them. If enough customers leave coinbase, a replacement will arise
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:10:45
we're all us
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:34:19
Stop blaming coinbase, and start seeing where you messed up. You're learning about cryptocurrency. It's a harsh teacher.    
I saw that you were asking for an exchange. I use BTC-e for LTC&lt;-&gt;BTC NMC&lt;-&gt;BTC, cryptsy for other altcoins, and coinbase. Best of luck
