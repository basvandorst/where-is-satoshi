Where is that option, cb or gdax? Going into gdax redirected me to cb and I just had sepa and bank card option. They already have my bank card details since I bought using this method initially.
Also, since my posting, I've heard negative issues with revolut anyway.
Surely there's an easy option to get my money back into cash?

Hi, relative newbie Here. I hold a small amount of btc, eth, LTC on gdax. Relatively soon, I'm planning on selling a little to get my original stake back. On gdax, when I transfer some to my euro wallet...what actually happens to these 'coins'? They disappear from the 22 billion or whatever in eventual existence? What do gdax do? Sorry if a stupid question.
Secondly, I want to buy other stuff... monereum, ripple, maybe verge, dash too (opinions welcome on these), but maybe just 100-200 USD each to start....part b) I want to buy with non crypto currency...are there any exchanges that do this? And pretty quickly too.
Thirdly, I need a wallet, I'll get onto that...is paper one sufficient if I don't hold thousands of dollars?

Ok, looks like I did the whole transfer the 6 euro to my coinbase euro wallet, and despite reports, it took under s day to hit there.
So, guess it's all good to go now? Transfer my gdax coins to my coinbase euro wallet and withdraw via revolut?!
Oh, what actually happens to the coins when I move the value of them into my bank account?!

Thank you! Looks like I've linked coinbase and revolt... hopefully. Just waiting on 6euros to be transferred and then guess I'm good to go making the transfer from cb to revolut to bank
