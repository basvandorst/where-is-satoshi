Easy funding, but the 3-4 day wait time is really inconvenient. BitCoin is just really inconvenient, it will not be widely adopted. It is simply to hard for the average person to acquire.

Even more helpful. Thank You.

I see your point. The barrier to entry is still very cumbersome.

That's not unreasonable. Maybe 1/3 1/3 1/3 even or whatever.

I whole heartedly agree here. Whenever I hear someone say "I put all of my money/bank account/retirement fund/nest egg/hope/etc into one investment (stock, bond, business, forex, house, piece of land, time share, car, drug of choice)" I realize they have very little intelligence when it comes money management. Look what happened to esteemed institutions like Lehman Brothers, which was over 150 years old at its collapse, or Bear Sterns, which had about 90 years. They're gone. This can happen to any singular company, asset class, commodity, or currency in an instant. If BTC are going to explode in value, than you would only need 5-20% of your portfolio in them in order to do really well.

This response is nonsense. Say I am looking for any sort of currency, would you suggest I auction items in whatever nation's currency i desire? Oh need some euros? Just auction some items on ebay.de . This is not convenient or even slightly practical. I've been banned from Ebay several times, so online auctions are, in reality, very difficult for me.  I want bitcoins for actual purposeful transactions, not to simply have a 0.000234 bitcoins in my wallet.

I am in the same boat as OP, except I am in the US. No one here has offered any useful explanation on how to easily buy bit coins. It seems as if bit coins are a currency reserved for the technical elite.

I've been mining and visiting faucets. I am up to a grand total of .0022 BTC!!!

I lack a printer. Being digital currency, it would be great if it could, you know, easily be acquired digitally. I'm in the midst of waiting to fund dwolla to hopefully purchase some on an exchange.
