Bitcoin may be able to tell me that an organization paid $100 to an individual, but it does not tell me what it was for. Was it salary? A reimbursement? A bribe? Was the organization supposed to be using that money to pay for salary? Were those reimbursed items allowable items? There's more to auditing than merely determining what money was used for.

How do you design this in a way that prevents people from just driving off without paying? 
With a credit card you can pre-authorize the card and then finalize the transaction once the amount is known. You can't do that with Bitcoin - somebody has to initiate the send transaction, so there is no way of ensuring that payment will ever be made. 
You could pre-pay for a specific amount of electricity, but that's annoying because you never know exactly how much you will need. 
You could have an RFID card that you use with the charging station which links up to an online wallet with a balance... but that's exactly where we are now. 
The RFID-based units are almost sort of reliable... I don't want to have to screw around with anything that requires a functioning network connection.

Whoever set up the "donation" actually set it up as an order for a fixed amount. Because the sending address tends to be unknown to the receiver, the verification process depends at least in part on the receiving address receiving the correct amount of BTC. That's why you got the error message. The particular way things were set up do not accommodate donations of varying amounts very well.

Exchanges are where you take money (USD, Euro, etc.) and buy Bitcoin. The function of the exchange is to allow the market to decide what Bitcoin is worth in terms of another currency. 
To be able to buy on an exchange, you need to get funds into your exchange account. Exchanges sometimes do this in-house, but often they don't. It's usually more efficient to hand off this function to another party that specializes in it. This is what Dwolla does. You transfer your money from your bank account into Dwolla, and then you make a payment to Mt.Gox.
The verification thing is a requirement of the US government. If Mt.Gox/Dwolla wants to operate here, they have to abide by the government's laws, in this case those on money laundering.

It's really no more difficult than buying any other currency is. 
If you want easy, use BitInstant. You make a deposit at one of many locations and you get your BTC or your exchange credits (which you then use to buy BTC). While it does not require any personal information, it's not cheap with fees at about 4-5%.

Currency is no good if it's not a long term store of value. If I can't be reasonably sure that the $100 USD I convert into BTC today is still going to be worth roughly $100 USD in a month, I'm not going to keep that BTC around. 
This is going to seriously hinder the use of BTC (because converting between currencies is a hassle - why do it when I could just use any of a number of more convenient payment methods?), which means you'll just have a bunch of speculators left. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:58:46
No. Each MtGox account holds BTC and various currencies. When you execute a trade, it happens entirely within MtGox. If you sell 15 BTC for $20 each, then your account decreases by $300 and increases by 15 BTC, while someone else's account increases by $300 and decreases by 15 BTC. It isn't until you withdraw your money from your MtGox account that things move in the BTC economy. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:53:40
If they already withdrew the coins and the transaction went through, then you're right - MtGox can't get them back. I'm guessing that's what the guy who started all this did. Unfortunately for MtGox, withdrawals go through very quickly. I don't know if that means they're going to pay out of pocket to get everything back in order.

It would be reflected in the exchange rate, but no actual BTC will have changed hands until that someone withdraws the BTC from his MtGox account.
@_date: 2011-06-11 10:57:27
I'm in the same situation. Liberty Reserve felt a little sketchy, so I went with Dwolla. Verification happened quickly enough, but the transaction to transfer into Dwolla is taking forever. The money's gone from my bank account, but it's not in my Dwolla account yet. Like you, it was supposed to have completed on the 10th. 
While I think this is more a problem with our glorious electronic banking system than Dwolla itself, it is very frustrating. I have watched BTC rise from ~$18 to ~$31 and fall back to ~$20 unable to do anything.

Blockchain by default uses some transaction fee. If you try to send the entire contents of your wallet, the transaction will fail because you have not reserved anything for the transaction fee. You need to take the transaction fee into account when sending coins.
Many other wallets will also do this, so you will still need to pay attention when sending coins.

You would account for BTC the same way you would account for any other foreign currency. There are already existing standards that tell you how to deal with this.
