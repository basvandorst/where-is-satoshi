I picked mine myself thinking it would confirm eventually and I was not in a hurry but it got kicked out of the first mempool after 48hrs but was then rebroadcast by another node and finally I got it back 48hrs later in my electrum wallet..... But blockchain.info still says it's "pending" to go to the exchange address..... Blockcypher says it still at my first address so I'm not sure if it will go through after the backlog....
I had one once that took 4-5 weeks to confirm (I didn't used to send any fee for moving funds between my own wallets for the last 6 or so years)

Nothing since then and this is going into day 14...

I think the gains will offset the tx fee for 99.9% of btc users...... You use a small example to make your point that you can post a $20 necklace anywhere, postage is not free and neither is insurance.... Someone last week moved 14,400 btc somewhere for the same fee it would have cost for $20......bitcoin also doesn't risk  getting or stolen in the postal system, getting impounded or detained at borders and the costs of moving previous metals get exponentially larger by how much you need to move.... A tonne of gold moved from new York to Hong Kong would be insanely more expensive than a btc tx for the same value

The fact that you believe your usd is so bulletproof invalidates the rest of your post but I haven't time to write pages ....

They are cool, undoubtedly.
But other motorcycle owners call them "hardly ablesons" because they are old tech selling on brand ideology rather that technical innovation.
It's still a very nice bike, it just pales in comparison when you check the new yahama mt-10 or the BMW s 1000's etc
They're about the same price, maybe a bit less but they've got a hell of a lot more tech for the same price and sometimes less... 
But still applaud this harley dealer for accepting CryptoCurrency, he will find out in a year or two the btc he got for this bike is worth all the bikes on his showroom floor combined :)

Same here bro, I have been through the roller-coaster of self doubt so many times price moves don't even affect me anymore....
The worst trade I have made, in % terms was selling 20% of my btc for gold less than a year ago, the price was 1250 and people like VinnyLingham were saying it's going back to 800 etc and it went the opposite way.... 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:45:27
The people who buy it will probably do so through a lawyer and use it to shelter their money offshore and save having to pay tax..... I doubt anyone who intends to buy it would be planning to live like the locals in a shack....

i have no desire to cash out into fiat anyways so im happy enough for my wealth to live on the blockchain 
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:35:37

i dont think they should be celebrated for this ,it shouldnt take them over a month to see if there is $200k that needs refunded AFTER being alerted by the sender

me and you maybe related lol

Your right, 85%+ is moving to segwit 2x 
You can disagree all you like but your 5% altcoin  with different pow will not be a bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:46:12
Satoshis coins are bigger if you want to go treasure hunting.... 
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:40:18
Bitfinex did it cleaner, they are still in business lol
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:43:45
Electrum is not "trustless" software.... Stick with core software since you already have it
@_date: 2017-07-05 12:31:59
90% are signalling segwit2x, I don't particularly like it  but I'll follow the majority..... Anyone who doesn't is just foolish and selfish to try and impose their own rules on a community that doesn't want it and won't accept it anyway
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:06:59
So, they're activating it on which date /blockheight? 
Should btc users really have to check twitter or reddit to see if they're in danger of a replay attack or on the wrong chain or whatever?? 
It doesn't bother me because I run a full node but it's going to make non technical people people who bought into the digital.  gold 2.0  feel insecure and that's the last thing you want to do 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:29:57
Not the house, bet the whole damn farm...

Breadwallet is Absurdly high 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:13:00
i dont know ,if it brought enough benefits without the problems of the old stoneage blockchain we have now  people might accept it ...........i dont know enough about the technical pros and cons of this technology to make any opinion yet 
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:41:56
All the wealth i have now came from bitcoins ,but i have divested into other assets (property ,gold,altcoins and some stocks ) over the years as btc value grew and grew....I still have over  50% in btc tho ....
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:43:15
the fact that you say it  needs to be made known that coinbase didnt steal someones funds doesnt say too much about coinbase .......How could they steal it when his bank sent it into their bank account anyway?
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:06:53
No, you've got it backwards

Flying around the rest of the world doesn't involve such aggressive searches...

like roger ver ? yes of course you could ....
but id wait for 7-8 figures before id move to a tax haven and renounce my citizenship lol 
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:16:38
It fixes a lot actually, if someone wants to waste money spamming, let them, it will cost him a lot more money to fill an 8mb block with spam
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:59:06
They're is nothing to upgrade, people could use EC with current infrastructure 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:29:10
Bitcoin cores wallet.dat is normally encrypted, I hear the jaxx guys don't even bother with encryption... 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:10:12
A good rule of security is obscurity, people have been hacked because their identity was somehow linked to reddit and Twitter bitcoin related accounts, throwaway email and reddit should be mandatory if you are interested in maximum security 
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:03:43
Do you think a technology like decentralised Acyclic Graph or "dag" would ever be able replace the blockchain on Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:14:28
They can't prioritize answering emails by $$$ amount lol, how would they know they $$$ amount without first reading the emails?? Lol
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:58:47
If eth price keeps falling it will be unprofitable to mine in under 2 months
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:56:38
I would be surprised if it even gets off the ground, the barry silbert coin has segwit2x and it intends to scale up the blocks so we end up with 16mb capacity in around two years.... 
Anything else is simply not enough anymore, 1mb segwit is a non starter at this late stage in the game
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:51:52
1mb blocks ain't enough... 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:23:26
Even Vitalik says turing complete is only a red herring and not true in reality
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:42:18
But Goldman Sachs said yesterday btc is going to $3950 after the next shakeout
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:03:50
8k is probably a hot wallet, if that's his life savings it would be a terrible wipeout
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:51:19
Actually, a block bump would be quicker easier and more acceptable than segwit 
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:19:24
1mb bitcoin can't cope anymore, it's obvious, the sooner we upgrade the better
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:23:24
It maybe cold enough in that area to mine without cooling... Some parts of China get pretty cold
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:51:21
So, you're saying he's a dipshit? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:31:16
Could be worse guys, coulda bought eth at 420...lolz
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:30:41
Doesn't matter, first things are first, and security in btc is  Uninstalled
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:49:05
Eth will fork. Again and no doubt it will get hacked, I'm sticking with btc, 100k he we come
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:22:53
i thought BU and CLassic were user configuarable ?

This isn't Satoshis bitcoin anymore if  you make those kind of changes
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:44:01
I haven't reached that point yet, but probably closing in on it.... 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:09:38
this isnt a winner take all scenario where the loser will go to zero ......btc can do some things eth cant do very well and its more reliable ,but eth is more malleable to suit differnt  types of applications .......
if you want a coin that can outshine  btc .eth ,xmr all built into 1 package check out byteball
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:25:52
Phones thesedays have fingerprint unlock and remote wipe and wallets are also protected by a password, I feel perfectly safe in keeping btc on my phone and it would be a challenge to see anyone being able to find a lost phone, manage to open it without the pin and then steal the btc with my fingerprint and pass phrase before I could wipe the device or brick it remotely... 
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:57:32
By all measures...
