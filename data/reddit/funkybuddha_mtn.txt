No new money is coming in.. so the whales are causing this dip setting up a trap to rob the hodlers. Crypto veterans when they see top coin's value free falling. They buy the dip and the whales cash out which causes another dip. They again bring the prices up a bit and hodlers start dreaming about another bull run.. and few days later another blood shed... holders jump right into the trap and buy again.. follows another dip.. Hodlers are the new cash cow for the whales... when  Hodlers are tired of this game and stop falling for the same trap over and over... then the whales are going to manipulate the market finally bringing the long awaited bull run...

I would have been easily been destroyed by this recent bloodbath  but when i tried to invest during 2018 jan-feb local exchanges stopped accepting fiat due to massive influx of new investors ... my first investment in crypto was around late 2018 Feb/March. I am still down 75%.

I have been in crypto since Feb 2017,the only thing saved me from investing during ATH was local exchanges didn't accept any fiat due to mass influx of new investors. This market crash is the worst i have seen so far. This manipulation is  going to scare away anyone trying to get in. What are the whales planning to do this time around?
