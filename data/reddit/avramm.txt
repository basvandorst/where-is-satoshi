It's the same economics as the old 419 scams.
Only needs a couple of suckers to make it worthwhile.

Yea, I'd take a Model S any day.

Same same.
But different.
But still same.
@_date: 2019-03-28 02:47:03
Yea, keeping your coins on an exchange that openly, brazenly and routinely revokes access to their customers' money is just asking for trouble. You can go to a bank for that privilege.

ICOs, STOs and IEOs are different beasts.

I'd actually like to implement a stable wallet. A wallet that maintains a synthetic dollar position by shorting an equal amount of swaps on the server side. It would mean that you can hold BTC in the stable wallet without worrying about its value changing.
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:56:31
It's also a lie.
They are **able** to provide you with more information. They are electing not to. And they don't need to, because the funds stored on Coinbase are not yours. They belong to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:36:46
LOL, I'm sure people are queuing up to declare the contents of their wallets.
@_date: 2019-03-28 09:53:49
Or not. Just as easy to short a Bitcoin as buy it.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:53:13
Cash settled options are completely normal throughout the financial industry. They're contracts. The option to buy or sell at a fixed price.

Clear bull indicator. I'd buy as much as possible.

What do you think will drive adoption more - The arrival of native Bitcoin tech built into smartphones, or the ascendancy of the Lightening network?

"It's always a good time to buy. HODL"
I get annoyed with that. It's NOT always a good time to buy. It's terrible advice.

The beauty of using Veracrypt is it's based on the E4M code - written by someone who has a small percentage chance of being Satoshi :)
@_date: 2019-04-04 06:56:42
There's a reason that Bitfinex drifts so far way from the spot price everywhere else. It's an island. 
They're either on fractional reserve and you're in a queue until it's your turn to be able to withdraw, or they are having banking issues. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:05:17
Don't deal with exchanges who deal in fiat. Too much risk.
@_date: 2019-04-09 05:26:51
The fact that you're having to even think about this is a massive UX failure, imo.
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:12:33
You're talking about a very small number of data points. Be cautious of over extrapolation.
@_date: 2019-04-16 02:39:46
I think the Bitcoin ATM owner should have a better warning and helpful information. This will just scare people.
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:09:32
You know you're in a bull market when people start freaking out when you're only up 1% for the day.

Looking at the charts, it seems likely to be 6 days away.

God bless the free market.
@_date: 2019-04-15 02:46:01
Then no one should trust Roger Ver on anything related to cryptography.
If Ver believes that that CSW is Satoshi without cryptographic proof, he cannot be trusted.
Edit: Is that still true? I don't follow the crypto personality cults.
@_date: 2019-04-26 05:12:11
The standard of proof seems to be very low to me. For the bizarre CSW saga, cryptographic proof or GTFO. It's as simple as that, we're a crypto community after all.  
For everything else, it just looks like autistic kids having an argument on a forum. Grow up.
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:59:49
The weekly charts showed 6, steady weeks of price growth before the spike earlier this week, unheard of since October 2017. This week is week 7, also green, unheard of since April 2017. Yes, volatility has spiked and the price is moving around a lot. But the weekly trend it still for growth.
It's unlikely to retrace far in my opinion, and with the halving coming up next year, now is about as good a time as any to get in.

That's insane. That can't be real, can it? They are tracking what users do with their own money?
If that's true, they have massively misread the market in which they are operating.
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:28:24
"New users" includes the vast majority of people. We're super early in the adoption curve.
@_date: 2019-04-26 08:00:34
Yes, I would have expected the opposite effect. People would swap their Tether for Bitcoin.

Every time I see this mania creeping in, I just want to sell.

The major indexes which weight average price across exchanges have been green for 7 weeks. Which is more significant than a single exchange.

Has anyone seen McAfee and CSW in the same room at the same time?
The prosecution rests.
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:39:30
Beautifully put.
And if I don't like it, I can use another exchange.

Also 2 years (April 2017) since we had 7 consecutive weeks of price growth (as we are currently).

Those coins will never move. He wouldn't need to move them though, just sign a message with the private key.
Satoshi was Hal Finney. Of that I'm reasonably sure.

CHINA BANS BITCOIN
Clear sign we're heading back into bull market territory. China used to ban bitcoin several times per week. Happy memories.
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:07:26
If inflation is at 2%, your money will half in value every 35 years. 
If you are sued, or are subject to asset seizure, you could lose everything.
Bitcoin is not inflationary. Governments can't manipulate it for their own benefit. Judges and IRS operatives can't get their hands on it.
Is it too late to buy Bitcoin? No.

Average speed of a car in Hong Kong is about 8mph. 
You'd be amazed at how many Porsches, Ferraris and Lambos there are here. I could probably buy the shell of a Lambo and just park it outside my apartment.

Now I'm unable to imagine anything \*but\* Greenspan doing coke and banging hookers. Thanks for that.

Greenspan is the John McAfee of fiat.

@_date: 2019-04-01 01:29:48
That's weird.
In Hong Kong, "The Genesis Block" is a OTC exchange, crypto community centre and work space for crypto devs. We also have bars in HK that take Bitcoin. Including hefty discounts for paying with BTC.
How can you have a bar called Genesis Block Bar that doesn't take Bitcoin? It's like a band calling itself "Free  Beer"
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:29:04
I think the 21st is the day we'll see the golden cross for the 200/50 MAs. That's a pretty important bullish signal. I'd be surprised if we don't see a significant bump in price following that.
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:32:28
LOL, anyone who thinks this conman is Satoshi cannot claim to understand cryptography.
If you run any kind of coin, token or exchange and believe that he is Satoshi, users should avoid you like the plague.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:54:18
I don't want to use any exchange that has exposure to Fiat, Tether or deals with the US in any way.
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:24:13
I don't know CZ, but I don't have any reason to think he's a scammer. You have nothing to support the suggestion that the report is "BS" - they don't have answers yet, which is unsurprising.
Problems with 2FA means that their 2FA process has been compromised, not that individual users were hacked.

I wasn't talking about an exchange, but whatever you need to believe.

Using the supposedly segregated client fiat funds as their slush fund. I mean, they were very clear in claiming that USDT was 1:1 backed. Then they quietly changed the definition after the NYAG went after them. Now it seems that USDT is backed by fiat for less than 80%.
I'd call that fraud.

Advantages of Gold:
1. Far more stable as a store of value currently. This is purely a market cap thing.
2. Gold heists aren't as common as Bitcoin heists.

I've heard some very charitable explanations of his behaviour.
One I heard at the weekend is that he is part of a directed effort to protect the real Satoshi by putting forward so much noise and different versions of reality that it's confusing. Basically the Putin/Trump method.
That would be more believable if he wasn't perjuring himself in court.
@_date: 2019-05-24 01:13:51
Cool story brah.
I love crypto-erotic fan fiction.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:15:50
I can absolutely believe it, since I've worked in a business like that. It's not an indication of shady business practices, especially since the company I worked for was the most trusted in the business, for good reason.
The location of their servers tells you nothing. They likely use a data centre.
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:53:32
You can't foresee who might be looking at this and for what reason.
10 years from now, it could be a disgruntled employee, the IRS, an ex spouse. Not trying to scare you, just drill a little opsec into you.
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:55:49
A Bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2019-05-08 08:55:47
Bitcoin is infinitely divisible (at least in theory), so it doesn't really matter, since the price will naturally adjust to the supply, as the supply decreases.
Not a stupid question at all. Fiat currency, like US dollars are inflationary - the US prints more at will, so their value will always go down in the long term. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, so assuming it is adopted, its value will always go up in the long term.

The commenter made the claim that it was ridiculous to not know where a company was based, that it was indicative of shady practices.
I used personal, firsthand experience to refute it.
You don't HAVE to trust Binance. No one made that claim.
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:11:12
Their location isn't unknown.
It could be viruses (unlikely). Phishing is possible, but would require a data breach first.
Look you could be right, I'm just an evidence kinda guy.
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:00:04
Not a fan of Binance, but their transparency and their immediate commitment to plug the gap from their own funds is to their credit.
