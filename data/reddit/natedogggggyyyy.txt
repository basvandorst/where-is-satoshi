The average user probably knows how it works because its not easy to use. I recently told my buddy about public keys and private keys and he had a OH SHIT moment as he sent all his bitcoin from coinbase to the keepkey that shapeshift gave out for free a while back. Coinbase users don't even know how it works and thats the closest the average user gets to. I think most people on this subreddit know more than the average user (IMO). The ones that I thought would know but in reality  don't know nor care are all over here in California and at conventions such as e3...

Ah I see. Interesting stuff. Thoughts on lightning network and off chain payment channels? ��
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:22:28
I suggest a cold wallet storage (offline wallet). Ledger nano s, keepkey, trezor all work. 
Open the wallet and get familiar with it. Back it up and learn about it. Then when you are ready, copy your public key address and paste it into the receiver address box. Click “send”. 
Note: NEVER give out your private key, it’s the same as giving out the front door key if your home.)
Treat your public key like your house address and the private key as the key to the house. If people want to send money to you VIA e-mail (see what I did there), they’ll have the ability to.
Some things to keep in mind: 
Bitcoin takes about an hour for final confirmation (6 block times) so after you send it, don’t freak out when it’s not there in 30 seconds. Also, keep in mind that all bitcoin addresses start with a “1” or a “3”. If you see something like “0x.....” that’s an ethereum address. Only send bitcoin to a bitcoin address otherwise you risk losing it. It’s a one time deal, just like if I were to hand $100 cash to the wrong person.. that would be it. There’s no “take backs”.  
Best of luck! You’ll fall down the rabbit hole soon enough and next thing you know it’ll be 4 days later and you’ve become a bitcoin veteran. Lol

The best way I could put it without complicating things too much: 
Imagine you and I go out for some food. You pay the tab on a card so now I owe you $10 for food. Then we go for non alcoholic drinks somewhere and I pay. Now you owe me $4. This means I owe you a total of $6. This keeps on going throughout the night as we transact back and forth, paying each other on the lightning network. Now it’s all direct, and it’s kept between us. When we are done for the night, the final amount is accounted for (let’s say at final I owe you $8). The transaction is broadcast on the bitcoin blockchain for everyone to see that I paid you $8. Nobody else will see all the back and forth that we had. This enables lower fees, and only important/final transactions to be broadcast.
Now what about the custodianship and the judges for a person who tries to broadcast the wrong amount? We’ll save that for another time haha. Lightning network allows for quick micropayments by creating payment channels between people ��

If you really are questioning it, you can recover the wallet with different hardware using your private keys or 12 word phrase. Don't share that with anyone though, theyre like the keys to your house

@_date: 2019-08-16 03:47:37
educate yourself, then think about security. Keep it in an offline cold storage if you can. But EDUCATE YOURSELF first. If you're not educated, the chances of losing everything is much higher

@_date: 2019-08-31 21:47:40
bitcoin is a store of value and not a very efficient in its use-case for payments. It depends what kind of business you run, I guess. I think its a case-by-case issue. I personally have been living off bitcoin and get paid in it. This is because I live in the US, and it turns my client base from domestic to international. I'm a film maker and I can charge anyone from anywhere in the world exactly how much I want based on the deliverables. It works for me. It might not work for you, though.

I think proof-of-work is here to stay (for bitcoin). Everything else, we don't need it. We don't need ANOTHER proof-of-work protocol, because we have one that works

IF its in a child address/derivative address... you'll need to generate the private key to that specific address. Let me explain what that means.
Imagine a tree... the main address when you first open a bitcoin wallet is the tree trunk.
As you hit "receive"... some wallets generate what's called a derivative address (you can see the importance of that later). The derivative address is like a branch that stems from the tree trunk.
Tree trunk address - 44' 0' 0' 0
Derivative address # 1 (first tree branch) address - 44' 0' 0' 1
Derivative address  (2nd tree branch) address - 44' 0' 0' 2
So let's say you received bitcoin on branch  
You need to get into the 2nd tree branch ... not the trunk. If you have a 12 word seed, you can generate the private key for the trunk AND all the branches. You need to find the private key to the 2nd branch, which is 44' 0' 0' 2
By importing the branch wallet you gain access to the 2nd tree branch. Then you can send that bitcoin to a new address. There is a website that my buddy sent me: [
I would recommend trying it out with an empty wallet address first to test it out, etc.
I got paid in tether last month (and they sent it to a bitcoin derivative address)... so I had to scramble and recover it that way. I hope this is the case of what happened with the wallet you were using... cause then it is definitely retrievable.
Good luck to you!

bitcoin about to leave all the alts behind
@_date: 2019-10-27 05:51:08
If you don't own the private keys, you don't truly own your bitcoin... I recommend using the Exodus wallet (exodus.io). I use it as a hot wallet, as well as a keepkey hardware wallet for offline cold storage. If this all sounds super foreign to you, I wouldn't invest much - maybe $100 or less to get familiar with everything first. It's a process

@_date: 2019-12-02 07:01:53
My humble opinion: If quantum computing CAN break bitcoin private keys.. then that means every centralized bank account (their security is much lower than bitcoin's AES) will essentially be hacked as well. The entire world would have to worry about that before they can worry about what it's doing with bitcoin.
Also, with the developers currently immersed in encryption, it would not be difficult to upgrade the network to a quantum-resistant consensus algorithm. Bitcoin is like fungus, you can't really kill it and it'll adapt. It already has for the last 10 years

Take 50% upfront for the service in either bitcoin or a stable coin (if you're afraid of volatility use a stable coin). Provide the service and send an invoice for the remaining 50% and the bitcoin/stablecoin address. All of the people I work with I meet in person first and they shoot over the funds through the bitcoin wallet QR code that they can scan on my phone

from my understanding a wallet "balance" that's shown on a wallet is the same as an "unspent" transaction. It means that the address you're looking at has a (unspent) balance of 94,504 btc
