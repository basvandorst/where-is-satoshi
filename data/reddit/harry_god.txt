Smart guy, placed a little too much emphasis on free markets for my liking though.

Agee, not so much to do with the currency as human nature. Although the currency being used can arguably reverse crashes.


I would suggest that post Bretton system has had a substantially better record than the gold standard.

US government backs it, so I wouldn't go so far as to say "jack shit"

Fair point, although it goes on to say Hayek suggested continued contraction of the money supply contributed to the depression. As well, Austrians encouraged a laissez faire approach which we all know didn't work out all too well.

Gold standard didn't end until post depression; it was in fact one of the reasons for the length/severity of the depression.

And there's the problem

Generally, it's accepted that Government laissez faire approach entered the economy into a depression from a recession. Few disagree, although I don't plan to convert you over reddit.


Certainly wouldn't go so far as to say its ludicrous. I'd go so far as to say it's required in some circumstances (liquidity trap), and while government spending can't be the sole "spark" to economies, if you add in low interest (Increase MS) you have a pretty good starter economic policy to get yourself out of recession territory and back to growth.


I'm no math wiz either, but I'm pretty solid with my GDP growth numbers (stagnation FYI is 2-3%). Also, not too sure where you're getting 08 from?

"And here lies the problem with gold. Its supply bear no relation to the needs of the economy. The supply of gold depends on what can be mined."
I think that is what should be taken from this article.

Yes, much better than the alternative

Expanding the money supply is a key macroeconomic tool to avoid recessions/depressions

Ha, I guess I should have put "through 2008" instead.

You're not suggesting the overprinting of money was the reason for the great depression?
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:39:57


Not just a steep correction, a depression. The renewed growth only came after huge deficits on federal programs and WWII - so renewed growth actually requires government spending.


Extended stagnation? Its been four years. Also growth rates of around 4% are much better than -45%
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:51:29
Correct, technically they are saying that through "The supply of gold depends on what can be mined."
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:59:33
I would have to disagree and in fact suggest the opposite is true.
Also, apologize if I sounded patronizing in my previous comment.

Nixon in 1971 (But only temporarily of course)

Medium is the message

That's a more difficult question to answer. Many factors contribute to depressions, the monetary system being one of them. Arguably, it was an underlying reason since with the current system (Bretton Wood II) it could have been avoided.
EDIT- IMF has a good synopsis if you want to take a look (First two are most applicable -Cooperation and reconstruction (1944–71) &amp; The end of the Bretton Woods System (1972-81)):

I agree, so maybe we shouldn't discredit what he says about the bitcoin based off his prediction of the internet made in '98.
