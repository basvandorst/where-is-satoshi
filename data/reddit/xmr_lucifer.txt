If you're dependant on antidepressants and hookers, you have bigger problems than hating your job. I can't give you any specific advice since my situation is very different, but what spurred me to abandon my career was traveling to somewhere nice, warm and cheap and then returning home to another year of work. No light in the tunnel until next year..
Now I'm in Cambodia, it's a genuine shithole but I like it much better than my old life. People don't seem less happy here than where I came from, even though their situation is objectively a lot worse.
I look at the poverty around me and at the large number of expensive black SUVs on the streets, and I think about all the average people driving old scooters and working for $300/month or less. I went to a shopping center and they have 65" 4k TVs that cost as much as back home, more than a year's salary for most people here. It seems that flashing wealth and status is more important than fixing the problems here. I would love to feel connected to the people here, to share their dreams and burdens. It feels like a completely different world from what I'm used to. At the same time I'm an outsider to them, I can never be like them because I have too much money and too much outside perspective. I have been there, done that with things they don't even know exist (and vice versa).
One thing I can say though: If you're subjecting yourself to a job you hate and you're *not* saving for a very early retirement, get out. Financial independence is great. Anything else is just wasting your time/energy/sanity making someone else rich.

I don't know the current throughput but the new throughput would be 10x the current.


The stale rate is pretty low, it wouldn't be a problem. It would put pressure on poorly connected miners to demand more efficient block propagation.


20 1-minute confirmations would be equivalent vs. a 51% attack and much better against attacks with less hash power.
It would also improve the user experience greatly for anyone who's happy with 1 confirmation.

A constantly forking chain wouldn't be acceptable long term, just as the constantly spiking mempool is unacceptable long term. The tragedy is that the community has become too divided to come up with real solutions in time.

If the ETF is approved there are lots of fund managers and other big investors who will be able to include bitcoin in their portfolios. That would be really big because it would push the price up and give bitcoin more legitimacy in the financial world.
An agreement with a HFT company indicates that both the Winklevii and Virtu Financial believe in the COIN ETF and are preparing for it to be approved. It may not tell us much about the chances of the ETF being approved, but it's a data point and worth being aware of.
Of course this is pure conjecture.
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:47:16
There are two problems with the current mempool situation.
1. Unpredictable confirmation times and stuck transactions due to too low fee estimates
2. Rising transaction fees
1 can be solved with technology. 2 can only be solved with more capacity or less use. I would prefer more capacity.

The tax authorities originally interpreted the existing law to mean there should be VAT and no one with enough political power bothered to challenge them on it. It sucks but at least they've come around now.
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:41:45
Capacity is how many users bitcoin can have and how many transactions it can process.
The limit has been reached for how many transactions it can process as it is right now. That is a problem because existing users have to pay higher fees and because any additional users will increase the fees further. At some point there won't be any new users unless the capacity is increased. That would be bad for bitcoin because it would drive users to adopt altcoins instead. Bitcoin would lose its first mover advantage and become just another "shitcoin".
Yes capacity can be increased with technology. Right now the community can't seem to agree on how, but it's certainly possible from a technological standpoint. I think we need both a direct blocksize increase and a second-layer solution like LN. LN isn't ready yet, and even with LN we would still need more capacity on the blockchain in order to scale to billions of users. That's why I support a blocksize increase now and after that we should focus on a second-layer solution that the community can get behind.

You should care very much about privacy. You're not doing anything illegal now, but who knows what corrupt/misguided/gullible politicians will be elected next? What will they ban next? PayPal was quick to ban donations to Wikileaks. Governments have illegally imprisoned Assange and other whistleblowers for speaking out against corruption, surveillance, war crimes and other abuses of power. Censorship of Wikileaks is an attack on free speech and press freedom. Free speech and press freedom are fundamental safeguards against tyranny. If we don't care about privacy we could lose our privacy, then our free speech, then the rest of our freedom and all our rights with it.

Have you been living under a rock? is not perfect but the censorship in here is pretty blatant. I don't know if it's still the case but when was formed, this place had an official policy that any talk of a hardfork to increase blocksize was labeled "altcoin spam" and removed.

It's not a crazy conspiracy theory, just simple economics. Blockstream want to be first movers in the LN market, that's why they want small blocks and high fees so that people will be more eager to accept SW and LN now rather than further down the road when there is more competition for the customers.
They're not trying to hurt bitcoin per se, they think LN is inevitable and they just want to accelerate the transition so they can make money by taking a dominant market position. The side effects are bad for Bitcoin, but due to their cognitive bias they have trouble seeing the harm they are causing.

They can keep trading pre-fork BTC as BTC and list post-fork BTC as BTC-a and BTC-b, and keep trading in BTC until either BTC-a or BTC-b comes out as the clear winner. Withdrawing BTC will have to be disabled but withdrawing BTC-a and BTC-b should be enabled as soon as it's safe to do so (which depends on the exact nature of the fork)
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:11:49


That's called a double spend.
A fork is a change to the protocol. It's essentially harmless unless it's unintentional, contested, or not properly planned and executed. Even then it won't directly cause people to lose their bitcoins, but an accidental fork can expose people to double spend risk if they're unaware of it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:57:05


Or exchanges could simply state that prices are in pre-fork BTC eqivalent tokens where 1 BTC = 1 CoreBTC + 1 BUBTC. Then they can let people exchange between the 3 flavors of bitcoin-tokens independently of altcoins.
It seems like the best way to preserve stable pricing of altcoins without switching all altcoin markets to USD-equivalent tokens (not all exchanges even support USD deposits/withdrawals so switching to USD tokens would be a much messier endeavor).
Once a winner has been determined, should hopefully not take too long, markets can switch over to trading in the new post-fork BTC whichever fork that turns out to be.

It's not hard to comprehend, it's just that the reward subsidy is scheduled to continue for decades, and if Bitcoin continues on its trajectory to become a major global currency the value of the mining subsidy is going to grow much larger over the next decade or so despite the halvenings in that time.

Don't act as if the market has no say. The miners can't just ignore the users, then the users would take their money elsewhere. If BU activates and becomes the majority chain, we the community will still have to come up with a good scaling solution. The difference would be that we could spend a few years on it without bitcoin becoming unusable in the meantime. There are some good proposals out there already, I think a lot can happen in the next few years.

People are jumping in despite the volatility. They do so because they understand that the upside is worth the risk. As more people jump in and the price climbs further, the volatility lessens.
Right now it's more volatile than it has been recently because of the big pump to 8888 CNY and the subsequent correction. Before it did that it had a nice and steady climb that lasted for months without any scary moments. We'll see more and more of that the higher the price gets, but the climb to those heights must inevitably involve short periods of increased volatility.

How much would that cost? At the current 95% full 1MB blocks, it takes 50 kB per block to cause congestion. At 25% full 4 MB blocks it would take 3 MB per block. Quite a big difference. Maybe big enough to make such an attack prohibitively expensive?

Politicians are used to being able to inflate their way out of national debt. It's a hidden tax on all currency holders used to gradually bail out everyone with loans. With a non-national currency that option is no longer there, but politicians still spend money they don't have because nobody holds them accountable for the damage they cause.
The result is that they have to find some other way to reduce debt. Austerity, bail-ins and defaults seem to be the alternatives.
Iceland chose to default (though their debt crisis was slightly different). They seem to be on a path to recovery, but this time with bankers in jail and better politicians in government.

How long will that trend continue? How many users will bitcoin have at its peak? It won't be billions, not without much bigger blocks AND off-chain transactions. Right now we have neither.

It may seem sudden but we have been building up to it for a long time. If you zoom the chart out to show months and years it's not such a big jump in price.
$800-ish is also a level of major psychological resistance, so now that it's been broken we can go much higher in the next months.

It sounds like you're trying to imply that the meaning behind the word isn't a perfect analogy. But you're not saying that, you're just saying that's not what it's officially defined as. I know that already.

Yes. At the current bitcoin market cap the effect is negligible, but if bitcoin becomes the new global reserve currency the USD and other fiat currencies will suffer.

That's only ~51 GB per year. It could grow 20 times as fast and it would still only be 1 TB per year. Most people who are tech savvy enough to run a node also have the income to afford 1 TB per year without making a dent in their budget. It's not an issue at these levels. It's not like we need every user to run a node.

@_date: 2016-12-23 05:07:21
Maybe $800 is too high but it seems doubtful. The reward halving means only half as many coins as before have to be bought to maintain the price, and people are buying like never before (not like the 2013 bubble which was brief and obviously unsustainable).
Whether we can sustain prices much higher than $800 long term is another question. It wouldn't surprise me if we fall back to ~800 after a new bubble.

Its usefulness as currency is tied to the cost of using it. If no one could use it it would be worth nothing. The more people can and want to use it, the more it's worth.

You entered the numbers correctly but these are the wrong numbers to use:

At what point would it be off-putting? Because without bigger blocks the fees will keep rising until many users are put off and stop using bitcoin.

Sure, it can scale to infinite users as long as they never actually send or receive any coins.

CSV was not a controversial change. SW is.
@_date: 2017-04-03 21:14:04
The claim that nothing changes is false. If a significant majority adopts new rules, bitcoin is changed forever. The only difference between a hard and a soft fork is that the stragglers don't get booted off the network because their clients will still validate the new blocks. Any fork that uses the old rules will either die or become a very different coin than it was before the fork.

Why is the RAM need so great? Does the UTXO set need to be in RAM or something? I would think that's something that can be optimized.
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:39:30
It actually started with some very reasonable people asking for an increased block size limit to avoid the high fees we have now, because we believed high fees would slow adoption and weaken Bitcoin's competitive position against alternatives. The request was shot down by Greg &amp; co. because they believe high fees are a necessary feature. Over time the debate devolved into the mess we have now with many of the more reasonable voices having given up and moved on.
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:21:18
Don't you realize that the SW vs BU thing is about control? It's political, it's about whose vision Bitcoin will follow.
By focusing on technicalities you miss the bigger picture. In the bigger picture SW is a huge change and CSV is tiny.
@_date: 2017-04-04 07:13:19
If Bitcoin is going to succeed long term it has to maintain its dominant market position. That means the adoption curve must be exponential until we have billions of users. With an exponential adoption curve the price will also be exponential and the increase in price will more than cancel out the reductions in block rewards for many years. Actually I'm more worried that too much money will go to the miners if that happens.
The demand for cheap transactions isn't unbounded but it's a hell of a lot higher than Bitcoin can currently accomodate. A more scalable solution is absolutely necessary. BU will buy us time to agree on LN or an LN alternative, it won't solve the scaling problem.


I sure as hell don't say that.
The miners can veto changes to the protocol and force activation of hardforks, but if they abuse that power they risk the economic majority rebelling against them and changing the PoW algorithm.

Restore the most recent backup, patch the system to prevent reinfection. It's pretty simple if you have good backup routines.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:49:17
If there is a patch, it can be applied offline. If there isn't a patch then you have to find other ways of protecting the system. Firewalls, configuration, etc.
Backups are absolutely necessary and the only truly effective defense against this type of attack and a wide range of other problems that can and do happen. If you don't have backups you're fucked.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:48:53
"Long-term" in this context meaning half a century
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:09:14
My point being that half a century should be more than long enough to discuss tail emission or other solutions for incentivizing miners such as deciding on a reasonable fee structure based on actual transaction volumes. There is literally no need for fees right now except to restrict the transaction volume.
