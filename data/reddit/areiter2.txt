This picture is actually from a weed grow. The heat from the grow melted the snow, and so the man was caught.

You should try Bitcoin Cash

I opened the account when I first started, seemed like a good option then. Not so much now
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:29:30
That argument is irrelevant. We're not "shipping" anything here
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:27:54
I too would love to know this
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:53:00
uhh... whoops, haha

I get that, and I've been doing research. But I opened this wallet at the beginning (my beginning) and never had to deal with this. At least not until today when I tried to send a couple bucks to a friend, and now here we are. 
I know that we can choose our fees and the higher they are, the faster the tx goes through. But Xapo only allows you to choose two options (this is new for me), both of which are ridiculously high imo

Xapo. Online wallet, they have the private key (sry for the confusion)
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:51:41
Looking into it now, cheers

Or my wallet trying to screw me over since they have the private key.. Who knows
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:28:36
Xapo. I moved all my coins out and closed the account... I just realized this (original post) and liquified that wallet. It's bull shit
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:57:50
Agreed. I'm in the process of switching now. If you ever stubble across someone trying to use Xapo, tell 'em no
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:52:11
Shit is ridiculous. I get that the miners need to get paid... but come on

I'm a little confused as to what you mean with "censorship resistance." Would you mind explaining this a little more?
