* Most bitcoin fanatics are misogynistic (Stuff like this:  sure makes it hard to argue this point)
* Bitcoin is a scam, pyramid scheme, a ponzi scheme, etc.

* Bitcoins value is derived and backed by nothing.
* Most people using bitcoin are criminals buying/selling drugs or just trying to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.
* Mining is a huge environmental waste of resources.
