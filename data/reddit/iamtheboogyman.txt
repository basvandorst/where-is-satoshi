there was a question in a interview with roger ver around 6 days ago that addresses this video pretty well.
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:11:00
yep, lagging out pretty bad for me
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:12:58
theyve also got some badass features, my mate who is with them forgot his card and got cash out of an ATM via text to his phone. I was amazed.
But I shall have no ties with such an Anti-bitcoin bank.
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:47:59
Strange,  maybe because I got in in beta stage

be careful when investing guys, these sites pop up and disappear all the time. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:36:22
if you are going to buy often you might want to look at getting a credit card you can use without any international fees and use circle. Pay it off straight away from your debit account. That is if you an trust yourself I guess.

whilst I think its a great ad, I think its aimed at people who are already using/have bitcoin. Why would someone who doesnt know the purpose of  bitcoin go through the hassle of buying bitcoin, downloading your app and paying through that when they are happy paying with their credit card. There needs to be an incentive. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 11:45:51
pretty sure he says "bricksquad"
@_date: 2015-05-12 01:20:19
haha not that much has changed with mainstream media. 
Jeffrey corrects her at the start about bitcoin actually being very traceable and not anonymous, then at the end she comments on bitcoin's anonymity. In one ear and out the other.

with the tweet,...... sheesh.
joe rogan put out about 7 sarcastic tweets along with the conor mcgregor one.
one of which joe said that if he was ever to go out into the octogon he would like "culture club - do you really want to hurt me" to be the song that he enters the ring to. 
Should I write an article about that maybe not being the correct choice of song for joe rogan. 
No because he was being fucking sarcastic. 
what history has conor mcgregor got with bitcoin that would make the UFC accept bitcoin if he were to win?!?!??!
btw i love bitcoin and joe rogan
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:50:43
Naw his voice sounds heaps more panicy than usual,  
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:50:06
It was more of a add on
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:12:18
how rude, CLAM aint ded, just not worth much :)
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:16:36
I think Joe Rogan was just having a bit of a laugh... 
But hey, why not take what you can get. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:09:16
wow i didnt know that, thanks.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:19:27
xapo is the largest custodian of bitcoin??
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:23:15
at this point i feel like both sides sound like onecoin salesman
@_date: 2016-11-29 11:47:14
are you aware of any improvements in the pipeline to help rectify this problem?
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:32:28
if i could have instantly confirmed transactions with the same security as the bitcoin blockchain i would be all over it.
@_date: 2016-12-15 12:21:36
Exactly. I dunno why everyone is with the "you are going to jail" shit. Who has proof you transacted in anything illegal on alpha bay?
@_date: 2016-12-04 09:35:26

@_date: 2015-08-26 07:51:06
I have no idea what's happening here
@_date: 2015-07-06 08:07:27
Was wondering where I had seen this before
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:09:16
Nobody read that in that tweet he says, "(I think cap increase is a slippery slope).
That is not advocating it at all 
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:14:42
It may change the value of those coins though 
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:38:17
If the miners have too much control, take your money to another coin that doesn't have that problem . Its against the miners interest to have too much control
@_date: 2015-07-21 07:15:30
Sorry man I've Watched way too many it would take to long to find. But if you watch the last podcast Stefan was on they talk about a disagreement between Abby Martin and Stefan most of the time, if you listen to it you can see why Joe has formed that opinion. 
It was in the a later podcast that I heard Joe refer to Stefan as craxy.
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:06:55
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:34:31
He fucked up when he said "those who don't embrace it will be left behind." People hate that Shit, it makes them put up a wall straight away .
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:44:09
yeah sorry i confused Abby Martin with Ana Kasparian
@_date: 2016-02-03 10:03:51
I think an the logical answer is shit flavoured ice cream because of the lack of intestinal bacteria 
@_date: 2016-02-17 06:04:47
that scared the shit out of me, just the thought of a actual depression. 
I have been quiet about bitcoin as of late but this has encouraged me to be more outspoken again.
@_date: 2016-02-13 22:50:57
ah so like the ol' inputs.io
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:52:54
Joe Rogan has repeatedly called Stefan crazy after their last podcast. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 09:26:03
even if ether were to rise up and challenge bitcoins market cap, bitcoin aint going anywhere as long as there are miners mining it.
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:46:18
Pics for research purposes?
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:29:06

@_date: 2015-04-13 06:46:09
thankyou for your input

@_date: 2015-04-13 07:34:53
Yeah, Ive read a little on the bitcoinica missing coins.
It never seems to come up at the meet ups only on reddit.
But i'm not judging Coinjar on what one of the co-founders might have done.
I dont plan on holding a large amount of coins in any online wallet provider.
 
Just interested on how the fees and everything else works. 
But I have a card on the way now anyway so we'll see how it goes.
@_date: 2015-09-29 20:42:23
You can invest in my [loan]( if you haven't already!! 
@_date: 2015-04-13 13:13:51
So he hasn't changed his mindset... Thanks
@_date: 2015-09-30 05:59:30
Ah yes I'm the same when investing,  usually only in btc denominated loans. Saying that you and I are obviously bullish on btc price, there are plenty of bears and hedgers out there to fill the USD linked loans
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:37:31
I would say thats more of a bad thing, the market loves to squeeze leveraged positions 
@_date: 2015-09-07 06:12:38
I love this service
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:15:25
No u r the loser

I love these guys and have used it many times. But how can they be winning all these startup awards? it seems like are a  pretty basic service.

Can't watch right now. Anyone tell me what he says ?
@_date: 2015-09-21 01:26:15
Decentralize charter flights
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:49:35
What about "blockchain"? 
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:57:29
I imagine it would be extremely difficult to cash out such a large amount of bitcoin anonymously. maybe they would offer them a way to withdraw it with no strings attached
@_date: 2015-09-30 00:47:28
I don't think the interest would be any higher, I personally wouldn't because I would have less time to work with the money. 


I don't really understand what you mean here. 
 The loan I am taking is linked to USD, for example if the loan is 10BTC and at the time btc price is $250,  if price rises to $500 instantly after the loan is activated I would only have to pay back 5BTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:24:44
Shadymess might be talking about the time you publicly claimed you sold a bunch of BTC and started working on VIA(?). i remember at the time i took it as though you were no longer in support of BTC.

Thanks mate
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:40:46
its definitely the wallet itself, i am experiencing it right now
@_date: 2015-11-28 12:11:44
I use them several times a month,  thanks guys
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:14:46
So sick of people saying they don't like bitcoin, but they like the blockchain technology behind it. That IS bitcoin. 
Just say you don't like the speculative side of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:51:14
Uh oh, they caught on
@_date: 2015-03-11 05:19:37
just watched this video and I was amazed.
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:16:32
Go in and out of bitcoin using alt coins. Solved
@_date: 2015-10-11 14:49:45
I just got dumber by reading that 
@_date: 2015-10-31 11:37:50
Laziness,  I saw the address in my wallet and thought it was the one I previous sent 1 btc to. I thought that was the address I wanted the btc to go to so I sent it.  I realized after that it was the incoming transaction I was looking at, not the outgoing from earlier.  
@_date: 2015-10-31 12:07:29
thanks alot jack
