maybe someone can try a conversion like btc to usd and post the exact time and exchangerate ?
i will not give them my phonenumber just to try their service
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:22:04
its the same. its possible to generate illegal data out of a reddit message. possible that websites that lead to the information directly will have problems...
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:56:36
i think because some users can not withdraw USD over the bank system, they need to buy bitcoin to leave btce
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:11:00
no you need a code to read it right ? it is also possible to generate a code which would transfer the bill of rights into illegal stuff, but this has nothing to do with the bill of rights.

i had russian in scool for 9 years and today i couldnt even talk about the weather with a native russian. :D
just a warning
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:11:01
yes but the transactions on the bc are not a public instrument for writing and reading things. but i would bet if you share a link of a website which would show an illegal message in the bc, you will have a problem. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:37:46
be sure you dont get robbed and you can check the money is real

bitcorn is far away of being user friendly... it is the problem of the service provider to build software that automaticaly adjust the fee for example...

very nice. i once thought about the possibility to prevent email spam with bitcoin but i believed it would be very much too complicated to realize ;)
@_date: 2014-11-01 17:20:24
at the moment you can receive for example $ change to £ an send, but there are fees. So i think in future maybe it could be possible with bitcoins without or little fees. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:27:34
what do you think, when will they decide about the Bitlicence ? this year, or in a few month ?

and how could they make a transaction without doing 2F again ?
i hope you didnt lost much btc.. maybe enable email conformarion for transactions too

"Should I invest the rest"
no, i think 50% is more then enough
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:30:02
i never used bitreserve, but in the past there were many bitcoin services people lost their money to, so maybe at the moment bitreserve seems to be "the" investment for you, but it is always not good to trust so much money to one service or person. i read also many posts of people here who lost money this way and asking here what to do now.
so better get some distance and wait how you think about bitreserve in two months.

- until now i didnt know that your site exist, when i type in google "Bitcoin kaufen kreditkarte" there is nothing about your website, why ??  maybe you need to contakt german Bitcoinblogs like bitcoinblog.de and others...
- it is possible to upgrate your landing page. it could be look more professional and personal. maybe pictures of you and your team, maybe support chat...
- you have to fokus on ur spezial benefits. to get bitcoins easy and fast. this should become more clear, because this is the only reason why someone would use your service. like "Bitcoins kaufen in 5-10 Minuten Via: 
VISA  -  3 minuten
SOFORT überweisung  - 5 Minuten
- most germans dont have CC, so it also should become clear that its possible to get bitcoins fast without CC on the landing page. maybe fokus on the abilitys and funktionality of payment options
(i dont want anything)
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:38:47
yea because im from EU and i cannot choose $ to send. but the currency doesnt matter, there are always these hidden fees... :-)

you forgot the WU hidden fees.
WU tell me when i want to send 300 € to vietnam, the vietnam bank account will get only 294,05 € at the current forex rate + the normal WU fee of 4,90 €
@_date: 2014-11-09 01:16:02
the trading volume of altcoins is very low, so if some stupid people follow buying the same coins as the owner of bitpick do, ofcause the prise will suddenly rise. but the last people buying will make loss. this is just a scam. there is no masterplan for trading, and if somebody would know, why he should tell anybody..
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:45:32
there is always a little price difference between the exchanges, yes, but its getting more and more close because of the arbitrage traders. 
AND you not only making loss through thees differences, for example when you send from vietnam to Bitstamp, you make a little profit... ;-P
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:14:55
ok i just typed i want to send 1000 euro to japan in YEN.
WU sais from my 1000 € they will get 142582,52 YEN
when i calculate at the current EUR - YEN rate at finanzen.net (1 JPU = 0,0068 €) i see there is a hidden fee of  30,44 € + the normal fee of 4,90 €
i dont think this is an accident
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:42:26
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:06:32

thats why i dont have CC, but using bitstamp and kraken without fees for deposit
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:15:27
i send him money in 3 seconds from germany to the usa, thats convenience isnt it ? yes i need to give personal information to exchanges, like to banks, but not to other companys which lives from transmition fees. my bank fidor.de is in working together with kraken.com, iam sure in some months i can deposit, change € and btc in the same bankaccount, nothing other will be needed. there will be no use for paypal anymore.
the fees for bitcoins are only for energy, there is no cheaper way atm i think. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:44:45
nice one! ..better dont start trading now ;P
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:30:07
i can deposit/withdraw euro to my bitcoin exchange in about 5 minutes and there are NO fees. (fidor.de)
once i set up the axchange account the hole process is done in minutes and total fee of 0,X % fee, in BOTH directions. i also can do this on the way from my handphone.... 
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:54:52
lol... because with money he can decide by himself what to buy and where. its not that hard to understand, stop trolling
@_date: 2014-10-30 22:21:34
be careful with CC, paypal and other possible chargebacks, scams.
for me it looks like LB is a place for criminals and arbitrage traders
where u come from ?
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:59:03
i remember years ago nobody used paypal because it seems to be too complicated
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:27:16
they dont care because they know its not their money.. !!
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:39:27
lol this is so stupid i dont know what to say
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:20:37
paypal is just solving problems of current difficulties in using $ or €. bitcoin is money that dont need services like paypal, its solving these things by itself. sry for bad english. also i dont have a paypal account and dont feel like paying hidden fees and giving personal information to them. bitcoin seems to be complicated for new user, but it makes things easy
@_date: 2015-05-26 02:03:54
well he wasnt honest when saying mtgox is solvent, he just didnt know anything, talked bullshit because he was heavily invested in bitcoin. he quit us citizenship for avoiding paying taxes...  you think he all does this kind of shit because he is fighting for a better world an accidently making lots of money ?
@_date: 2015-05-02 09:36:16

money ? profit ? look how crazy he goes for money
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:40:51
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:46:52
no, why ? i mean when they get hacked and get insolvent or something like this, in worst case i only lose the money i had on the exchange. since i can trade there with 20x i only have 1:20 of the money i trade with on the exchange
@_date: 2014-11-09 01:21:49
no, sry ;P
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:16:37
iam surprised about the 5k bid at 350 still being there, so that wasnt only for advertising gbtc, seems to be a real bid
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:23:53
if you think so... my 10$ will help him more then comments like " you have eggs and flour ? make fresh pasta!" ... 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:45:14
yes i was also thinking about this. i lived for some months in asia together with native asians, they have a lot of different unwritten social rule that doesnt make sense in our culture. 
since i have 20x leverage on okcoin, i think its the best place for trading because i could lose my money on every exchange, but on okcoin it would only be 1:20 of the money i trade with

i think you dont understand how leveraged trading works.
my point is all about exchanges getting hacked or exit sams, if you are interested in how to trade on leverage i can recommend you this blog: 
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:25:39
if you realy need the bitcoins monday, you can try Kraken.com. the verification is easyer and it should be finished in less then 24 hours. 
when you transfer the money to the kraken fidor bank account (they use german bank) until monday, its likely that your sepa transfer arrives already on monday. then you can buy and use bitcoins immediatly
for the "tier3" verification on kraken you need :
Government issued ID
Verified proof of residence (e.g., utility bill no more than 3 months old)
Social Security number (US only)
ID confirmation photo (Germany only)*
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:03:25
iam not sure but i think they want to sent you money like 5 cent via SEPA bank transfer with this 8 digit code in reference. if thats right you need to wait until monday because sepa transfers doesnt work at weekends, except your bank is fidor.
for your information: registration, verification at bitcoin.de takes some time, also buying bitcoins can take 1-2 days, because you can only finaly use the bitcoins you bought, when the money receives to ur trade partner, which can take 1-3 business days with sepa transfers. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:57:50
in western countrys people also lie and cheat, they just cover it different. for example they ask for additional verifycation in order of KYC in a deadline, because they realised there are a lot of old inactive accounts with money on it
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:47:12
i dont want to defend someone, just saying that if he is telling the truth and worked on there as cto for months, only leaking this information when beeing forced to like now, he is not a person someone can trust or say he is the "good guy" in this story.

the euro lostmore then 40 % compared to the dollar last year. currencys are being traded always. but everyone can always hedge against volatility all currencys including bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-05 04:05:22
what ? you sold bitoin to pilots ??
@_date: 2015-07-04 06:16:47
omg ofcause but not all people are interested in bitcoin. for shopping average stuff bitcoin is not useful yet
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:03:44
for example with futures.
if you have "savings" in btc you wanna protect against volatility, you can keep 95% of it in cold storage, the other 5 % you place a short bet on a futures market with 20x leverage on a bitcoin.
the fees on the okcoin futures market would only be 0,03% for all time. 
thats a common for other markets and works also in bitcoinworld.

to copy your id is allowed in these cases, because its for preventing money laundering.
all big bitcoin exchanges require such identification as far as i know. other ways to get bitcoins is always more expensiv for you. but if you dont care about price you can try mycelium wallet local trader (cash). mycelium.com
@_date: 2015-04-21 00:57:51
yes and thats what many greece people do already
