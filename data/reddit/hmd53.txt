I get notifications when prices drop or increase. Today it was not usual, not for me. Is this a sign? That "Winter" is coming?

I finished watching the documentary "Banking on Bitcoin" yesterday,
and this dude came up claiming he was Satoshi Nakamoto. 
LMAO he goes like "I am Satoshi Nakamoto, and I will never come again on news or TV shows." And then he starts his blog, with a private key which was jack shit. Only BS on his blog. And then one fine day, he goes "Sorry about this"
He was fined by the Australian Tax Department or w.e. For not paying some of his taxes. Haha.

Why would they put all of their investment, and then they themselves hijack it to make it worthless? Eh?
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:29:38
They have to make their money somehow. They are not charity.
