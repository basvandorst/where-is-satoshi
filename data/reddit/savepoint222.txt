What's the difference from Bitcoin Cash if Bitcoin also increases the blocksize? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:11:03
Oh you sweet summer child. 
This is nothing.. you will be fine in 4 years.

Why won't exchanges adopt Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:32:45
If it's just the name, why do we hate Bitcoin Cash so much?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:34:00
I also believe that involves personal responsibility. It is each individual's responsibility to manage their money correctly and not go into debt. Or manage their debt correctly. There are saving vehicles available in the fiat market that does return interest.

Oh god. It hasn't killed anything and it isn't a threat to BTC. Get over it. Both coins are proving to be very profitable. I'm happy with both.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:41:59
It can be used as a currency to purchase and exchange goods, but they do need to fix the scaling problem. Hopefully, the lightning network will fix that. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:00:40
Yeah it was a fork, but now it is it's own chain, so yes it is it's own thing now. And I'm down with forks! It only benefits you if you were already in the chain. Why would you complain about that?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:33:51
He has the worst personality to invest in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:53:17
He was trying to describe programmable money.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:32:47
Naw. Then we should eliminate litecoin and every other crypto currency? The only difference is the forks copy the blockchain, other then that it's a separate ecosystem, I don't see it as a threat. I'd be happy to see both succeed. This rivalry between and is so childish. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:56:57
This is great advice! 
Money doesn't bring happiness.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:57:46
I don't get all the hate and rivalry for bcash. It's its own thing and everything contributes to the cryptocurrencie space. Can't we all just get along?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:05:01
Bch isn't a threat to BTC. Any attacks are just the community hating in each other.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:40:33
They are separate ecosystems. You can't   use bch to spend BTC and vice versa. It is no different then any other crypto. Should we shut down all other crytpos to prevent inflation? So what it forked of the same blockchain, what difference does it make?
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:59:12
It is free money. No reason not to keep it hedged in bch.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:14:34
Haha EXACTLY!
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:47:45
How come we aren't using the lightning network now?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:16:04
My understanding is they don't reward savers because savers don't simulate the economy.  They want people to invest and create business, not sit on money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:20:16
Yeah it's definitely a problem, and it needs to be fixed. But they are working on solutions, like the lightning Network, which hopefully will resolve it. Once it has been resolved it can resume to be a currency again. We'll see. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:35:02
How are they the same ecosystem? They spend on their own chain. There are still only going to be 21m BTC. I can't import bch into the BTC chain. Same as litecoin. I don't understand why your not against litecoin then. I'm holding both to see what chain wins. Maybe one and maybe both. Hopefully both as everyone wins. The rivalry on both sides is soo incredibly childish. It's pathetic.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:53:43
Exactly, just freakin HODL for xxxx% returns. Jesus how hard is it? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:06:31
This is exactly what I'm talking about. You all need to chill on the rhetoric, is totally pointless.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:50:56
I didn't get it?
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:23:03
Me too!
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:26:43
Just give it 1-3 years. Just be patient. I bought at 400$ and Bitcoin crashed to 200-300 for like two years. So I was in the red for a long time. But since I waited it obviously still paid off. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:58:49
Don't buy bitcoin. It's going to crash!!!
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:52:45
Hahahaha He should have listened to you. What a tard. I sat in the red for 2 years and didn't sell. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:41:50
So glad I held through the dip of 2014.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:41:12
That would be set for life. I don't got 7mil though. And eww to the suburban house. Suburban living sounds so depressing. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:57:29
apparently 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:05:34
I bought in in 2013 and i hodl through being in the red for 4 years.  I knew I just had to wait till the next halving.  It's worked out. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:43:35
And it was a bubble when it was 200, 600, 1000, 3000. When does the bubble stop bubbling?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:23:37
Here is my grain of salt advice. 
Looks at the trends. Bitcoin has ALWAYS trended up over long periods of time. One thing you should research is Bitcoin halving. The inflation rate of Bitcoin halves every 4 years. Less supply, means more demand, means increased price. It's pretty simple. 
The next halving is in 2020. I feel strongly if you hold till past 2020 you will see a profit.
 
That's what I've been hodling for and it's paying off for me. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:58:32
That was a good time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:47:45
According to this it's worth a few million? 
 
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:53:21
Congrats!
