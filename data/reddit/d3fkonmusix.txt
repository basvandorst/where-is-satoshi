I actually understand how bitcoin works. I also understand how markets work. I also understand how wall Street works.
You are telling me that just supply/demand and publicity helped drive the prices in 24hrs?
I really don't think so. At this cap, the amount of money needed to increase the value of btc, is enormous.

No wonder the technology behind bitcoin is wonderful. But if anything will be used as a mainstream crypto currency, it sure as hell wouldn't be bitcoin. At least for now. The lightning protocol does seem promising.

Check the news. The big players who have hated btc all their lives are in town.
That video i linked shows how these people have been manipulating the market by causing new peaks, publicising it, getting more people on board. Then betting on the future to being a dip. 
These people are the new whales we've been seeing in the last week.
(The market referred here is ofc the stock market)

So what's your take on this? What do you see happening. Just keeps going up and up. With minor 1000 to &lt;1000 set backs?

Hows this off topic

Futures :) It's here to mess things up. If a whale drops. Sure people will buy in looking at the dip, but it's more likely that all the new comers from the past week or so, will drop their holdings fearing no gains. Futures contracts for sure will point at a short of the value. That's when the free fall according to me starts
Probably a 10k according to me

Have you experienced anything this long and this deep in the rate chart?

Chill out. I don't have my life savings in there. I don't plan on pulling it out before i see anything happening to it. It just sucks that it's going down so fast and all the skeptics are having a field day with our feelings

Must be heart sinking. Because my heart is

I'll just hold in zebpay then? Also, what did you see happening in the near future?
