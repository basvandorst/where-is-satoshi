And Olivier Janssens, he gave 100k to start a bitcoin foundation alternative, 80k+ in lawyer fees to fight mtgox and keep public informed, a huge bitcoin donation to freedom.me and a huge bitcoin donation to protonmail.

He's also been running the  project and you can see his post about getting evidence at the bottom of his recovery blog 
"I would like to thank everyone for the great investigative work they did to bring this information forward.  We also had some very brave people report a lot more criminal behaviour that went on.  We are now pushing for a formal investigation of everything we received."
This was in reply to a blog post of a call for sending over evidence.  
He's also been funding this whole thing out of his own pocket.

Scumbags.. Olivier told the truth. Glad it is 100% confirmed now.

“To continue funding an engineering team within the Foundation we will need a significant infusion of cash or potentially be insolvent in ~8 weeks”. -&gt; This confirms they are as good as bankrupt.

He actually shared the information from a report which was submitted to the Japanese police. That means that either the guy reporting it, lied to the police about the death threats on paper, or that the death threats were real. When he later investigated deeper, it turned out there was a possible header issue. At least he had the sense to report on that too. So either way, I don't think sharing something like that is jumping the gun. It was not hearsay, it was proof submitted to the police. Why not focus more on what happend there instead of going after his ass instead?
The guy made one bad judgment in his life, and he voluntarily compensated the affected party just 24 hours later and took full responsibility. For me that's pretty telling.

Onionbit1, are you connected to the Foundation? You have just 1 post, and seem very biased.

- The Mark Karpeles thing was not false, but because another employee (potentially) faked death threat emails (which puts liability on that employee). Until today it's still not sure if it was the employee or Mark. He just reported what he received.
- DMCA thing was answered in several places, also here 
-&gt; Yes, you can blame him for making a mistake now and then, but when you are outspoken, it's a risk. What he said today is true and has been confirmed by Gavin in the foundation post and soon be proven by documents which he can't release without getting sued. The members have to request them.
