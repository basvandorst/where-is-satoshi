Is it possible to build other things on the Bitcoin Blockchain? Like smart contracts? If yes, will that increase the value of the bitcoin?

I remember when bitcoin went from like 900usd to 600 usd and posts like this came up all the time. And, then the bull market set in and posts like this disappeared. 
Now, the bear is here and these posts are back! Try to enjoy them and see the humor in them until they all disappears when the bull market is back.

I have heard about a lot of people doing that and it seems that there is no consequences to it. So, it sounds like a very smart decision young man!

I have a blockchain.info wallet where I store my bitcoins. Im the only one having the password to that wallet. Am I the only one controlling the keys then? (sorry for what seems to be a stupid question, but Im new to bitcoins and Im in it to win it in the long run!)
Can anyone link a tutorial of how you secure your bitcoins in best possible way?

If anyone can download the video (and there is multiple videos on his Facebook), please do (I don't now shit about computers). Im sure the liar will remove everything when he finds out about this thread. We need as much proof of who the criminals are when OneCoin scam implodes and they all will try to disappear.

According to OneCoin them self. I hope that is BS, but seeing how many here in Scandinavia that are invested in them (I know several people - they have nothing to do with each other and don't know each other) I sadly believe that the numbers could be true. 
I don't know how to look into Bulgarian bookkeeping, but they claim  they are only selling education packages and the coins are just a bonus (this is so they can claim later that they never sold crypto currency, only education materials). But, no one have debunked the money the company claimed they have earned (and there are a lot of debunkers out there), so we shall all be afraid that the numbers are correct.

Haha, you seem to be upset. I gess it is because you are invested in OneCoin? Your money is lost, sorry, but thats the truth.

OneCoin have 4 billion euros invested in the scam. Thats 40% of the market cap of bitcoin. Whats happening when people get scammed is that the whole crypto currency-industry gets a bad reputation.
We all loose because of OneCoin. They are riding of the success of bitcoin and when they bust - they will give bitcoin and crypto currencies very bad publicity as well. As you know, the media don't really understand the difference and will put everything into one basket.

No. But, their bookkeeping is official and no one have said anything about the numbers of their sales. So, if you can't bring up another number - your guess is even worth less than mine. Actually, what is your guess? 100 euros?

Thanks for a very good answer and solid information. Also, thank you for debunking scammers, they give crypto currency a very bad reputation. We need more people like you.
