Because I would be buying things I dont need. I can't buy groceries with bitcoin or pay my credit card bill with bitcoin or buy gas with bitcoin.
If I could, I'd just use it.

Coinbase over bitstamp or others? And how "safe" is the information I give them in the verification process?

Not leaving for good or entirely. I just have never sold any bitcoin for cash before and I wanted some advice.

No. I invested some a while ago, and I intend to pull my initial investment out.

I guess I'll have to look up what I'll owe. Would I just pay my usual taxes so long as this sale doesn't kick me into another bracket, or is it different because it's "capital gains"? 
And also, since technically I'm only taking out what I put in, would I pay any taxes on it, since I didn't make any profit?

I don't mind waiting a while as long as if I lock in at a price, I get it at that price.
The other worry I have is I'd prefer not to have to basically send everything about me in images of my official documents to an exchange to be allowed to sell btc.

"Safest or circle" ?

Well then I might have to pull out a bit more than I put in to make it come out even. Oh well.
At this point, I'm pulling it out so that I know for sure I will have my initial investment regardless of price fluctuations and the like.

Ah, understood. So on my initial investment being pulled out, I wouldn't bother reporting it, because it's not actually income, but on whatever is left, I would report come end of the next tax year?
