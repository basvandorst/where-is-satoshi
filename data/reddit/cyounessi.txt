I am aware. Given that that was many months ago, it's doubtful that Roger influenced Samson's exit. First of all, it's speculation (by me) that he was even forced out in the first place. It's *further* speculation that Roger had anything to do with it.
But regardless of those speculations, I'm not surprised because I believe Samson was due out in any case because of his generally polarizing behavior. Most companies don't tolerate that kind of stuff. It brings a bad image to the company, regardless of whether or not you agree with his platform or not.
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:52:05
How many times do I have to say I'm aware of the backstory? That doesn't convince me that Roger has anything to do with this. No one knows why Bobby fired Samson, or if Samson actually quit.Whatever the real reason, it doesn't make Samson any less of a toxic individual. Would you be MORE uspet to find out that Bobby fired Samson because of Roger? Because to me, it doesn't make a difference.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:22:52
Neither is the original chain. Frontier or Olympic versions of Ethereum are the original chain. Point being, the "true" chain is the one the community chooses, not the linearly first one. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:36:44
Oh I wasn't even thinking of Roger when I used the word "finally." I think a personality like Samson's in a "major" corporation wouldn't (and shouldn't) last more than one day in our culture. One could have expected Samson to be fired long before Roger ever made mention of it.
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:34:51

So you *do* think that he was forced out? Despite everyone saying the opposite?
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:57:23
No, that's not a "good" thing. That's a very "ends justify the means" mentality. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:21:56
Toxic doesn't mean "wrong," per se. However, he's classless and tactless, and did nothing but promote further division in the community (despite how "right" his platform was). How is taking a winning position and *furthering* the divide considered anything *but* toxic?

@_date: 2017-03-28 18:38:14
Great. Be excited. I'm not saying not to be. But you need to be objective about it (which is hard, I know). It's difficult to take the EVM and completely sidestep Ethereum to use some convoluted security system that has never been done before and expect everyone to just immediately jump on board. Their sidechain hasn't even been implemented yet, there are no developers working on dapps for bitcoin, there's a federated security model, there's a very questionable developer fee, all while Ethereum currently exists today and processing 90,000 tx/day. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:58:53
And that's a fair point. I was just speculating, and qualified my statement as such. Regardless of the real reason, there will always be the official reason and the "official" reason.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:31:47
Does that mean there will still be *some* trust, or will it be completely trustless? Will there always be a developers fee? I'm also confused on how tx fees will be 1/10th of Ethereum's in a fully trustless manner. Thank you for your response.

Well you just completely changed the goalposts/conversation. We weren't discussing whether or not dapps are useful or if any Alts are useful. I was simply pointing out that RSK is so radically different that it is not equal to Ethereum. It's merely yet another fork of the EVM with several extra drawbacks.

Theres a list of 5-10 use cases that we've both read about ad nauseum. There's no need to debate it here. Just wait for a freaking implementation before you declare victory. It's been 2 years. For all you know, maybe it takes 5 years, maybe it takes 50 years. Not ALL software is built in 2-3 years. There's *clearly* not enough evidence to make a judgement yet.

They send coins to exchanges because they *have* to in order to speculate and buy/sell bitcoins, not because they want to or they're OK with it. In fact, the main rule here is to never keep your coins on an exchange, ever ever ever.
With Ethereum, you'll *never* have to send your coins to a centralized party, *ever.* That is a massive difference, especially for a community that values decentralization very highly. Maybe you can't acknowledge the difference, but the average user surely can. In fact, several Bitcoin Core developers have spoken out against this very aspect. 
And the fee policy is just horrible no matter how you spin it. If/when the sidechain gains popularity, I wonder how long before that "fee" goes up. How long before the federation and RSK centrally plan the tx fee. There are just too many flaws with this project in my opinion from a consumer standpoint. 
Edit: and yes, it's easy to keep fees down when you have a centralized service.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:06:19
Why wait 5 years? Already exists in alt coins today.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:18:53
Please, he at least left my ETC intact. But I can't definitively say that the Federation will leave me with *anything at all.*
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:17:43
and I would just like to point out that Rootstock =/= Ethereum, as Rootstock *still* uses a federated peg and *still* have plans to skim some absurd development fee off the top of all transactions. It *also* requires a soft fork AFAIK. So, just saying, you have to take those into consideration as well. Ethereum centralized? Sure. But so is RSK. Also, *any* dapp developers will have to go through Ethereum to learn to even get a dapp onto RSK. I promise you, zero dapps right now are gonna jump ship for a larger userbase. Things are going extremely well and developer culture is very positive. Zero incentive for a developer to leave all that behind to market dapps to a consumer base that may not even want it.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:51:16
Who wants to send their coins to a centralized federated peg? And is the developer fee still in play? Some absurd fee charged from all transactions or did that get removed? Bitcoin users shouldn't and wouldn't ever stand for that.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:53:34
Winning it in what sense? Not to say that you've *lost*. But you clearly haven't *won* either. It's a work in progress. Development is underway.

Exactly. Many coins have had non-contentious hard forks that have maintained the same moniker. Segwit 2x was meant to be non-contentious (hence the NYA) but clearly they failed at that.  
So this is unchartered territory for sure. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:18:23
Jstolfi says pow change is a pipe dream due to the complexity involved. Is that true in your opinion? Also are you beginning to come around to forcing the soft fork? I recall you saying that was a horrible idea. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:30:31
Isn't this the difficulty in convincing an ambiguously large and diverse user community a main advantage of deploying SegWit as a soft fork instead of a hard fork? If the community can band together to change the Pow, why can't they band together for other protocol upgrade hard forks?

I have no contingency plans for my dollars becoming worthless tomorrow, just as I have no contingency plan for an asteroid hitting Earth.

Bug, fix, bug, fix, bug fix...etc
That's how software development functions. If an investor is unhappy with the quantity of bugs, they can divest. The entirety of those issues hardly constitutes "catastrophic failure." Price is half of what it used to be? How about, price is still half of what it used to be! Glass half full/half empty. 
I'm sure someone could also write 4-5 sentences of the darkest episodes of Bitcoin's past as well. But it's meaningless.
@_date: 2016-11-06 16:25:56
"In theory" is not a mitigating response. In theory, there are many coins that are vastly superior to Bitcoin. In reality, however, Bitcoin still reigns supreme, and Rootstock is still centralized
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:03:13
That's not a strawman? There are *plenty* of people who take Eth seriously. You may wish to argue on the quality/merit of those people, but that's not what we're arguing. All I'm saying is that Ethereum has high developer interest. That is fact.

That is literally exactly what I'm saying. Bitcoin has slow, methodical development, at the cost of effective protocol upgrades. I don't know what the rest of your post was about, that wasn't what we were discussing (eth vs btc). I thought we were discussing how the market views non-contentious protocol upgrades?

@_date: 2016-12-08 14:00:17
I agree with you. But the problem is when *users* get tired of the status quo, they think to themselves "miner's incentives (or developer's incentives) are broken and Bitcoin is stagnating" and then everyone jumps on them for going to a "scamcoin."
If the incentive system is broken, there will never be any development upgrades, and I think that's an issue.

I'm not saying it was a flaw in Ethereum. What I'm saying is that the majority of developers can look at the situation and say "Yeah, wow, that sucks. But I can understand how mistakes happen on the path towards building a new platform". It's akin to a developer building auto-pilot in a Tesla and watching it drive someone straight into a wall and kill them. Well, yeah that would suck, but that doesn't mean people are going to give up on autopilot because of a mistake. They're going to learn from it and move on.
I *can* appreciate the fact that you are unwilling to move on. That is your freedom of choice. But to claim that others are also unwilling to move on from TheDAO is factually incorrect. The majority of the developers have stuck around, even if the investors have not. And this argument began with whether or not the developers have stuck around.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:57:27
The funniest part is that their failed hard fork has sufficiently scared Bitcoiners away from hard forking forever....which means that *regardless* of what the price is doing, one coin will stagnate and one will evolve. Some will choose to be on the higher-priced, stagnated chain, and others will be on the lower-priced, evolving chain.
Which will you choose?

This is pure FUD. Developer interest in Ethereum is still very high, as evidenced by the amount of developers who spoke at their annual conference. 
In fact, no *serious* developer would look at a newbie mistake by an experimental platform and claim the project is dead/dying. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:17:50
Eth contentious hard fork =/= not all hard forks.
Some hard forks are merely protocol upgrades.
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:38:06
TheDAO rescue was "successful" (technically speaking). Of the two followup protocol upgrade forks, the second one led to a consensus failure (very non-successful fork).
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:46:43
That shouldn't even be a statement that has to be said. We live in a capitalistic society. It's taken for granted that people are interested in money and rewarded with it for great projects. The blockchain was designed with miners acting self-rationally.
So to say that developers are interested in Ethereum because of easy capital or financial windfall doesn't add any value to the conversation.
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:15:41
Stagnation doesn't mean *nothing* will change, ever. It just means that change happens slowly. In this case, it's been a very, very slow pace towards scalability, and at the very last second, some small mining pool has **JUST** enough hashpower to block the freakin proposal.
How is that not the definition of stagnation. And the coin that has hard forked every 2 weeks has paid the price, literally. It's "value" has tanked. Yet its protocol is stronger than it was before the hard forks.
So it appears to be hard forks are bad for a crypto's value. So the tradeoff is between swift, effective protocol upgrades, and market cap. Even OP himself thinks hard forks as a protocol upgrade (non-contentious) are bad for a crypto. That is the rhetoric that is being spread. Hard forks are bad and dangerous and cause a coin to lose value. The fact that the protocols have strengthened seem to be only of secondary importance.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:42:07
Yes but I don't care for a digital gold with volatility 10x as much. Bitcoin's portability and use as a peer-to-peer currency don't justify the increased volatilility, *for me, as an investor* (my personal opinion). Personally, I think Bitcoin should be a P2P currency, less so a store of value. Not that it can't be both, but I find the focus on digital gold and inflation hedge to be underwhelming.
@_date: 2016-11-15 06:55:55
Consensus =/= democracy. Changes aren't passed through with simple majority. That's the way it works. To change it now, after all these years, would be a horrible precedent.

I agree. I'm not for or against SegWit. My point is, the fact that the miners nor the users know for sure whether or not SegWit is economically rational makes this whole blockchain governance thing *very* dubious and frankly a little embarrassing (and I say this towards all coins).

So then, just to be clear, Bitcoin isn't broken, and if you think miners are being rational, as you should, then you have no issue with blocking SegWit *and* blocking any hard fork block increase?
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:59:16
Well when the big mining pools can just call each other up (ViaBTC, Bitmain, etc etc etc) and be like "Yo, should we vote SegWit in or out" I feel like there's a bit of a problem here!

You're also making assumptions and spouting them as fact when they are, in fact, opinions. The only real answer is "no one knows" when it comes to the future landscape of crypto. But the  bullshit detector is when someone claims to know who is going to win or what is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:44:52
Except with the bribe you're making a lot of assumptions about the distribution of Rep, the bribers, the bribees, method of bribery. With an exit scam you just need the main dude to walk away. And so how do people typically avoid exit scams? By keeping their funds off the site. Good luck trading back and forth in an active prediction market when you have to wait to send Btc to a website. Much easier/cleaner to use Augur. Btc users seem to be completely tone deaf when it comes to user experience. Fear of an exit scam is a legitimate concern. Game theoretic bribes are just theories for now. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:47:34

@_date: 2017-04-17 14:04:10
You're deflecting. The government doesn't require you to use Bitcoin. It requires you to use anything *other than what they regulate.* That's Bitcoin, Eth or Waves for all I care. That's up to the merchant and the users to agree on a common medium of exchange. What they choose to use in the future is mere speculation. If I had to guess, they will use something fast, cheap, easy to use, anonymous. But there's no requirement that they use Bitcoin (in the future). 
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:42:55
So who is to say that altcoins or ICOs won't attract non-speculative, government-backed, capital inflow like Bitcoin did? Can you predict the future? Can you predict government behavior?

And wouldn't Nitrogen being part of the multi-sig be enormously easier to bribe rather than some unknown whale oracle that you have to find a way to contact and communicate with? I understand the point you're trying to make, but I don't understand the equivalence of the two.
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:18:19
There's a minimum threshold of innovation/network effect that newcomers have to hit such that they are able to compete against the incumbents (Tesla vs Ford, Netflix vs Blockbuster), lest they just get absorbed by the incumbents (all the examples you listed).
If you don't have what it takes, then of course your best ideas will be absorbed by the powerful incumbents and its network effects. So with Bitcoin, you're literally betting that Eth/monero/etc aren't *quite* innovative enough that they can stand on its own two feet, and that eventually Bitcoin will absorb its qualities (Privacy through a Bitcoin sidechain, Rootstock for smart contracts).
Either diversify to be safe, or essentially be betting against future innovation/technological progress.

@_date: 2017-04-17 16:35:45


Yes I completely agree with all this. Bitcoin is the best at all that. *Today.* There are many people who do not believe that this will be the case in the *future*, and are positioning their speculative investments accordingly. That doesn't make it a bubble, scam, ponzi, etc. Is it so hard to comprehend why speculators are predicting a shift in *user* demand? It doesn't take a genius to see that, *in the future*, users might prefer Monero for privacy, Eth for cost/speed, etc. You might say Eth won't be faster/cheaper in the future, and you can position your investments accordingly (or write a blog). You might say Monero-level privacy isn't necessary. But these are all just opinions, and it makes me wonder why you tout them as facts. Maybe you're just a very declarative person, and your opinions just appear to come off as facts when you really mean them as opinions?
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:01:44

Right, "forcing" the soft fork would probably be a very divisive action in my opinion, but at the same time, this 95% thing is not only arbitrary, but also gives a minority dangerous veto power (let's not get into a "what is consensus" debate lol). So, how expensive is it to buy 5% of hash power? I'm not really up to speed or knowledgeable about mining economics. I sort of get the feeling that the folks over at BU aren't the  SegWit fans.

Most rational people would say "well this competition is healthy for the future of cryptos. TheDAO was an unfortunate event on the quest towards full decentralization. It will be interesting to see how security improves and what protocol upgrades are made to ensure further immutability." It's the difference between pessimism and skepticism. Pessimists say "this is a bad idea, it'll never work. I hope it fails." Skeptics say "there are a lot of challenges ahead, but if X, Y, and Z are achieved, this could be a very powerful platform. Let's see how competent the developers really are"

@_date: 2016-09-08 23:33:54
Eh, that's not true in the same sense that not all ethereum apps will be able to run on the ETC chain. Many of the ETH apps have interactions with the real world (such as Digix) that won't be immediately portable to other EVMs. In fact, most of the "killer" apps won't be able to be easily copy+pasted.
@_date: 2016-09-09 18:54:41
That's sort of like saying you don't own dollars, you owe IOUs from the government. Sure, I suppose that's true, but that's really the only way I can envision being able to use gold for ANYTHING under than burying it deep underground, and having the military guard it.
Bitcoin *started out* digitally, so it makes sense that its digital representation is true-to-form. And if you're a "filthy fiat" kind of person, then sure, gold tokens, or eDollar tokens might be useless to you, since there's still that element of trust.
But if you just remove yourself one step from that philosophy, digital tokens that represent real physical gold with your name on it is the best way to actually send gold around and have it be used for something of value.
@_date: 2016-09-09 13:06:55
It's trustless in the sense that you own the gold without physically owning it. Because your SPECIFIC gold is cryptographically tied to gold in their vault, you can be assured there's no fractional reserve or any funny business going on. You can redeem your DGX tokens for the actual gold any time you wish (there's a redeem feature and the vault will mail you your gold). There's legal structures set in place as well. Again, it's not 100% trustless and never claimed to be. However, you do own your gold, both cryptographically and legally. So then it uses the blockchain to be able to freely move around and exchange and trade and pay for things with those gold tokens, which represent real gold.

@_date: 2016-09-09 00:21:09
Yeah I mean think about it. DGX tokens represent gold physically held in a vault in Singapore cryptographically verified to be yours. You couldn't just buy DGX tokens on ETC and then just redeem the gold. That doesn't make any sense. Or ConsenSys is building a film and production studio where its token SNGLs represent a share in equity of the company. You can't just copy the contract code, deploy it on Rootstock and expect your SNGL tokens to be worth anything.
My point is, there is a lot of business aspects that go into these projects, and it won't be a simple copy + paste for these EVM ports. That's why I was asking if there are any developers on Rootstock right now building apps.
@_date: 2016-09-09 19:37:54
I think governments seizing gold from the vault of a country like Singapore is roughly on the same risk order of magnitude as the Chinese government shutting down all of the mining companies in China, which is what, like 85% of hash power? There will always be that "government gon fuck shit up" risk. Also, I think what you're arguing precludes any hard assets from ever making its way onto the blockchain (even Bitcoin sidechains) because there will always be that counterparty or government risk. If you only want purely digital assets (like Bitcoin) to ever be on the Blockchain, then sure, that's your right. But personally, I'm envisioning a much more interconnected society.
In any case, one step at a time we have to improve things, no? Ok maybe this isn't a perfect solution, but unambiguously better than E-gold. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:27:29
but if miners are refusing to build upon BU blocks, that makes BU a fork right? BU is a hard fork? Or would that only happen once segwit is attempting to be activated.

@_date: 2016-09-09 19:25:57
Right, and I can agree with that, but my point is, of the ways in which gold can become a medium of exchange, there's physical, and there's digital. If physical, well, you're gonna have to chop up a ton of gold and mint gold coins etc etc, but you'll have to spend in person. So if you're going to go the electronic route, then this is *as good* a solution as you can get. If you think it's still not good enough, then how can you justify gold ever having any value as an inflation hedge against the US dollar? The point of gold is, if the dollar does blow up with inflation, gold will actually be used for something. But if you're going to reject it's physical usage, *and* its electronic usage, then I guess you're saying that you don't think gold is worth anything at all?

Do you find projects that require trusted third parties merely unexciting or completely worthless. Personally I find value in such a scheme if it significantly improves on the current model.

Except you're not trusting Digix, which is just a group of guys, you're arguing the gold Vault of Singapore, which is (arguably) more secure/safer than any other gold vault (and certainly moreso than a group of devs). So yes, there is still some element of trust, but that's not really the point of my post up above. The point is, businesses providing services on a blockchain, won't be obligated to perform those same services on a forked chain. So you couldn't just copy/paste code into ETC and rootstock and expect everything to run smoothly. There's real *businesses* behind some of these smart contract apps.

Largest dev team and smartest hard core developers doesn't necessarily translate into Most of the innovation. I've been in Bitcoin since Nov 2015. Almost 2 years later, the only innovation I've seen developed and merged is SegWit. I've seen Z-cash develop zk-snarks. Monero has beefed up their privacy. Eth is on the cusp of amazing sounding technology (even if it doesn't work, no one in Bitcoin is working on similar stuff). Filecoin, Cosmos and Tezos are trying some pretty ambitious things as well.
Innovation is about risk taking. Who's taking risks in Bitcoin? Bitcoin seems way too conservative to be able to claim the title of "most innovative cryptocurrency."

So everything boils down to network effect for you? Nothing else matters? Color me unconvinced. That was the same argument I heard the entirety of 2016 in this sub. Bitcoin dominance was 80-90% then. Now it's sub 50%. 
"No one else will ever want those features."  You're willing to bet your whole stack on that philosophy?

Why does everyone so conveniently ignore opportunity cost? Just because I acquired them for pennies doesn't mean there aren't real world real asset tradeoffs that I'm making today.

I thought 95% of the most recent x number of blocks needed to have Segwit enabled for it to be activated. How can the pro-segwit miners block that?

Lol you just called andreas a beginner.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:41:31
Maybe in practice that's how PoS'ers think, but that doesn't change the fact that if you're staking your coins, you're giving up the right to sell your coins over the staking period. Let's assume the lockup period is 6 months. I am forgoing the ability to sell those coins if the price of ETH goes 10x during that 6 months (it could correct back down before I get my coins back). Somehow, somewhere, you have to acknowledge and account for those costs. To unilaterally dismiss that opportunity cost, I'm not sure it's worth continuing this discussion.

Bitcoin *was* antifragile. The censorship and near-religious zealotry has fragilized it significantly since the glory days. That doesn't mean it can't become antifragile again, but it won't do so on its current course. You can't subject Bitcoin to the type of animosity and censorship and short-sightedness of the past 2 years and expect it to magically get "stronger."
Edit: Yes, let's downvote when we stray from the hivemind. The central tenet of every antifragile community!

@_date: 2017-10-28 16:16:07
One aspect to this argument I've never understood. Regarding the final owners/bagholders, don't they derive some/any value from participating in the ecosystem. If the economy is sufficiently circular, being the final owner grants you permission to participate (despite losing the benefits of any future upside). Why do you discount this value?
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:59:32
All sources point to the exact opposite. Corporate interest in Ethereum is at an All Time High. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:49:19
Don't you have to spend money to acquire coins? In your example you just assumed a uniform distribution. I'd say that's quite an assumption. It's equivalent to saying "just assume everyone already has an ASIC. Then no one has to spend money to buy mining machines, so no one has to do jack shit."
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:59:49
Because of the technological failures of the underpinning protocol (and its community). If Simplicity were to actually prove superior, it would get much more mileage and utility on Ethereum, not to mention it would be merged in quite quickly. It's great that Bitcoin is pushing forward the space of smart contracts, but Ethereum is currently the dominant player in that sector.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:51:56
Yes, that is true, you've always claimed that Bitcoin already had smart contracts, but you have *also* been consistent in pointing out that smart contracts are almost entirely useless. So, if they're so useless, what's the point of all this? Or are you going to suddenly say that maybe some of them could have some use now?
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:18:01
Clearly I'm taking issue with the notion that it will be "worthless" after 2 days, not whether or not timing is important.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:58:23
For years it was "smart contracts are useless." Now all of a sudden "we have a *better* smart contract language." LOL make up your mind bitcoiners, but don't forget, ethereum/solidity produces 500,000 tx/day, and simplicity is still just vaporware.
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:36:38
No one cares about relatively. Only the market matters.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:19:42
Apparently Bitcoin Gold mattered enough to enough people that they preemptively dumped all their alts to acquire more Bitcoin (so that they get more Bitcoin Gold), and now they are switching back.

Actually, rootstock is the dictionary definition of vaporware. Hyped for years, yet nowhere in sight other than testnet.

@_date: 2017-10-30 22:05:35
Oh *all* of a sudden you like smart contracts? Or, it just needed to be presented to you in *just* the right manner? Solidity? Pfft! I'd never touch that trash in a thousand years. But *Simplicity*! Loving what I see here, folks!

1. Is this permissionless, or do we need Liquid's explicit permission to issue arbitrary assets on this platform?
2. Is this trustless, or do we need to trust Liquid or some other Trusted Third Party to not interfere?

Yes, forking is a Satoshi-given right to all users as a means of expressing their individual preferences. Unfortunately, while it's easy to create another network, it's not so trivial to create another network *effect.* That takes a lot of effort. Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:54:51
Your definition of trustless is off. You can do a fully trustless sync without having to sync the entire transaction history.

The real question is can sidechains work without SegWit?
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:03:19


Yes, if you have money to spend freely, then you're good to go. But I would argue that no fiat currency allows you to spend it freely. True freedom means no one can arbitrarily stop you from spending it, which is absolutely untrue with USD.
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:57:18
Actually, the "average" person isn't just those living in happy 1st world countries. The "average" person extends to all the world's peoples who live under autocratic rule or exploitative governments. If you want, you could even extend this to the "average" person over history as well. I assure you, there is immense utility for moving money when you're normally not able to.
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:45:29
The reality is Bitcoin doesn't scale too well on-chain, so alternative solutions are needed. Either be happy with layer 2 solutions or move to another alt. We don't live in a perfect world.

Can we not bash other coins? Can we just not do that anymore?

I don't think this applies as precisely. His argument is that early Bitcoiners get rich necessarily by future investors. Some fiat currencies, such as the Euro, weren't launched to benefit any early adopters. Everyone got a fair shake from the start, sort of.

That's not their graph. They're citing the graph that they believe to be incorrect. In any case I don't know who's right or wrong. I was just pointing out that it's not so clear cut right now.

I'd be very interested if you could expound on this. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-10-30 02:52:14
Are we not all guilty of moving goal posts? Haven't you declared for years that Ethereum would never get to where it's gotten so far? Haven't Bitcoiners made compromises on its core tenets over the years (mining centralization probably wasn't part of the plan, and neither was rampant censorship on its biggest community forums.) I'm not saying Ethereum is great or whatever. I'm saying "He who casts the first stone...."
We don't have to respect each other's projects, but I do believe some humility is required on all fronts. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:13:44
While I'm glad that you've never dealt with any problems, I can confidently say that many, many people have. 
I'm not pitching you on anything. The people who have it easiest definitely have the hardest time understanding the use case. But, again, there are billions of people who don't have the same rights that we both share. I too have experienced little trouble buying what I want. But I know dozens of people who aren't as fortunate.

Sorry, I wasn't agreeing with Jorge, merely articulating his argument. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:46:03
If you make a fork whose Proof-of-work is easy to compute, it wouldn't take long for it to become the "longest" chain. What you really want is a chain that has had the most amount of work computed.

How is this exclusive to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:56:08
Yep agreed. Feel free to pump your coin under the guise of fraud protection, and I will continue to call people out on it. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 12:53:35
Sure I can agree with that. There are indeed other scaling solutions. In the end they'll likely all get their fair shot and the users can decide. But no use in trying to cripple the competition. I don't think anyone truly knows what the right course of action is.

Yes there's some value in it of course. More value than using Eth, where everything is validated by miners? Not in my mind. What you're describing with a federated trust is the banking system. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 22:49:23
As an Ethereum supporter (and Bitcoin supporter, too), the reality is: no one knows. Anyone claiming that "Ethereum has everything figured out and it's just a matter of implementing it," is lying to you. On the other hand, people like saying "Ethereum is fundamentally flawed and will *never* work," without putting some qualifier such as "this is merely a guess," is *also* lying to you.
No one knows. Period. That's why Ethereum is called an experiment. That's why Bitcoin is an experiment. We are experimenting.

Except you're full of shit when you talk about helping people. You know how I know? Because you're posting in the wrong fucking forum. If you really gave a shit about anything other than pumping your own investment you'd have said this in r/Ethereum, not r/Bitcoin. Only reason you hate ICOs is because it's generating worthwhile buzz over in your competition.

How ironic. You're achieving the opposite of what you preach. I don't need you to tell me what to do with my money or where to invest it. Your "education" is just pure bullshit and a  failed pseudo attempt at regulating what other people do under the pretense of empathy, but really just to pump your own coin. Fuck off.

That's funny. I would say spending Bitcoin on dark markets for drugs is much more dangerous, but I never see you judging them or arguing against it.

Where is LN actively working on Litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:15:32
I've never seen you nor anyone else warn about drugs on this. Super super rare to see someone discourage others from using Bitcoin on dark markets. It's always "more power to you!" As long as it keeps pumping their investment people are generally ok with ANY use case.  I never see PSAs about the dangers of drugs or gambling. But ICOs? My god, it's like the zombie apocalypse had arrived and you're out warning people to run for their lives. A bit hypocritical in my view. 
I am 100% positive that if ICOs were easy to manage on Bitcoin, we would see thousands of them and people would be gaga over it. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 12:47:03
Let the market doesn't which fork should win. Sacrificing the long term viability of Bitcoin by inhibiting natural market forces just to keep your investment good and proper is terribly shortsighted. Plus the ETC thing lasted about a month, is basically dead now.
