Gotcha mate.

If you wanna live like a pauper and not a king that's your choice.
But it's completely unnecessary 500k is a fraction of 25m you'll be absolutely fine. 5% on 20m is still insane that's a mansion and a lamborghini.
And still enough to maintain them with no worries. 
There's also the option of buying used Lamborghinis there's plenty with less than 10,000 miles on them.
You're underestimating how much money it really is you don't need hundreds of millions to live a life of divine luxury. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:08:47
A private jet can cost 50 million (I've been jet shopping) 
Lamborghinis are definitely possible 25m is lamborghini money.  It's all about wisely investing that money.
5% growth on 25m is a lot of money every year 100k a month you can afford a mansion and a ferrari you can't afford to live like you're Jeff bezos and fly your private jet around the world but you can charter all your domestic flights for the rest of your life.

Can I book Mark this and get back to you in a few months? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:40:53
As someone who's dealt with senators before you're gonna need it. They're so stupid about some things it's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:41:05
25k a month is enough for a few models
And leaves you 75k a month for expenses like your cars.
You're underestimating how much 25m is. 
It's an absurd amount of money 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:58:45
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:17:09
Read what I said again.
25m is enough to very easily own a lamborghini and not worry about maintenance costs or insurance costs at all. And still be able to own a wonderful home. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:28:23
Oh this was about systems already in place that they had no idea what they did or how they worked or anything.
They're very poorly informed in my experience. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:41:53
Looking at my transactions from last year is actually physically painful.
Seeing 100-200 dollar transactions now be 5-6 grand is ridiculously saddening.
Oh well though no use crying over spilt milk.

How does one apply to be a charitable cause? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:28:46
Not when you're rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:45:32
Hmm you have a point time to buy 10,000 of each. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:25:52
Huge upfront costs and then insane upkeep and fuel costs plus having to hire a full time pilot.
Chartering a jet is actually very reasonable in comparison to first class airline tickets.
Honestly if I didn't fly so much it's the only way if ever fly. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:55:17
You have no idea how many times I've been stared at blankly whilst trying to explain that.
People seem a little more responsive now that they can see BTC is over $1,000 USD they seem to be accepting it has a value even if they don't understand it. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:07:08
To be fair in 2010 I was 13.
I really would have but I didn't have anyway of purchasing it. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:52:39
And his name wasn't I remember desperately trying to get my mom to let me mine bitcoin (didn't have my own computer)  and her telling it was a waste of time.  Lasted about a week then I forgot all about it until it shot up to $1200 she sure felt dumb then. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:40:55
Bitcoin is still too complex for 90% of end users..  
Please try to remember most end user's are morons 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:22:49
Actually wow yeah that give everyone convicted on cyber based evidence a shot at an appeal. 
There's no telling how many people could be potentially released because of that. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:30:44
Shit I know some private companies with similar setups. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:56:44
Don't feel bad you're not the only dependant with an account.  I got my account as a dependant.

Guess who's no longer buying a tesla
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:53:52
This used to confuse me so much. Before I learned people used decimals like we use commas. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:02:43
Really?  I didn't even see a 7-11 in Honolulu.  I just got food from those other convenience stores that I've forgotten the name of.  
@_date: 2017-01-29 07:56:23
Sounds like someone needed to buy something that cost about €1500 
@_date: 2016-12-09 03:16:29
Me too but for charity. 
Not like cancer or anything I just know a stripper named charity and I need donations. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 05:23:39
Paying twice the insurance for a property you're exclusively renting out wouldn't be so bad it'd be offset by the income generated by said property. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:51:42
Are they out of their fucking minds? 
They will never be like PayPal. They're subpar to Venmo and square cash.  What they had going for them was bitcoin. 
Sigh in 5 months people will hardly remember them it'll be oh what was that app I used to use to buy bit coin?  Oh circle that's right hmm wonder what they're doing oh yeah bankrupt. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:47:09
Welp time to delete my circle account. 
The only reason I ever had one was to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:50:20
Pretty much, as I'm sure they very quickly find out. 
They just don't compare to companies like venmo or PayPal and they never will. 
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:14:59
The rest of all life on earth isn't going to be my dinner so yes less important.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:20:28
This is just further evidence no one would have held till 8k
Unless you'd simply forgotten about it until now there's no way anyone held this long. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:08:02
Unless it's not in there which is my conundrum I'm only kinda sure it might be in there. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:11:38
Nope although I bet we feel equally as sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:12:32
Some people with thousands have held and sold a big chunk off at various price points. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:22:21
Somewhere I have about 20 btc that I'll never see again.
That's a kick in the pants. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:07:35
The problem is I don't know where I put the computer.
It might be in a box somewhere in the hell hole my family calls a storage unit (it's two large shipping containers in the middle of no where filled to the brim with crap)
But it also might not be and tbh I can't  be bothered to look maybe if bitcoin hits 10,000 I'll go dig em out but for now I'm fine just accepting that they're gone forever. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:44:02
Which is why Rick likes Morty more every Rick needs a Morty to balance em out.   
Also to shield them with their immense stupidity. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 15:56:03
I can't tell if they wanted to spell samurai and failed or if they intentionally misspelled samurai. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:58:13
Don't be a dick I'm not even talking to you.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:29:56
It generally is because what you're tying to hide is almost always illegal. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:11:41
Ahh you are correct in French that is the correct spelling. In Japanese it's 武士 which you would pronounce Bushi.  
So not even close to the American spelling of samurai. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:33:16
Alot of things you can do recreationally can still be good for your health. 
Like running. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:04:18
The episode with evil morty I think when they first introduced the council of Rick's. The other Rick has a list of the smartest Ricks, and c-137 Rick is 5th.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:45:12
He's not the smartest man In the multi verse he's only the 5th smartest Rick. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:20:02
I want it to drop to 200 again.
So I can buy more. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:22:30
Why would you?
Isn't the whole point of crypto currency so that people can't just take it from you?
I could have millions in bitcoin that no one would ever be able to touch because you can't ever prove I have it. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:52:47
Doesn't matter the police aren't equipped or trained to do anything about it.
They barely know what bitcoin is let alone do they have an intelligent cyber crimes division to pursue and prosecute anyone. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:21:29
Goodluck hacking something not connected to the Internet. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:04:04
It won't happen it'll never get that far they simply won't bother. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:05:35
You and me both. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:19:08
And they police will likely laugh at you.
Cyber theft isn't really a thing yet and is very rarely prosecuted or even investigated. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:36:02
With bitcoin you can literally do nothing.
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:06:11
Like the other guy said you're behind the times. You're basically just wasting time you're paying more for the electricity than you could ever make. 
It'd cost more in electricity in a day than you'd make in a year.

With either my credit card. Or PayPal it only takes 2-3 clicks to buy a game on steam. 
I'm not sure I understand the difficulties you're having. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:52:11
None of that shit is legit don't try and have people killed.

Dark market net?
