I wonder what this could mean as far as promoting the use of Counterparty (XCP)? They have been lying low but still developing the technology underneath Symbiont.

Bitcoin is by definition anti-fragile. And secondly, good solid code built for billions of transactions takes time to write and test. Scaling blockchains while keeping privacy and decentralization is not easy. But it's happening.

One indicator alone doesn't mean anything. It can however help support a trading analysis with multiple factors considered.

"Governments worry that everyone will be able to do what they have been doing for decades, but more easily." 
"Governments worry that crypto will help finance arms and drug deals and take market share away from them."
"Governments and big banks worry that the crypto market is a bubble which will burst and take capital away from their own bubbles."
And it goes on. We're witnessing the largest transfer of wealth, power, and decision-making in our history.

I don't think anyone really knows. In my view the perspective that people will dump crypto to get cash is as valid as the one hypothesizing that money would flow into crypto as people seek better returns and an alternative market. That being said, if the crash was bad enough to cause a global recession, think we would see almost every major market go down. We will find out if Bitcoin really is "gold 2.0"... It already is for countries battling hyper inflation.

It's not user-friendly yet but the foundation seems solid and it works. This is amazing to see! Implementing the UX/UI layers is the easy part. For those bitching about it "not really being here", you're missing the big picture. Bitcoin's scaling layer IS working!

No, it's because Bcash has been using highly unethical and shameful methods of attack against Bitcoin like lying, stealing accounts and spreading nonsense. Supporting that project is the same as saying that you endorse those tactics. Personally, if a business I know agrees with what bcash is doing, they won't get my money.

I've had many over the last four years. I'd say the two most painful ones were starting to mine years ago and giving up after a few hours because nothing happened. I had a good feel about this internet magic money but I didn't really think it would be worth much. If I had mined a block back then for 50btc I most likely would have kept going. 
The second would be trying to trade and losing tons and tons of profits I could have made just holding.

Is it possible to trace the exact cause or source of the fee increase? It really looks suspicious.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:26:47
I'm still trying to understand why a business that prints money legally would risk everything to print more money illegally. Sure, greed. But you have to be really stupid to want to do it. What I'm saying is that it's possible they're scamming but jeez would that be dumb.

That's amazing then. Anyone who resists the Trump administration is doing the right thing.

Fair point. Political: support for/against Bcash/Bitcoin for personal reasons/business goals. Technical: some projects might be lacking dev-support and/or might have higher priorities on the roadmap to focus on.

Fun fact: I'm in Malaysia and every single old, young and in-between person has been asking or discussing about Bitcoins and cryptos. There are condo buildings with entire floors with open windows (miners), a shortage of video cards (miners), people selling spaces in mining farms, selling S9s, buying cryptos, managing funds, ETC...
Cryptos are on everyone's minds all. Some people are still anti-cryptos but they're the minority.

It's more centralized on purpose. They've been very transparent on why they did it and how they manage their supply - it's programmatically handled at fixed rates. Not sure where you got the 80% of banks own it.
As far as real world value and use cases, ripple is one of the top crypto projects.

When did being a decent person that values equality for all become a "liberal" thing to do? We're all human beings floating on a rock in the middle of space and we all want the same thing: to be loved. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:11:49
LGBT adoption isn't a "liberal viewpoint". It's recognizing that people of different backgrounds and genders can actually love each other and that meddling in their private lives is wrong.

There's some truth in what he's saying but, much like everything else in life, the magic lies in between the weeds and the noise. Look there and you will see that the whole blockchain ecosystem is paving the way to a completely different society.

It's a pretty sad day for and supporters of Bcash when their PR person makes fun of one of the classiest ambassadors of crypto. Roger Ver just sank to a new low.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:09:53
It would be even wiser to not spread right-wing extremist policies like say: LGBT people shouldn't be stood up for because it could be "too political".
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:32:51
What a weird question. Supporting human rights for everyone is not political in any way. It's just the right thing to do.

It could end up being a case of the tail wagging the dog. The amount of money played in the futures will dwarf current volume and it will influence the exchange prices.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:10:21
Saw the headline "Civil war rages on" first and then Ver's face on TV. Didn't watch it.. It's sad to see the mainstream media do what they do best: spread nonsense and drama. It's equally as sad to see the crypto space being infiltrated by the same values of hyper greed and self-care serving individualism it was built to counter. Of course, people will be people and these kind of things happen everywhere. I'm just being an idealist. But I do hold the general "blockchain community" to the highest of standards for its sense of purpose and desire to change the world for the better.
Let's make sure we all rise above the waters and lead with integrity and focus on the mission: decentralize everything.

Yea but Chris Hedges is a hardass journalist who says it like it is. He isn't popular in mainstream media because he doesn't filter what he sees.. He has been predicting what is going on with Trump for *years* and warning us about it.

BTC has died over 200 times already. It can't be killed, only made stronger.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:21:03
In the same boat as OP except over the stretch of 3 years. HODL was the strat all the way down from $80. Saw the price go up to $1140 and started to count my Teslas. Then it crashed and I saw it go down to $400 where I sold to buy back in later. etc, etc... I think over the course of 6 trades I've made every time it was based on fear/greed and every single time it went against me right away. It's like when I bought it went down and when I sold it went up. It has been extremely frustrating but also a good lesson to just HODL. 
I could have around $200k worth of BTC right now if I just held but I'm sitting with cash in my account after another  idiot trade a few weeks ago. I hope it goes down soon, haha. FML

I'd love to see a review of this "study". As of now it's just FUD imo.
disclaimer: I hold BTC and bullish long-term but i've always been suspiscious of Tether, not because of them pumping but rather them NOT holding USD. This is the key question that matters most!
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:49:36
This thread should be at the top of - the study is far from being very convincing in their heavy-handed conclusion. The media ran with the headline and this has hurt cryptocurrencies in the public's eye which is something none of us want.

Well for one Bitcoin has a limited supply. The current monetary system, at least in the US, is based on a Ponzi scheme where more money is printed out of thin air to create more debt that could never ever be repaid. 
Bitcoin is also more transparent and verifiable. Additionally Bitcoin isn't run by a centralized privately owned authority like the Federal reserve. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:17:52

Bcash supporters are drawing thin on their arguments. BCH is as much of a threat to BTC as common sense is to attaching itself to Donald Trump's brain. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:25:16
Bitcoin has a supply limit of 21M coins. No more coins will ever be created after this.
