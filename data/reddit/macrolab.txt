If miners sell all bitcoins now, they will never return money for costly equipment and never upgrade it. I doubt they are going to loose battle so easily. But, in principle, we can find approximate answer. I think purses generating a lots of bicoins may be found.

Bitcoin is not inflation proof. 200000 BTC is generating every 2 months and this generation speed is constant till approximately summer of 2016 when generation speed will be halved. Miners need to pay for electricity bills, some of generated bitcoins need to be sold, especially now when generation difficulty is high and bills eat good part of miner's income. Espect that price will drop at the end of every month from now while difficulty is high and decreasing ;)

Brain wallet is good idea, but a procedure of private key generation must be unique and easily reproducible. E.g. you append generated private key to your initial pass phrase from the end and generate new key with modified pass phrase. Or replace one letter from the initial pass phrase with private key and generate new key etc. Repeat this several times. When you are ready, create paper wallet with offline computer. You will have a feeling that you have someting more then just a paper to store your BTC

Bitcoin undergos inflation now. 200k of them are generating every incomplete 2 months. The lower bitcoin price, the more bitcoins need to be sold to pay for electricity bills. I doubt miners are selling all generated bitcoins right away as they will never return cost of expensive hardware. As a result even more BTC coming to the market every time when price drops and stay for a while at this level. Next price increase will be at summer 2016 when miner's reward will be halved. Till this moment price may go up and down a bit, but will decrease in a long term.

That is true if all miners start to sell bitcoins right away. Im my opinion most of them are keeping most of generated bitcoins and sell them partially to pay for electricity bills only. In this situation bitcoin inflation will depend on bitcoin price and may be even higher then generation speed, when miners sell accumulated bitcoins (e.g. to pay credits).  The lower price, the more bitcoins need to be sold to pay for electricity and this may fix BTC price at lower level despite of any good news.

Miners may hold bitcoins partially, but another part need to be sold to pay for electricity. The less bitcoin price and the higher difficulty, the more bitcoins need to be sold. Price is going down due to growing inflation.

Make shopping cart plugins to help other merchants to accept bitcoins. I have Joomla 1.5 and Virtuemart 1.1.x website but cannot use bitpay payment processor because there is no plugin exist for my shop version.

This is not a fall, this is a huge fluctuation because some of Chinese people purchased one or two bitcoins in the past just to check what they can do with them and now throw them away to the market. :)

If you dont read carefully how paper wallets work you may gift your money to miners. :)

Webmoney ( is main and, probably, the first online payment processor in Russia has WMX purses where you can store bitcoins. I use this payment processor since 2009 and never had any problems or heard that this payment processor was hacked in the past. They have 0.8% transaction fee although, so when you want to withdraw or deposit your bitcoins from this system you will have to pay a fee. From the other hand you may sell your bitcoins to other participant of the system via built in marketplace ( for the price you want. This removes a step when you need to use second exchanger which may also apply a fee to withdraw your funds. Webmoney accepted in China by multiple shops. My girl had no problems to order and buy some staff at Chinese online shop and paid with webmoney 
Coinkite looks good, but I would not store my funds here, because I prefer old established company which is not just bitcoin related service.
