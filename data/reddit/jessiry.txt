"only" 4%? I think everyone should look at this post: 
As long as the fee is more than 0.5%, that's rape

Sorry for the delaying respond, LakeBTC had opened a sepa account recently, but they only recive SEK..  
No matter, sepa account is very convenient in Europe, I think you can set a **sepa** account, you send EUR to LakeBTC, they would recive SEK; LakeBTC send you SEK, you could recive EUR.
BTW, they are doing a fee rate adjustment, deposit free, withdrawal fee is 0.1% + $5, trading fee only 0.2% and 0.05%.

≈ 15,500 $

I know that completing USD to BTC to CNY only need one Exchange - [LakeBTC](
1. Deposit USD to LakeBTC via bank wire
2. Buy BTC with USD
3. Sell BTC for CNY
4. Withdraw CNY to your account via bank wire

Well, this is one method, but the cost is significantly higher in multiple sectors transfer, maybe you could refer to this method: 
deposit USD to Lakebtc -&gt; buy Bitcoin with USD -&gt; sell Bitcoin with SEK -&gt; withdraw SEK to your SEPA account (EUR).
That is only **0.6% + $5** fee ( 0 + 0.2% + 0.2% + 0.2% plus $5 ), and Bank charges will only twice. Compared to your method, this way will be cheaper and faster which doesn't need to deposit -&gt; withdrawals -&gt;  deposit -&gt; withdrawals... repeatedly.
