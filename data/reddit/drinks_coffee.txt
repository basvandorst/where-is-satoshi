You can't just lump all of Europe together like that. There's huge differences between countries and even within countries.

A botle of sriracha contains 12600 mg of sodium. That's the equivalent of about 33 grams of table salt. That's a dangerous amount of sodium to consume at once. People have died from doing stupid shit like that.

They do move the coins (at least some) to exchanges. Where do you think they get the fiat to pay the vendors?

There's no problem if you immediately sweep it and wait for a confirmation or two.
The comment I was responding to said "...give them a paper wallet they can instantly verify so you don't have to stand around waiting for confirmations".

Yes, that's my point. You should never accept a paper wallet unless you sweep it immediately.

Except as a buyer that's a terrible idea. You have no way of knowing if the seller has kept a copy of the private key. The only right way is to transfer the btc to an adress that you and only you controll.

Has any one considered that the increased amount of transactions might have something to do with the recent drawing on ?
There was a drawing a few days ago and the winner was announced on November 22. It looks like this transaction spike started at the exact same time. 
They couldn't reach the winner for a few days which resulted in a lot of hype and excitement about what his reaction would be when he found out. A thread related to this was posted to and managed to make it to the top of which probably generated a lot of interest in bitcoin and brought in a whole bunch of beginners that wanted to test out this crypto-thing.

It should if she wants her money. Appealing doesn't really take a lot of effort. She basically only has to send in a written note stating that she wants to appeal the dessition.


Appealing in the administrative courts is free in Sweden, regardless if you win or lose.

She can still appeal. "Förvaltningsrätten" is the lowest administrative court.

That's why you keep a buffer of saved up money. Is it really that common to be living paycheck to paycheck in america?
