CME futures contracts expire today, so whales trying to drive down price before 4pm UTC.

Seems to be linked to mainstream news these days. If it's all fear stories then we'll slide again. If quiet, then might continue to creep up.

Still pretty new to this. Totally sold on the philosophy and technology, but governments/banksters are making me super nervous. We're under attack right? I mean, propaganda, talk of regulation etc... Safe to keep calm and carry on?

From what I gather it's a classic bulls vs bears prizefight. I for one thought we'd be in worse shape by now. I'm encouraged.

Nano supposed to be better, but there's a long wait. I got my TREZOR in a few days and it's fine.

Er... inflation?

Bitcoin isn't everyone's cup of tea for sure. And I think you're right that folks should have a balanced portfolio of investments, not just Bitcoin/crypto. I wouldn't rule out hyperinflation though. The US and some other countries are bankrupt, printing money etc... Writing is on the wall. Just have a plan I guess.

Strap in folks, it's going to be a very rough ride next 24hrs. Buy the dip!

Out of interest, how do you guys typically lock in your gains? Do you 'cash out' or maybe move it into USDT? I'm talking mostly about altcoins rather than Bitcoin. I'm just holding the latter.

4pm UCT

My concern is the leaking market cap. Also, biggest threat is from government/banksters regulations. There's a propaganda war going on, and I don't know if crypto can survive it.

Well, this is interesting. Felt we were heading for $9k for sure. Can it hold up?

Inflation means your dollar will buy you less in time. You've had pretty low inflation in US lately but trust me, if/when inflation goes above a few % every year you will notice the difference.

I think it's 4pm UTC
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:54:30
That is truly special.

Mondays and Fridays usually quiet. I'm just pleased it's stabilised a bit at least.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:30:01
No question. That's the real story.

Hi guys. Newish to all this and wondered how useful these indicators are, and what they mean. Anyone ever refer to them much? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:42:53
It's just consolidation, and plenty of resistance at this level. I'm expecting a decent rebound middle of next week. No doubt BTC will make me look stupid again though.
