To be honest, the mods are doing a much better job than they were a few months ago when I unsubscribed in disgust. But still a ways to go. If they ban memes and "the market is going to crash/explode" posts this sub can be credible.

The resilience of bitcoin is based on a peer to peer network. There is no central server to hack or steal. And there are millions of backups of the blockchain on every peer, all accessible in real time. If a government issued a cryptocurrency they would have to either convince the public to support it the way they support bitcoin or maintain a blockchain on a central server that would be the target of unending attacks.

It's a security precaution and fairly sensible. Computer hardware is a preferred commodity for scammers and thieves. Many online retailers switched to a "ship to purchaser only" policy by verifying shipping addresses with credit card providers. When you ship to an address that isn't yours the retailer may ask you to contact the credit card provider to add the address. If you haven't noticed this before it may be that your credit card provider knows way more about you than you think they do. Obviously there is no equivalent for bitcoin. There is no method in place to verify that the shipping address belongs to the same person that placed the order.

Corporations are typically valued on the basis of their income, not assets. When you buy stock in a company you are buying the right to a share of their distributed income. You have no claim on their assets.

The smallest/poorest country that has an exchangable currency that isn't tied to a larger country's currency is Comoros, an island nation off the coast of Madagascar.
As of 2002 Comoros had 12.5 billion Comorian francs in circulation which, at todays exchange rate, equals about $35 million in US dollars.
Finding a perfect match for bitcoin might be time consuming. You need to find a report from the country's treasury or maybe the IMF or World Bank on the amount of that country's currency that is in circulation and multiply it by the exchange rate on OandA or similar converter. But yes, bitcoin is bigger than a lot of countries.

If you want to report it use schedule D. Treat it like a stock or bond, capital gain or loss.

Wrong. You have a gain on whatever portion you sell for the difference between what you paid for it and what you sold it at. But, if you bought and/or sold at different prices, you can elect to sell in order of the date you bought, either ascending or descending. But once you make that election (first in first out or last in first out) that's the way you have to continue reporting gains and losses.

They are already perceived as common criminals. Doesn't seem to have any effect.

If bitcoin were a currency it would be illegal in the US.
