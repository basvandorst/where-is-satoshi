I think OP meant he has $1000 in BTC. Not 1000 BTC

One of the main things you should consider is that you're not investing, you're speculating. A retirement plan is an investment.. the BTC market is speculation, akin to gambling (you are speculating that bitcoin prices will go 'to the moon', and are hoping to gain massive profits from it).
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:52:19
To be honest, not really..
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:39:51
It's impossible to say, a true bitcoin optimist would say that bitcoins could be worth 10,000, 50,000, a million or more 20 or so years from now. 
The pessimist would say the entire market will crash, because of a bug in the system making the bitcoin worthless
I personally think everyone should have atleast 1, cause you'll never know :)

Pack up your bags boys. Looks like bitcoin is mainstream now.

Do we really need to be upvoting advertisements, just because they accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:46:01
Not saying it does. Just saying that you are a biased source.

Honestly this is not a very good argument. 
Basically his premise is that it is unwise to spend Bitcoin because the price is constantly going up, and by spending  you are potentially losing a ton of value.
Lets create a scenario. Say you're buying a Pizza for .05 BTC roughly 17 USD right now. In the future 0.05 BTC might be worth 170 USD. So obviously the smarter move would be to save the bitcoin and reap the future rewards? No!! One way or another you are going to be eating that Pizza, so instead you'd end up using your fiat currency to pay for the Pizza (Money that could have been reinvested into BTC after you bought your Pizza). If you'd simply reinvest in BTC after buying the Pizza you'd be in the same position with the added bonus of helping the Bitcoin economy.

In general I would say that you are an ignorant prick. Who cares if people have investments of 1 bitcoin or less.. The only thing I hate about this subreddit is the people bitching about 'noob' investors, it's unfortunate we can't all beas intellectual and enterprising as you

Can you make profits through arbitrage, give that there is no transfer fee between exchanges, and often times exchange prices can differ by more than 10 usd?

Honestly, we should settle down on all this Subway content from this store. First we got the video, next this picture, and an interview coming up... If I was working at this store I'd start to get annoyed if a ton of people started coming into the store and began to record me for accepting bitcoin and making me hold up signs. But maybe that's just me..

Actually it would be the exact opposite, All customers would start to move their money out of fiat and into bitcoin = bad news for banks = why banks will never support bitcoin

Yes I've heard that gox is taking like months for withdrawl, but they will surely come eventually. I doubt they would just close shop one day and scam tens of thousands of people out of millions of dollars.

Only people making profit from mining are those selling the equipment. Difficulty rates are rising and ROI are nearly impossible because of it.
If you have free electricity, can get a miner quick (easier said than done), and are fine with waiting a couple of years to see small ROI. Than by all means mining is for you :).

This chart is not as confusing as it seems think of it like:
If BTC reaches **X** penetration of demand (1%, 5%, 10%, 20%)  in **Y** years (1, 5, 10, 20) its price will be **Z** (price listed on the chart).
And for reference Penetration of demand simply means the degree to which bitcoin has been accepted by the marketplace.
Also only the bottom is in millions, which is very bad formatting..

Having someone control 50+ of a market is never a good thing.
The short term effect would obviously benefit us as this hypothetical investor would be buying btc at an inflated price. But when they eventually reach that ownership percentage, they can control the market and dictate prices.
But what about long term? For example, perhaps they sit on their coins for a couple of years, decreasing the currency in circulation and increasing demand significantly. And then decide to cash out and crash the market perhaps because of external influences (see: government).
