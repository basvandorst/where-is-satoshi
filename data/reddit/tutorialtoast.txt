Have you tried sending your bitcoin to a different wallet that you could withdraw from their? I have a friend that has the same issue with their CB account and I had them send me funds and withdrew funds that way.

Save your 500 dollars friend and visit 
Been using it for about a week and I'm not disappointed. It's a cloud based not that uses your api to control your trades. Just don't buy bladerunner. To rent any of the bots you have to pay a small btc subscription of .0006btc. Then you can either rent free or premium bots for an addition subscription. Please use due diligence and research before renting any of these bots. They can lose or make money for you if you are not sure of what strategy you're using.
