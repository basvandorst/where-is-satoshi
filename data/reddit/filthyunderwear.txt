Or Keepkey.  Any of theses offline hard wallets are great.

The Germans interviewed have the right idea.  Less government control over their finances.  Sounds perfect for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:18:13
August 24, 2015 - Bitcoin 218.45.  Now 603.50 - Coinbase.  Seems like almost 200% for 1 calendar year.  There are tons of shitcoins that can move over 1000% in one day.  BTW old ether is 10.65 now - Coinbase - that's down from 14.18 from July 22, 2016.  Sounds like it's getting slaughtered.  Good luck with old and new ether and maybe ether jr.  and ether III and so on.  Glad big brother  has your back.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:28:19
Not Coinbase.  Your bank or issuer of your debt card should.  They're the ones responsible.
@_date: 2016-08-27 00:45:09
Wow.  That graph is pretty crazy.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:33:51

This is different.  Apple allowed someone to use their system illegally.  They may hold some responsibility. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 00:41:56
Big fan of keepkey.  Easy to use.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:28:56
Keep key or trezor.  Both are good.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:52:52
Yes negligence for Apple potentially.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:30:07
Ummm Bitcoin is up over 200% ytd.  What about new ether?  Old ether is too old.
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:09:42
Second paragraph says they're 'using blockchain' 'the technology that underpins Bitcoin'.   Sounds like their intent is to use just that, Bitcoin blockchain.

Completely different scenario.  Apple is providing a service allowing you to use its tech to create and sell a product.  You getting robbed in a store which has nothing to do with anything it's selling or hosting has zero to do with the services of the store.  Apple makes money off apps it lists.  The store doesn't make money from a thief in their store.

Try and have you lender track the wire.  There should be a Fed ref   See where it was sent.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:51:53
If they host an app on their site and make money from the creator listing it, then they is some responsibility by Apple unless they were a victim of fraud too. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:30:07
This is a stupid post.  How is this worse than Mt Gox? It's not as if the Bitcoin protocol was hacked.  The exchange was hacked.  Security wasn't good enough.  When a bank gets robbed, which happens daily,  it's not the currency being taken that's the problem, it's the banks security.  Calm down and get a lollipop. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:42:59

Agreed wholeheartedly 
@_date: 2016-08-01 01:06:12
Completely agree with Vinny.  Ether is a mess.  What if they hard fork again ?  Now they have 3,4,18 currencies?!

One thing I do like is that the government is recognizing Bitcoin's ability to radically alter the economy and how one does business.  They're scared.
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:58:07
Bitcoin is a direct threat to the nation-state's ability to control the purse.  How are they going to tax the transactions when they cannot identify who sold/bought what?  It will undermine a governments ability to function properly with a huge reduction in collected taxes.  The article seems more concerned about non-state actors ability to avoid fund confiscation.  The actual ramifications of Bitcoin, however, are much greater.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:21:02
Appreciate the response.  I believe some of the issues I mentioned would be concerns of the gen. public.  If ppl can be reassured that if the bank is 'robbed', they're 'money' deposits are safe/insured etc.

lol usury?  They charged too much interest to governments?  So now you're an advocate for 19th century France, England, and Germany getting ripped of by the Rothschild so they could fund their wars against each other?  Seriously,  the whole Rothschilds thing is an antisemetic conspiracy theory.  The simple fact is that the Banking system is corrupt b/c its more interested in outlandish profit than people.  That's why Bitcoin is so revolutionary.  I highly doubt the Rothschilds or Rockefellers give a shit about it.   However, the central bankers will soon.

I don't understand this.  Do you mean a hard vs soft fork?  Segwit sounds like it's slowly being implemented.  Granted I'm a noob but I never heard of a Bitcoin split.  Doesn't it go against satoshi's intent to double the size of the available pool of Bitcoin?

The whole Rothschild conspiracy is really just an antisemetic canard.  They stood to lose more when nations fought.  They weren't arms dealers.  They invested in government bonds, assets among other things.   It's equivalent to saying the Rockefellers, who are arguably equally as wealthy,  profited from encouraging WWII.  It's BS.  What bitcoin is doing though is taking that financial power away from a banking family or families or conglomerates and giving it back to individuals.  That's what's important.  The Rothschilds have primarily diversified away from banking and are involved in wealth management.

Not decentralization. Bubonic Plague and other 'fun' diseases and viruses which are treatable now but not then.  You're speaking in platitudes not facts of the war death and destruction which occurred during the Middle Ages through the 18th century.  Political thinking and philosophy certainly evolved.  Also, Monarchy's were the prevalent rulers then. Doesn't sound very decentralized.

Um proof?  if they created banks and helped fund countries 'adventures' in some manner, how is that their fault how money they loan out is used?  So yes, they provide a monetary service.  Show me where they counterfeited fiat?  Oh an manipulation of currency happens everyday on the Forex exchange.  Some legal, some illegal.  Your point?  You want to blame the fall of the world economy on a 19th century banking family?  Go ahead.  Why not blame the Medicis then? The ones to truly blame today are the central banks - the Fed, EU, Japan, the Saudis.  These are the ones that are the enemy of Bitcoin.

There is a massive difference between the US and China.  There is still a semblance of civil and individual rights in the US and there was never any type of individual rights in China.  US electoral system, while imperfect,  allows for participation by the gen populace.  China does not.  Russia elections are truly rigged with one candidate which ppl 'consistently' vote for with wide allegations of voter fraud.  If you think China and Russia have better fairer systems than the West, you should move there.

If you're hodling long term, then anytime is a good time to buy.

Don't think this is crashing too fast.  Much capital flight from China going into Bitcoin due to devaluation of Yuan and capital controls.

Any way to unpaywall this without paying the wall?

Agree but it can blow back the other way quickly

Buy it

Updating the firmware has been an issue.

Great article.  Let's keep getting this type of exposure.
@_date: 2016-07-08 00:55:48
Yeah they spelled Hodl wrong 
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:30:50
I agree Bitcoin is fine but you're still a douche for saying Zionist owned media
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:24:48
So what are you going to buy? More Bitcoin, silver, gold? All the above?
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:48:21
Coinbase.  I buy a few every month. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:12:52
This is good, but the word regulation always scares me. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:50:44
You never sell them
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:54:52
Trezor is very secure.  I use keepkey too and it's as secure.  Really like both products.

Im a big believer in Elliott Wave analysis.  I believe Bitcoin will dominate many asset classes for growth over the next 20 years.  It's growth is really driven by market sentiment which I believe is growing exponentially in its understanding and belief in Bitcoin.  It is a store of wealth which is privately held and monitored.  One does not have to worry about inflation devaluing the currency.  These are very attractive attributes.  It is also very easy to transact with and carry as opposed to fiat and PMs if held in a private wallet.  I agree with the comparisons to the growth of the Internet.  The market cap of the Internet dwarfs any asset class in the world.  It didn't exist 25 years ago for all intents and purposes.  I would use EW to attempt forecast of its growth but Bitcoin is still in its infancy so I believe like the Internet it will grow exponentially once it hits critical mass.  At that juncture  more traditional growth forecasting might be applicable.  I hodl more than 10 Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin creation rate will be halved.  That's a fundamental change
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:11:06
So does that make him a Zionist or just Jewish or something else? I hate this racist bullshit.  Jews don't control the media blacks are human beings and Muslim aren't all terrorists .  That's one of the points of bitcoin. Everyone is equal.  No dollars pounds euros yen yuan just Bitcoin.  Grow up from the BS racist bullshit.  Enough hate in the world.

What rational person/business would keep money in a bank that's charges them for doing so?  It's as if banks keep doing what they want and humanity needs to just take it.

Anyone know if this bill has legs?

It will make crypto currency great again

I really don't want to buy anything with Bitcoin.  I'm Hodling for eternity or until 1 btc = 10,000,000 usd then maybe I'll sell one. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:11:50
I hear you.  Got to be patient.

The problem is core and classic need to compromise and they are not.  I love bitcoin and hodler until the end but if this doesn't straighten out, we're going to hard fork like Eth.  
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:20:28
Don't know what you have access to.  European exchanges are good.  There are many.

PMs too
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:15:19
Use an offline wallet like Trezor or Keepkey
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:36:52
Drink some beer and keep on Hodling 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:35:06
Because Bitcoin has the potential to undermine their taxing power and currency in general. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:48:57
Nice! Me too.  Just picked up a kilo of silver. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:13:04
Really ? It sounds like you do adhere to the mass media BS and racial stereotypes.  The biggest and most powerful lobby group in the US is the Chamber of Commerce.  They lobby for all major industry including the banks.  Nat Asso of Realtors is next then the AMA.  What Jewish lobby do you speak of ? APAC is the only one I know of and its not even in the top 25. There is no Zionist conspiracy to manipulate Bitcoin.  Eventually there maybe a governmental one in various nation states. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:54:39
If you were going to sell it, how would you do it?
