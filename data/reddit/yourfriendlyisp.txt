Bringing kids around and seeing their faces light is the highlight of the parents night, if some kid looks down and sees some piece of paper with "Go on the internet and get 15$!" the parent is going to immediately think, what kind of internet scam is this guy trying to pull? They then throw that away, and proceed to eat the candy bar. I'm just thinking realistically, the more you inflate your dollar amount on the paper, the more of a scam it is going to look like. People will still feel scammed because they won't know what to do with the BTC, even if they get it in their account.

As a technically inclined little kid, this would still be terribly disappointing to any kid that is coming to your door. The chance they they get that coin into an account at all is very slim considering the 3-15 year old that will be knocking on your door. Next even if they DO get it into an account, what the FUCK is some 12 year old going to do with 15 dollars in BTC? Go buy some crack off silk road? Change it into 15 dollars on MtGox? Invest in some gold stock? Some kid will have no use for this at that age. All the kid will remember later is, bitcoin? Oh yeah! Thats some shitty thing someone in my neighborhood handed out instead of candy! 
Go buy some king size candy bars and make it the highlight of their night instead of trying to push some agenda. I remember getting pissed off when parents would hand out toothbrushes.

Is it possible to "gift" someone money on paypal in exchange for bitcoins? "Gifting" being a non refundable transaction on paypal.

The government is going to liquidate all the coins they took so eventually they will make it into the market and the price will go down.
