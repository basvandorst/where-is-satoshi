I know a guy in south florida with a 501c nonprofit 
He is passionate about solving inner city gun related violence.
His operating budget is only like 4k a month and all his expenses are clearly laid on on his site.
I don't believe he has bitcoin address yet, but I hope you consider his work...please check out his videos!

Obviously this isn't scientific but there is a disproportionate number of lefties so far given we are only 10% of population. If this is true...I think this is incredible given the implications for the thinking abilities of left handed people. 
My hypothesis is that left handed people have a sense of forsight about where society is going before society as a whole knows.

Agreed, as I said this is no way scientific, I just wanted some evidence towards my intuition based off of what I've been reading

I had to trash coinbase because they close my account and refused to tell me why, just did my first transaction on gemini

Btc-e has the shadiest reputation but they have always done me solid on every transaction...they are one of the oldest exchanges and defn get an undeserved bad rap
