Maybe. Wouldn't that be very expensive though? Remembered that the last spam attack left lots of BTC-dust in thousands of wallets...

Crypto is general. We could see BTC bubble pop if people don’t find it as useful as they’d like to believe. Some alt coin could offer more utility, more security, and more equality.
That being said, 5 years is a long time, right? BTC could in theory retain their branding and overhaul their entire protocol from the ground up. It’s like changing the engine and leaving the chassis intact.
582 billion crypto market cap today. It’s the flippening from fiat to crypto guys. Enjoy the ride.

Great! Thank you for your explanation. Well that puts the bubble-pop-event even sooner! Scary thought!

BCH has the asic boost exploit, that allows certain players (i won’t say who, you can find out yourself), to gain an unfair advantage; hence centralisation of mining and power. They use the block size debate as a smoke screen for this fact.
Block size should be dynamic, so as to always adjust to 80% full; a good balance of low fees, sufficient payout for miners. You may refer to Willy Woo’s blog about the ideal block size.

Have you seen this graph? Uhoh.

True. However in 5 years time, things will be different.

Yes you’re right. Think the way I wrote this was unclear.
Basically when the bubble popped they had to get the economy back up, so lowering rates to 0, makes borrowing easier, and props things up. 
Rates at 0, helps people pay back their debt obligations, and this takes time, years of time. This part of the money cycle is called deleveraging.
When the economy has regained its footing, rates go back up, as we saw in 2016. This part of the cycle is called leveraging, and it also takes years of time. When rates get too high, and people can’t pay back their debt, bubble can pop.
We are now at 1%, which is comparatively much lower than the pre 2008 levels of 5%. Thusly, borrowing to finance your crypto purchase at 1% is still manageable for some folks. Maybe.
