What's that to do with the fees? Lol..so you put your orders higher to pay for your transfers? Wow man, that's desperate. Talk about future of financial system :)

Recently, you can run full nodes of 8-16mb blocks in subpar computers with subpar harddisks. With the hardware and tech going to be available, think about that in 2 years. 
Large blocks and centeralization tale is utter bullshit imo.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:03:56
I highly doubt that..build up some confidence and intellect instead..
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:34:37
Bitcoin's addresses are declining more in numbers if you look at the charts. Quarter a million more in fact.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:25:38
So? Redditor for 28 days :) What is the correlation between being a redditor for a specific amount of time and pointing out the obvious flaws in an argument?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:47:58
Stop being stupid also :) 
Being poor or being a student is irrevelent.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:00:05
This is an old video, probably more than a year. There were no tx fees than :) it's ironic how easy it was a year ago to use Bitcoin in shopping, yet now they made the coin unusable.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:49:36
Please stop being poor...
And your assumption is wrong. For that amount to be 100 dollars, Bitcoin needs to be more than 150.000.000$.
So please stop being poor, and irrational...
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:27:26
Fud? :) You guys posted a video from the good old days, and I informed you about reality...I don't see any fear or uncertainity in my answer. Quite the contrary, it's pretty certain.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:50:40
Yes he is definitely, check the name...
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:24:00
So adoption is not important for you...cause no matter what, you'll be hesitant to use your BTC in life. If everyone thinks like that, there won't be a moon to go.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:11:25
Says the Crypto legend...
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:14:15
If you don't see the internal factors behind the mempool problem and believe coinbase is the culprit here, go on, keep lying to yourselves.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:14:16
Been there during a meeting? What do you even mean? :)) You just need an average iq to figure it out, or at least make an educated guess.
How about you? Have you witnessed Roger with a Hitler moustache whipping the shit out of miners too, or you are the blatant liar yourself ;)
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:44:03
What a great idea..so if everybody saves and be frugal, who's gonna spend it and trigger the financial revolution we've been talking about the whole time?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:17:11
Blockchain ofc..who else did you think? They couldn't technically got the coin ready for Mass adoption...either in making Ln ready waay before as promised, or providing temporary/permanent blocksize solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:26:56
I hope you meant bear market, cause I can count at least 10 altcoins which doubled the gains over bitcoin in bull market
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:53:50
Well, Bitcoin.com is a mining pool. Miners choose what they want to mine, it's not a company like blockchain where you dictate every single decision and force others to follow blindly.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:08:44
Yeah keep calling names :) maybe that will help  yourself out of being so pathetic. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:58:09
Yes sure, but only if you saved the game before selling...
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:41:41
Wow...shocked to see a simple company can get the almighty Bitcoin on its knees. Since you claim all the mempool disaster is their fault.
Pathetic claim really.
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:51:18
Maybe Mr legend is the salty one, because his precious coin lost quite a bit of market dominance.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:04:29
What's amazing actually?
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:34:27
You call that low?!? Indeed lower than the insane fees everybody got used to...but low? C'mon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:28
How do you buy your groceries with these fees? Or tell me when was the last time you did this? Good old low fee days huh?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:02:24
Well actually your answer to the question lies in itself. You use a 3rd party. Credit card company or the bank. Wasn't Bitcoin intented to do this? How can you revolutionize the global payment system if you re still in need of a 3rd party?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:15:11
Bch is forked because, some people unlike you, saw the incoming problems around the corner. Your so called devs insisted that it's not going to be a problem.
Well guess what, it will be a big problem. Stop flaming outside sources, and look a little deeper inside.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:37:27
And what evidence might those be? 
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:45:08
Bitcoin was never intended to be a store of value.
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:18:42
And they all say bitcoin is a store of value??? Are you even serious? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:23:19
If you are fool enough that you can't even see the flaws in your argument, yeah, you may choose to call names to end conversation like insecure, felon, bcash etc... :)) You're so used to that after all. If those name callings are not because of feeling insecure and threatened, I wonder what is.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:56:45
How much was it to open a channel?
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:39:55
Man you don't even know what is a Satoshi for btc and bch is, and you've been posting this shit everywhere thinking you made a discovery.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:23:05
So you lowered your low from 4k to 3k first and now 2k? :) That's quite a way in 3 hours time..
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:49:18
How cute :)...but rather than your arguments, you are the one who looks like a dick. Any word for that too in your country?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:30:27
Quite an adjustment in a blink for a crypto guru like yourself ;)
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:38:38
Read the topic, which you have written, again...maybe you can what's wrong about it this time.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:47:58
Doesn't seem so fair actually. People who made the explosives an issue back then have all the rights to do so now. But if those who didn't care at all are making a drama about it now, it's the definition of hypocrisy.
And you do remember a thread about that back than? :) funny cause as of 2018 there are at least 5 threads about it everyday. What a correlation, huh? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:38:55
How did you come up with 900 
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:40:06
So, i'm right...nobody cares for explosives. The reason it is brought to the table is because Roger changed sides. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:29:51
Nobody seemed to care about this "sells explosives on internet" thing before the fork. He was a public figure for BTC for many years, but that was fine. Right?
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:42:41
That's why I've been telling you not to think so much about forks and valuation.. :) your arguments are worst than a 12 year old's.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:24:01
Well, unfortunately it's not and that's why the fees you call same are not same at all :) if you can't even figure that out, you shouldn't be thinking about deeper stuff like forking and valuation.
Your remark about coin cap also shows your level of knowledge.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:23
That's exactly what being a whale is...
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:35:14
Yeah but you can't call it manipulation, can you?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:23:19
That's not something to thank for though
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:28:21
The meaning of manipulation in finance world is not the same with the definition in the dictionary..
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:42:22
:)) what you've been saying over and over is the same thing, and proves my point over and over again.
You don't care about explosives. 
You just want to attack Roger Ver ( as you said claiming he attacked btc) 
With a tool which was always there, even when he was pro-btc and you never cared before the fork :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:35:46
That's the worst explanation i've ever seen...my boss holds a lot of wealth, but he doesn't play stocks and crypto. Is he also considered a whale?:) 
If you have a lot, all your trading strategy is named manipulation by noobs.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:05:11
Yea you are right, even litecoin, eth, dash and monero seems to be a better product than btc right now. Sad but True.. 
If you look back at the title and pics, all three are inferior than the mentioned original. But bch is better as a product, that's what i've ben telling.. I dont care which one is popular or beloved :) that s completly another case.
And if btc was the product it is now, back in 2009, nobody would've backed it.. With high and unreliable fees, slow transactions and off chain solutions. Think about it! 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:07:12
Puahauahau haven't seen anything funnier lately..the guy talking about insecurity of the last worder, tries to squeeze the last word with the phrase "I already gave you the last word". Genious bro :) you are wasting your potential here in Reddit :)) go be a pro debater or something.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:05:44
in ten years, everyone Will be somehow involved with the crypto world. Bitcoin doesn't need to fail and fall apart specifically. If another medium or coin delivers what the society need, that Will be the main subject. Names and titles have nothing to do with it.
Personally, I would've prefered bitcoin to continue in the line it started, and deliver what is needed properly. But unfortunatelly it seems that point's been long passed. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:55:11
Apart from your theoretical could've, should've, would've shit, when you can Come with solid numbers to back that btc is cheaper and faster than bch, we May talk about it. But as you Said, as of now, bch is a more advanced product than btc. Hey dont be so salty, it's the numbers and specifications telling that, not me :) 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:16:39
I ll gladly take that bet.
In addition to that, If the blockstream doesn't take its fangs back from the btc, it disheartens me to say this but it might not even be in top5 by 2030.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:39:51
Lower fees, faster, 32mb Blocks.. Just Google the technical specifications of both. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:43:29
Well it's faster, cheaper in fees, 32mb blocks assure your transfer Will be in the next Block, smart contracts... I don't care if it's a change of a variable or more, bch is a more advanced product than btc in all these terms.
İ don't even mention philosophy :) since btc is a store of value now with 3rd party extensions such as segwit and LN instead of a low cost  p2p digital currency.
By the way, Drop me a message if btc Median fees or transfer times go lower than bch, maybe when ln goes live right. Say... İn another 18 months maybe? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:14:18
Actually this doesn't make sense, since bch is a more developed product than btc.
