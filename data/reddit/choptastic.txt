Conversely, I first got into bitcoin (a little over a month ago) because I picked up a client that insists on paying in Bitcoin.  I plan on extending the offer to my other clients now, and will be curious what kind of response I'll get.

If you have any 3rd party items in your cart, Bitcoin gets hidden  as an option during checkout. That could be leading to confusion.

You're missing the colon after "https". The link should be 
But here's the text:
Dear unit holders.
These are the results of the survey. 68% of all unit holders have cast their vote:
- Yes, PetaMine should switch over to P2Pool – 96%
- No, PetaMine should stay with ghash.io – 3%
- No, Petamine should switch to another pool like Eligius or BTCGuild – 1%
The result is clear that a big majority of unit holders prefer a switch to p2pool. As we were performing additional tests the past week, we have to inform you that unfortunately the Bitfury systems are not compatible with p2pool. We are currently working on a solution for this and we will switch to p2pool as soon as we are able to fix this problem.

Thanks! It was a ton of fun! And I hope at least one person thought "hey, this bitcoin thing seems neat, I'll play around with it."
