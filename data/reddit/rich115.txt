Can anyone help with a stuck transaction? I sent a small one (0.0005) over two weeks ago with a fee that was too small (0.0000082). When it didn't get confirmed I figured it would just timeout after two weeks, but it and 0.02341384 is still stuck in limbo. I sent it from a Ledger Nano (with Segwit), and now the entire 0.02341384 is missing from my Ledger. The Ledger itself doesn't show the sent transaction, but the total amount in it is missing the total amount in the transaction [here](

A bunch of people thought that the best way to scale Bitcoin was to increase the block size. Others felt it was better to use Segwit to allow more space for transactions and then use off chain scaling. Increasing the block size did not get support via consensus (which follows the method laid out by Satoshi), and so some people decided to fork to remove segwit and allow larger blocks, and the called it Bitcoin Cash. 
The biggest arguments centre around the ability to scale and centralisation. The arguments against Bitcoin Cash are that it will be harder to scale in the future, and nodes will have to be centralised. Those people that are for Bitcoin Cash argue the opposite, and say that Bitcoin transactions are too slow and costly (though I’d disagree personally with this later due to my own experiences).

Then Bitcoin is a good long term option. Segwit is a way that the blocks in the blockchain are composed to allow for more transactions per block. It also helps facilitate the Lighten Network that will allow fast and low cost transactions, which is due soon (hopefully 2018).

It’s all opinion at this point, because like others say, anything could happen. 
In my opinion, a lot of people will be using parts of a bitcoin (mbtc or satoshis) to buy products and services in years to come. So any amount is worth it. 
Do some research and if you agree, buy what you can afford to lose, and then put it away and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:03:07
Yeah, it’s not very well known/advertised. But it’s a feature of bitcoin. You can set your own transfer fee. If an exchange doesn’t allow that, then they’re hiding that feature from you.

But, you should look into the background of those supporting BCH. Start by searching for ASICboost, and what Segwit means to it. Then look into Craig Wright and his claim that’s he’s Satoshi.

Also listen to Ver in recent interviews, he spends a lot of time attacking Bitcoin. So again, hard to avoid getting sucked in to a slagging match.

Fees can actually be set very low. The only time I’ve seen high fees are when using an exchange that doesn’t let you set them. If you use a wallet or exchange that allows you to control the fee it’s can be set very low (you can even set it to 0). I transferred about $8k the other week for 50 cents.

I think both can have their place. But I also think people don’t understand bitcoin. It can be used as a medium of exchange.  It’s just that most people don’t realise you can set the transaction fee. If you use the right wallet or exchange, you can set the transaction fee as low as you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:46:13
Not specifically. I’ve not used GDAX. When I’ve used a couple of exchanges I’ve not been able to set a transfer fee. When I’ve used a wallet I’ve been able to set my own transfer fee, and set it low. The transfer has happened quickly. So I know it’s not a requirement for the entire system, just something that the exchange has set.

Essentially you’re talking about investment. There are many ways to do it; buying bitcoin is only one, and probably riskier than most. I’d suggest reading up on the fundamentals of investing before you jump in. Grab some highly recommended books (people like Warren Buffet know what they’re talking about), have a read, and then make a plan (without a plan you’re just a tourist). It sounds like you’re passionate and interested in the topic, so it shouldn’t take long to get a bit more knowledge and some grounding that will set you up for life. Good luck!

Brilliant story. Well done. In the short term it may have been better to keep the 1btc, but in the long term you’ve learn some amazing lessons that you’ll value the rest of your life, and earn you far more than 1btc. Besides, if you keep hodling and mining you’ll end up with far more. Also, props to your parents. It’s awesome they’ve helped support you!

Coin base should be fine for your first purchase. Then look into creating your own wallet, or purchasing a hardware wallet. There is no need to rush into sorting out the wallet, but it’s much better than having it in an exchange for too long (to understand why read about [Mt. Gox](

Running a full node doesn’t cost much. You can you a normal desktop (or laptop), which doesn’t require any special cpu (you’re not hashing). The only thing to keep in mind is the network cost, but I’m on an unlimited plan, so don’t pay any extra. The additional electricity is really not that much. 
The incentive is supporting the bitcoin community, and having a lot more control of your own wallet.

I wish I could edit my original post for context, but can’t. The post was mostly a response to a tweet by [Tiho Brkan]( and a resulting news article. I felt that they only showed a few years of the results of a bubble, and I felt that wasn’t showing the whole picture. 
It’s also worth keeping in mind that Apple was around well before Windows. So it certainly had nothing to do with people choosing it.

A small drop in Amazon? You might want to check the prices (Amazon’s value tanked too). Also, you’re comparing two companies that were run very differently.

It’s impossible to know. Normally, when Bitcoin Cash isn’t attacking the block chain, it’ll happen in a few hours. But because of everything that is happening today, it depends on what the transaction rate the ATM submitted.

They weren’t part of the tech bubble? That’s a bit odd when you can see by the graphs that they were. A better view is actually the NASDAQ, which took longer to recover, but still did. However, I’d like to think we’re comparing the best in market, not all cryptos. So I think a fairer view is comparing to two well executed companies. Yahoo was not well executed.

I asked the same question myself. It really comes down to how proactive you want to be with your wealth. If you don’t mind leaving it up to others, and taking a risk, then it makes sense. But if you’d rather be proactive and ensure that you take your wealth into your own hands, then you should own your own wallet. I’m sure if you ask the Uber wealthy, they’ll all tell you they don’t trust others with their money. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:28:16
Ignorant? Thanks for being constructive. As I’ve said elsewhere, I suggested two things. Firstly, that it’s hard to compare this “bubble” to others. Technically it’s not like anything we’ve seen before. You can’t easily compare bitcoin to companies. It’s closest likeness is something like tcp/ip. If I could have invested in that in the nineties I would have. But if I were to compare it to companies, the. I’d pick best in class, because bitcoin is well thought out. Pets and Zombo were not. Secondly, if you back something of quality for the long term, there’s a better chance you’ll do well. I didn’t invest in Pets or Zombo. Did you?
