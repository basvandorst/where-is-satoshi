Why are the rest of us hating tether so much? Because it has all the signs of a blatant scam. They have no more credibility than bitconnect. The fact that they are tolerated in this community, allowed to flourish on many exchanges is ridiculous.

Really? If I have an account with RBC wealth management should I not tell my advisor about my crypto?

If you sell for dollars, or exchange for another crypto then you owe tax on any profit you made. It doesn’t matter where your dollars are kept.

If you donate to charity anyway, you wouldnt owe capital gains if you donate in bitcoin form. In fact you’d get a tax deduction if you itemize deductions. You would have to find a group you want to support that accepts bitcoin though, or help some small local group set themselves up to accept them sell it.

“Should be safe”
You should add some disclaimers, like a) what you’re describing is a crime called “structuring payments” which carries jail time, and b) financial institutions are required to look out for and report transactions which appear to be structured to avoid reporting requirements.

Did WSJ provide a list?

The list would be helpful for non-Chinese speakers.

USDT is built on Omni platform, which uses bitcoin blockchain. This might be the normal way to move USDT.
