Ponzi is not scam if you know it's ponzi and know rules you know with what you gamble. In proper ponzi if you get out before it crashes you win. But payouts must be in order and losers are last ones.

It's not only those 6. In this screenshot they made 11 blocks from 15 and that's quite a lot. They're making the most blocks and if they purposely doesn't include some transactions it will delay their inclusion in blockchain until some other miner includes them.

Not really. Most of Europe [CEE 7/4, type F]( is used and even in other countries outside of Europe. There's exceptions like UK and few other countries which uses a bit different ones, but mostly this is the most widely used standard.

Nodes only define which are valid blocks and which transactions to relay, but which transactions are included in blockchain are defined by miners. Of course miners can't include invalid transactions, but they can not include transactions they don't like.

that's why this post, I'm also wondering what's happening. But for me that they're saying truth sounds more believable, than some scam trying to earn BTC as scams are usually much poorly made and go for more, not some few cents. Also the more these will show up the less people will give any tips. But if it's truly some new undetected virus, then we're in deep shit...

I think this should work
   dd if=/dev/sdc conv=sync,noerror bs=64K &gt; ssd.img
where /dev/sdc you've to change to disk which is SSD, this will clone all disk with all partitions to file ssd.img, just check if you've enough HDD space
then you'll need some bitcoin wallet recovery program which can search that file
PS. that command wont give any output, to see progress look at ssd.img filesize

Bitcoind had been running on that VPS for like a year without any problems, but that company got bought over by other one and they don't allow running it. But no worries I switched VPS provider.

Nope, they made it really clear that it's only their policy and nothing else.

oh please, stop this bullshit. each VPS have allocated bandwidth and RAM, you can use 100% of it. That's for what you're paying. And I was nowhere near limits. That VPS had 1.5GB RAM and 1TB monthly bandwidth.

I did canceled services with them, but this wasn't the only reason. Not even main reason :D

I think it should be fun, but do we add any transaction fees? Wait for confirmations? Or just send right away? Please clarify everything, compile a list of all address and send everyone PM that they're included, what are the rules and what they should do.

SSD is actually quite good for recovering. It works differently as typical HDDs - even if PC writes data to same location, SSD will write it to physically other place, because of [Wear leveling]( I'm not sure which tools can, but you need to clone whole SSD from 0th sector to last one and then there it's huge chance to find wallet.
@_date: 2013-08-18 18:19:52
All transactions are in blockchain so you can easily parse them ;) And all bitcoin addresses are public keys. you only can't get unused addresses.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:11:05
ok, I just tried 2 days ago. I mined exactly 13h and earned 0.01562402 BTC that's with all fees already paid/taken out. It's right in my address.

It's not and I said them so and then they replied that it's not issue but only their policy.

LOL, don't mine then, it's not worth. Or buy decent GPU... But soon anyway seems there wont be point of GPU...
@_date: 2013-07-15 09:53:22
yeah, WTF? does it means someone got my password?
I also got email that someone was trying login
I didn't had 2-factor, but seems Blockchain saved me, because seems it didn't allowed login? anyway now I enabled 2-FA and also logging.
this is really weird as it is/was my most secure password, it's only for this site and I haven't used it for few weeks and it's not written down anywhere, if someone got it then only way is that I had/have keylogger :S
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:00:56
also you shouldn't mount partitions. If they are mounted then umount
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:00:28
yes it's hard to tell how actually it did cost. But I'm quite sure I made profit lol :D because I mine on my gaming PC when I'm not playing and I think there's small difference between running without mining and with. I've 1 kW PSU and even in idle I bet it eats shitloads :D Also I don't mine at nights. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 12:00:06
but we don't need only idea, we also need it's realization, need people who would try to implement it. I really hope it's more than just talks as it would be awesome.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:47:45
My guess would be that attacker somehow managed to get your wallet password, it's unlikely that you didn't wrote it anywhere as I don't believe you could remember it :D So where did you kept it? Maybe in some file or some site? Of course smartest would be on paper, but that's pain typing it each time...
EDIT: BTW what bitcoin clients did you used? like bitcoin-qt, electrum, etc?
@_date: 2013-05-11 22:51:01
I don't really remember price, I bought it like 3-4 years ago and then it was top highend so quite expensive, I was building my gaming PC and total price was ~$3k from which most was those 2 GPU, and next expensive was MB and CPU
Currently it gives me ~600 MH/s and earning me like ~1.2mBTC per day (like 8h, I don't mine often) actually I mine very rarely, I've mined just few days in total. I can't really give any precise info, infact I even might be wrong, I really need to do some precise bookkeeping lol to tell exactly how many hours I mine and how many BTC I get. As currently I've no idea, in total I've mined just ~12mBTC, as like I said I'm doing it so rarely.
@_date: 2013-07-15 11:07:05
ok, seems we're safe, it's caused because someone tried to open wallet with alias (mine is same as Reddit/Bitcointalk) so probably someone tried all usernames from those DB. All information they got is whether such user alias exist in Blockchain, but they didn't received Identifier (that's why email) and they don't have password either. If they would be able to get your Identifier then they would be able to try bruteforce wallet password, but only weak passwords or based from dictionary.

In reality I've no idea. But theoretically ALL current encryption/hash algorithms would be useless. But it's not enough with just quantum computer, you also need implement algorithms to crack these. It's like you've big hammer, but you still have to correctly hit on nail. And programming quantum computers are totally different than current ones.

it's not CPU intensive, it uses more CPU only when doing first initial synchronization which was done long time ago. It wasn't using more than 3% CPU for last months. And my average load for over a year period was only 0.10. It's been running there for a while and I never had problems. It doesn't use much CPU.
EDIT: also when I said my VPS never had big load they confirmed that it's not because of it, but simply they don't allow it.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:19:04
I already have VPS. Actually even before this suspension I was considering changing provider as there was better deals. Anyway thanks for offer and that's nice, there aren't many VPS providers which accept BTC.

What exactly is panic? hundred cases, thousand? It doesn't matter where information is stored about it. There's no trusted source on internet. Actually it's much easier to create fake reddit accounts and create loads of such threads. For wiki, it's versioned, each user and IP is registered for any edit. Of course can create new users and use Tor. But for wiki need spend 1mBTC for each user and post as much detailed info as possible to convince users and even then there's chance that people wouldn't believe. And users can change other wiki pages too thus making their account more trustable, same like here karma.
And no I didn't said offline completely, I meant most BTC. On PC you need only BTC you are going to spend/trade in nearest future. And those other all are typical advices I think everyone have heard already. This post goal wasn't to give any advices really, just to make it aware that coins get stlen and should try to know how so could avoid making similar mistakes.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:13:04
It isn't. That host on which was that VPS is new Intel CPU with 8 cores. bitcoind uses same resources as running Bitcoin-Qt, have you seen it using much CPU? nope, because it's not. There's only one case when it uses quite a bit of CPU, when doing local blockchain verification if it wasn't shutdown cleanly last time. Also probably when run for first time.

@_date: 2013-12-23 01:58:52
No, it doesn't work that. It's not related to fragmentation. SSD disks don't have to be defragmented because read/write speed doesn't change there. But fragmentation could make it harder to find wallet as you might find one part of it, but rest could be elsewhere.
Wear leveling for SSD disks works that it will always write to area where it's least writes. So if you've 10 writes at X and 5 at Y, it will first write at Y. So most likely if that disk isn't used a lot, there probably are other places where it's more less written than at wallet location which probably was altered often. In fact there might be even multiple copies on disk.

No idea about this company which took over. Basically I had VPS running with bitcoind there for more than a year and only now when they got acquired by this other company they suddenly suspended my VPS. Without even mentioning that they're changing some policies.

@_date: 2013-12-11 22:19:43
Then they are scam :D When I'm renting VPS I'm looking at dedicated RAM, if it's not dedicated then they're cheating :P I wouldn't use services from such company. Also this still doesn't answer why bitcoind, as I also had there other services such as mysql, nginx, php, squid. And mysql+nginx used more resources than bitcoind :P
@_date: 2013-05-23 07:55:01

@_date: 2013-05-14 00:44:41
maybe yes, maybe no, there's no way to tell for 100% sure. And I don't really think it's BS, it's quite a lot of effort hoping to gain couple of BTC
