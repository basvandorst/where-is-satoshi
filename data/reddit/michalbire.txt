Also no ones leverages 100x. It’s literally gambling, your margin for error is tiny. Even 25x is highly risky.

Yeah I mean who does — everyone buys this asset in order to make profit later. Retail just pretends to care because they don’t understand how the mechanics work. You think the BTC descending triangle is gonna breakdown to sub 6k? I’m wondering if the institutions are really gonna succeed at pushing this to rock bottom prices :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:17:26
I agree with Michael, institutions are waiting for the market to get fully washed out before slowly investing.
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:37:52
Especially in crypto — institutional money controls this game. They want to squeeze every penny possible.

Yeah the market definitely needs to embrace it -- and it's all in the hands of technologists.
I noticed that bitcoin transfers can take up to 30 min though. Versus a visa payment takes seconds. I don't get how everyone argues it's faster?
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:24:10
I've seen the term contracts in a few places -- what's it referring to?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:35:33
Thanks for the back to back replies. Did your algorithm predict $4k at this point, 1 year ago :)
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:59:52
@_date: 2018-10-03 04:26:37
Well said — descending triangles have 64% to break down.

Thanks, doesn't seem to support Canadian players though. Would a VPN solve that?
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:44:00
Very cool re: segwit
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:20:12
It happens.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:57:35
Where should I move them in the meantime? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:20:50
I'm trying hard to figure out whether those are terms I should look up - or not.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:02:03
What if I enabled 2-way authentication on Bitstamp. What makes a mobile wallet different? I'm just trying to understand :) Also, what if my mobile phone gets lost, broken, I delete the app etc?
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:21:53
I read to buy more during crashes.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:51:22
The value will go up once they're all mined, and owned then eh.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:35:30
Understood, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:27:03
Can you link me to both please.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:57:29
Thanks for the warm welcome and kind reply. I'm innovating tech for PPC industry (advertising) and work with Data Scientists and engineers. My background is Econ, software eng/architecting.


Hence why I think many buy, and sit on it. But the value of the coin increases as trades occur so I've been assessing where the coins most move. Gambling seems up there, but for it to increase even more in value, the coins need to be more widely accepted across industries.
I'd be curious to evaluate whether accepting coins as a form of payment in my startup may be worth it. My startup will be in majority a computation / infrastructure game.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:03:44
Thanks for the reply.


I've read the term contracts in a few places, what does it mean?
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:23:18
It doesn't support XRP :(
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:29:22
What is Segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:09:44
Lol. Well said.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:34:09
Great reply, thanks for the warm welcome. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:31:32
So I've realized that a bunch of industries are best suited for bitcoins: anything illegal that doesn't want trace - and gambling.
I haven't found bitcoin be mainstream in the everyday world yet, and I believe that the more industries implement this currency, the more it'll rise in value.
It's a responsibility for the world to increase its value.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:24:42


Can you expand on that thought :) 
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:15:42
And if you had to guess, what are they using their coins for if not sitting on them?
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:17:54
Says someone who's been a Redditor for 6 days.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:19:58
Sounds like everyone recommends to hold.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:21:00
Whys that 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:21:28
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:43:57
Thanks. How does segwit benefit the cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:45:31
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:04:32
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:12:54
Thanks, now I get it :)
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:04:26
And you're second guess: where are their coins most spent online?
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:18:36
Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I do agree safety first, put in some research today and bought hardware.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:35:23
Moved price up or down?
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:41:41
Thanks. And what's a healthy amount to put in monthly based on growths seen? Has anyone been able to pump out some predictive algorithms using Data Science? I work with a few big brains, so I'm curious to see if any trends can be found in data.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:44:53
How can physically delivered push the price?
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:41:52
Totally know what you’re doing.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:31:27
It’s tagging 10k and dropping back down
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:39:21
Which previous high
@_date: 2019-04-11 11:39:20
Well don’t you feel useless now? ��
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:19:11
Hey everyone, just remember this:
1) You don't know how others will react, so you don't know if they'll drop in panic. All you can do is encourage and tell them to hold while showing past trends. The markets are a represention of people's excitement or fear. In this case today: fear, fear that they won't be able to exchange it after China suspends exchanges.
2) The success of cryptos depends on your ability to stay calm and reserved. The better plan you have for trading, the least likely you'll get affected emotionally by this. If you bought to hodl, then hodl. Don't drive yourself down every day. If you bought to trade, then you've done a sh*t job to buy on a bullish trend. Now you know. Next time take a class about trading, and don't repeat your mistake. Make a plan.
3) All that you've lost is time now. Nothing else. You just have to wait for the next opportunity to sell high, take profits and buy low. That's the name of the game.
4) We're the generation that's paving the way for the next.

Well said
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:57:42
And I’m guessing public/exchange support + miners willingness to mine will affect it.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:10:24
Thanks, and you need bitcoin in order to gain from the fork right. Not bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:48:37
How is the price of bitcoin gold determined? Market?
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:49:13
Go on..

Yeah totally. I find it magical that these cryptos can just get suddenly copied, as if money could just get printed.
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:05:51
If he had setup 2FA on Coinbase, wouldn’t of that had blocked the SIM hacker to not be able to get into Coinbase no matter what the password reset attempt was?
