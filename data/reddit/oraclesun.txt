They don’t let you, at least not in the US

Hey just a heads up, I would not recommend doing this. A friend I knew used a fake ID to get into clubs and they came down hard on her with identity fraud charges, etc. 
Just wait the 3 years, or if you're in the US you can get a Photo ID

I also used Breadwallet, made the mistake of picking '
Economy fees' right as the network was exploding. After 2 weeks, the tx got dropped, even though every time I opened the app it seemed to say "just now" - that was just a UI thing - the transaction still was timestamped with the original time. 
When the tx drops (you can check the blockchain, it will say 'tx expired), you might need to re-sync your wallet with the blockchain (settings --&gt; sync blockchain). After I did that, the money returned to breadwallet

Sorry but this is wrong. Your "USD wallet" is protected under FDIC, but only if you are a US customer. Digital holdings (BTC wallet, ETH wallet, etc.) are not insured through FDIC, but rather through Coinbase's private insurance.

The reward for solving a block is separate(1) from the reward you get from the transaction fees in that block. (2)
(1) is a special bitcoin transaction, the only one that has no inputs, but outputs 12.5 Btc to whoever solves the block. This is how bitcoin is “issued”, and how new money enters the economy. 
(2) comes from bitcoins that are already in the market. There will still be fees even if no new coins are being issued

I'd just like to add a few things:
- Make sure your node is accepting incoming connections (Options--&gt;Network-&gt;Accept incoming connections) 
- Make sure port 8333 is open on your router and computer firewall

Can anyone show me how to append text to the user agent like this? Do you have to compile Bitcoin core manually? I'm assuming no because it's showing Core 0.16.0 and not 0.16.99..

Nice! Just remember that it is strongly recommended to not re-use addresses. The address is a hash of your public key, which is only revealed to the network when you validate and send a transaction. 
Also, if you use the same address, it becomes trivial for someone to de-anonymize your wallet and those who have been transacting with you.
 To keep your public key private and anonymous, its best to avoid reusing addresses. Most wallet software does this automatically by creating a new 'change' address whenever you send some coins

When people hear that a quantum computer just  reverse engineered a private key from a public one, the value of bitcoin will plummet, making the entire operation worthless. 
Devs are working on post-quantum features to add to Bitcoin, such as quantum addresses and a more difficult, quantum-proof algo 
In the meantime, to be 100% safe, you can always use a different address whenever receiving btc, so your public key is never revealed

Hey, I'm thinking about using Digitalocean's spaces instead of having a full attached 225GB  volume as I do now. Is it still working fine for you? Would you recommend it? Thanks

What’s interesting about this is that these figures come nowhere close to the actual cost of maintaining the current monetary system 
In addition to the printing costs, the government needs to finance measures to track counterfeit money. Things like watermarks and the holographic Liberty Bell on the new $100 need to be updated every so often and that isn’t cheap either. 
After it’s printed, the money also needs to be moved to the various banks. This is a multi billion dollar a year industry. 
Bitcoin has these features built in as a function of the protocol (money creation, transfer, verification, etc.). It’s only requirement is electricity, a relatively infinite and renewable resource.

Right but is the time consistent across both graphs? I doubt it since Bitcoin has only been traded for the last 10 years.

The bitcoin node running underneath your lightning node definitely helps secure the network, so long as you make sure port 8333 is accessible and enable incoming connections. 
No one can route payments through an empty LN, so it would not do much in terms of affect the network. However, learning how to set it up and becoming involved in lightning is enough to help, as long as you intend to fund a channel with a few satoshis at some point. We need all the decentralization we can get

The are a few VPNs that don’t collect any logs. Some take bitcoin or even cash in the mail. The CLOUD act decimated any notion of Internet privacy - so in my view, VPNs are completely justified for everyone now, not just if you have ‘nothing to hide’

From what I understand, the Lightning network is designed to handle day to day minor transactions, with the prime example being buying a cup of coffee. Large transactions do not benefit much from LN, there is much greater incentive to use the blockchain for those. 
Think of how SIP and RTP packets “piggyback” on top of TCP packets when you’re making a video call or watching a video stream. As the RTP packet delivers your video, it’s no big deal if a frame or two is dropped or arrives out of order, because the underlying protocol, TCP, resolves these errors.  This makes RTP very lightweight and efficient, because it doesn’t need to worry about error correction or error detection. 
The same concept is applied to the Lightning network, as it can only be run as a 2nd layer on top of Bitcoin. The idea is that centralization on the LN will be mitigated since the underlying technology that powers it, the blockchain, is inherently decentralized.

A lot of the market is bot trading. These bots use different algorithms to try and study the moving average and to buy low and sell high. When someone makes a large enough purchase or sell, it triggers a good portion of the bots buy/sell threshold, causing them to trade, shifting the price to where other bots start to trade, and then finally the retail investor either panic sells or fomo buys.

Not only is the next halving in 2020, but it appears that it will fall somewhere within the month of July. 
The 2020 Summer Olympics will be held in Tokyo from Jul 24th - August 9th. Japan has long been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption, having termed the currency a 'legally accepted method of payment' 
It's possible that these two events coinciding will propel Bitcoin into the forefront of mainstream acceptance and use.
