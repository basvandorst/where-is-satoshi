Basically, the gubberment that so many people seem to love, steal your money through taxation, to keep their special friends in power and control at the cost of the whole of humanity.
Until their monopoly is broken, this will continue to be the way.
Some people are happy to live on their knees, others have had enough of it.
You can't beat the gubb with violence, that's also another monopoly it controls.  We can however restrict their power, and with Bitcoin this can be achieved, without violence.
When you see the gubbermint going after people who are rocking their nice little boat, it should wake you up as to where their real loyalties and passions lie.
For many a moon that has not been with the people, and we need to start the end of this utter bullshit.
