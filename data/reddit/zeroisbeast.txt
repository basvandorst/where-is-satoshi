Hahahahaha. Glasses jacket bitcoin.

My god. Do not rationalize his suicide! Whatever sick justification you can come up with means nothing when compared to a mans life.

I was able to and it confirmed pretty quick but only one transaction worked.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:29:34
Worth a shot...

Nice try Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:01:10
That made me laugh so hard.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:35:02
Mark dropped the last msg sgt. Foley tossed to him.

Well I mine and it pays my rent and college expenses. I mine litecoin because I was able to get a great deal on some asics. My bitcoin total power is about 4.5 th and lite coin is about 119 mh.
So I think mining is a good call. I took a bit of a risk but it paid off for me.

Saw the word coincidentally and all I saw really was the word COIN. I need to go to bed.

"What do you think of Mr.Karpeles?"
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:53:33
Ponzi scheme? 
Well if that's what you want to believe. I don't really care anymore. Many people have been burnt by investments and had money stolen before. This is not that different from a credit card company freezing your funds while the stock market crashes. Maybe you are the perfect business man and never make a bad call. If so congratulations, you did it. If not, I'm sure you still understand  high risk can have high rewards and also large losses. Just like with a bank you still have to protect your money. Here you do it yourself. It's only as secure as you make it. He could have become a super millionaire had he known or taken a bit more care. But that is a risk he took. The good thing about his situation is that he has his life still. Something that is a hell of a lot more important than his BTC. Hell, he may even try BTC again and have an epic comeback story. There's no chance if he's dead. Hopefully he realizes that. Better yet hopefully this guy is just wanting attention and has all his money in cold storage. Id much rather be wasting my time on this post than a situation where a human being was considering ending his life. If you really want to give up here's the Reddit version.
Tl:Dr - Don't end your life. You don't get a do over or any one ups. Someone will miss you. I promise.

Bitcoins being stolen don't worry, here's the link to a malicious website.
@_date: 2014-05-07 07:17:29
Still is fun. I've been playing around with it since June last year and love it! It's been my hobby throughout my freshmen year in college.

Most likely he's using these things called Karpeles tunnels! 
Edit: False alarm apparently it only has to do with the medical field.

It's to help my dad with the non profit he runs! That's my qr but it's basically a placeholder for his. He's excited about it so I wanted to help.

This is a draft! I just got in a few to see how the metallic finish would look! They are not crazy expensive and you can make them look pretty nice!

I really didn't mean to be condescending. My apologies.
