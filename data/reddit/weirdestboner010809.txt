Sure the btc-&gt;btc transaction is instant and untraceable but is it not a complex and lengthy process before and after the sale?? This raises some serious and potentially costly concerns for me hypothetically playing it out in my mind...
**Note: I'm currently living in australia with a credit car paypal and local bank account - These factors may add to the experiences and difficulties I personally have experienced in my short but very active involvement with BitCoin and the network / community I've interacted with to date**
So far my attempts to efficiently buy / sell small amounts of BTC have been convoluted and expensive but I'm really not financially capable of increasing my current balance of 22+ coins until the price crashes again... Can you elaborate on the tools / sites etc you utilised to handle the large amounts you discussed?
With the amounts you've discussed wouldn't a bank or authority (federal/taxation) raise questions about the origins / purpose of this technically untraceable anonymous activity showing on your account? 
And if you can somehow prove that its not the proceeds of a crime etc. would you not be liable to pay tax (depending on the country where the account is held)
More q's to follow...

Fairly new to all this, (1-2 months of intermittent curiosity / research) so apologies if its a stupid question but which site / tool are you using to do this?

My balance as it stands seems to be pocket change for you... I think much later in this experiment, (if it even makes it that far) I could consider the transactions you are talking about but I would definitely be interested in more details and your experience process during the property purchase.
ie. What type of property are we talking about... a house or are we talking less cumbersome assets like a storage space or cbd carspace 
Did you suggest bitcoin as the tender of choice or did the seller?
