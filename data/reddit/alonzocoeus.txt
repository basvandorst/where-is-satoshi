First the limit is 21 million. Second mining is the solving of a mathmaticaly hard problem to verify a block, a block is a group of transactions linked to the previous block for a block to be accepted the miners must find a number which when put into a function with the block it gives a value below the current difficulty* because this problem is hard miners pick random numbers and check if it makes the block valid if it does they broadcast the new valid block to the network, in return they get a reward, new bitcoins. Third the limit is enforced by the colective if a miner trys to gI've himself more bitcoins all the nodes notice that, the reward value is wrong and they drop the block and the miner has wasted time and money to try that so he lost money so he won't do that in the first place.

only if it is sent on the blockchain, if he used LN the heist would be lightning fast.

The trick is to think of it as an opportunity it is not every day the market flips so use that data to test your bots or buy the dip or just don't look

yep and me and my friends are betting that if you have your money in the right place we could make huge returns. also it gives us the ability to trade between chains instantly goodbye brokers, this would give us a unified decentralized instantaneous exchange.

Good for you, i am using this time to stress test my bots it is not every day the price falls flat on its face.

you have to commit a sum of money which you can then spend on LN. when you are done you can close your channel the coins go back onto the chain.

He sugested they would short bitcoin to earn profit
Problem with your short thing it is just a easy for 100 miners all to drop there hashpower and because there is correlation between hashpower and price the price would drop and you would make profit or they could drop there hash power wait for a recalc and turn there rigs back on giving them more BTC per hour.

i have read the code the white paper i just dont comment because i did not feel i had anything to add. don't just assume because i am a unknown individual i have nothing to add. i would also like to comment that your hostile tone is hardly fitting of someone who claims to have put that much work in to act overly hostile towards a question.
