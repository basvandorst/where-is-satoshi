Could you elaborate? I am only beginning to understand Bitcoin (evidently), and more information on the overriding of blockchain history would be helpful. 
If so, I will gladly update the description.

It's not for the hype.
I've always enjoyed journalling, but feared the destruction of my all-so-valuable journals. In imagining the most permanent way to store data, I came up with this. The blockchain is the ultimate journal.
Of course, there are other applications too, but this was my motivation.

Well, that's just politics. Bitcoin is first and foremost a currency, of course. But it opens doors to so many other possibilities as well. On numerous occasions, I've heard the Bitcoin protocol compared with early-stage Internet protocol, in the sense that each of these are platforms for new technologies. And while I don't entirely agree here, the point is that your accusation of abuse wouldn't be agreed with unanimously, even among highly involved members of the Bitcoin community.

My project won't entail mining - just running a node, examining in-wallet transactions, and sending transactions myself. Would this still be dangerous?

Hooray for decentralization
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:48:40
Yeah, that would be a great application. There are some other as well. First to mind is the publishing of whistle blower-type information, like that shared by Edward Snowden.
To censor it, access to the blockchain would have to be censored. And more importantly, spoofing of any kind could be detected by verifying blocks.

Hmmm, if anything, I was expecting cross-criticisms of technology and/or scope - maybe that Bitcoin considered Ethereum overgeneralized, or that Ethereum looked at Bitcoin as a soon-to-be archaic predecessor.
I'm surprised at what you say, mostly because of Vitalik Buterin's affiliation with the Thiel Fellowship and the high standing Thiel Fellows hold in my mind. Of course, I have no evidence behind my intuition.

Correct. Storing data in these notes would be no different than storing data in regular databases.
My tool encodes data withing the blockchain, thereby including it in Bitcoin's [essentially] immutable history. This data propagates across to thousands of nodes around the world.

Feel free to post an issue on GitHub or message me here if there are any issues or potential improvements.
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:27:25
Hmmm, I wasn't aware of block reorganizations. Do you have any links to where I may find further information?
Aside from general interest, I'm trying to figure out whether or not my implementation could be invalidated by this.
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:33:30
I admit to your first point. It is worth noting, though, that users of this tool pay transaction fees just like anyone else.
I'm looking into merged mining info right now. Again, this is something I'm not familiar with. You are far more knowledgable than I am in this area.

Thank you, Peter. My opinions on this matter are a subset of yours, to some degree, as they were derived from your talk here:  Small world.
Anyhow, I agree - there are only two options here. The Bitcoin community must either disincentivize protocol like mine, or embrace new applications that build atop blockchain technology. 
Bitcoin prides itself on decentralization and lack of reliance on trust. Accordingly, "abuse" of the system should be curbed automatically, in a similarly decentralized fashion. To trust on the basis of morality conflicts with the entire premise of Bitcoin.
On another note, I'm checking out blockpop now.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:25:55
Of course!
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:27:38
Oh, alright. I wasn't yet aware of transaction fees existing. Having only ever used CoinBase, I mistakingly assumed that my transaction fees were being directed to CoinBase itself.

You could join a mining pool, assuming that you have computing power at your fingertips.
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:00:38
Where can I read about this occurrence? I'd like to learn more.
@_date: 2015-04-08 08:51:24
The IRS considers Bitcoin an asset, essentially. Are other assets donated to campaigns? Like stocks, bonds, or, more weirdly, properties? Also, do campaigns accept foreign currencies as donations? Just trying to plant my feet here.
Don't get me wrong, I am glad he's accepting Bitcoin. However, this all seems like one enormous contradiction...
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:37:13
A good handful of these aren't entirely valid. Regardless, it's positive and mostly truthful publicity. Thus, I condone. Not that anyone needs my approval...
