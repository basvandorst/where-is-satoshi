lol. first, you only go to jail for willingly refusing to pay taxes (ergo, fraud). you don’t go to jail for the act of not paying taxes.
and getting shot for resisting arrest has jack shit to do with taxes. you get shot for resisting arrest for any reason you get arrested for, even if you are innocent.
additionally, using a law as a definition is irrational in this case since it’s also LAW that the government is allowed to collect these taxes.
you’re really saying this: by law it’s theft even if the law literally says it’s not...

Sure they do, for free and for love and rainbows and unicorns.
back here on earth, government funds science, education, healthcare, military, police, law, energy, infrastructure, economy and much more.
but please, keep making a bigger fool out of yourself.

that has to be the dumbest thing i’ve heard in a *long* time.
it’s a service fee. people who do not understand how a country works and how it finances itself should not be allowed to decide its fate. It’s the greatest weakness of democracy. People who think that because they have an equal voice, their opinion is equally valuable.

you have internet? conputers? food? housing? roads? electricity? laws to protect you and your family?
you are using the service whether you signed up or not. don’t want the service? go live on a deserted island. you want to live in a country? you follow the law and pay the taxes to live there and use the services.
you may not like the choice, but you *have* a choice. nothing is rammed down your throat. you’re just being incredibly selective and naive to push a point you think you understand, but you clearly do not.

i do, but unless this was supposed to have an /s attached to it, i don’t see what that has to do with anything.

of course looking at the other side is important, but calling it theft is idiotic. 
but no, the governmeny represents the people who voted for them and are given a mandate to express our wishes and enforce them. we don’t shoot, we fine you until it becomes clear you are not going to pay, at which point you are bankrupted or depending on intent, punished in a way we collectively agreed on.
nobody likes paying taxes, but calling it technically theft would mean you got nothing in return, which is simply not the case.

"Stolen" is like saying the police is "stealing" your money when you never called them. But hey, why let a system that clearly works a multitude times better be implemented if you can simply let the poor whither while the top few thrive and the rest have their mouths open, hoping for a golden nugget to be shat into their direction...
The fact that due to this attitude it's more expensive to be poor in some backwards countries (which includes the US under Trump), should be more than enough to understand the system is skewed in favor of the ones who don't need it.
