I had a nightmare last night that I was audited by the IRS.

That's because so many people have only been into bitcoin for &lt;1 year. If you have been holding for a few years, spending some bitcoin is not a big deal. I bought a 1080TI in bitcoin because I wanted to reap some of the rewards for holding.

Yea and that's all you have said. It's moronic, its idiotic, it's stupid lolol who would do that? 
And that's all you have said, you have nothing of substance to back up your opinion so far.
It's obvious OP doesn't need his paycheck to pay his bills and even if he did he could liquidate bitcoin to do so. But somehow it's still moronic. Just like I'm sure it was moronic of people to buy bitcoin 3 months ago, a year ago, three years ago. They're all morons wasting their money. Obviously not because you are here in for some reason.

I'm not adding layers to the thread. Everyone knows how life works and how to pay bills, buy gas and buy food. Not everyone knows how to use bitcoin or store them. The fact that you think you would store bitcoins on exchange shows just how little you know.
You can liquidate them instantly, whether through an online exchange or meeting someone locally. Last time I checked it can take a couple days for a regular paycheck to clear, and thats if your employer has the funds. 
You can't change the system if someone doesn't take the first steps. You are also looking at this from your own perspective and not considering how OPs situation may vary. Maybe he doesn't need his paycheck to pay his bills and living expenses?

No, because people aren't trying to build separate economies around gold or oil as a currency. OP believes bitcoin can be used as a currency so he is trying to support it as such.

No, there were actually about a dozen orders of people buying at $9000+ on GDAX last night right before they froze trading completely. Some real screwy stuff happened on GDAX and then they went back and erased the order books and cleared the charts.

Maybe he doesn't need his paychecks to pay bills? This is not much different from setting up an automatic buy of bitcoin on a regular basis. Except now he is supporting and pioneering the bitcoin economy.

Only an idiot would store their coins on coinbase. The fact that you think that's how this works just shows how little you know.

I'm thinking the employer is paying all the taxes and then converting the post-tax income to bitcoin before sending it to the employee.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:43:01
Maybe if you are thinking from your perspective it may be but OP may have enough cash savings that his salary isn't necessary. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:06:34
Yea it was showing nothing cause it was broke, couldn't keep up with the buying. It took about 30min after it peaked at 19.7k for it to actually start working again.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:02:51
Yea it pretty much is a regular investment and that's all but it is also different since it is an employer paying an employee in bitcoin and not just him buying bitcoin.

Buckle up tight for the ride and hodl on. If we see a good dip I will probably buy, as usual.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:30:49
I guess you have no applicable knowledge left to actually leave a real comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:40:47
You don't know that, he could have a large cash savings that he is able to use for all his bills already. Maybe this is just him acknowledging he doesn't need his salary in cash so he wants to get it in bitcoin to support the bitcoin economy.

Not if he does a 1031 transfer, but good luck finding a CPA that will do a 1031 with bitcoin. I'm sure you could find one but I'm also sure it would attract a lot of attention.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:46:03
If that's what you actually think then I hope you aren't invested in bitcoin at all. Why is this so irresponsible? You don't know anything about OPs situation, he may not need his paychecks to pay his bills so he is doing this to support the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:16:22
This would still be subject to capital gains tax as it stands now. No different than if you went on NewEgg or Overstock and bought stuff with BTC, that would be subject to capital gains also.

I didn't take screenshots but I counted 12 orders in the order book that were filled at $9000+, the largest one was 1.5BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:29:05
Maybe his salary isn't all of his money? Why do people not realize this? Maybe he has enough savings/investments that he doesnt even need his salary to pay his bills or maybe OP lives with his parents and has barely any bills. There are so many ways this could make it a lot less risky than people are making it out to be.

Mt Gox didnt lose coins, they were stolen. Just go pull the address you sent from and see where your coins went.

Same thing happened to me today, my GDAX balance never updated but I decided to try selling it and it ended up working and my balance updated.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:33:28
Nah, the exchanges are just unprepared for this volume and it's really showing.

We should sponsor a Nascar driver to legitimize ourselves.
