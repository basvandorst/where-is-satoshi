Best site for Canadians to buy BTC/ETH to transfer into ripple? I'm on coinbase but I'm trying to move away from them... Quadriga is also giving me troubles with funding
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:30:44
It's been over 4 days for me...Maybe it's because I'm from Canada that it's taking longer :/

Hey its me your nephew
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:28:26
Have you used it before? Are there any problems that I should know about?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:21:39
How long does it usually take for Binance to verify people?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:48:51
I'm currently on binance right now, I'm worried about buying ETH on coinbase (both because of the fuss lately and I only have a small limit) and transferring over. Should I use another exchange to buy ETH or should I just buy it from CB and transfer over
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:04:33
I don't have that much in it so I'm not sure if it's worth it for me to get one :/ Is Exodus a good wallet to even store them on my computer?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:44:02
Have you heard of Gemini? How does it compare with coinsquare?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:40
Oohh okay that helps! Thanks bro

Hey guys,
I recently got into investing (although not a lot, $200 to start) in cryptocurrencies like BTC, LTC, and ETH. I'm in Canada, is there a trusted site I should use to trade? I'm currently on CoinBase right now but I can't withdraw from them directly. I also just downloaded the Exodus wallet (is it good?), should I be transferring all my money to the wallet? I have them sitting in CoinBase's "wallet" but idk if I should take it all out and put it in a wallet or put a little in the wallet and leave a little in CoinBase? I think on Exodus I can buy and trade directly in the program but I'm not sure.
Thanks in advance for your help!

Hey its me your buddy
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:14:15
Can you ELI5 limit orders? Is it basically once the price drops/rises to a certain number, it places the order automatically?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:06:51
Should I be concerned....LOL
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:41:29
How do you buy Ripple? With all this coinbase news, I want to transfer out io coinbase but what exchange can I use to buy ripple? The limit is too small on coinbase, can anyone recommend a site that has a higher limit?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:45
Thank you, I'll look into them. I've heard about QuadrigaCX but I might as well just wait for the verification since I want to hodl anyway haha appreciate it
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:01:48
Should I put my new investment into just BTC or should I spread them from BTC, ETH, and LTC?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:06:31
I don't have *that* much in it, only about 300 or so. So it's better for me to get it off the exchange? How do you feel about the wallets like Exodus Wallet for the computer? Is that a good place to store it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:48
That sounds reassuring! Through Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:19
I'm still new to binance, can we send fiat to binance and use that to buy alts? I'm in Canada and I think binance uses USD, would there be any problems? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:02:35
People are buying ! Holy shit, should I buy now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:06:51
Thats true, I'm Canadian as well and I'm using quadriga. Wanted to know if it was a bad choice
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:22:06
What do you think it'll dip to? It's at 252 CAD on coinbase but I'm waiting for it to go back down to around 200-220, you think that's possible?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:11:50
I've just started to use Kraken but it appears that it's been crashing a lot lately because it won't load certain pages. Is this normal?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:06:15
Ohh okay okay, I'll see which one plays out better for me haha
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:30:59
That's true, thank you for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:22
Are you Canadian? Is coinsquare better? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:04:02
I feel like I should buy, the price is going up fast, all I see is a green wall!!
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:40:06
Okay I'll give it a shot! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:17:46
What's a better wallet? Preferably one that has CAD as well
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:39:56
They chose to stay anonymous so it doesn't matter anyway. You're stressing yourself over little details. Be thankful that there are still people like this in the world instead of getting worked up over their gender.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:29:28
I transferred all my coins from coinbase to QuadrigaCX.com, fees were $20 which is pretty high but not as high as yours...
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:19:03
That's true, thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:10:01
Yeah, I still need to get verified on QuadigaCX right now so I'm at my limit for the week with Coinbase for now but I will definitely look out for that in the future! Should I invest more into ETH as well? Or is LTC performing pretty well? Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:05:40
In Coinbase, I get to see how much I'm making from my investments in the coins. If i put them in, say Exodus on my computer, how do I see the profits from my investments like how coinbase displays it? Sorry I'm kind of new at this haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:30:13
Yeah 200 is just a starting point but I was thinking of putting in another 500 or so after the futures come out. I'm in Canada, isn't GDAX calculated in USD? I'm also wondering if it *does* dip after futures, should I put the whole 500 into BTC or should I buy like 300 BTC, 100 ETH, 100 LTC?

He posted in here for a while, 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:10:26
Smart phone would be good but its easy to steal, are there any desktop wallets? I kind of dont want to keep it in paper bc it might get lost
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:03:23
Should I wait until Litecoin dips to buy? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:00:10
How know you do?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:19:03
I'm trying to find another site to buy BTC, many of the exchanges are having trouble verifying new people. I wanna transfer out of Coinbase and am using Quadriga (I'm Canadian) but the funding is giving me troubles. What's a good site that you guys use to buy BTC/ETH because I want to eventually transfer to Binance and get Ripple with it.
EDIT: How's Kraken for people?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:09:26
Aren't there bigger problems than worrying about if someone is male or female
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:31:54
I got validated in 2 days, that's really odd
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:56:26
My BTC/ETH/LTC (although not a lot) is currently in coinbase right now. Should I take them out of coinbase and into the Exodus wallet or should I just leave it in coinbase and see how much money I'm making on the 3 investments?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:55:14
I wish I had 3k to toss at all 3 but unfortunately, I'm probably going to only have another 500 to play around with in the near future. Should I split them evenly?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:13:51
Ohhh okay, thank you for that explanation! Especially with market orders haha 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:21:29
I transferred my coins from coinbase to Quadriga, ETH and LTC went in pretty quick but BTC is taking a longer time, is this usual?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:25:39
Sorry for the late reply, Quad is giving me some problems with funding and it's been pretty irritating. Are there any alternatives to funding?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:12:49
That's true...so I should probably transfer them right away
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:59:53
Cool, definitely would be nice!
