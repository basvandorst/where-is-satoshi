1. Any kind of gambling is illegal in mainland China. You can play cards for money with your friends, but someone try to organize these type of stuff could end up in jail if police decide to catch you. But surprisingly, you can play on any major poker sites in China easily. You can not deposit and withdraw through bank though. You have to go through taobao- some Russian payment company-pokersites. 
2. You can play on currencies and foreign stocks. That's not very hard. But due to RMB appreciation, it wasn't popular at least for the last few years.

For now, you can sell goods and services by bitcoin if you like. But no one  especially no payment institutes can serve as a third party to take the default risk for you during the transaction, as normally bank insured debit/credit cards, and payment company like Alipay do. So no merchants has the reason or motivation to accept bitcoin. And there will be no company like "bitpay" in China. That is illegal. 
For your question, in the foreseeable future, NO.

They are. But without the support from alipay. They wont be prefered for sure. I see some of them charge extra if paid by bitcoin.
Most of these 400 have a recent trading history of 0.

Thanks for sharing this. I completely agree with all Joseph says in this article. 
 "If it was a currency you couldn’t legally use it for a transaction in Mainland China. " Because the only legally **currency** for transaction in china is RMB. As a commodity, bitcoin **can** be used as a media of exchange. But without support from legal payment company, doing an online transaction via bitcoin completely comes down to whether two parties trust each other. For big merchants,  there is basically no incentive to accept bitcoin.

0 rmb-btc trading fee. fee is only applied when you withdraw from them. 
This may not be updated. They could refuse to accept bitcoin now.

fiatleaks just counts transaction made on exchanges. btcchina has 0 trading fee, which make it having 5 times the volume of gox. 
So, it doesn't mean there is a net inflow of bitcoin to China.

Not necessarily. It's like ebay. Anyone can list item, it doesn't mean there will be people buying. 
The problem is say if you start up a shop, list a item and claim you accept bitcoin. How could I trust you if I am the guy paying first? I would prefer to pay rmb and go through alipay. In US, the answer is bitpay etc. There is not big seller with excellent reputation accepting bitcoin right now. There might be in the future.
Recall that baidu thing? In their statement, they just said they stop accepting bitcoin due to volatility, not regulation or legal concern.

Alipay has very high reputation in China. Both Alipay and Taobao are brands of the same mother company called Alibaba Group. Alibaba do b2b, c2c, and b2c business. Taobao is for both b2c and c2c. Alipay was orginally designed to support Taobao, but later commonly used by other online platform. 
What alipay does is **1**.receive fund from people's bank account. **2**.take buyers' fund from their alipay account when they are trying to buy stuff online. **3**. tell seller to ship their product and only credit fund to seller's account after receiving confirmation from buyer.  
For receiving fund, it's free for mobile client,0.1%-0.5% with a cap for PC. 
That's alipay's basic use, and right now it can even do more. You can even use it to say money get interest from it. If you enroll in this program, whatever unused balance in your alipay account will generate interest daily. Right now the yield is equal roughly 15 times of normal saving interest. 
Alipay is online thing. For offline, people use bank issued debit/credit cards,and cash.

You get it wrong. They can still do it now. But likely all the exchages will be shut down by the Chinese new year.

I honestly didn't heard about this. It looks like a Chinese version of bitpay to me. But I can see their last news was updatedon Dec 2. I assume they are banned now after the announcement. 
For other store, I only saw 2 stores accepting bitcoin on Taobao now, but both of them are generated by some random people, there was no business going on on both of them. 
Offline, I believe there is still some, but definitely not much.

0.35% annually. If you can agree to not withdraw for a certain period, it will be higher. Highest would be 5.x% annually if you don't withdraw for 5yrs.
