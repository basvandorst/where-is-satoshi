Because she is still technically head of state. And no, we were independent in 1867, there were just some formalities that needed to ve worked out in 1982.

We would not take your offer. The fact you use the word cuck tells me you're a Trumptard. Goodbye.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:07:49
The fact you're so defensive speaks volumes enough.

This is the kind of people investing in bitcoin. Now I know why the price keeps going up. It's just a bunch of retards all blowing into same bubble and every so often taking a break to yell that it's not a bubble.

Easy money until it's not. All you people are  just trying to not be the sucker holding the bag of shit at the end of ring around the rosie.

Ah, gotcha. I dont think they are actually supposed to charge the $1. It is supposed to be charged and immediately withdrawn, it's just to make sure charges can actually be applied to the card.

Off chain transactions? I thought the purpose of Bitcoin was to verify every transaction through the blockchain. Does this not defeat the entire purpose behind bitcoin? That every transaction is public information?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:16
Okay, but that's still all just speculation on what Bitcoin COULD do. At least stock price is mostly based on a calculated presumed set of earnings over a stock's lifetime

You do know that you are more likely to have your credit card number stolen at a store in person than on a reputable major retailer online right?

I'm not angry at you, I'm frustrated with your attitude towards people asking to learn things. Telling me to go learn myself does nothing for you and nothing for me. If i were the type of person to listen to that, Id have already looked it up, which I have. If I hadnt have already looked it up, you telling that type of person to do so also wouldnt do anything. As far as BTC is concerned, why do you think Im here? To learn whether this is something to note or just the latest in what seems to be a gigantic bubble machine that is the US.

Because you're in a speculation bubble thinking you're smarter than the people who run the goddamn federal reserve. Get a fucking clue. If you think this can save a failing economy, you're so far out to lunch that we can't even have an actual conversation about this.

I suppose so. That's the other thing that makes me not like it. The creator isn't known. Why hide if it's a perfectly legitimate "thing"?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:26:58
No, putting money into something you don't understand goes against rule number 1 of investing. That makes you an idiot. Idiots don't usually keep their money for very long.

Which is why all these people just jumping into the currency seem like idiots to me. The whole meme culture surrounding the "-coin" market makes me less likely to believe it will ever be more than just a flash in the pan. That, combined with the non-secure nature of the exchanges makes me not buy in, both to the currency and to the idea. Can you shed some light on how I'm wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:40:31
You don't need to, but if you don't understand it and still buy one, you're an idiot. I swear Bitcoin price almost 100% meme driven.

Enron operated for years before blowing up. Same with the housing market. Scams can last a long time.

I would say it was 50% memes, 25% Hillary hate and 25% major news sources not shutting up about him. But yes, very strange.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:42:02
And this is why newcomers hate this place. I have read the wiki, and it still doesnt make sense to me. I prefer to have people explain it to me because that's how I learn. If you want to alienate people from learning about your thing, this is how you do it asshole. Literally not helpful at all by posting this garbage as a reply
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:02:04
Okay, but it's still just a useless internet token to me. How is this not just a scam to run up the price and then dump it, making a bunch of money for some people but losing it for others?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:10:09
I'm asking if Wall Street already has their greasy hands on bitcoin and are going to prop it up and then crash it like they did to the dot com bubble, the housing bubble, and the oil bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:48:32
Okay, but none of you actually think of the sucker at the end that IS holding the bag. Just as long as it's not you right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:12:30
People claimed neither was the price of oil, but that still bubbled and exploded.

The stock market and the companies listed actually create VALUE though. And as much as I hate herbalife and their shitty business practices or EA and their shitty business practices, they make revenue and return a positive profit for their shareholders. BITCOIN DOES NOT CREATE VALUE. It has a little utility as an online currency, but there is not going to be a mass exodus of people going from using their native currency to bitcoin any time soon. Also, just because some pyramid companies trade on the stock exchanges doesn't mean every company is like that. You have to weigh each company on its own merits.
