If you don't have your private key, you own $0.
If you keep funds on an exchange you only have temporary-part ownership of them... until you don't.

Why block out the amount? Someone gonna track down the transaction in the 12k pending?

My rig does the same thing though and I guarantee it costs 1/4th this thing does and probably has higher hash

I did my research before making this post. You should look into it too. It's actually quite frightening. They used to have a picture that listed their partnered/ownership pools and its all the ones with red arrows and two more.

Well nobody can say I didn't try to warn people. They would rather comment dismissive bs then do the research themselves. /shrug

Thank you. The sooner people realize that Bitmain really controls all the pools I listed the better. Either directly or indirectly, Bitmain controls all those pools wether people want to believe it or not. They \*\*\*Had\*\*\* to branch out to other pools otherwise just their farms &amp; R&amp;D of new asics would be well over 50% alone most likely.

In the end its your choice. Nothing can be done about their dominance now, its too late. I just want people to know what they are dealing with.

Absolutely not. The real satoshi wouldn't be such an embicil
