you just set your finger on it. I need new addresses all the time to keep things to myself. It quickly becomes a pain in the ass don't you think?  
  
Also, you say that "they have no way of knowing whether it is to another one of your addresses, a business, a friend etc." but "they" can always see what the destination address is used for. If it's Amazon.com's adress for example then it will be public knowledge. And even an "anonymous" address has a public record of transactions... So any information you give out about your bitcoins' whereabout, as "useless" as they can seem to you, already represents a leverage for someone who would want to look into your finances. Would you be OK if tomorrow your bank starts to publish on its website your account's activity, just replacing the accounts your money comes from or goes to by a number?

FTFY. Your generalizing was a bit ridiculous as this particular case applies to Switerland (being neutral has its downsides as well). I regularly make SEPA transfers from France to Germany, and not a single time have I been charged a single cent. It's probably written in their bank rules somewhere, so if it in the "user's guide" then it's not robbery, just the normal funcioning. After that, it's up to you to accept it or not.  
  
editing for a last point: your banks are not bullshitting all things related to bitcoin (be it exchanges or yourself), the deposit fee would also be collected if you were making a SEPA transfer from switzerland to a european bank account for buying shampoo or prostitutes. That's just the way the system works

@_date: 2015-01-28 09:17:10
communism also failed because those in power wanted more of that: power. with power comes wealth, and it's in the human nature to always crave for more, at the detriment of others. They were a "do as I say not as I do" model. Bitcoin suffers from exactly the same thing and that will maybe be the cause of its downfall. Those in charge (exchange owners, key developers, etc.) will eventually use their exlusive powers, be it insider informations, abuse of power (think exchange admin powers to act behind the scene), Mt. gox -style robbery... All the ingredients for an explosive downfall are present in bitcoin, just as it was there with communism. Power rots the soul of men and make them greedy. That's nature.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:23:31
any reason why you have this feeling?
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:42:40
You're missing my point I think. Today, with little effort, I can make it so that in normal circumstances, no one but my bank knows where my money goes, so people don't even ask themselves what I do with it. Tomorrow, with bitcoin, virtually anyone can see that my money is going somewhere. Not necessarily where, but at least the money is seen to go somewhere. You don't need a complete information to start making people curious...  
Sure, no one makes me tell people to justify anything, but just the fact that people can get nosy is bad enough IMO, because my money is a private thing and I hate the idea of people being able to stuff their nose in it.  
 
Now, you're talking about moving bitcoins. Of course, if I have 10 different adresses, I can distribute my coins on them, no one knows they're mine, etc... but this means I have to keep track of them, so extra work for me. Moreover, I'll always need at least one "official" adress where I can get my salary paid or from which I can set up automatic payment for my bills, so the starting point of my money will always be identified. with enough time and number crunching, someone can follow where my money goes. Unless I use a separate adress for each transaction I do, I will create cross references between adresses to be done, giving away some private information about what I do with my money...  
  
So with the current bitcoin system, what I see is that I'd need to make efforts managing my bitcoins just so that people get no reason to get curious about my money. It's a bit tedious don't you think?

they may be using a new address for every deposit, but at some moment the money has to be transferred to an address officially linked to Amazon, right? for their own needs to transform BTC into fiat for example.  
You say you wouldn't care with public transaction data with no names on it, but I doubt you're part of a majority. most people do not want their privacy revealed to the general public (even partially) by a third party.

Yeah, if you can afford it. Do you have any idea how much internet via satellite costs in Venezuela? My educated guess is "no". It's awfully costly for the average joe. A quick look around reddit looking for venezuelans (so, people who know what they're talking about) discussing satellite costs shows that it's prohibitive for the average joe. "cheapest" I read about is the equivalent of $50 a month:    
Do people from working class in a country facing this kind of recession have 50 bucks to spend each month for internet access?

Funnily enough, the question was asked to a venezuelan guy the other day. He said that people can't buy anything with bits-coin in Venezuela, and that they're actually too poor to afford using their money for something else than food. As for India, last time I checked, bitscon adoption rate in the country was lower than Mt Everest growth rate.  
But maybe you're not just pulling this out of your ass, and have actual information to back this up?

With your system, the richer you are the better security you get. Police enforcement, no matter how flawed/inefficient/whatever it is, is for all citizens and individual wealth is not taken into account.  
Also, basing security on a lottery-like system is not a good idea in general. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:17:52
but the more people buy bitcoins, the higher the bitcoin value gets. So all you need to have the price go up is get as many people to buy bitcoins as possible. It's simple maths, just the bitcoins fundamentals: the law offer and demand, buy low, sell high, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:35:21

are you fucking retarded? "bitcoin linked to criminal activity", "millions lost in bitcoin scams", "mastermind hired killed with bitcoins", "ISIS accepts bitcoins donations"...  
how good do you think that sounds to the general public? good, right? after all, it's "any publicity", right?

Less than 5k people polled, for a total population of 1.3B. 
Poll probably was done in major cities where people are somewhat better educated on tech. I doubt they went in rural parts to do that. 
Talk about a misleading poll/title, and how representative this poll is on what China thinks.

pimpin' for bitcoin... I like the idea. How much you make per month by advertising this prostitution ring?

just find stock pictures of people and write some text about their "love for bitcoin". Since you don't ask for names or personal info, there is no way to know whether the testimonies are true or fake.

look, I'm trying to reassure the guy and make him join the ranks of the bitcoins enthusiasts, and you just come and ruin it all.

I also have an academic degree. And I don't see anything wrong with what he says. I agree that Bitcoin is still a small phenomenon. Here in France it's barely spoken about in IT-related press or websites, even less in everyday life. I've never heard anyone around me (and again, I work in IT) be it at work or friends or in the street or anything, talk about bitcoin for any reasons

So you're telling me that polling 0.0003% of the population is sufficient to know about said population's sentiments.  
I live in a city with around 85.3k inhabitants. If I ask 0.25 people a question, will the answer be representative of my city's opinion? (I'll let you choose which quarter - left arm and left chest, right arm and right chest, left leg andr left abs, right leg and right abs- we should ask) 
I'm sure that *in some cases* 5k is enough to give a nation's sentiment. But in OP's case, it sure as hell is not, and as I pointed out, the title is misleading, and in *this particular case* the poll isn't representative of the sentiment in China

[wat did I just read?]( do I need a special degree in smthg to be able to understand your game? Can't you make rules anybody would be able to understand? The goal is to make bitcoin mainstream. With stuff like that, your average joe will never want to even try to understand what it's all about. So your pinata just stays a game from bitcoin diehards for bitcoin diehards only. Isn't that called some kind of circlejerk?
