HA! My friend directed this. A really close friend. Funny to see it here....
@_date: 2015-06-15 06:14:00
Boom! Just got my invite. The interface is cool, but no active trading yet. Anyone else?
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:50:12
As I mentioned. Not looking to sell, just trying to un-buy.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:48:30
Definitely not going to sell. Just trying to un-buy. Just e-mailed bitstamp to see if there's a way in their system. I put my money in at $1213 and now it's worth less on bitstamp. Talk about horrible customer service.

Holy fucking shit.
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:05:18
This is hyperbolic. Sounds like someone making fun of the bitcoin community and everyone upvotes.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:42:25
That just gave me 100 more BTC. Trying to get rid of them, not gain them. Thanks, though.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:46:02
it didn't go through. If you send me all your bits I'll send you naked pics
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:57:21
What are you talking about? How is this related to my question?
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:45:15
I understand completely. I am asking people to speculate on how those problems might be solved. You're just saying "don't worry, they'll be solved."
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:57:41
Interesting. I didn't know they could be backed up. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:40:18
thats why I qualified it with "mainstream"
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:41:42
Of course...You think I'm an idiot?
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:12:44
awesome thanks for your contribution. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 08:06:10
How do these keep getting worse?
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:48:33
please see: "hot girl"
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:57:43
truth. people only think about their original investment. silly.
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:21:24
You can't argue my point by offering another point of view that isn't my own. I never thought that nobody will use checks. Argue with me, not something I can't speak on.
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:28:12
Holy crap. Major accounting software incorporating bitcoin. It's sobering how "real" this movement is starting to feel-- not to mention how fast major players are getting on board.
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:32:03
I don't want my private key to touch the internet. Forgot to mention that.

$150 netbook and backing up to multiple drives does not spell convenience for me. I'm talking about all the people that would rather the convenience and safety of a bank. No backups needed and safety from the FDIC. After all, the banks are who we are competing against for mainstream adoption. Convenience must be equal to banks for money storage before mainstream hop on board.
@_date: 2014-10-27 05:56:10
sadly, this is what I did and is making me lose faith in people's exuberance about the current state of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:31:59
Woah! My first tip. thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:47:14
Awesome. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-01 07:58:35
this is so fucking stupid

But you're the one asking me for $20....
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:19:25
That would be big hype
@_date: 2015-02-17 00:54:48
My take on explaining the types of bitcoin storage. You have three variables: cost effective, liquid, secure. You only get to pick 2 with the existing solutions. Mods should sticky this. It gets asked a lot, but there's no right answer for every occasion.
* Cost effective, secure, not liquid: Paper Wallets (BIP0083)
* Liquid, secure, not cost effective: Hardware Wallets (Trezor)
* Cost effective, liquid, not as secure: Online Wallets (Coinbase)

you took a screenshot of this thread? how does that help demonstrate your point more than just replying?
@_date: 2015-02-19 05:48:54
So you're telling me you'll send me a photo of your tits if I send it to you?
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:10:25
This wins. I love dogs. Money sent.
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:05:46
You're asking by posting in a thread that says post your best reason for me to give you $20...
