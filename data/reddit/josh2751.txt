Their TOS used to read as follows: 
"3. Purchase and Redemption of Tethers: The Site is an environment for the purchase and redemption of Tethers. Once you have Tethers, you can trade them, keep them, or use them to pay persons that will accept your Tethers. However, Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency.
There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers."
It appears they've modified it in the last few days.  
I'd still like to hear from anyone who has ever redeemed a tether, because I don't think anyone has ever been able to.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:45:42
You can't redeem USDT.   At all.  You can only sell it for other cryptocurrency.  Read their TOS.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:51:26
Lol. So redeem a tether and prove the rest of the world wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:20:43
No, the "new tax plan" simply clarifies rules that have *always been in place*.  It was never a gray area.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:29:53
In the US, all exchanges, including crypto to crypto are taxable events if they result in a gain. So you start off incorrectly. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:46:30
It’s called forgery, and I’m sure there’s a federal statute. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:18:55
No, he is not.
It's never been that way.  All exchanges have always been taxable events if a profit came from them.  Some people have pretended to believe that the like kind exchange rule could be used -- but they weren't reporting those either, most likely, as they have to be documented and reported for that rule to be effective.  
The recent tax law "change" did nothing but clarify already existing policy.  
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:30:31
It needs to be simple, work well, and work with many crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:59:04
The 1809 update that was doing this has been pulled.  It's no longer available for download.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:00:07
Correct. The value of the coins at the time they were mined is counted as income to you, and is the cost basis for the coins for tax purposes. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:41:54
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:32:02
I don't care what their press releases say. Show me. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:38:32
Yep, we knew about those too. And a lot of people lost money on cryptsy because they weren't paying attention. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:28:20
You can't mine ltc with a btc miner. They're different algorithms. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:25:47
Actually there's a lot of evidence that Tether is a scam.
But go ahead, what are you afraid of?  Everyone but you knows what happens when you try to redeem USDT for USD...  You claim that they don't follow their TOS and they actually do that redemption -- prove it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:39:24
You can't withdraw tether.  
The experiment has been done and the results posted. 
It's a bank saying "you can't withdraw anything, trust us anyway, we've got your money safe". 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:23:33
Not even close to true. 
This isn't even a mined coin if it's an ecr20 as it appears to be. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:30:50
Show me. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:19:28
What's it like to blindly defend something you don't even understand?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:49:21
lol, no it's not. And there have been many people working on it over the years. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:47:15
Somebody hoping for a flash crash?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:14:05
Not what it says. 
Go try, see what happens.  
They will not redeem them. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:42:17
Authy is not secure and it's a bad substitute. 
And all you have to do is keep your keys and you can enable google Authenticator on any device you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:48:51
Go try to redeem tether for dollars. I already know exactly what's going to happen...
It's not a conspiracy theory, they *will not* redeem them. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:17:44
No, everybody knew something was wrong with mtgox.  We certainly didn't know all the details,  but the signs were there to see as I recall. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:56:23
Me too. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:41:16
It's amazing to me that nobody seems to care. 
I agree this is a huge issue, and btc price is artificially being driven up by it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:51:25
The issuance rate was the same. 
The difficulty was much lower, as the network hashrate was much lower. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:14:13
Go try. There are screenshots of the response on the web. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:42:02
So prove me wrong...
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:14:10
It's called margin trading silly. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:43:26
It has a couple of secure and mostly tamper proof microprocessors. It's not a thumb drive.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:45:49
So prove me wrong.
Show me how you redeem USDT for USD.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:32:36
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:57:49
Actually that's the perception, but their terms clearly say they will not pay you for your tether. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:32:55
Go try.  Redeem usdt, in any amount, for usd and prove you did it. 
They're lying, and everyone knows it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:36:03
You understand you need to substitute the actual path to the file, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:10:07
Ok, to be pedantic the block issuance rate was the same. The coin issuance rate has halved twice, but I guess we were talking about two different things. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:48:14
Still over a month to send it in though.  No reason to give them a reason to take more money.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:08:57
No, with 100k in income and no withholding he needs to pay estimated tax by the end of the year to avoid penalties. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:41:02
No. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:33:37
Yes, there is. 
And the SSD is not removable. In short, he's fucked. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:14:44
You could try.  SSDs aren't like platter drives -- they don't really let you get down to the hardware to do anything.
