1. Many exchanges are region/currency limited.
2. Bitcoin transfer fees are astronomical at the moment. So if you are a Coinbase user you can't just buy it somewhere else and move to your Coinbase (price differences between exchanges don't cover moving fees). And withdrawing funds from anywhere else can pose somewhat of a challenge.
3. Many of the cheaper exchanged might be considered less reputable so people choose to use "safer" but more expensive ones.

It would be cool if somebody made these but instead of Bitcoin used stable coins to avoid the price fluctuation while the coins are in paper form. They wouldn't even have to all be same value, you could make a 1 Tether, 5 Tether, 10 Tether, 20 Tether, 50 Tether, 100 Tether ... this way you wouldn't even need to have Internet access to buy things as you'd be able to physically trade certain combinations of these wallets when you want to buy something.

Bitcoin is only viable for holding, not for spending. That is why they don't bother with it. Just imagine the amount of compliance / tax issues they'd have to spend resources on if they switched to Bitcoin...

I'm not sure which part of my post made you question my mental well-being...
I though CryptoCurrency community was all about emphasizing personal freedoms, so if I believe that keeping my money in the 'traditional' system is my best option, I don't see why you'd be distressed by that.
Its not even that I believe that CryptoCurrencies are dumb, there is a need to significantly improve the quality of retail banking. Crypto being a possible alternative for a certain consumer segment might be a good step forward to getting banks to start working on some improvements in this sector.
Technology behind Crypto is also rather impressive (Blockchain, Tangle, various consensus/payment protocols...) and in my opinion the value of intellectual property generated in this community far outweighs the actual value of the coins all of you Crypto people are so obsessed with.

Only if he/she/it/they still has access to those initially mined coins...

Even is there wasn't a catch, would you really give away your full ID for 20$ ?

Hey man, to each their own... I'm probably being too restrained with my data anyways.

USD is backed by: The fact that its the only currency that can be used to buy oil on the global market, is used by virtually all nations as a primary reserve currency, is the only way to pay taxes in the worlds biggest economy, has the backing of worlds strongest military, has the backing of the biggest gold reserve in human history - 9k metric tons, etc...
Bitcoin is backed by: Teenage reditors' lunch money, some of the dankest memes on the internet, virtual digital wales, power of doge, infinite fork potential, Moons gravity pulling the value up, etc...
Everybody is free to make a choice !

" On March 26, China launched **crude** oil futures contracts priced in renminbi (RMB) on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange. "
So... just like with the Bitcoin futures, its not REALLY buying/selling.

This site only posts shill news articles... it makes me doubt the credibility of this article

Nothing I guess... its all about how much each person values their privacy, for me personally 20$ wouldn't be tempting enough to give away the amount of info that is needed for KYC

Its Ok. I know, banks love wars.

I'm not saying that it wasn't Central Banks fault. My argument is that contracting monetary supply is bad. Regardless of who/what is causing it.

That just shows that until other 'bad' currencies disappear Bitcoin is never going to become the primary everyday currency.

True. But considering that the worlds population keeps increasing I don't see this have a significant possessive effect (assuming that the laws of inheritance don't change in some drastic way).

Depression started after the Great War and ended (at least in the west) before the start of the Second World War.
The Great War was more of a cause then a solution to the Great Depression.

Then, I guess that until Bitcoin becomes the dominant currency it is gonna act more like an asset then actual currency (similar to the low/no inflation Swiss Franc for people living outside of Switzerland).
But yeah, at some point the value of necessities is going to 'outweigh' the passive value increase of Bitcoin and people are going to start using it as a more traditional currency.

Aren't your first and third options actually the same thing ? (from a 3rd person perspective)
