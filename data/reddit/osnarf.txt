I don't understand convincing somebody you know to invest in... well, anything really, but especially not something as volatile as Bitcoin.  It seems like a good way to get people mad at you.

That guy is on your side, smartass.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:23:47
Yeah but now you have to convince her to keep holding and not try to salvage what is left of her investment, and you're getting a bunch of crap (most likely).  I wasn't trying to imply it was wrong or anything, just seems like it would be stressful.

Oh wow, yeah that is pretty big.

Thanks, I was pretty sure that was what they were referring to, but I had never heard the terminology of blanks and fullstops before. I'm actively trying to change over to using only one space after a period, but it is a habit ingrained so deeply in my head that I usually have to use find-replace in any serious documents. It's very frustrating that I was taught to use two spaces by every pre-college teacher and that it was never corrected by any college professors who read my papers. I learned by some random Reddit post.

IMO the only money that should be in Bitcoin in general is money you can afford to lose.  While I think they were foolish, I still feel bad for those who don't share that sentiment.

Isn't 51% almost exactly the same as 49% in terms of ability to perform these attacks? A miner with 49% of the hash rate is going to have pretty similar odds to get the next block.

That, and Bitcoin still isn't widely accepted enough that you (most people) aren't going to have to convert it to cash anyways before the money someone sent you can be used for rent or groceries, especially if rent is due TODAY or you are completely out of food. WU is pricey, but it is for urgent cases where you need cash right now. If you have more time, you can mail a check for a few cents. Bitcoin isn't quite there yet (most landlords and grocery stores don't accept it),  so WU still serves a purpose for now, in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:51:13

So why not cointip? The problem is that most people who see it won't bother to read up on it, they will only see the name. It helps for people to constantly be reading the word Bitcoin so that it remains relevant.

1 millibit = 1 nanobitcoin = 0.1 Satoshi
OP was trying to say 1 millibitcoin = 1000 bits (aka 1000 microbitcoins). 1 millibitcoin = 1 million millibits = 1 kilobits.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:36:07

Thanks, I forgot about that.  As a follow up, do the people running the miners choose whether or not to process transactions with no fees attached, or is there another reason attaching fees is optional (but recommended if you want to make sure the transaction goes through)?

No, it's more like saying "send a message with the software" in an article about twitter, which is less redundant, or saying "students can drive to school in the machine" in an article about cars.  Point taken that it is an odd choice of words, but I definitely don't think it's cringe-worthy.

My net gain is 300%, I hold bitcoin except when I'm sitting at the computer day trading.  I was referring explicitly to the results of trading.  And my advice was to use really small amounts of money or not do it all, so I'm not sure what you're upset about.
Edit: I just realized that you were probably talking about my net gain from trading being negative.  Either way, my last point still stands.

In the US, we printed 8.4 billion bills (or ~359 billion USD, if I can add) last year, but over 90% went to replace old bills.  That leaves less than 840 million new bills.  However, it says nothing about the denomination of those 840 million bills, so the actual money added into circulation could be as low as 840 million USD or it could be as high as 84 billion USD.  [This site]( says there is approximately 1.18 trillion in circulation as of March 20th, so we increased the amount of money in circulation by between 0.07% and 7.66%, depending on the bill denominations.  Does anyone have more info to narrow that down?
By the way 84 trillion yen is ~872 billion USD.  Does anyone know how much of this is actually new money being added into circulation, or how much?
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:42:54

Well, yeah, bitcoin is in a bubble right now.  And it has been before.  And it will be again.  Being a legitimate investment with a price that will eventually rise higher than the current price does not mean it isn't in a bubble currently.  The $250 peak bubble doesn't look like such a small speed bump on a logarithmic graph.

Saying  100 cents is too much for a dollar is like saying 1000 millibitcoins is too much for a Bitcoin.  Neither is like comparing the prices of two different currencies.

@_date: 2013-12-05 22:30:09
That would be up to the individual retailer. They may only accept Bitcoin up to a certain small amount when they initially start to accept it. It may be as low as $100. If there are minimal issues, or the issues wind up costing them less than the fees from credit cards, they will probably gradually increase the limit. If they have the ability, they may ask you to wait for a confirmation on high value transactions instead of only accepting fiat.
Edit:  Of course, the reverse is also true. If it is costing them more money they will probably lower the cutoff or stop accepting Bitcoin altogether.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:48:47
I think that you will. Credit card fees are high for merchants. There would have to be a lot of false transactions for it not to save them money.  People shoplift all the time, this would be no different.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:09:31
Good traders have also probably lost a ton when they were new, which is the price of gaining the experience.  I'm definitely noticing myself getting better, and am finally not losing money constantly (hovering around breaking even for the last month or so of trading).  I think the hardest part of trading is controlling emotions and trusting your judgement. I call about 75% of the market movements correctly, but then I fuck it up by panicking and getting out or back in too early when there is a small reversal.  I highly recommend trading with very small quantities of money when you are new (if you trade at all), because you are probably going to lose a good percentage of it before you start making anything.

It worked fine for me the other day.  I bought very little just to try it because I'm broke, but it worked.  I used moneygram at CVS.  Anecdotal evidence, but just figured I would contribute.
PS:  If you do this, you have to tell them to enter the amount you are paying + the fee, because for some reason the fee shows up as $0 and is instead included in the actual amount sent.  I had to use the red phone several times before this got worked out.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:11:11
OP, you should put that bolded conversion rate at the top of your post too so the lazy people see it, too.  Or put a tl;dr
Btw, 1 millibitcoin = 0.001 bitcoins not 0.0001 bitcoins.

I think I'll be passing on the entire app, lol.  Don't feel like being the Guinea pig.  But if they have your login info, can't they just withdraw everything no matter what boxes I check in the app?

I thought you were talking about the verification processes of Bitstamp and Gox. Most people transfer BTC into btc-e, and then trade away.  There isn't an option to give btc-e verification documentation which will allow international wire transfers from the US - they will refuse all transfers from US banks.
