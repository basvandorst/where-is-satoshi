Indeed. I used to like him, but smart man would not comment on stuff he doesn't understand. Kinda lost some respect for him after the ill-informed comments about bitcoin few years back. 
He won't be the first old, rich, white man that is unpleasantly surprised by technology and it's potential though.

You are so evil :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:40:54
Absolutely agree!
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:42:46

@_date: 2017-10-19 12:05:28
I wish I was still as excited checking the price as I was in 2012. Even if the movements are much bigger now.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:20:56
You should write book about it :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:57:13

Stop listening to your wife. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:56:08
Yes indeed.
The only thing unclear is if it will be now, or at $10k, $30k, $100k.....
we have seen 30x spikes from $1 to $30
