let me spell it out for you, key point you should take away is this:


hence title is nonsensical

yeah, u/proficy is right. Articles like that are important for people who dont know much about cryptocurrency market. They show that crypto is viable and working RIGHT NOW.   
I just felt like trolling and thats not most interesting post in r/Bitcoin cause it is kinda a main point for purist fans. It is why we love crypto in the first place - because its better than, at very least, fiat issued by unstable government.

not much to explain, GenesisMining put on satire protest where people participating are supposed to be a bankers and they chant stuff like "bitcoin has got to go, hey hey, ho ho"

obviously not done by academic cause structure is terrible, but other than that nice idea!

Honestly, I'm tired of people discussing BCash in this sub!It's really not worth the attention.  
Although it used to solve a problem, BCash is nothing  more than test net for minor future Bitcoin block size increases, thats considering how its being ran and whos being ran by, that's it. Plus, it was already agreed that it can not scale the way its being developed right now.
By constantly talking about it here we are just giving it attention which results in more scams, confusion and people being agitated.

Jeez guys, forget this design, its simply too similar to dollar among other things. 
One other thing, which annoys me personally, is that loop goes other way than  That results in this font design being kinda same, but with fairly big difference.

This should go up.
Among other things Purse.io actually help sellers to spend their amazon gift cards which even though is enablement of this kind of pay ( yeah, some people pretty much get payed in amazon gift cards), but at least it in small scale now

Arguably comments can be a cause too, it could be explained by slashdot effect(pretty much defined by reddit), except for volume instead of traffic

heh, as it happens I'm partly a web developer. Although swamped right now, some time soon I'd be willing to take it on if somebody would help out.
For the growth of community and all that!

is there a place which keeps tracks of cryptocurrency or blockchain related events in europe?

alternative last panel could represent me just stuffing my lifesavings in some box and not worrying about shit
@_date: 2018-11-02 08:02:14
im fairly certain that was sarcastic shot at usual hodlers comments

...aaand you can't really do anything when you make transaction on bitcoin blockchain, they are irreversible.
Unless you would take over 51% of the network and invalidate blocks with your transaction [= 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:21:12
i do agree with you though =] 
man, its all in good heart and it is stated its a joke ;]
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:46:15
hehe, at first i thought you were joking, like "write your keys on paper and keep it safe" sort of thing 
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:22:06
I'm gonna go ahead and assume you don't have many friends or you're in tight group who hates everyone around them
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:16:14
That is straight up misleading title
