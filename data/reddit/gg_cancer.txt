If there was a global currency good luck trying to balance a fixed interest rate with as big of a wealth gap as someone living in California and someone living in a hut in Mongolia.
There a lot more reasons why but it's not as simple as saying "come on trust each other a little pls".

Why would someone who is new to bitcoin replace their iPhone with an equal or worse phone.

If CMHC did not exist, banks would charge you a higher interest rate to compensate them for risk of default, or they would obtain insurance from a private insurer, at a higher cost, because that insurer faces higher borrowing costs than CMHC. CMHC has a very low cost of funding because it is backed by the taxpayer, and thus it can offer mortgage insurance to banks at a lower cost than a private-sector entity. This is the entire premise behind CMHC - to lower interest costs to home-buyers by assuming default risk at below market rates. 
The government was only guaranteeing the loans that the banks held and money was not spent. All banks globally were suffering from a liquidity problem. This would not have brought the Canadian banks down, but it would have brought down a lot of businesses that could not access capital to do such ordinary things as pay for inventories, expand and cover regular costs.
The mortgages that were purchased by CMHC were already insured by CMHC, consequently, there was no additional risk to the government. All the mortgages that were purchased were performing mortgages, i.e. the mortgage holders were paying the principle and interest on time. There was not bailout as the mortgages were not in default.
Going into the purchase the federal government expected to make about 1% profit on the deal, and did just that. It is hard to suggest a bailout by the government when the government is making money going in. There were no subsidies paid by the government.
Once again the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is just spreading economic nonsense because their cheif economist can't stand fact that Canadian banks were not bailed out whereas were had massive Corporate Union welfare/bailout of the auto sector.

...somehow you made this into a android vs iPhone argument and even falsely quoted me. I never said iPhone was better. I just simply asked if you are new to bitcoin how would buying an android phone solve the problem. You can't really expect people to purchase a brand new phone just to use your wallet.

How does it increase demand for new ones if the person who smashes it doesn't want another? Wouldn't selling them increase demand especially if the new owner is new to iphones which means they'll buy the new generation later.
But who cares about supply/demand, it's stupid to destroy something and not just donate/sell it for money to donate. On top of the wasted money of buying a new phone that can also be better spent else where.

The practice of buying insurance on conventional mortgages is by no means new. Just because they spent more than before doesn't make it a bailout. I guess all the time before are mini bailouts that happen everyday?
I only consider it a bailout if actual money is transferred, not if the government makes a guarantee to help in a crisis but the banks never actually call on that guarantee. They never gave them money to do whatever they want with (look at how bank CEOs in the states were given huge bonuses).
You want a bailout, look at what they gave to the auto industry. The two instances are not the same at all. The Canadian Banks were solid financially but literally needed liquidity support to meet their normal obligations. CMHC bought CMHC Insured mortgages from them to assist with their liquidity requirements if they needed it. Not a bailout. 
It did not cost the taxpayers one cent. That's the difference.
And the reason it didn't cost taxpayers anything because if a mortgage the government bought through CMHC was paid off, the government made a profit on the interest rate spread. If a mortgage the government bought through CMHC defaulted, because they'd insured the mortgage anyway, the government was no worse off than it would have been if it hadn't bought the mortgage.

The government didn't have the buy these mortgages. They did so to maintian liquidity in the market for such things as allowing small business could finance inventories, households to borrow to buy cars, students to buy books and all the rest of the borrowing that goes on in the economy. It wasn't for the banks.
There was no bailout, the banks would have happily carried on with the performing mortgages. All this allowed them to do was do more of it. There process was that if more money is moving, more money will be made. All the government did was guarantee what was in effect alone of credit. Not a penny changed hands. Seems like it worked.
Again, please actually know what you're talking about without blindly reading a headline.

Really? You're just going to link the first article when you search "Canada Bail Out" without even understanding it?
First of all this is no "secret" at all as this was all disclosed already by the Harper Government's Action Plan. The bailout it is referring to is that the CMHC buys mortgages off of banks. CMHC has always been insuring mortgages, the only thing that changed was that they increased the amount of insured mortgage bonds they buy from the banks to allow them to make more loans. 
This doesn't change the risk exposure of the banks or CMHC, since the mortgages have always been insured. I think CMHC and therefore the taxpayer actually made money on those bonds since they offered a higher yield than CMHC's funding costs. Flooding the system with extra liquidity is not the same as bailing out any banks. 
I'd go more in depth into it but I'm obviously talking to someone who simply only reads sensational headlines.

Also people should know there are two Android Projects. The first is Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the other is Google Android. the project that Google builds and shares with its handset partners. The former is free while Google's includes proprietary technologies that are not available as open source.
And you probably need open source hardware as I assume Qualcomm does not allow you to boot AOSP from even phone like the Nexus 5.

If bitcoin were to become a global currency without ever becoming part of the day to day loaning of one entity to another that would mean a huge shift in what the economy would like that. That's a goal that is so far away it might not be seen or even possible in our lifetime or after.
