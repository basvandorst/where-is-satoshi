Funny how that wasn't your approach to claims about Clinton further up in the thread.

You're right that it won't increase with transaction rate, but it will increase with price. The reward increases with price, and if the reward is higher than the price of the electricity used, it makes sense to increase the hashing power. So you have to scale the power consumption with market cap. The US dollar have a significantly higher market cap than Bitcoin, so the comparison is not reasonable.

A quick googling indicates that the yellow dots cover the entire paper, so they exist in any sufficiently large part of the paper.

The money that could have done good elsewhere is something to lose.

You need to cool tissue way faster than we can with something the size of a human (head) today to preserve the fine details of the tissue. A lot of the neuronal pattern is in that fine tissue. So any cryopreservation done today will probably destroy what makes up the mind in the process.

Which part of my statement do they contradict? That the fine details are not preserved, or that those details are necessary to accurately describe neuronal activity?

Can't you declare any income to the IRS, without stating where you got it from?

It seems like you can: 
It seems like to come from a conflict between the right of the government to collect income tax, and the fifth amendment. The solution to that conflict is that you can declare illegal income to the IRS.

That is one problem. The more fundamental problem is that, if there is public information about the future price of an asset, this information is already incorporated into the price of the asset. So even if a technique to predict the future price of an asset from public data actually worked, it would stop working the minute the technique became publically known. So techniques discussed on public fora cannot work.

But it still reaches the predicted price faster than you can react once the information is public. So it is worthless as investment advice (I should probably have stated that that was what I meant with worthless)
