respect for checking, Sir! I must admit, I made my statements only upon estimations so it was actually exagurrated. That bein said what you calculated is only the inflation considering wages. There was also actual (felt) price inflation: From this site [ I get: One Doller in 1950 are $7.84 in 2004. I calculated this with (1+0.039)^54 = 7.89295 . If you take Wage + Price inflation you then have 4.7 + 3.9 = 8.6 which is not between 10 and 15 but certainly a shockingly high rate (al least to me).

You are completely right. I apologize for not having thought it out clearly. Basically my thoughtprocess as I wrote this yesterday was that if there was an inflation of about 700% over 50 years, there must have been an inflation of 14% which is of course completely wrong, especially when I compare it to your calculation. I actually take back what I said, you were right, sorry, was just too tired to think about it clearly yesterday

If a government prints tons and tons of money (and thats exactly what was done) the value of the currency HAS to go down after. The only question is: How long is the lag on the market. Since we are talking about huge areas of influence and about such a big scale, the lag could be a few years, but it will eventually come. Europe as well as the US are currently living in a time of artificiantly created economic boom. Long term it will hurt more than if you hadnt printed the money. Simple austrian school mathemathics. There is no way you can avoid a bust. None.

look what people were living with 60 years ago and then take a look at today: (source: Wikipedia) [This chart is median income of 15 year olds or older, who have non-zero income] 1950: $2,570 2004: $30,513
Yes, the US got wealthier, but not by this much.

well, thats why a creteria for good money is also diversibilty. The solution in this case is not to print another extra set of dollers, but to make the one doller 10*0.1 dollar. This is easily possible with Bitcoins.
