They can also use their superior resources and powers to pump out a steady stream of propaganda, for example saying that bitcoin is only used by gangsters, criminals, rapists, terrorists, nazis, money laundrers etc, and anyone who doesn't belong to these categories is in fact still guilty of the same crimes by means of guilt by association, and as such should be ostracized and punished, and in any case, it's all just a scam anyway, so you're not only a major criminal but also dumb if you use this devil's coinage.

People in the US would have less money, yes. But people in he rest of the world would have correspondingly more, if the only thing that happens is that the USD collapse relative other currencies, which is what OP postulates. 
Bitcoin is not a US only thing in any way.
Of course, there could be some underlying cause that is bad for all of the world, and knock-on-effects of the currency change. Like, if a supervolcano erupts underneath the US, the USD might tank, and it would be bad for everyone else as well. Also, a suddency currency collapse could trigger other unforeseen consequences, like massive bankrupcies in certain sectors, and then those consequences could wipe out value worldwide. But the currency change by itself is not a huge deal, since it is only relative value shifting between countries.

I booked a hotel and chose to pay it immediately with bitcoin. A few clicks and the payment was done in 10 or so minutes (tx confirmed). Not sure why there would have to be several days and banks involved at all. Don't know what the multiple currencies involved you speak of mean. I see the prices (on Expedia for example) in my home currency. When I choose to pay with bitcoin at checkout, it is converted to the bitcoin equivalent and I pay that bitcoin equivalent.
My main comparison was  a comparison with paying with credit card without using Paypal. My LOL towards PayPal was mainly with regards to the risks of having your money entrusted to that notoriously unreliable company that's been known for decades to arbitrarily freeze accounts and generally put up shady rules or reject credit cards or else cause the bank to freeze the credit card and what have you. I won't touch it even with a 10 foot pole.

There is no such thing as deflation or inflation for bitcoin currently because virtually nothing is priced in bitcoin (yet). The price of an asset rising is not deflation. It's just the price of an asset rising. Everything is still being priced in fiat.
If bitcoin becomes more widely used than fiat, then pricing may start to happen in bitcoin. If let's say hamburgers and man hours started being priced in bitcoin, you could have inflation or deflation, but since bitcoin is capped at 21 million and 99% of that coin supply will have been issued by 2030, inflation is virtually impossible in such a future. Deflation is possible, and indeed likely, considering that more coins will be lost than the newly issued (add on top of that the ever ongoing productivity increases in most forms of production, which is also deflationary).

Lack of volume, and lack of competition.
Lack of volume leads to lack of competetion. Lack of competition leads to high prices, leads to lack of volume. Lack of volume leads to high costs per transaction (because ATM owner has mostly fixed costs for licensing, regulatory burden and fixed costs for the ATM itself). High costs per transaction leads again to lack of volume.
TL;DR - viscous circle is cursing the ATM market.
If everyone was using these things frequently, we would not have the problem of high prices (high markup by ATM operator), and we would have competion, and everything would be fine and dandy. But they aren't, because it's too expensive. Not sure it is possible to break this circle currently though.

Well they're not competing with fiat ATMs, but rather with online bitcoin exchanges, so that is the relevant comparison.
As for competing with fiat as a whole, that's more of a matter of bitcoin as a whole competing with fiat as a whole, which is a whole different matter. 
Banks don't charge fees perhaps (depends where you live, I guess, in many places they do, one way or another for sure they always charge you), but certainly the issuers of fiat (Central Banks) do charge you a fee called "inflation". So there is that.

Paypal? Lol.
If you compare the checkout process between bitcoin and credit card for online tx, it's essentially the same. Bitcoin is slower with confirmation, but most of the time the hassle of typing credit card credentials etc, and usually the extra step of VISA Secure or what's it called takes longer (especially on mobile) than just clicking a link and sending off the bitcoin, so it pretty much evens out. Once LN is widespread, bitcoin will be far more smooth than credit cards.
For physical PoS, cash or credit cards are still more smooth than bitcoin, but that's not where bitcoin shines, which is obviously in online transactions (especially international).

So you don't understand even the fundamentals of how neither bitcoin nor fiat works, huh?
Bitcoin is capped to 21 million coins. There will not be any inflation, regardless of adoption. It is literally impossible.
Fiat on the other hand is being printed all the time. Every 100 dollar bill is being diluted by this printing. The recent Quantitative Easing by Central banks has massively diluted the value of your dollars, even though it is not visible in Consumer Price  Index *yet*, but it is 100% certain to do so eventually.

No it isn't. You are jumping to conclusions. If a bank has deposits of 100 BTC, they cannot just lend 200 BTC to someone. They could write a piece of paper saying "this paper is good for 200 BTC - honestly, we pinky-swear!" and give that to some gullible fool, but the fool would soon realize those bitcoins doesn't actually exist on the blockchain and cannot be used for transactions. Only the actual bitcoins can be used. 
That means that whatever lending happens will not be *fractional reserve* banking. You can have bitcoin banking, yes, with person A lending money to Bank B, who then in turn lend it to Customer C, but they can not give C more than they got from A, hence not *fractional reserve* banking.

Competition, and volume.
Central Europe, apparently including Poland, is the crypto center of the world. Switzerland, Austria, Czech Rep. etc., more ATM there than anywhere else.
If you have competition, fees start to go down. If fees start to go down, volume increase as more people start using it. More volume means the lower fees doesn't hurt the operator because they get more volume instead.

You don't upgrade an old wallet per se. New wallets you create can be segwit. Your pre-segwit wallet (with old seed) can still be used in Electrum and will remain pre-segwit for as long as you like.

BTC price depends on many more factors than adoption.
The price right now is about 1/3 of what it was 6 months ago. Is that because adoption is suddenly only 1/3 of what it was 6 months ago? No, almost certainly not. There is a correlation between price and adoption but it is far from linear, and it is far from clear if price follows adoption or if in fact adoption follows price, to some extent. Right now Bitcoin feels "cold" while 6 months ago it was "hot" - is that why adoption is down (if it even is)? These are complex interactions.

The idea of security by hash rate is the (correct) assumption that there will always be hostile actors willing to spend money on securing hash rate for themselves to use nefariously.
In a successful bitcoin there will be literally trillions of dollar in potential rewards for that behaviour. 
To assume that you can protect such a network just by means of altruism is ridiculous.

I think we had that situation for much of 2014/2015. The price was stuck in a bear market downward dynamic, even though new and old people were coming back into bitcoin (after the worst of the crash panic had settled down) and there was all sorts of adoption happening within the ecosystem.

Increased adoption of segwit and batching means there is in fact more traffic happening than ever. 
The late 2017 mempool peak was mostly due to Coinbase and others spamming the network with inefficiently designed outputs, that have been slowly remedied by better batching and segwit adoption throughout 2018. Also some of the extreme peaks around the time of The Great Schism in mid and late 2017 were almost certainly politically motivated spam attacks.

Although, I forgot to add:
It is possible that something *was* kind of broken this time too: The transaction congestion was pretty bad in December, for whatever reason. It's rarely been mentioned as a reason for the crash, because the backlog got almost completely wiped even before the crash started, buuuut, you could argue, I suppose, that before we are ready for the next hype cycle, we again have to rebuild something in the ecosystem: We need to get Lightning Network fully functional and sufficiently adopted to be ready for prime time. 
Interestingly, that may indeed take two years or so. I could easily see a mega hype build in mainstream media at some point, when the implications of LN start sinking in. Right now, there is literally zero coverage of LN in media. Yet, we who follow the space more closely, know that it is one of most exciting things happening. When media catches up to this: Well, there you may have the mother of all hypes. It (media comprehending what LN will bring) probably won't happen already in 2018 though.

The fundamental misunderstanding (in general) is that mining efforts, and the associated power usage, increase when bitcoin usage (transactions) increase. This is NOT the case. 
What drives hash rate is PRICE. (Expectations for the price in the near future, perhaps next 6-12 months, rather than the current snapshot price).
Obviously if adoption increase, price probably goes up, but  it is not increased adoption per se that drives hash rate.

Miner's decision whether to increase their hash rate takes into account: 
* price

Unfortunately there is sloppy usage of the word "wallet" going around, where some people use it when they mean address.
For all we know, the 94,000 *could* be part of an even larger wallet.


Yes they are. The ones you are mentioning (most mobile wallets, Trezor and Coinbase), while having each their advantages, none of them are particularly good at letting you manage the individual addresses. If you want to delve deeper into the fine details of address management within a wallet, I'd recommend starting to play around with a more full blown wallet, such as Electrum or Bitcoin Core.

Also, "adoption" means many things. Joe Doe buying some coins on Coinbase and not doing much with them is a sort of adoption and gets new people invested in bitcoin's success, but there is also much more important deeper adoption, such as actual usage of it as a payment system, merchant adoption (of which there are many different levels), and so on. 
IMHO, "all of the above" is valid adoption, and important, but some of it will affect price but not transaction volume, while other types affect transaction volume but not price.

It could be 2 years, sure, but there is a huge difference between the last crash and the current crash: Last crash was caused by something fundamental getting completely shattered: The Gox collapse. Gox had, I think, something like 80% of the global trade volume. When something like that goes belly up AND a huge proportion of the population losing their money not only by the crash but also because of a fundamental fault of how the ecosystem worked at the time (= people keeping their money on a shady exchange), this means that it could be legitimately said that in many ways the system was BROKEN. 
Now, as we know, it wasn't *really* broken, but something had fundamentally changed for the worse between before the bubble and after.
Fast forward to the current crash. This time the price dropped because... people seemed to agree that maybe we'd gone a little bit overboard with the price... so it was probably overvalued? One could add some other factors, such as concern about regulation/bans, the Japanese Gox custodian dumping coins, worries about Tether, but pretty much whatever you add to the mix, all of what had changed between before the crash and after the crash, this time, was an emotional feeling, but NOT a fundamental flaw or broken house such as Mt Gox.
This is why it *could* be argued that "this time is different!". ;) Or maybe it was last time that was different (remember the previous bubble before the December 2013 one happened less than a year earlier in April 2013): After the Gox crash, Bitcoin was somewhat broken and needed a "extended maintenance window" - a longer than normal recovery time in order for the ecosystem to rebuild a healthier infrastructure of exchanges.
I'm not saying the bear market is over, but IMHO it is going too far to assume that just because last time recovery took 2 years, it has to take 2 years this time as well. History doesn't repeat EXACTLY.

Terrible example to prove your point. Gold is literally ONLY being used as a store of value (aside from a tiny fraction of a percent being used in industry). Who the hell uses gold to transact with in 2019? The vast majority of gold is just sitting in vaults.
Also, it is not that many people holding gold, apart from perhaps a few rings, necklaces and a watch. I bet that even today, there are more people in a typical Western country who hold some bitcoin than who hold physical gold. The difference is that a lot of gold is held by large institutions such as banks and governments.

How could that possibly work? If the Putincoin is going to have any of the characteristics of a "coin", it will be tradable around the world, even if not within the borders of Russia. And if it is, then either it's real price will become market driven whether Putin likes it or not, or Russia will have to intervene in global crypto markets the same way they do with the regular ruble to print, buy and sell to keep the price stable.

I'm sure everyone sane wishes they had the foresight of selling everything in early Jan 2018, but anyone who has held until now would be idiotic to sell anything at this point. Sure, it could still go further down, but the overall upside is so much bigger than the downside now, even if it will take time to realize it.
It is almost impossible to call the precise bottom of a bear market until it has happened, just like it is to call the top of the bull, except in hindsight. However, chances are pretty good that we aren't all that far from the bottom now. And selling at the bottom is just as much of a mistake as buying at the top.

So you don't understand how bitcoin mining works at all? The number of users of the network is not directly related to hash rate.
The only connection is one between bitcoin price and hashrate. For bitcoin to use 1000 times more energy, price would have to go up 1000 times (assuming roughly constant power efficiency of miners).
So the only scenario your 1000x prediction is possible is if bitcoin price goes to 3 million dollars.  Is that you prediction?

It is only in hindsight you can label that point as "the bottom". When you are at the bottom, and look at the charts, it's just another step on a seemingly endless slide down the abyss.

That is a pointless nitpicky comment. Whilst you don't formally store the bitcoins, you do store the private key, either directly or via a seed phrase. How you store the key (or equivalent) is what's being discussed here. Your suggestion of airgapped computer is one of many options, just as I was trying to explain above. It has its pros (fairly safe against attack) and cons (clunky, somewhat expensive to have a dedicated airgapped computer, not easy to explain to grandma, also not safe against natural disaster unless you set up a system with redundant copies), just like every other solution. 
"Just keep your private key safe and that is it" is good advice some for use cases, but far from all, aside from the fact that it doesn't address the main point of how to keep your private key safe.

In return, they get to enjoy full protection and a uniquely privileged status under which they cannot go broke, get to print money, sort of and generally allowed to make as much money as they want and how they without being challenged from the state.

No one is saying they can’t make money. OP just requests that prices are clearly labelled to the buyer so they can make an informed buying decision, just like you would expect in every other business?
You’re not getting mass adoption without proper market competition either, and that requires an ability to compare competitors.

Iran is not under attack, only it’s artificially propped up state fiat currency. 
The days of pegged, propped up and artificially inflated/suppressed currencies are fast disappearing due to technical developments for the last couple of decades. Most governments have already realised this and let their currencies float. Some desperate regimes, such as Iran, still think they live in the 1980s, but one by one they will learn they don’t. 
Eventually all currencies will float. Crypto will just be the final nail in the coffin of currency controls.

It is an excellent example of the use-case bitcoin was created for. It is a much better starting point than "Why bitcoin? Moooooon ofc!!!". People may know of bitcoin, and may even have heard of "decentralized" and "censorship resistant" but they don't understand why they should care about that since they are not terrorists. The current deplatforming runs home the message: Eventually everyone will be affected, directly or indirectly, by the bankster digital money system that is rapidly replacing the OLD censorship resistant money, which is cash. 
People won't see it until it literally starts touching their own lives.

You cannot within the Google auth, but most services you can either bring up the recovery code from within the service (let's say a bitcoin exchange), or you can disable and then re-enable the authenticator, and when re-enabling make sure this time you write down the restoration code. You have to do all this while you still have a functioning Authenticator. Do it now!

I agree with your concerns about a widespread immutable, irrefutable registry. Sure, it would save us some hassles and risks with current ID procedures, but we might get a previously unimaginably dystopian mass surveillance mechanism with such a system.

Businesses have employees who need pay, suppliers who demand pay, rent to pay, taxes to file. Until all of these *also* accept bitcoin, businesses have no choice but to convert all or most of their revenue into fiat.
Bitcoin is a bank in your pocket, yes, but individuals operate on a whole different kind of way from businesses.

Bitcoin slowing down eventually is inevitable. The market cap of bitcoin can't be bigger than the "market cap" of all the assets in the world. A 100 trillion dollar market cap of bitcoin would be a ballpark endgame for total world economy take over, which translates to about 5 million per bitcoin. The exponential growth of bitcoin will start slowing down well before that point, it's inevitable.

I agree, this is the best way to do it. 
Fiat of any sort crossing borders is hard to circumvent legal restrictions. Bitcoin however, exist in all countries simultanously, thus never have to actually cross a border. Both border crossings (out of your own country and into China) should be done while the money is in bitcoin shape. 
The remaining problem is then twofold: How do you turn your money into bitcoin without paying exhorbitant fees? And how do the receiver turn their bitcoin into fiat?
If either of you don't even have to worry about that, then you have removed most of the problems. As for your end, I assume you know how to get bitcoin or already have it. As for the Chinese end, it all depends if they would be fine with getting bitcoin instead of RMB. They might well be, you should at least ask.

That is quite honestly a stupid thing to say. A platform like Patreon does more than just accept money being sent. Various levels of membership for patrons etc. Also, most random youtubers or other content creators aren't (yet) aware of what the F to do with coins sent to a bitcoin address, or how to use it to pay their day to day bills.
Heck, most people even on this sub don't seem to understand how to use bitcoin more than HODL, sit back and wait for moon to happen, then cash out out to fiat to buy Lambo. How to you expect random "influencer" youtube kids to start using it as a foundation for their business?

Logically and ethically I agree with you, but you know what the counter-argument will be: "Well who knows what else bad stuff you might have done! Better safe than sorry, let's store the data just in case. After all, if you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide, eh!?". If there is an opportunity for a an organisation or entity to gain more power and more control, they *will* utilise that opportunity.

Platform like Patreon make it MUCH easier for supporters to support multiple creators from one fun and convenient hub, compared to having to go to each creator's (potentially shitty or unsecure) own website. 
When Sargon of Akkad got kicked off Patreon, and many Patreon users got pissed and unsubbed from Patreon, this cascaded to many other content creators as well. While this was bad in this case, it gos both ways, and normally, it goes the good way: What I mean is that this cascade proves that many many patrons support multiple creators. They almost certainly would not have supported if they had to visit each creator's own website, keeping track of many different subscriptions and so on.
This is 2018, and we will most likely never go back to the 1990s/early 00s style web before platforms and social media, where everyone had to have their own website as their main window. People are just way too used to being able to brows stuff from platforms. 
This is also why deplatforming is such a serious problem.

Gold parity would be ballpark 500k per bitcoin. I would expect slowdown of bitcoin exponential growth to happen somewhat before that point, because at that point the value of bitcoin becomes of global systemic importance. If bitcoin crashes 90% from 20k levels, that can still be ignored by world leaders. Today, if gold crashed 90%, that would either trigger or signal a major global financial collapse. If/when bitcoin reaches parity with gold, then world leaders will need to be deeply invested in bitcoin price stability, and would take measures to stablize the price before that. You can't have a 10 trillion dollar asset collapse 80-90%, nor can you have it balloon 8x, without this being treated as a significant world systemic problem. It would be top of the agenda of every single top level G20, G8, IMF, US, EU and China summit.

FYI: I still use it several times per week, which is more often than I use a credit card. So much easier to use than the credit card. Cash is good too, but only for physical stores. Very hard to buy stuff on the interwebs with cash. Bitcoin still sucks for physical stores, obviously. "Its use is non existant" is an absolutely delusional statement.

The main reason this is relevant is because JP is a high profile advocate for free speech and against censorship. Since censorship resistance is pretty much bitcoin's fundamental value proposition, putting these two phenomenons together is a potentially important event.
Bitcoiners: "Listen up everybody! Bitcoin is financial censorship resistance!"
Mainstream free speech advocates (MFSA): "uh... sure whatever... who cares. You bitcoiners stick to your drugs, okay? Now, for the rest of us - let's talk about censorship in Universities and Media, that's what matters!"
*MFSA gets financially censored*
MFSA: "Holy crap! We just got financially censored! Can you believe this shit!? How is this even possible! Is there nothing we can do!? Beg VISA and Mastercard nicely perhaps?"
Bitcoiners: "Well, like we said before, bitcoin is censo..."
MFSA: "Wait, bitcoin can do that? WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT BEFORE!?"
Bitcoiners: "..."
