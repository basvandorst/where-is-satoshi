I always have subtitles on, but otherwise, you're right.

Would have been better if it was filmed from the other side so he's not sitting in the driver's seat, but getting out of the passenger side.

Oh, I see. I always heard it sound like mount so I figure spelling it like that would be good, lol.

I have a coinbase wallet, it’s been a hassle connecting my bank account, though.

What’s the easiest way to get Bitcoin?
I have a Bitcoin wallet with nothing in it.
@_date: 2014-09-13 16:46:05
Thank you a lot! I’ll check out Localbitcoins!
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:49:11
Thank you very much!

What do you use to have a different address for every transaction?

I’m in the United States, and I remember the whole Mount Gox story.

Curious question, what is the B in the top left corner? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:20:59
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:18:43
They do?
I couldn't find anything, though I may be wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:59:29
THank you very much!

I'm not leaving Bitcoin though!
Just wanted to use what was in my wallet to buy something!
@_date: 2018-06-06 00:38:22
Thank you!

Are they SVG files?

What site/program are you using to track the price?
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:47:20
I'm 24 soon and I'm thinking of doing this.
About to move somewhere with my current job and get a pay raise. Might put the hourly difference in BTC.

Is there a page that updates with supported states?
Coinbase says that they're not ready for my state yet.
@_date: 2015-11-22 05:32:56
I just bought some from circle and got it in less than a minute.
Edit: Grammar.
@_date: 2015-11-20 22:21:37
Whenever I buy any amount of BTC, I'll buy it from Circle because it's instant and then just transfer it to Coinbase. 
THat way I don't have to wait for it if I were to buy it through Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-11-20 22:39:23
Too bad it's not available in my state yet. :C

I love this excel spreadsheet. Do you think you can PM me a template? 
@_date: 2015-02-14 14:51:25
I hope this happens. I think it would be great.
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:04:22
Eh, the price was the only thing I was really thinking about.
I don't know how to account for the others,
