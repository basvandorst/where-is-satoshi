Great ideas, and the possibilities are many.
You could even build a decentralized minecraft-style world where each cube of land was owned by a public key, and they can be traded for bitcoin.  Those who own the land can do a transaction to change the state of the cube (eg. make it stone, brick, dirt, etc).  So you could buy whole areas of land and then build your own structures and cities.  When a person is exploring the land, their software refers to the blockchain to obtain and render the state of the world.
Right now I just want to do step 1 which is to put together a team of enthusiasts so we can start getting organised and planning even some basic apps.

Once they accept ChangeTips, then we can focus on getting them to add bitcoin donations here:

They do accept donations, though.

I think that could work on a technical level.

Here is the raw data:

I can't seem to get Google Spreadsheets to produce a trend chart with a log scale.  As I posted to the other guy, maybe in the future I will convert this to a different graph library so that it can do log scale and other things.

Very nice!  It's also good to see that we appear to have the same figures for tx outs.
How are you working out the memory usage?  Did you patch your bitcoind?
I just realised that the UTXO set should probably exclude unspendable outputs like OP_RETURN.  I might modify my code to only count standard scripts like P2PKH, PKSH, P2P and see how the data looks then.

UTXO stands for "Unspent Transaction Outputs".
This data effectively shows how many "pieces" the existing bitcoins are broken into.  As you can see, that number is on a relentless rise and rarely ever drops.
I produced this data by iterating over each transaction in the blockchain, and increasing the utxo set size by the number of outputs, and decreasing the set size by the number of inputs, excluding coinbase inputs.
Personally I think this represents growing adoption and usage of the currency.

It's using the charting tool from Google Spreadsheets.  Doesn't look like I can do this unfortunately.  If I work on it more I will look at converting it to a more advanced charting library.
