So it is kind of like a bitcoin=credit-card transaction, because there is a guarantee of payment in BC, except this is not a private financial company, but a community of acceptance based on a verified code (so to speak) guaranteeing each transaction and an open sourced visibility where everything can be seen and ledgered, except that some transactions are node-to-node and opposed to universal, which speeds up the processing and adds a layer of privacy. Excuse me if my description is incorrect in any manner, as I am a newbie, but after reading the edifying posts, this is what I understand. Please correct me if I am wrong or need further guidance.

Any fiat is only as strong as the market forces that recognize it....BC is recognized, owned and used all over the world. It has value! As more and more use BC, it threatens the value of the dollar and other currencies. This is what is prompting tweets by Trump or those around him.

Why do you say that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:41:26
Limited number of bitcoins.....massive increase in consumers who want to invest....basic supply and demand economics.....everyone wants a piece, so they can say at their next cocktail party, I own BTC. Gaining more acceptance in the marketplace. Price will keeps rising. Remember when nobody understood the Internet!!!!

Keep trying passwords. I forgot the password for my safe. I kept trying and eventually got lucky. Somewhere in the back of my brain it rose to the surface. But I knew that I used some numbers. Not sure when you generated the password, but think back to that time, and what you might have used. Good luck...
PS: not familiar with Electrum...does it lock you out further if you try too many times?

Open an account with Gemini...educate yourself on Bitcoin. Read the posts here, absorb, listen and learn - read 
references and links, but also chuck the BS. Transfer a small amount of money into Gemini. Then buy a small quantity - preferably on a dip. If you buy now, barring Nation States interference, you probably won't go wrong over time.

Great insight and explanation. Much appreciated. I believe in BTC as a vital and independent form of currency for the future (free from the shackles of global states and corporations), once transactional scalability is achieved and it gains credence in the general population through sustained use and viability. Thanks again...
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:48:09
Does anyone know that actual percentage of the world-wide population that actually uses bitcoin for mercantile or business transactions?  And what is the source of the data?

Excuse my ignorance, but these transaction figures, are they independent of the buying and selling of BTC, or inclusive...?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:46:02
OK...I think I follow. So unless the transfer of BTC is recorded on the blockchain, it will not be recorded as a transaction. What I am trying to understand is, of the recorded transactions, how many are for mercantile transactions or purchase of goods, as opposed to just buying and selling BTC. I was trying to get a gauge on BTC, as a vibrant form of currency in the worldwide business marketplace. Thanks....
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:55:51
Does anyone have the number of daily-worldwide-transactions using bitcoin and the source of the data?
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:33:48
So if you sold 1 bitcoin and took a loss of 1,450.00, and used that loss to offset a 1,450.00 capital gain, if the gain was long term, you saved 290.00 if tax rate at 20%. If you buy back that same 1 bitcoin at the same price, you are standing in the same position but 290.00 richer. If bitcoin goes up 290.00, you saved nothing. If bitcoin goes down, you gain even more. Is this about the gist of it?
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:58:25

I tried coinbase...no me like. I use Gemini now and like the interface.  If you buy a lot, you should set up a paper or hardware wallet and transfer until you need to use the BC. Debit cards are usually faster that bank account transfers. But also compare transfer fees.....

It is anticipated that there will be transaction fees paid to miners. It will be about scalability and the increasing size of block chain transactions, which will theoretically reduce the number of transactions to be verified by miners. It will all be about keeping transaction fees affordable but high enough to keep miners on-board.

Speculators are being weeded out. BC will find its natural value...as its technology and use become more pervasive, understood and accepted, its value will rise. Speculators who got in late are being punished now for buying for the wrong reasons. As with AOL, years ago and other tech stocks, those that had the vision and were hodlers saw their investment go up over time. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:29:26
After a long day, your question definitely made me chuckle. Let me ask you this, if you purchased $20 worth of bitcoin, and it went way up the next day, would you still have $20 of bitcoin, or would it be positive of it's $20 value?

Good thought -  but you upload your driver's license and then upload photo taken with computer or mobile webcam....I guess they compare.

The license is valid. Just an old photo. It's the way it is done in NY. I am getting a updated photo....

Coinbase refuses to accept my valid driver's license. No ostensible reason, but that ID not acceptable. I suspect the issue is that the photo on my ID is from 15 years ago and bears no resemblance to me now. So I have to get an updated Driver's License with current photo, as my account is now locked. I have emailed them 2 times in the past 10 days. No response.
