Regardless of what anybody says, bitcoin is still a gamble.
It could continue to rise, it could absolutely crash in the next year or two and stay down as it becomes too financially intensive to mine anything and people start forgetting about it.
It's an exciting concept for sure but it's young and not without it's flaws. For instance, it is extremely volatile especially due to not having any "standard".
Long-term (so far) it has risen dramatically, yes, but there is absolutely no promise of this trend continuing in the future, or occurring again with the same strength as it did a few days ago.

Even if you didn't necessarily make a good investment here (so far anyway), you've at least got the right attitude: You can afford to lose it.

Believing that bitcoin is anything other than a gamble is a mistake.

until the government comes in, says "hey guys no bitcoins" and starts strong-arming people away.

Houses are a poor example though. For starters, unless you're massively incompetent, it's almost impossible to lose *all* of your money on a house. Whereas with bitcoin, it's entirely possible that in the future it could potentially drop to sub-dollar levels or swing way the fuck back up again. It's too young to tell what the long-term will look like.
Secondly, houses vs. bitcoin: Houses have utility. They serve a tangible purpose and value to people. Bitcoins do not; their value is based solely on what people are willing to buy or sell them for.
Thirdly: The smart money doesn't invest money they can't afford to lose. If you budget yourself properly then you will figure out how much money you will need on average for rent/food/utilities/bills/etc, and set that aside. The remainder is your investment money.
For instance: I make roughly 1800/mo. I need roughly 900-1k/mo to maintain my standard of living as far as food, gas, etc. goes. That other 800? I can afford to lose it. If it goes away, I don't suffer. I'm lucky currently to have low expenses but the example still stands, just wanted to put some numbers out there.
in short: the people who buy houses most do it as a place to live, the people who buy houses willy nilly as investments will still likely be okay if something happens anyway.
