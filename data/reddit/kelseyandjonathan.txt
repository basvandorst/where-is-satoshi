If nobody uses BTC, then where's the value in it?  Are you just holding it so you can sell it for fiat later?  Why would anyone buy it from you if nobody used it?
Eventually, if BTC is used, people will think, "That bag of chips cost 0.000159 btc."  Not, "That bag of chips costs $1."  Otherwise, what are you holding for?

I think it will be north of $65,000 a year from now.
Mass adoption is about to occur with Bakkt and ETF.  It will cause millions of dollars to flood into this market and increase the volume dramatically.

Fidelity is slated to open institutional trading in Q3 this year I think.  Bakt is beginning to on-board members right now but are still waiting for SEC and TD will probably begin trading in Q4, however is currently on-boarding members as well.
I think we will need to wait for Q4 to see any real explosion in trading volumes and $, but I truly think it will come by the end of the year.  And I think, realistically, a $45k-$55k valuation could be hit by the end of the year.

Censorship is when you suppress opinions that are not your own.
From Google itself:
the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.
"the regulation imposes censorship on all media"
What you are saying is comparable to someone burning books that they deem not suitable for you to read and you just say, "you can buy it from someone else." Or, "you can just re-write the book and keep it on your person at all times."
That does not mean that book is not being censored from you.
This is corporate censorship at its best.

I see a path for banking to be replaced. I do not see a path for capitalism to be replaced anytime soon. I’m open to suggestions though. I just have never found a better proven system to raise people up and give them a better quality of life.

Once again, no one is saying that Google is the only available service... but when a company offers a service and they purposefully only show you things they want you to see, that is textbook censorship.
Which is fine if you're going to some Leftist/Alt-Right source, but we should not expect this from Google.  At least we didn't used to expect it.... now we do.

We will see I guess then. Like I said, I will never blindly deny anything. I just want proof is all. 
Either way, we’re in for a wild ride in the coming decade. I think we can all agree on that much ;)

I Love capitalism. It’s the best proven mechanism ever, in the history of the world, for bringing people out of poverty.
And Google, as a private business, can do whatever they want. They should just be clear about their intentions so people aren’t deceived.

There is a huge difference between having ICE custody your BTC and having Coinbase do it.  Plus there are still more issues with exchanges and trading and pricing for institutions.  It's all falling into line now and this year we will see institutions flood crypto with $.
Like I said, just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:16:51
Because the infrastructure for them to buy and custody that BTC is coming online now.  Imagine institutions as an 18-wheeler tractor trailer.  All we had before were dirt roads and gravel roads and now with Fidelity/Bakt/TD/etc.... we are getting paved roads.  Just wait for the interstates and you'll see growth like you couldn't believe.
That's just my 2 cents.

Can you make something similar to this, but in a blue theme?

Go to Wengen, Switzerland.
I've traveled A LOT of places, but the people and scenery there cannot be beaten!  Take a train from Interlaken to Wengen and it'll be the most beautiful thing you've ever experienced in your life.  Promise.

This is an excellent way to think about this whole scenario.  I agree and have a similar plan.
