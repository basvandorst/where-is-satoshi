Well I humbly backtrack! 
As you noticed, I was of the original impression that permission was needed from yourselves to access the funds.  Even after carefully reading the article. 
I'm glad to understand your service better. Thank you for clarifying that for me. I think I'll take a closer look at what BitGo is offering!

I'm sure I spotted a Freudian slip in the article.  
"One key simply does provide enough security"
I like the idea of having control of my funds. I don't like relying on a 3rd party to release them to me. But of course I do understand I am not the type of entity this product/service is marketed to.

Which exchange were these dumped on? Probably prudent to set up a few low orders on that exchange to catch the any follow up big sells.

It's a few months ago now so I'm not certain, but I think it was Yamadi that I used. Bic also accepts bitcoin.

I think for most people, the cgt allowance is more than enough to cover the amount you are spending.
The alternative option of converting the btc to fiat on an exchange, and then sending this by international transfer to your bank account is a slow cumbersome and fee laden experience.

I think it is just them two. I got a bit carried away with my response I'm afraid.

Not in Japan. Quite a few major department stores will accept bitcoin for all varieties of consumer products. And when the payment is accepted with 0 confirmations, the experience is fast and straightforward. I used the Mycelium app to scan qr codes and made several purchases with ease. 
I expect that your country will start to accept crypto at points of sale alongside developments like contactless etc.
