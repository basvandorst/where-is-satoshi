On this note, will Chinese banks straight reject a wire transfer from an international bank that carries an account for an exchange?

BTCC Voucher now sold at retailers? VERY FUCKING AWESOME. HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN.

Exactly. In addition, share price is not an indicator of real intrinsic value, only the market value.

So anyone who puts an unfilled order on the books is a maker and will basically receive a credit for their trade once it's triggered? Whereas, anyone who's order is instantly filled will pay a fee? Is this right?

Do you feel, at the end of the day, that Chinese consumers will have an easy, over-the-counter (even if it's a virtual counter) way to buy these vouchers for the foreseeable future?

Personally, the most awesome benefit of being in the BTC scene at this point in time is that it's opened me up the world of finance, something I was previously ignorant of.

Not sure why these people are having problems. I withdrew coins on the 14th and they showed after an hour. 505e27d9f5ee5b0c2ab81a6a6335a8c2a439eac728896943c6c95f761cecca5d

I don't understand. I thought part of the Central Bank policy announcement was that banks weren't allow to accept transfers from BTC exchanges.

The question is, when you buy/mine a majority of these? I can't help but to speculate you were a very early investor.

I too thought I had hit a goldmine until I pumped a small amount of btc through what looked like a free money cycle, and what do you know, withdraw was blocked! What I don't understand is, once you realized you couldn't withdraw fiat, why didn't you pull your BTC out of Gox? Am I lead to believe you tested the arb opportunity with 550 BTC??

If we believe he has good intentions, then maybe he will swoop in to mitigate a crisis (a bailout?).

What other retails will carry these? Will it be as easy as walking into 7-11 and buying a card?

Well there are multiple reserve currencies held at any one time. I said USD dominance, not USD as some “first of its kind” monetary instrument. Why don’t _you_ do some research.

Loss of USD dominance will not be great for the world. Everyone has problems with US domestic policy, but historically there is more “peace” in the world than ever before. So you have to ask yourself if you want to replace one “Star Killer Base” with a bunch of “Death Stars”. The world won’t be pretty, but at least we can all technically be millionaires.
