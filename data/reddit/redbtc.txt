So, now advertisers are looking for a database of bitcoin users?

I dont see much to doubt the 10 years demand, bcoz in whois record I can seen the domain is registered till December, 2023 !!! My doubt is in the business model.

How about opening the eligius code so that those who want can run a pool for 0% fee ?

He has said in his site that he'll distribute the 10 BTC per 10 block sale. So he's not actually giving free bitcoin. He's distributing what he's earning. But my question in business model is why on earth he'll give away all BTC he may earn ? Where is his profit ?

U may read - [BIP 106 Proposal 2](

I think, this is misinterpretation. MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE does NOT define smallest block size. Smallest block size can be much smaller than MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE.
MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = Maximum block size without SegWit data
MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE = Maximum block size with SegWit data
Previously, there was no question of SegWit data. Hence, the new "max" block size is still capped at 1mb.

Fantastic tool. But, why only chrome extension? Please provide an URL to access a webpage from any browser.

In English or Chinese?

More than a year ago dynamic block size limit was suggested in BIP format - [Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap - BIP 106](
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:55:22


Why r u showing serialized block size? Check MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, which is now known as MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE...
    /** The maximum allowed size for a block excluding witness data, in bytes (network rule) */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000;

Please point me to the relevant line of the code on  where we can see 4mb.

Neither side of the community ever thoroughly discussed the best flex cap proposal so far, i.e. [Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap - BIP 106]( which was submitted more than a year ago. Both side of the community want proposal of their own people only.

Looks like the original code written by Satoshi to limit max cap to 1MB has been removed in the SegWit implementation!
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000;
Or am I missing something?

SegWit is NOT a raise in block size. Once accepted widely in the network, it raises network capacity, which is equivalent to raise in block size.

That's a good news. I thought Wikimedia predicted bitcoin network might not support their daily volume :p

How secure is it to use bitaddress.org &amp; coinb.in as those are my favorite address generator and online wallet respectively? Does the centralized ad push make any threat to the security of browser based bitcoin operation?

Does any ASIC-hard or ASIC-resistant or ASIC-hostile PoW algorithm really exist or it is just a matter of time for someone to arrange logic gates to transform any cryptographic algorithm into Application Specific Integrated Circuit?

Wherever you go in Australia, make sure Dr. Craig Wright is not involved. Because, after taking your money, he might say "I'm Sorry. I can not." ;)
