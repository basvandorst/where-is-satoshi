thanks guys!
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:46:13
worked it out! Thanks guys, was what you said, i entered into bitaddress.org and it gave me the uncompressed which worked
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:19:51
Thanks, but for there to be an issue I'd have had to gone elsewhere on the laptop to get any sort of infection. Opening up chrome &amp; going direct to Blockchain.info would mean that blockchain.info would need to be infected somehow to initiate some sort of exploit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:56:02
It could also have been some sort of attack during recent events since no one can explain to me why it would hit my wallet &amp; then 4 seconds later get sent to another wallet. 
Then when i run a test transaction again today it doesn't happen. Magic huh.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:07:15
This has happened to me, this is the third instance - would you be able to link me the posts youve seen regarding this matter?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:09:55
This is the only alternate conclusion I can come up with but why didn't this mornings trade get stolen? Why did it hit my wallet &amp; then leave my wallet 4 seconds later? Why didn't it empty the entire paper wallet? Why did my 0.10 BTC transaction clear fine?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:16:19
If they stole my paper wallet then there would be a lot more than 9 BTC missing.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:25:13
Yep I'd usually use bitcoin Core but I needed the coins urgently and didnt have time to wait 2 days to download the entire network.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:29:53
I know, I would usually do the transaction via a fresh Ubuntu install with Bitcoin Core on it but I didn't want to wait 2 days while it synced. 
You can go into the settings of a blockchain.info account and 'import a wallet' I imported the paper wallet &amp; entered the security key, entered the amount of BTC to import &amp; then used the dropdown box feature to select the blockchain.info account i was logged into. 
The money is then sent from the paper wallet into my blockchain.info wallet, then 4 seconds later it's sent to an unknown BTC address with an incredibly high transfer fee.

I'm a big supporter of BTC but this is exactly what's holding it back. Blockchain.info are happy to wash their hands of it and not even attempt to investigate &amp; if it was some sort of internal attack on their network they would never admit it unless there were thousands of people having the same issue as there is no possible way to recover the coins other than issuing a refund. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:15:57
Thanks for reaching out! Thats strange! I actually did have blockchain reach out to me because of the post but they've since gone cold! Really appreciate you contacting me though mate!
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:56:32
This was the first thing I checked. It was 100% blockchain.info - Manually entered into the browser.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:02:20
The trade was on November the 12th at 9:57 AM GMT - I just traded an additional 0.10 BTC from another paper wallet &amp; it wasn't stolen so it cannot possibly be malware unless someone has invented an airborn malware that can inject itself into my Windows 7 OEM CD and only activates on transactions above a certain amount....
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:59:54
So whats the alternative, sit and spam their non-existent support team who just paste the same 'try enabling 2FA' response? 
 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:57:09
You traded from a paper wallet into a fresh blockchain.info wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:58:17
I've transfered lots of bitcoin over the years &amp; know how to do it to avoid malware. The bitcoin landed in my wallet &amp; then left my wallet 4 seconds later, if it replaced the address it would go directly to their wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:24:52
Well I mean if the 0.10 BTC i transferred this morning on an alternate wallet got stolen then i'd agree.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:25:06
I'm just out at the min but I sent these time stamps in my ticket to Blockchain.info
Received Time	2017-11-12 09:57:39 - Received Bitcoin
Received Time	2017-11-12 09:57:44 - Unknown wallet received my $
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:13:27
It's a CD from when Windows 7 came out that has been used multiple times to re-build my BTC laptop.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:15:07
I'll post when I get home
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:31:37
Plot twist - coins returned. See original post for more info.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:19:48
Nah mate your missing the point. My aim of posting this here is to get Blockchain.info to actually look into this instead of just sending me a copy and paste email telling me to enable 2FA.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:25:34
Wasnt aware of this - ill take a look! Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:54:49
Nope it literally goes from my paper wallet to my blockchain.info wallet &amp; then 4 seconds later it goes to an 'unknown' wallet that isn't mine with an incredibly high transfer fee so it gets sent quick.
I've tried sending bitcoin since and that sent fine, from the same machine just different wallets. I'm 99% sure it's some sort of blockchain issue.
Blockchain email support said it was malware and they cant do anything.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:24:16
Nah you dont need a 2FA to send anything only to login.
I logged in as I usually do &amp; sent the 9 BTC from my paper wallet. The 9 BTC entered the wallet &amp; then left 4 seconds later. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:36:25
Regarding the post about bitcoin cash - That was posted an hour before the trade as I didnt want to trade 9 BTC out &amp; miss out on anything I could have claimed with it being such an old wallet.
The second post is in regards to a paper wallet that has no connection to this which only had a private key in Hex format which wouldn't work so I had to use bitaddress.org to get the Private key - PLEASE NOTE: This is another unrelated paper wallet.
I'll post the TX ID when I'm home

This fella has his tinfoilhat well and truly glued to his head
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:12:26
No I just removed 9 BTC from the paper wallet via importing the address into blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:02:24
To prove my point :)

Perhaps there is a legit on-going issue &amp; it's not all just tinfoil hat conspiracy theories that I'm somehow trying to discredit bitcoin &amp; bring it down. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:38:34
What are you talking about? You linked this post?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:33:25
I clearly didn't download it the generic way.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:47:34
I made the post regarding the 65,000 - Mine was different to this, I sent mine &amp; it actually transferred into my wallet but 4 seconds later i transfers to an unknown wallet address.
