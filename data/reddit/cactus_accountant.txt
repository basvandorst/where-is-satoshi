Bitcoin isn't doing anything that ethereum can't. And right now this hold up and high transaction fees are making me lose faith in it.
It has the big name, and infrastructure but cryptos are not main stream yet. If the fix keeps dragging on and cryptos become main steam shortly it'll be left behind to better structured coins.

My 2cents..... (just a dude on the Internet)
Smart money will slowly increase the price. Dumb money comes and goes after that quick gain, which is what we've seen, all the dumb money got out of the market....people got scared because they put in more than they're willing to lose. It's stabilizing now and I hope it continues to grow but not boom over the next couple months.
I'm hodling a little bit, but am a beliver in what it is.....I've set up with my employer to get paid a small portion of my pay into a phone wallet. Once they sort their fees shit out and I have a couple hundred in this wallet I'll start encouraging the regular places I go to to accept bitcoin.
My next motorbike is going to be purchased with bitcoin so that's a $9,000 reason for a motorcycle shop to accept bitcoin of they want that sale.
Hodl by all means, but also where possible try to help it grow. It the system doesn't get used than it won't have a purpose. Getting paid $100 per month in bitcoin for the odd coffee, lunch, beer, will do more for bitcoin than hodling will.

I like to consider myself a hodler. Been in the game for a month today, check the prices all the time.....update spreadsheet all the time.
Today I feel I've earn my sea legs, and haven't looked at the price for most of the afternoon.
Nothing like a good price drop to stop me from getting tied up in current prices.

Have too much and call it oil and the USA will invade you, over through your household government (spouse), set you up with a better government(more stable spouse) give you weapons and steal your resources/oil.
Sounds like a win? It hasn't helped the middle east.

I'm concerned that bitcoin doesn't look as attractive to buy with this uncertainty around the fork.
