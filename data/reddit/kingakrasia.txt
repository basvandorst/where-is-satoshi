Think about what *I* have done? The irony. Trump doesn't like reading, either, so if you are his "trainee" -- as you have self-identified -- then maybe you shouldve selected a different nickname, like TrumpSnowFlake or Illiterates4Trump? Just a suggestion. But it really doesn't change the facts you just highlighted yourself, that "pure gold is slightly reddish yellow in color...". Or copper-colored or orangeish, but not yellow alone. It does not run. Gold is *gold*!

Who cares? Artists, producers, film houses, and anyone else interested in accuracy when it comes to getting paid, to include, of course, banks, Google itself, and anyone else contractually involved in their streaming service. Transparency is only one among many positives. It really seems naive to me to think anyone can blindly trust Google analyitcs. Block chain removes a need for that very kind of blind trust. And scaling ultimately is a short-term challenge that will find an answer, like everything else in tech, through the evolution and advancement of the technology.

It continues to be a talking point, tying btc (or alt coins) to criminal enterprise, despite most guests highlighting the use of USD in the same (e.g., a recent Tom Lee interview comes to mind). I don't believe their editorial discretion, re: some of these recurring talking points, is by accident. It could serve as an educational opportunity, by choice, sure, but they nearly consistently play ignorant a little too well for me to believe otherwise.
