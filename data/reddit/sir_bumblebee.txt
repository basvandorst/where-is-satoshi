It was a really dirty country. Like they threw their trash everywhere. We were walking along the beach, which was full of trash and a colleague just stopped, walked over a trashbin and looked in it. I asked what the hell he was doing and his reply was: it's the cleanest thing around here. Take a look for yourself. Indeed they just left their shit on the ground instead of throwing it in the bin. The road from cassablanca to marrakesh was one big dump. People have no rules while driving. They just do something. They have a thing they call 'insalah' (don't know how it writes) or something like that. It means Gods will. So if you have an accident, it was Gods will. So why should I look out, because God planned this if you were to be in an accident.  Plus most of them tried to rip you off (taxidrivers, merchants,...) I know it's in their culture to negotiate, but once they see a foreigner, you can see the dollar marks in their eyes. Nope not my cup of tea. Although I heard different from other people, my experience was not positive.

Who was to blame the last economic meltdown because of real estate? Not the housing market, but the banks who lend way too much money to people who couldn't pay those amounts.

I've been there. Outside the holiday season. Lets say they will never see me there again.

So...does that matter now?

And to add about the banking issue: a lot of countries helped their banks by donating them money, to avoid bankruptcy. That had an effect on the currency.

True, and indeed crypto won't replace currency. But I'd rather have some sort of a safe haven, like the bitcoin idea (which indeed is not stable at the moment, but I expect it to be in the long future) to put my money in. Thing is, currency is only for a nation, while bitcoin is for the whole world. So if a country does not well, I'd rather have the option to invest in something that is not regulated and will better hold its value. But for now, indeed crypto is way to volatile. But it's also like you said, if it's a worldwide crisis, crypto will also suffer.
