Except you don't have to buy at the lowest point or "time" the market. In this illustration buying at any arbitrarily low point and selling higher will  ALWAYS return a higher rate of return over the same number of shares had you dollar cost averaged between those two arbitrary points.  In other words. If you can afford to buy 100 shares at a lower price then buy shares at that lower price. Don't buy one share every month for 100 months starting at that lower price.  
There's a reason why rich people keep their money longer and invest smarter than poor people who piddle it away month to month thinking their hedge will always net them a higher return than the supposed risk taker.

Except dollar cost averaging isn't the smartest way to invest. It's a hedge. A person investing 100 shares of anything at is lowest point and selling at it's highest point will ALWAYS make more money than the person who buys 100 shares 1 share at a time in the same time period.

You know part of obtaining a brokerage account is the experience/credit of the person using the brokerage account. Believe this or not the financial stability of the people who use a brokerage account effects everyone on the brokerage account.  Do you want someone with a gambling addiction, making long calls on a margin account? I don't.

That's right because if we give the world to peaceful drug users the world will be a better place. Sorry I seem to be having an aneurysm.  Because the systematic murder and torture of a race for a flawed ideology is comparable to people who lives would be a little better if society cared about them.  BTW folks the free market is both okay with the extermination of a race and the slow destruction of people's lives with drugs. So long as it is a choice folks!
