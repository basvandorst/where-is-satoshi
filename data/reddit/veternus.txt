This IS the early stages...

most likely this... if you have any abnormal transactions come in and HMRC don't get their cut.. her Majesties plod will beat down your door with stale crumpets...

It's not though, I am one of the people who sold at 11,600. I put in a leveraged short and made 0.2 BTC. I have now put that 0.2 BTC back into cold storage and taken that permanently off the market thus adding to scarcity.
Everytime a high reward low risk short or long presents itself I take it. The way I see it. The more BTC I can accumulate now the better.
So selling with the trend allowing me to profit both up and down just makes sense to me.

According to the stock/flow ratio, which has predicted the price of Bitcoin for the past 10 years to an amazing level of accuracy (google it). We're going to see a 1mil USD Bitcoin sometime around 2025, 10mil by 2028.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:28:08
Yes disappointing. It's only the best performing asset in the last 10 years. Terrible.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:31:11
Typically, people who put more money than they're comfortable loosing into speculative assets are the "get rich quick" type. So price swings in the wrong direction work them up.
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:00:21
So what you're saying is. I should set buy orders a stupidly low prices so that mr MD can dump to me and I can instantly 4x my portfolio? :D
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:03:45
In the UK derivatives trading is classified as gambling therefore it's tax free. Yay.
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:00:04
I shorted the shit out of bitcoin today and now HODL an extra 0.2 BTC as a result. Yay.
@_date: 2019-08-19 12:39:04
3.03 BTC GONE
That's awful. I wouldn't use a paper wallet for that amount of Bitcoin, ever. When you have potentially life changing amounts of Bitcoin you have to use a hardware wallet, no second choice.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:38:27
Well... if he hits me hard enough. Then by the time he asks me the second time how to access the BTC there's a large chance that I would have lost that information.
@_date: 2019-06-11 00:02:20
I'm moving in 3 weeks and the Mrs would kill me if I added another hole to the wall this close to our moving date... :/
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:01:00
No flex intended. But I guess it does come across a bit 'flexy'.
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:39:59
Obviously not. :)
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:43:57
I've already had 9 people message me and I've created a custom BTC paper wallet for all of them. If you want one too, DM me.

Probably pass the keys to my two daughters.

0.5 BTC puts you in the top 2% of all bitcoin holders globally. ��
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:34:43
I think he means "sticking ~$24,000 to your wall has very little upside". Lol. He's right.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:27:16
Why's that? Good luck getting my private key from a custom designed paper wallet that only I know the encryption key too.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:23:29
Solid advice. :)
@_date: 2019-06-11 08:09:26
I'm a graphic designer.
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:45:07
Someone could steal the whole picture, wallet and frame but they can't get the BTC without an encryption seed I designed into the paper wallet. Even if they got that, they can only obtain half of the private key (what's hidden in the image)...
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:35:51
Thar she blows!
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:33:25
Nice try, person who wants to hit me repeatedly for my private keys...
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:40:23
Come say hi ;)
@_date: 2019-06-08 08:14:53
Please go down I have a huge buy placed at 6600
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:39:40
Then I will be very sad.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:26:08
I'm turning that into a little red sticker and adding a tiny hammer next to it. This is genius.

Enjoy the 3 BTC my man!
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:39:59
You sir, are smart. The risks are very real! I will take additional measures to ensure myself and my funds are safe.
@_date: 2019-06-10 22:54:13
I'll happily build you one. Just DM me.
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:09:27
Until people are selling old abandoned reddit accounts in 100+ years because they have 99 dormant satoshis on them that are worth thousands of dollars. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:33:39
A friend of mine has a 'family pool' of BTC, they split the private key up into 4 parts and each family members owns a bit of the private key, all 4 of them need to agree to sell for any of them to have access to the funds as they're in cold storage. I thought it was a cool idea.
@_date: 2019-06-11 08:07:50
Nailed it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:51:07
This guy Bitcoins.

What's the point of owning a guitar once owned by Jimmi Hendrix if you can't play guitar and stick it on your wall?

Just Google 'bitcoin paper wallet' there's some decent ones out there, but please be safe and make sure they're legitimate ones.

My printer only does a minimum print run of 10 units. I can't get single ones done. I'll send you the print ready file and a link to where u can get them printed 'all you'll have to do is pay and upload your shipping details' send me a DM.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:43:27
Why on earth would you sell for a loss just 24 hrs after buying in? My god that's moronic.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:26:24
Yes, it's in big letters hidden somewhere on the image. If you zoom in enough you can steal all my bitcoin.

Yes, you would only need to wipe away your tears with $20 bills instead of $100 bills. You utter peasant.

Good point, if one of them ever topped it, that's game over for their stash. Maybe they have a contingency plan I don't know about :/

Exactly. I also feel that these people feel that they 'missed' the crypto boat. They haven't, they could literally buy now at $7k and probably see decent returns, so when the price does its usual correction after a big jump they feel justified to reassure themselves they made 'the right choice' to never buy into crypto and people like myself deserve the drops.
Jokes on them, I've been in since 2014.
