It didn't work? What happened?
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:34:27
How can someone honestly think "Hmm I'm gonna sit down in that casino and play my best to win lots of money" But I can see strategy fanatics sitting down and saying I think I can beat this guy and take his money! Lots more fun that way :P

I had originally intended to spend development time on a new game, namely line-tower wars - where players build mazes out of towers as opposed to just a set path. Something like that takes quite a lot of strategy and the game possibility space is far larger.
If you're up for it, I would love to get more regular suggestions from a gamer that knows what good game balance feels like.

Yeah.. looking into the logs. Looks like the server took a traffic spike. Will need to distribute to multiple servers, as one is not enough!

Will be sure to improve the registration experience. Right now it redirets to login after successful account creation.

Instructions would be a good idea, maybe a small guide.
Destroyer towers are planned to attack towers back - unsure about this still.
Upgrades are in progress, will take some effort to make them balanced.
Security measures - will have https soon, balances managed by bitcoin software, everything else is standard account mangement.
Yeah, skill-games are tough - they have to be tough to solve. Part of what makes this one hard to bot is that it's not turn based, and decisions depend on what other player does. Although certainly if one was dedicated enough, could code a program to calculate the best decision in every situation - would take a huge effort - better just play with the mouse :P

That's no good.
@_date: 2013-08-07 02:07:46
is anyone a js programmer?
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:31:53
It's back up. There is now a load-balancer to keep incoming traffic to something it an handle. Better to deny than escalate the problem by serving traffic that it cannot handle.
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:39:12
Hey that's actually a fantastic idea.
@_date: 2013-08-07 00:05:52
Already found and squashed 2 bugs :D Thanks everyone for helping out :) Feel free to suggest modifications, I know there's a lot to tweak.
@_date: 2013-08-07 00:28:42
so far one crash was due to a bug in the code. Hoping to find the limits to the server as more ppl get on.
@_date: 2013-08-06 23:14:17
Amazing, Haha

i checked into it.. the browsers don't support it, but I might be able to hack out Left/Right variations of each sound.
@_date: 2013-08-07 12:10:33
I'm a bit embarrassed to have missed this, but thank you for pointing this out. I will make no excuses and say that xss slipped my mind. I knew it wasnt perfect, however, which is why I did not want to launch it with real Bitcoins right away. A lesson was learned.

Is anyone having trouble creating a game/ seeing the game list?
@_date: 2013-08-07 12:45:39
good ideas.
does your tower not turn red when trying to place on prohibited ground?
@_date: 2013-08-19 19:56:06
Thought I'd share this memorable game screenshot
 taken by a player
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:09:30
A few updates for your gaming pleasure:
- games get autosaved, so if server crashes, you won't lose anything. GAmes get paused, will resume when both players are ready again.
- sessions persist so you don't need to log in again after a server update.
-a few game balance update, more to come.
- quite happy with the current balance, will perhaps make towers weaker/creeps stronger.

Thank you for your feedbak sir! I will make sure that the next update will be worth your while ;)
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:32:15
It should be back up now.
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:36:14
Thanks for your kind feedback. Relentless improvement from day one! :)
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:03:29
Thanks :) should be working now.
@_date: 2013-08-07 02:26:32
Sorry for that.. i had to restart the game to update and fix bugs. I hate doing it, but it's got to be done. Maybe ill figure out a better way to update in the future, without breaking people's games.
