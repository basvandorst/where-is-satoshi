Blockstream is a private for profit company.  Of course every action then do is for personal profit, this seems like a straight forward concept.


Having a better theoretical future solution for scaling is not comparable against another solution that exists now.  [Bitcoin transactions and blocksize already peaked]( about February 2016 (about 6 months ago).  Since no solution was available, since we are waiting for Blockstream magic and super awesome elegant best scaling solution to come out any day now, transactions and interest "bounced" off the top and is crippled for 6 months now.

It is possible, however the block size debate seems to be a huge point of contention and causing unproductive splintering in the community now.  I believe this strife is resulting in Bitcoin losing ground on its space in the cryto-universe.  Speculation is Blockstream is purposely crippling Bitcoin in order to build a system of payment layers which their company can directly profit from transactions.
For example, Ethereum has only been out for 1 year, and already has over 10% Bitcoin market cap, as people seem to be voting with their wallet.

It would be a different story if Blockstream had an operating SegWit model ready, and Roger Ver has their solution of bigger blocks, and we could let the community decide or figure it out and compare them with merits.  If SegWit is the more elegant solution then sure we can pick it and move forward a,d I am sure Mike Hearn and Roger Ver would understand that, since we are working as a team.
*Blockstream has nothing however.*  They have a promise written on a bar napkin.  If you want thoughtful development, then how can you say letting blocks be full coming up on *almost a year now* is acceptable?  Its the definition of opposite of thoughtful development, and they block other solution which was ready simply because they wanted to control the protocol and have the final say, which is very selfish.

Bitcoin will survive pretty much no matter what, unless RSA encryption is broken.  However the questions is whether Bitcoin can *thrive*.  I think the charts show that Bitcoin has been slowing down in growth, especially in the past 6 months where blocks are capped/full.


honestly Core could have simply ate some humble pie, adopted the proposed 2MB limit themselves, continue SegWit development and patch it in when finished.  I just don't get this mentality that if someone else has a good idea, you can't use it because you didn't come up with it yourself.
@_date: 2016-08-30 05:21:18


definitely seems vague.  To gain value from increased adoption and increasing Bitcoin value, it seems like simply "buying and holding" would be the straight forward path.  
For example, I see you guys received about $75M funding around February this year.  Price then is around $380.  The investment capital would have already given +52% ROI in only 6 months time from simply getting value from Bitcoin going up.
Under your plan, what is the time period for getting 52% ROI to investors?  5 years, 10 years with the "support and solutions opportunities" ?

Craig has a lot of evidence pointing towards his possibility of being Satoshi (like being on the cypherpunks mailing list way back when), and know/being friends with many of the early key players.  So, he is Satoshi much more likely so than the average redditor or average population.  In other words, if there was a top 20 list of possible Satoshis, he would probably be on it.  
However, of course he hasn't proved it yet so its just a likely possibility now that I don't think is disproven by him not providing a public signature.   theories:
* he is purposely trying to caus confusion to discredit himself and put attention elsewhere
* he is Satoshi, but for some reason doesn't have the keys easily accessible (think super cold storage somewhere)
* worked with team or group project on "team Satoshi"
I thought that the [Wei Dai Satoshi]( possibility is also real.

@_date: 2016-08-17 16:09:32
I appreciate your well written and thought out answer, however I have a few issues


Here you are saying the healthy state of the network is for blocks to be full.  I disagree with this point, Bitcoin as a payment network (which it was designed for), so not always run at full capacity, because of variations in spending patterns and behavior is not linear.
For example: lets say there are demand for 24,000 Bitcoin transactions per day.  So, you would say from your point of view that we need 1000 transactions per hour, then 6 blocks per hour, so we need our blocks to be able to handle a max of 166 transactions in size.
However, the problem here is that Bitcoin spending pattern is [curved throughout the day]( so, during daytime USA hours lots of people are shopping and spending a lot, and at night people are sleeping.  So at peak time in the day, you would not have 1000 transactions per hour, you may have 4000 transactions per hour.  With your model of max 166 transaction/10 minute blocks, then is a big problem as a payment network since there will be lots of congestion and traffic in the network at peak times.


Also, regarding this point, I did my own research and come to this conclusion.  For example, look at [Ethereum Price]( historical.  It only really started to gain a lot of traction about February of this year.  This is the exact time when the [Bitcoin network started capping out on full blocks](
So realistically, ETH as a "smart contract" platform is (right now at least) a joke and no different than any other alt-coin, despite this it was able to attract a lot of interest based on Bitcoin being maxxed out in capacity now and interest moving from Bitcoin to other places.

I think the block size limit definitely should be adjusted, especially in the short term since no other solutions exist.  However, side chain and the ideas presented here are good.  There really is no point to have your coffee transaction to be permanently on the BLockchain.  Also, with the same token, there is no reason your coffee purchase should take 1 hour to settle.  
Think in 5 years down the road, do you really need to have that coffee purchase immortalized on the blockchain ?  Also, other cryptos', like ETH have expanded functionality above Bitcoin.  Being able to integrate these into Bitcoin will help keep Bitcoin as the dominant coin.  Do we really need 30 crypto's to all be existing?  in that case it would be similar to EUR/ GBP/ JPY/USD fragmented system we have now, which was one of the points Bitcoin was moving away from.

I understand your point, however I do not believe this model fits this situation for a few reasons.
* There was literally code already in place to solve the issues at hand.  So people weren't yelling at core "Hey, you lazy basters work harder and make me some code because I am an entitled user!"  They were saying, "I have this solution already available that we can use, lets use it" which Core makes the decision not to use
* It seems inevitable that at some point in the future we will have block size increase.  So Core decision to not accept something ready is alienating a lot of Bitcoin developers and seems like an egotistical and selfing move.  Its like Core is taking Bitcoin development for themselves, and telling everyone else to fuck off.  Coupled this with the $75 Million company that now owns Core, and its definitely going to raise some eyebrows.
Bitcoin will survive long term, but it could be crippled short term and giving a opening for other alt coins to thrive and fill in weaknesses.

@_date: 2016-08-14 10:15:00


so what exactly do they need $80 million for?  The inability to have SegWit available before the blocks were full crippled scaling.  So Core doesn't seem to care about full blocks or limited transaction settlement enough to have a solution available when it is needed.  However, they also prevented other simple solutions to solve this that were ready to go, it seems simply because they were not the ones releasing it or it would make them look bad that they had to get outside help.  That's why Core is seen as egotistical and actually trying to hamstring Bitcoin to some, and just worrying about being in control for themselves.  Having a private for profit company behind decision this even makes it more dubious.  I think vast majority of people in Bitcoin space will say that blocks shouldn't be full, and network should be able to handle high transactions if needed.  As a payment network, imagine if Visa or Mastercard reached a transaction limit during Black Friday sales day (its a big shopping holiday in USA)?   Would you simply tell customers to go home, sorry they can't make their purchase because the network is over capacity?  This obviously seems crazy.  Even Core team is working on SegWit, which is said to be about 1.7MB block size equivalent, so they realize the need for this bigger network capacity.  However Core team was not prepared to have a release, so they either have low foresight and slow development (this problem was very predictable from years ago), or there is some malicious intent with Blockstream.  I don't know which one it is, but neither of them look good core Core.
Bitcoin has grown in the past several months, but I don't think anyone will say its because of full blocks or capped network transactions.  I think the best explanation is simple the halving event which is seen to lower the available supply of new Bitcoins created giving "investors" more perceived value.


SegWit looks exciting, imo the best solution would have been for Core to adopt 2MB blocksize increase last year, continue SegWit development, then patch SegWit when it is ready.

The opposite actually, centralized systems (like sidechains/database) do scale much better than trustless systems.  This is how Visa can easily process massive amounts of transactions each day around the world.
Increased block size will be needed for sure to some extent, but it certainly is not the end all be all solution.
It really comes down to, do you really need your coffee purchase this morning to be available forever on the blockchain?  I think the answer is clearly no here.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:37:47
They should have it grouped by "requester" also.  Bitfinex has a merchant account with them, so all their transactions should be linked somehow, so even it was 1000 x 120 BTC transactions, or 10000 x 12 BTC or 100000 x 1.2 BTC, there should have been a circuit breaker to trigger as part of any basic security program.

The biggest limiting issue right now I see is the 3 transaction per second limit.  
The second issue, is the splintering of the community, for example with [Mike Hearn](  Also Roger Ver and some others who used to contribute here, but now no longer want to.  This type of conflict is not seen as healthy, it seems very cutthroat.

off chain you mean alternative non-bitcoin cryptos?
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:12:29
The vast majority of blocks are full, and 3 transaction per second limit is max the network can handle.  Those are both true.
Many solutions exist already, however Blockstream vehemently opposes them even to the level of splintering the community and alienating long-standing members.
Ethereum is taking Bitcoins wind now because of this.

@_date: 2016-08-24 07:34:00
well, assuming that Bitcoin has use cases outside of DNM, which in reality now is just store of wealth/inflation hedge and remittance to lesser extent.  Monero I do not think has other purposes right now, besides wild speculation.

Lets say for example, VISA decides to run a Sidechain.  So anyone site where VISA is accepted now, would also include the option of sidechain Bitcoin payment.  This would expand Bitcoin payment compatibility dramatically around the world.

not true, the bannings were additionally done for anyone who advocated for bigger blocksize.  Bigger blocksize was consider "altcoin" thus prohibited from discussion as not related to Bitcoin.  Hence, several other subreddits being born.

Do I need to talk to Starbucks employees to find out what their owners goal is?  Sure, the employees may enjoy making coffee ... oh and that paycheck is pretty nice also.  The company's main goal is the earn a profit from investment, to earn shareholders money.  Same for any VC.  Their business timeline may be several years long, how is what they are developing today going to earn them a profit in 3 years?  This is the important question.
From that data you linked to me, ETH is showing strong steady traffic usage growrh especially since March of this year.  Comparison, Bitcoin today is currently where it was back in Dec 2015.  This is stagnation and its directly correlated to Blocks being full (although it would be impossible to prove this as the cause).  However all of our metrics tell us that Bitcoin success will be correlated with daily usage rate, so to cripple transaction seems either very stupid or willfully negligent.  Which one are you more comfortable believing?
@_date: 2016-08-23 06:33:23

Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol.  A private for-profit company exists simply to make the owners a profit, a return on investment if you will, by definition.
@_date: 2016-08-17 00:25:14


current Visa is settle in fiat around the world.  Having something similar settled in bitcoin could be very interesting.  Realistically, 1 hour confirmation time is not practical if you want a pure payment network not relying on any other sidechain.
@_date: 2016-08-31 11:26:36
wouldn't paypal work just fine for this application?
@_date: 2016-08-16 22:25:30
Centralization is inevitable, for example look at mining now.  It is centralized (everyone doesn't mine simply on their home pc like a purely decentralized network would have).
Also, there are some things Bitcoin can't do.  Right now, alt coins pop up that can fill their role.  For example, smart contracts "Ethereum" is a very popular one lately.  If Bitcoin could sidechain a smart contract chain, then it seems like people could just stick with Bitcoin, and not use other alt's.
In the future, also there are many other interesting use cases, that is not compatible with current bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:21:40

yes, a high % of Bitcoin "thefts" are actually inside jobs.  Look at Big Vern (Cryptsy), Mark Karpales (Mt Gox), Ryan Kennedy (Moolah), (Shapeshift), etc...
I guess having the big guys up top (or employees) stare at all these Bitcoins, eventually they realize it will take them a few decades to earn what is simply sitting there in the accounts, ripe for the taking.
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:56:59
If Monero gains popularity with DNM due to being harder to track, then this simply makes ALL Monero shady money.  In otherwords, all Monero transactions can be assumed to be DNM or tainted. 
So as far as the exchange goes, washing them for Bitcoin, it comes down to a centralized service doing the washing.  So, whether its a Bitcoin mixer or Poloniex it doesn't seem much different.
@_date: 2016-08-13 19:11:13

Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't a hard fork inevitable for bitcoin (even Core will agree on this even if it may be a few years in the future)?  So its just a matter of timing that is the issue, and whether it will be contentious ?
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:46:56
thats why the 20% discount given for Bitcoin.  They probably get tons of chargebacks from seized shipments.
Edit: A normal online business with low/no charge-back risk, could easily give 4% discount just from skipping credit card fees, but 20% is a pretty big discount I do not think should be expected from business for Bitcoin purchases.
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:52:57

These exchanges seem to brag a lot about "theft insurance," however what is their servers crashed and they had data loss?   Or they lose their key to unlock some accounts. It seems like there are a lot of possible scenarios that would result in you losing your bitcoin, that is not covered by insurance.
A real insurance policy would be something like FDIC, your Bitcoin is insured under all circumstances (except if you the user gets hacked somehow).

this would be pretty simple for them to implement since the Blockchain can provide proof of payment in case of dispute.  They would just have to add "bitcoin" transaction, which would include sending and receiving address, and amount.  There would be no disputes possible.
@_date: 2014-10-01 00:18:03
ok so that makes sense, this will help minimize Circle risk (if they were liable for chargebacks, then they would be out of biz pretty quick)
@_date: 2014-11-23 14:23:49

@_date: 2014-07-04 01:44:48
If bitcoin wants to succeed, it will eventually have to have some interface with consumer protection, which obviously comes with a % chance of fraud so we should expect this service to also take % to cover for this.
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:57:30
to get 51% then abuse some rules so they both benefit like stealing coins or double coins
@_date: 2014-08-29 01:42:52
the government could simply do a 51% attack, or alternately just bomb bitcoin mining facilities if it were to become a threat.

I don't think paypal will let you make huge purchases without having the balance ... unless you have a credit card on backup file with them which they will probably charge the credit card.
@_date: 2014-11-01 00:20:54
you mean people can buy bitcoins with paypal, but not sell?
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:45:59
could one of them slip code in for personal benefit?
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:18:36
Also wanted to verify this, someone sent me a message on reddit, which seems to be removed from my message history now?  (can't find it, means user was banned and message deleted?)
They said they would give me small amont of bitcoin, wanted my email address to verify.  I gave them a different email, not related to anything bitcoin.  Then today, I receive an email from "coindesk" advertizing btcmonetize.com scam site. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 07:18:21
I feel like its bad to have someone so entrenched in bitcoin politics to also be a moderator for this sub.  Moderators should be spending efforts on setting rules and improving the subreddit, which seems like there is a conflict of interested with someone with so much at stake businesswise who would most likely use their moderator ability to influence information/personal gain instead.
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:26:53
ok, so you still buy your groceries, car insurance, pizza, gas with fiat then.    If Bitcoin could move over to that market space, it would increase the possibilities greatly for its relevence and increase adoption. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:07:03
how did they bypass 2FA, if I may ask as to possibly help secure my wallet?
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:20:46
yeah, seems pretty uneven.  I think these big dogs are all thinking they will get rich of other people driving the price up, but unless bitcoin gains adoption then will be bag holders especially if the perception is that these big fish are ruling bitcoin and everyone else is just a pawn.  Because of this, I think the price will drop down to below mining cost for a while in the future until the pool evens out a bit (if it does)
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:23:26
Which payment processor are you using? I use Paypal and I believe a shipping number is good enough to provide proof, this is with eBay,. If you use a pure credit card processor they may be more difficult for you, is this the case?
@_date: 2014-10-08 01:18:51
yeah, basically anytime someone sells bitcoin with paypal its gunna be big fraud risk
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:48:00

I just don't understand why Bitcointalk forums needs at least a $1million dollar software rewrite?  Its a forum, what problems was he having that made him decide he needed to take this action?  Most of the biggest forums in the world run off PHP based software (VBulliten/phpbb), Bitcointalk.org doesn't even seem like a complex or popular forum in comparison.  
If Theymos wanted to integrate Bitcoin wallets directly into the forum software, and allow trading or sending money directly through that, then yes this would require a significant undertaking and yes, it might be wise to switch to Plone.  I don't know if this is even his point, and I don't know of any person who would trust their wallet private keys to a custom made forum software in the first place so this whole situation has a big question mark over it.  
Like I said its not my business but I certainly am not buying whatever story is trying to be fed here.

yeah, that would definitely seem likely, they would have to charge a % to soak up the risk, although it would likely be much less than the current credit card fees.  The problem is, Coinbase requires name, address, SSN, and a whole bunch of other information that I think Bitcoiners don;'t like to share.

I wasn't using it as an exchange, I just opened an account, did all the verification process, and make an order to purchase coins.  I am not a leverage player or trader at all, and never have been.  It was just a pure coin purchase and I didn't even get a chance to do anything since my order was cancelled (after they took my money), before they credited my account.  I have been watching the price and when it hit low $300's I decided to use that point to make my purchase as I figured it would be a good entrance

but I'm not even sure all the countries recognize Bitcoin as even property?  Its just bits after all on a computer somewhere, so theft would be considered just moving bits around, if a country doesn't officially recognize Bitcoin as property/currency.  I believe in the US they recently recognized it as property, and it is subject to capital gains tax I believe.

right, this would require paypal designing its own wallet system which would be a huge undertaking software wise.  Not to mention that a fraudulent person could just transfer their bitcoins out before paypal can 'take back' the funds.

The latest versions of SMF/phpBB/VBul are relatively safe.  Known exploits/bugs are found fairly quickly and patched by the ongoing developers that work on the projects.  Creating a whole new forum by scratch of UNTESTED SOFTWARE is magnitudes of scale more dangerous since it does not have the scale of stress or testing as popular platforms.  In addition exploits that do exist will likely not be found for a very long time because its custom software and allow would-be hackers to do much more damage than otherwise until discovered.  Is he going to continue to pay this team $1 million a year to maintain the forum and fix exploits as they arise?  Does any other site or company in the world spend $1million on simple forum software?
SMF already has had reputation system since 2008, and there are plenty of options out there.  You are quite mistaken if you think he is some master software expert by putting in a reputation system in SMF.
EDIT: Any Bitcoin user who uses their shared password on forums which is stored in plaintext as the same as their wallet password have already lost their bitcoins years ago by now.

wont there be a mandatory escrow requirement?  Bitcoin is irreversible so they may require you to have an existing paypal acct with bank backing, and limit amounts transfered.
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:41:08
you claim that PHPBB programmers (open source) are idiots, which is a Bold claim considering much of the bitcoin foundation is based on open source programming (is it possible to have good software without hiring a team 100k a month?).
Second, its just a forum and bitcointalk is not even nearly in the most busy/active forums traffic wise and complexity wise its extremely simple.  Its not like users need to have their private wallet keys to post a message on the forums, so why the drastic effort "for security" if you claim.  A forum does not require all this effort even if there was an increase in security, there is still no purpose.
If running a SMF makes someone a expert in forum software (lol?), then yes I am an expert also.   So this guy wants to recreate the wheel and go into the forum software business using Plone, ok thats fine but what does it have to do with Bitcoin or donations?
This whole situation makes 0 sense the way it is officially stated.  Even if plone has less security reported problems, its probably because no one uses it.

its simple, investors of Bitcoin, when the price goes down, feel like they have been lied to/mislead when they lose a lot of money.  So they don't share the "to the moon" attitude that people pump here, and act as a contrary opinion which could be considered as trolling.  So basically everyone who invested/bought Bitcoin in the past + year has lost money and could fall into this category.

I ordered a bit of moneys worth from coinbase last week, the price was around 308 and was supposed to go through today.   They took the money from my account, but just sent me a message saying they cancelled my order due to "safety and security."  So basically, if the price goes up after you buy, they won't honor your purchase.  That seems very not honorable to me!
edit: I was completely verified even with real life info.
@_date: 2014-12-24 11:53:02
I have a fully verified CB account, they have all my details, KTC legit, bank account legit same one I have had for 15 years.  Made a sample BTC order on the 18th @ $308, they told me to wait until the 24th to receive it.  Transfer was taken from my bank account, but I got this email today saying they cancelled the transfer for security reasons.  (oh yeah, and the price went up $34 since my order).  I don't mind losing money on investments I made, and I will admit fault when I make a bad decision, but this just seems dirty that they will refuse orders after taking my money and verifying me when most likely it was a financial loss for them since the price went up since my transfer.  Very disappointed with this extremely sketchy company will never use them again and this makes Bitcoin related companies looks really shady, especially since this one was one of the top names I figured they would be reputable!

not exactly.  SegWit fixes transaction malleability and quadratic hashing, the extra amount of effective blockspace is just a result.  ie: the goal of SegWit is not to increase capacity, its a protocol upgrade to streamline and fix some problems.

@_date: 2017-02-04 02:00:05


I specifically said I was presenting community arguments against SegWit  (which was requested of me, that they weren't necessarily my point of view or that I agreed with them).  Then you attack me and say I am parroting and lying, which seems pretty harsh.


That is a matter of your opinion, not an objective statement.  


One of my personal big problems with a lot of the pro SegWit arguments, coming from an objective standpoint, is they use lots of hypothetical conceptual future technologies as a reason that we need SegWit, yet none of them actually exist and cant' be tested.  Thus, it seems like a very weak argument that you are using for SegWit, based on something that doesn't exist and can't be tested as a reason we "must" do SegWit.  So basically its speculation on something you can't prove.   (and yes I know there is a Lightning white paper out, but it is still a speculative/unproven tech)
This comes off as really creepy to me, that people are trying to rush and force SegWit based on something that doesn't exist, why the hurry?  A rational argument says if you are going to use other technologies as your reason for needed SegWit, then they should be available already.


I talk to a lot of big blockers, honestly the main concern now is high fees and memory backlog which is hurting usability *today*.  Yes, Lightning/Schnoor/Mimblwimble and all these other future techs are very promising and some new technology will possibly guide the future of Bitcoin development, and that we should do our best to be prepared for that ... however its kind of head in the clouds argument, people think that Core is ignoring their issues today, also it doesn't help that pretty much most of the Core team has come out and said directly that they do not think the fees or transaction time is an issue at all.  I think this is a pretty big divide between the 2 camps now.    SegWit may offer a 1.7MB "effective block-size increase" now, however Core seems to be pretty staunch about not increasing the block size.  SegWit block size increase is actually an unintended consequence.

I am not just pulling this out of my read end :)
See here, [direct statement from Core dev's](


be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.


to handle its current capacity needs. I think the above sets out some
clear achievable milestones to continue to advance the art in Bitcoin
capacity while putting us in a good position for further improvement and

A SegWit transaction will be bigger than a normal transaction, when they are doing the same thing.
Also, the SegWit block weight discount will encourage bigger transaction size and more bloat since witness data is discounted 75%.
Some other arguments are that SegWit will create a large technical debt (excessive complexity), although I am not sure I consider this a good argument.
Some people dislike that it is being done as a SoftFork.
Also there is a SegWit spending vulnerability/attack where you can spend any SegWit transaction address.

This could make an interesting plug-in for Zen Cart of Magento or other ecommerce sites out there.   If you could reuse receive address it would make it even easier.
However for now you could just have people use cash/money order option, then get the invoice, and you eMail them your receive address and do it kind of manually.
Or you could use a Coinbase/Bitpay acct and just not convert it to fiat, there are existing plugins for that.

Are you talking about the SegWit effective blocksize increase that happens once SegWit activates, or an actual increase in the sense of blocksize increase that "big blockers" are pushing for? 
Basically the argument comes down to, SegWit provides an effective blocksize increase because of the extra signature data section being newly created on the block.  
However, Core will not provide a concrete time of vision of when (or how) they would want a blocksize increase.  In other words, Core wants to consider various options and has somewhat of a "wait and see approach" on the matter.  So, yes it is incorrect to say that Core will never support a blocksize increase, however they aren't giving a real tangible timeline on the issue and seem to be pending dynamic block size controls or some other restrictions that are yet to be developed.  
Also, *currently* Core does not support blocksize increase, most Core members currently see the fee/transaction log as fine and not an issue at all, and SegWit will handle this fine for the foreseeable future. If I were to estimate, based on the writings, Core is talking 3-6 years timeline on Blocksize increase.  I just bring this up in regards to HK agreement, which there was some talk of blocksize increase + SegWit around the same time.
Since they are kind of vague about the issue and reluctant to post official stances, because of the above mentioned "wait and see" approach I believe they are taking, I believe this is where a lot of confusion comes about (that they would never support blocksize increase).  Also LukeJr comments certainly do not help.

I am not talking technologically risky or impossible, the argument that is it disingenuous to "force feeding" this big SegWit change as a soft fork.  Since it is a significant change to bitcoin, a lot of people think it should be treated as a Hard Fork symbolically so its not just like upgrading a security patch or something minor.  So it is more of a symbolic idea that since its a big change that will change backwards compatibility, it should be ideologically done as HF so people can really vote on it.

I feel like they should have a dynamic algorithm, instead of us in 2015 "predicting" the future of Bitcoin size (as we know Bitcoiners tend to be overly optimistic of moon).  So the blocks should scale dynamically based on a host of factors instead of Gavin rubbing his magic 8 ball and deciding the future course of Bitcoin or some magic algorithm that may or may not predict Bitcoins growth.  If they over estimate and you have a multi-Gig block, and the network can't handle that yet, it seem problematic for confirmation times and possibly many other issues.

in order to BUY bitcoin, you have to go through bank like exchanges, with very strict identification information (SSN/address/phone/bank acct/credit card/etc).  The alternative is to buy from someone in person (with cash or something), but then you can possibly get scammed or robbed.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:19:50
more miners are entering, I would estimate the marings are MUCH higher than 1%, we just had a major asic seller switch to mining only (no longer selling).  They would not switch for under 10% margins I estimate.

Also, witness data does have a 75% weight discount, this is a fact Core developers will confirm.
Then you go on to talk about benefits of Schnorr/SA/MAST (and you left out lightning also?), however while yes SegWit will allow these future technologies to be possible, these can all also be done without SegWit (so I'm not sure this is a valid argument for SegWit?).
So basically the main arguments *for* SegWit, seem to be that it is available now and has been tested rigorously.  Also, it can be done as Soft Fork.

Trezor is almost 2 years old, if this company can sell a profitable Trezor duplicate for $30, even if Trezor had higher initial development costs, that should be more than recovered now and they could lower their costs to match this and still be profitable (but they aren't from what I have seen).   This implies that the cost of the actual Trezor hardware cost is probably between $10-20.

Some people here say miners want BU so they have gouge people on fees.  Now we have this poster suggesting miners want BU so they can charge *no* fees.  So which is it?
Either way, BU doesn't give an unlimited blocksize.  If say at some point in the future the blocksize is too big, and block reward is almost 0, then miners make no money from transaction.  So they can reduce the blocksize to start a fee market that would be appropriate.  
Raising 21M limit seems to be a deal breaker.

not exactly, the core blocksize will still be 1MB, however it adds an extra space on top of it for signature data, so total combined space will be higher than 1MB, but the core non-sig blocksize isn't changing (that required HF I believe).  Also, SegWit blocksize increase is a side-effect of separating signature data.

Either way, China has big bitcoin presence for 2 reasons.
1) Chips are manufactured there, so they can cut supply chain for cheapest electronic parts.  The same reason why every smartphone and electronic device is make in China.
2) China has cheap power, so the cost to run the equipment is low.  Also, lesser factor, cheap labor cost lowers staff cost needed to run facility.

yes there is, its the the block that current nodes see, and nodes that don't upgrade to SegWit will see 100% in the future, and its 1MB in size because that is the limit set some time ago.

This situation already does happen today.   Slower miner internet connection will have a slightly higher lag.  If you look at the historical transaction amount, we would probably be around 2MB block size for 2017 being fine, then with exponential growth 4MB in 2018.  So in reality having a slower internet connection is not too big a deal until maybe 5-10MB area, where the extra lag will be slightly more significant.  But in 3 years internet speed will also be increasing since internet speeds improve also.

So basically, LN is *potentially* a great new technology that will revolutionize transfers with Bitcoin, but you are betting all your cards on something that isn't ready yet.

Even with centralized hash power, the end user controls the price.  So if something bad is perceived to be happening, Bitcoin users will sell and drive the price down, the consumer always has a say regardless!
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:29:26
It just depends on use and organic growth of the network and users.  When transactions are under the block max cap (like they were up before 2016), then here is a limitless ceiling for new users and transactions.  However, once the ceiling is hit, price and confirmations skyrocket, so growth slows down.
So, with traditional historical growth, today 2MB would not even be good enough.  However, since for the past almost year, blocksize is near full, users are moving to alts (see Bitcoin record low market share), so I don't know if the projections for increases can be based on previous time periods.  We may have to adjust/reduce network/user growth to account for the "ceiling effect" we have seen.  So 2MB might actually be good for another year because of this.

People don't oppose SegWit because it allows LN, those people who don't support SegWit do not support it because the current Core/SegWit plan is to prevent on-chain scaling (besides the small SegWit bump) and rely *exclusively* on LN.  So you could say they are "betting the farm" on LN, and blocking onchain scaling as well.  This is the main problem people have, enabling second layer solution is great, but relying on it and forcing it is a bad choice, since we don't even know what problems or issues it may have, it could be a complete disaster.  
So just to be clear, Core leaders seems to be saying now "You will all use LN network because we are limiting on-chain scaling," which seems like they *don't* have confidence in LN that they need to create this situation where people are forced to use it.  Also, I should mention than LN is not even available now and we don't know what security problems/bugs/issues it will have.

@_date: 2017-03-01 13:36:04
no, the main non-witness block type will always be 1MB until there is HF, the same as it is currently.  All SegWit does in regard to blocksize, is add another witness block attached to this, which "can be 0-3MB in size" extra.  So total block size combined will be from 1-4MB, estimates on current conditions places it around 2MB.

So if you switch to keccak mining, that the new Bitcoin will basically have less hashrate than most altcoins.  Compared to current hashrate, it will probably be something like .1% being generous even after several months of buying new equipment.  
So you would eliminate one of Bitcoins main selling points and advantages, the massive hash rate that no other crypto can compare to.  So if you get rid of hash rate with POW change, then Bitcoin loses most of its first mover advantage.  I expect the price would also dump to sub $100.  All it would keep is the name recognition and exchange support.    I don't see Bitcoin ever really recovering from that fully, future miners will be hesitant to buy hashing power because of the threat of POW change so I don't see it growing as much.

you can use LN/test and develop it all you want on testnet.  Maybe its 1 year away, maybe its 3 years away.  
Scaling issues is more immediate than that.  Even with SegWit 2MB boost to onchain scaling, this may not even last a few months before blocks are full again with the historical growth patterns.
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:21:40


Old nodes who do not upgrade to SegWit will see 1MB blocks, the same 1MB blocks we have today and for the past long while (they will not see witness data).  That is how SW is able to give block size increase without a HF.  You are just trying to argue some silly semantics, but at the end of the day SW is backwards compatible with old nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:02:55
yeah and it could probably get a consensus with miners much easier.  I dont' think miners like to have to make tough decisions, they just want to wine and collect reward, and let other people develop.  However in this situation some feel forced to politically take a stance and try to convince others.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:00:11
If you switch POW, that means you will eliminate the 6+ years of network security that actually helped make Bitcoin the most secure crypto.  So you will basically have a brand new network with extremely little security, which means the market cap will no way be able to support current levels.  
Its a stupid idea that will make miner Billion$+ in investment be completely worthless.  If you want miners to quickly defend themselves and their massive investments, they will all switch to BU who is not threatening them.  This is the correct action to take if so.

@_date: 2017-03-22 13:03:08
sure, its a great technology.  I think all improvements that are possible for Bitcoin should be given their fair chance.  However, it seems like the current situation is "LN will 100% solve all our problems, therefore its the only option we are going to use and there are no other options for scaling."  Which to me seems very silly since its hardly tested/ready.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:27:41
Also, who decided for Core Dev that they must follow SegWit path, and no blocksize increase HF?  Did every Core developer equally come to this conclusion, or did a few leaders some up with it, and the rest of the developers implement the idea and follow because that is what they have done previously?
It seems like being a developer is a little different than doing the decision making process of how/when the network should scale.
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:12:28


how do they support development?
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:40:50
[Well its developed and in testing.](  Its not ready now for production/live deploy, but working through QA and testnet.  LN and Schnorr and other 2nd layer can work fine with this, and its the intention to release it when its ready.   BU people don't want to stop 2nd layer, they just want both options (on chain and 2nd layer).  So basically let the free market decides which new technology is successful.
I would say the subtle different with this and Core team, is Core seems to want to hurdle all transaction growth in the future to LN and 2nd layer.   So it seems like a centrally planned type setup for growth.

Maybe some miners may react as you expect, that they will continue to oppose BU, but some miners will retaliate against this threat.

this makes no sense.  If the miners wanted more fees, they would vote on nothing and restrict the blocksize to current 1MB forever.

If you give more power to the miners, that means you have to take away from from somewhere else.  So it seems like it is just shifting responsibilities from one place to another, I still don't see how this gives up decentralization.

Just a comment, Arther posted in chat a few months ago one of your videos "shitcoin" something on youtube, and he was saying how he really loved that video was one of his favorites.  He spoke with admiration of you and your video.  So I think you should take this as a compliment of him looking up to you and respecting you, I believe you misinterpreted it as an attack by them or them trying to sneakily rip off your content, which in reality I do not think it was.
If you really did not want your image to be associated or used by their newsletter, I am sure you could of just asked them and they would have issued an apology/retraction.  However it seems you are trying to make this your big payday and get thousands of dollars from them?
You can't take yourself that seriously to think an image of you would be worth that much.  Also you handled the situation poorly based on your chat logs, although I believe Arthur should have also issues an apology and removal if you requested (although no "monetary compensation" lol)

Jihan just *reposted* the article on his social media, he did not write it.  So, maybe he agrees with it, or maybe something else. As far as I have seen, everyone who I talked to who supports BU also does support LN/Second layer, they mostly want to use FlexTrans for malleability fix.  Fewer % also support SegWit + BU which would be like BitcoinEC, these people are more rare.  I can't say I've spoken to anyone who doesn't want any second layer solution at all.

What BU miner can do, is signal for blocks over 1MB, so they can choose to accept blocks over 1MB if they have the settings right.    As far as I know, they do not orphan blocks, but miners/nodes who do NOT run BU, will not be able to process the bigger blocks because of the old rules.  So there will be at least a temporary chain split, which may continue if old miners continue to mine 1MB block, or it may just end the miners decide to switch to join the biggest chain.

Well, technically miner can run any software they want, if you consider this voting.  I think Core now has technically the best quality development team right now compared to anything else.   However, this plan could backfire with what I think your intentions are.  Most miners are on the sideline now and not making any decisions about current scaling issues.  With this type of proposal "New BIP for block excess size/weight fraud proofs," its possible some neutral miners could see it as a way they are being forced to choose, and they could not like it.  
Maybe it will work, I am just suggesting that possibly it could have unintended consequences.  I think the better idea would be to improve your proposal to make more miners want it automatically.  There shouldn't be a war with miners/developer, it sets a bad mood, it should be team and group collaboration effort for mutual benefit.

its not suspension worthy if the users asks you to post the information, or it is already public knowledge.  Reddit admin just acted hastily without researching, then once they understood the situation they undid the suspension.  NULLC was following Reddit rules, although he did run close to the fine line.
I believe this was an attempt to get him permanently suspended, but a poor one.  If not, then certainly it was to try to frame him or attack him somehow by getting him to fall for the bait and buy the account (which he didn't do).

If the miners want miner controlled blocks, something like EC or even a temporary 4-8MB HF + SegWit, and get close to activation, Core could easily support that.  No need to call it quits for them if that happened.
Unless they are absolutely 100% done with Bitcoin because of this split, then they can quit development or work on something else.  Voluntary job.

A lot of people like to trash Roger Ver, and no one claims he has any significant computer science knowledge or abilities, but he did see the economic potentials early of Bitcoin and invested.  Rumor is he has a 300k coins bought pretty early on and he hodl'd.
I trust the hell out of Core Bitcoin team being the best at what they do, being amazing developers and computer science wiz, but the question here is not about computer science ability, its about how the network should scale.  You will get a different answer depending on who you ask and what their specialty is.  Most Bitcoin end user doesn't want high fee and long confirmation time.
I definitely see this "split" as bad thing for right now since we have invaluable members on both sides who we can't afford to lose.  I really wish they could come up with some compromise, like SegWit + EC and work together.

This is a brilliant move for Coinbase to seek partnership with Paypal.  If Paypal wanted to invest the research and resources, they could completely wipe out Coinbase since they already have banking and KYC/AML infrastructure in place.   For Coinbase to strike a deal with them, saving them the hassles and I'm sure giving good terms, makes it less likely for Paypal to do its own Bitcoin branch.
The only problem with BUYING bitcoin through paypal, obviously is that its irreversible transaction, which paypal's main business model doesn't accommodate to well.  Their best move, is to enable Paypal accounts in the future to be integrated with Coinbase, with high security in place to make things go both ways.

Well, I think a lot of good things the "SegWit/Core update" does do, (transaction malleability fix and quadratic hashing fix for example) does not rely on the Signature data be separated from the block.  So the "SegWit" update actually does a lot of things besides segregating the witness from the main block, many of them very useful and helpful I think most people would agree here.
The reason that the concept of separating the signature data from the main block was needed to be created, is to preserve the existing 1MB blocksize thus allowing a capacity increase on-chain without the need for a hardfork.  Creating the new witness merkle tree as an addition to the traditional "block" and attaching this extra information here, allows a capacity increase as a softfork, which is a pretty cool engineering feat.
The idea of getting this capacity increase, without needing to hardfork, is cool concept.  Core team probably knew the scaling issue was coming into play back in 2014/2015, came up with a plan to scale without needing hardfork, then added in the maleability and quadratic fixes.  They think the community wants scaling increase and to avoid hardfork, which SegWit accomplishes well.
I think the main debate now, with and Bitcoin Unlimited people, is they do want hardfork.  So, to them hard fork is ok.

@_date: 2017-01-06 21:07:44


It really depends on what you mean by "cost to the network."  For Blocksize perspective, it will artificially increase the blocksize (combined block+segwit space needed on chain) by encouraging people to use larger size transactions with heavy witness data to take advantage of fee/weight discount, compared to low serialized witness data transactions that have 4x the weight assigned which will be discouraged.
So this will create bigger overall Blockchain size increase faster which has negative consequences.  It may help out nodes which can prune this data on the otherhand which is what I believe you are referring to with the discount benefit.  So I do not think it is as quite a clear cut situation as you describe.

This is how Coinbase stays in business, a secret "extra profit" method used to increase the probability of them making profitable transactions, by cancelling a % of sell orders if the price drops after, and cancelling % of long orders if the price jumps after.  Happened to me last year when the price moved 8%, they cancelled my deposit for no reason, even though everything was 100% verified, used before and verified bank ACH transaction.
Circle didn't do shady stuff like this, and were not able to stay in business.  Then users eviscerated them as much as possible by trashing their app rating.

Would you leave a bad review for Wells Fargo app since they do not allow you to buy Bitcoin?  The negative review is pointless, because new customers who download the app will not be using it for Bitcoin, and the company purposely made the decision to remove Bitcoin (so its not like a bug that you need to warn them about).

Does this guy, who I assumed had quite extensive technical knowledge, really not understand that SegWit and "scaling bump" are one and the same thing?   SegWit allows for "on chain scaling" while keeping 1MB block size.  SegWit puts signature data in a new area attached to the 1MB block, preserving the 1MB block is what allows SegWit to a scaling solution as a softfork.  If he didn't want SegWit to be "scaling" its basically impossible to consistently make it 1MB equivalent, and would require a blocksize *decrease.*

maybe SegWit miners could just open a "donate" page, and people can send them donations directly if they feel they want to support that.  ViaBTC kind of did something similar, although they phrased it as "cloud mining," in the end it was just people who supported as a way to contribute.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:56:07
yes, high leveraged trading is a way for exchanges to make high leverage multiples of trading fees.  So in this case, people don't realize using high leverage results in massive fees (15% round trip to open and close), also you run the risk of easy liquidation, clawback or ADL.  
So the cards are definitely stacked in favor of "the house" which is the exchange in this case.
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:40:23


Then this would need to be a blocksize (true traditional block, not SegWit part) *decrease* and would also (I am not sure but think so) need hardfork.
So it would be like something 600KB traditional block, and 400KB segwit block for most normal transactions on todays standards.

This would be good news, for an immediate "sigh of relief" for network congestion.  Will give everyone some more time to absorb SegWit, flesh out critics, and come to consensus how we want to scale off chain in the future.

An unspent transaction is just a bitcoin address that hasn't been "spent" yet, meaning it is non-zero.  So my proposal I think would work since it accounts for all of these.  To spend an unspent transaction, all you need the owner to provide the private key signature proving ownership and the current balance.


It is, however the problem is with security making sure this isn't hacked/altered easy, since this would be a very profitable angle of attack.  However, it would be the same of security verification that is currently done everyday on the network.

@_date: 2016-12-05 22:08:25
Payment channel and lightning doesn't really seem viable to me.  Simply an offchain database (think like Paypal) I think is a very effective off chain solution.   So I transfer lets say $1000 worth of Bitcoin to my Paypal acct.  Then I can pay for things directly with paypal.  When I want to cash out, I simply withdrawal back to bitcoin.
Paypal = database, however it seems like having resolution/arbitration/chargeback capabilities is something consumers do want, hence people paying today in like 98% credit cards which have all those features.
Even is Paypal opens up dedicated Bitcoin accounts, (so no conversion needs to be done to fiat), then it would work similar to Coinbase.com person to person transfer.  However there could still be a fee for arbitration, I imagine it would be less than half the current amount CC vendors charge (3.5%) since Bitcoin can get rid of a lot of CC overhead and inefficiencies.
So think .5-1.5% transaction fee for buying thing, with instant transaction and arbitration, fraud protection, etc...

@_date: 2016-12-13 05:55:16
Maybe there should be some penalty.  For example, say the mempool is 3MB, and a miner only miners a 500KB block , the, if Total Block Size - Empty Space &gt; Mempool amount (meaning, miners skipped out transactions), the subtract block payout reward.  So in this case, 1MB - 500K = 500k empty space.  500k / 1MB = 50% empty, so block reward is reduced by 50% less.
Thus, miners are penalized for leaving partial empty blocks if mempool is full.
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:21:00
So SegWit actually makes it easier for spammers for clog the network at 4x the current rate, but doesn't help normal transactions that much?  xD
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:20:01
its not backwards compatible, it changes the whole block format forever.
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:42:09
nice tech, however I feel like it would be better for development, to leverage current smartphones with your platform.  Obviously you won't be able to make hardware that compares to latest smartphone tech, and everyone has smartphone anyways, which has NFC/Bluetooth/etc.
So, to be clear I think making hardware to compete with smartphone will be a losing battle.  Focus better on Nano S type device, and developing new smartphone security integration's, possibly using subscription app payment model instead of hardware physical device model.

If you were to do an objective poll, about whether confirmation time and fee is important or critical issue for Bitcoin user, I think you may find something different,... or maybe not.

no what?  In same country/zone (Euro for example), you can do affiliate payouts in EUR instantly and its 0 fee (friend/family).  Out of country zones paypal charges 1%.  Even if you mark the transaction as a payment, it will be about 3% paypal fee, also Paypal can convert instantly to any currency of any country essentially.
Also, Bitcoin payout will usually caus problems for affiliates due to converting Bitcoin to fiat is problematic (for example Circle closing, in US Coinbase would be only option, and they are painful to work with and it takes several days to credit your bank with ACH).

Well, to be honest, the time period he was looking at was after started just banning people for having different viewpoints (no "altcoin" discussion allowed), doesn't seem too unreasonable that maybe some of those people who were banned who could no longer speak in chat would simply downvote instead to voice their opinions.

I apologize, I wasn't trying to misrepresent or spread misinformation at all.  Maybe I read some opinions from developers who do not represent true Core vision, and possibly misinterpreted your statement here,
Based on your comment [here]( I thought it meant that SegWit was the only option you were considering about increase in main chain capacity. 
So upon reading the statement


soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability, and recent speedups
and incoming relay improvements make segwit a reasonable risk. BIP9
and segwit will also make further improvements easier and faster to
deploy. **We’ll continue to set the stage for non-bandwidth-increase-based
scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth
increases safer long term.** Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further
increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing
the groundwork to make them justifiable.
It appears that the official stance would be, SegWit first, then look at other bandwidth increased scaling in the future, where bandwidth increased scaling means increasing "main chain" capacity through some sort of block size increase mechanism.
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:36:46

Appeal to authority fallacy.  There is also a lot of people much smarter than me who do not want SegWit.  Also, 90% support is probably wrong. That is one of the downsides of censorship, maybe 95%+ of people in this sub support it, but you don't get an accurate view of the full picture because this sub isn't representative.  
Talk to me once SegWit hits 70% signalling support, so far the signalling isn't that impressive according to your "90% consensus"

The downside is, taking a system that is working fine for 6 years, then rewriting a large part of it.  Also, the block size is very full now and big backlog, so we need blocksize increase, which is one part of what SegWit does.  However, I feel it is dishonest and untrustworthy that you are forcing people who want/need bigger blocksize, to also be forced to accept SegWit as well as many other parts that are not related to blocksize.
So its like taking a kid and not giving him much food for several months so he is starving.  Then once he is very starving make him sign a contract for the rest of his life, they you will give him extra food but he has to join the army for life.   The kid will eventually sign it or die just to get more food, but that doesn't mean he wants to join the army for his whole life.
So I am saying, maybe SegWit is an ok plan for the future, but you should let people decide on its own merits, not by dishonest methods.
The better option is to give the kid food, then later you can give him the option to join the army, and then he can make the decision based on those facts.

maybe you weren't here for it last year, but Bitcoin implementations that would raise the blocksize were considered altcoins and forbidden to speak of in So anyone who wanted to discuss that went to other subreddits.  It is still the case today, however I think most of those people have learned not to post here about it now.

Actually incorrect, just a few days ago several core members confirmed with me that they don't plan to ever increase the block size.  They want everything to be done with LN/off chain and the 1MB block will be used for settlement.  SegWit changes block information a bit, so some of the data is stored out of block, which may appear to give "effective block size increase," but many of Core also have considered lowering the block size since they think it is too big already.

FTFY.  It means he can manipulate the market very easily and the price is vulnerable anytime he were to take any action.  Also, why?  Most people seem to be making up stories that he "lost" his private keys assuming he doesn't know how Bitcoin works or something.  The main reason I can see why, is people pretending that the first point doesn't exist.  Satoshi doesn't do anything, its not like he is CEO (implies actual work), he wrote something 6 years ago, and now expects the world to make him rich with their money while he literally does nothing?
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:59:14

It is exactly that.  There is a huge subsidy now, so everyone thinks they are getting "free internet transactions!!1."   However the system is being supported like a ponzi at the moment, Bitcoin needs more and more people to buy in due to inflationary pressure and so earlier adopters can simply maintain their value.  So the "steady" price you see is actually new people getting convinced to buy into Bitcoin, its inflationary pressure.  In other words, inflation is about 10% a year at the moment in the Bitcoin network.
Let me ask you this, if we eliminated the subsidy, would you pay $6 a transactions today to use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:24:52
Electrum wouldn't do this, the error has to be on your part, or just a misunderstanding somehow how it works.

if they are paying the fee, then anyone has equal access.  However, I believe nodes should have implementations if they are "full" (clogged). then to start rejecting tx with low fees until they are not full (like 50% full).  So it would be increasingly expensive for a spammer to run an attack.

You misunderstand.  SW is still activated with SF on NYA, so its not compatible with ASICBOOST.  So 2000 people are upvoting this topic even though Jihan activated SWSF which cancels out AB, and still trying to claim he is running AB.

This is just your personal preference.   Default behavior should be, if no change address is specified, that the "change" is sent back to the sending wallet.   You really think it makes sense that this money just gets destroyed, or lost or sent to some miner?  That's just sloppy programming.  Also, it doesn't change security at all, you can still trace back exactly the same from point to point a transaction because its all linked together, whether there is a separate change address or using the original address.

Miners main incentive is for Bitcoin value/price to go up, since they get paid in Bitcoin for block reward/fees.  Higher Bitcoin price, higher their income.
Small/full blocks reduces miner income, since it diverts traffic to other coins or prevents people from sending transaction.

@_date: 2017-04-27 06:05:06


Can you name a single example of this happening?


This is fully speculation about their motives.  Jihan supported SegWit + Blocksize increase in Bitcoin *just like he does on Litecoin* - which they passed SegWit now.  If Core wants SegWit, it would be such much easier to just release SegWit + 4-8MB HF, there wouldn't be BU discussion today if this happened.


And again, these are targeted arguments against an enemy, not logical discussions.  I doubt your team did the research on other miners or ASIC manufacturer, for example all current ASIC manufacturer may use ASICBOOST and also have remote control access to hardware.  No one is attacking Bitfury for this!  Because they support SegWit, so they won't be a victim to personal attack or DDOS attack.

Well, they had lost customer funds previously (I think they say it was hack also 1 year before, smaller scale), and they are a Bitcoin exchange, which obviously can be a target for theft.  Also, they worked with large specific security company for the sole purpose of increasing security and transparency.
As far as I can tell, most exchange "hacks" have actually been employees as far back as I can remember.  The idea of some "lone external hack3r who stole exchange money" is what the exchanges like you to think, but in almost all cases that I know of, you basically have the exchange owners and employees sitting all day starting at this gigantic pile of bitcoins that they know they can steal and "no one would fine out"
So they sit there all day thinking of ways to steal it and make it look like a "hack"
Also that Bitfinex gives 0 information and didn't contact government investigation says something.

I think things are moving a little too fast, lets wait for some actual proof and rebuttals before we get ahead of ourselves.  So far no proof has been offered.  Also, I doubt he extensively tested every ASIC miner on the market, so its possible many different companies all use the same trick.
I know nullc and Jihan are "at war" now, that's why I feel like this implication may be a little too preliminary and incomplete.  Also the fact that specific company names and actual evidence has been omitted seems a bit odd, he presents this situation as if he is a "concerned citizen" when we know in reality its cut-throat do-or-die with SegWit/BU now.  There are no favors or courtesies given.

Hong Kong agreement very clearly has [Hard Fork]( in it.
Even if nullc speaks for himself only, and not for anyone else, you still had an agreement that the vast majority of the miners/developers agreed to, so we could have SegWit today if they just followed through on SegWit + HF, because there was an agreement ready.  So why go against a nice solution that we can get consensus on?  Seems like some sort of power grab where people now think miners don't have a say?  Miner's best interest is with Bitcoin, because their income comes from Bitcoin value directly.

So the empty block = blocking the trucks from entering.  
Few questions.  Are you publicly sharing the reversed engineered evidence and proof that said company implements this?  Why aren't you naming the company or companies where this was found ?  Is it possible that every ASIC manufacturer uses asicboost, you only tested 1 unit but this doesn't mean other companies don't use it.  
I suspect you tested Jihan's unit since its pretty obvious there is a war going on, so if its true that they use it then there is no legal problem with revealing it publicly.  However if it wasn't true, coming out and saying so would have some legal consequences possibly.

Bitmain is the only (?) company that actually sells miner to other people.  So, to preserve the spirit of "competitive advantage" do you think it should be a requirement that *every* ASIC manufacturer also is forced to sell their equipment (lets say at equal cost to manufacture to further keep even playing field)?
Seems like Bitmain actually is the only miner trying to help decentralization in this regards.  Its a complex issue, I know the intention of this situation is to make Bitmain look bad just like you said, to get "users" to turn on them, and support SegWit, because some groups are in the middle of a "War" right now.  And the 2 sides are SegWit vs BU/bigger Block.  In the big picture I don't know if it makes sense, also there could be unintended consequences.  If its true that Bitmain all their chips use this boost, and 70% of the mining community uses it (maybe they don't even know it now), then you could paint yourself into a corner by threatening all those miners.  And what if Bitfury and BTCC China also uses it?
Its like when you are in a Tour De France, and decide to start testing some atheletes for "doping" it can unravel a big nest.  It could also make things very ugly with a UASF with a split chain.
@_date: 2017-04-30 07:57:00
Can you explain that more?  I don't see how bigger blocks will censor nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:00:19
Proof of what?  Superiority of SegWit?  Failure of BU?
Bitmain makes hardware, if you don't like it, you can modify the source code or simply not buy it.
Trying to use this as a way to discredit a scaling proposal that is associated with the mining pool that a separate part of the company also runs is a pretty far jump of logic.
The whole purpose of this is to discredit BU, and promote SegWit.  However logically its a pretty far jump.  If anything it will promote another hardware manufacturer to take market share of sales if customers do not trust Antminer/Bitmain hardware anymore.
Thats up to you to decide if you purchase mining equipment.

It helps to base argument and discussion on facts.  Lets say they did remotely kill or threaten a miner, that would be grounds for a big lawsuit, which would put them out of business for good!  Also, if they did something serious to disrupt the Bitcoin network, like kill 70% of hash rate, I do not think anyone would support them after this point.  At worst something careless could happen, like an exploit using Antbleed, but lets find out in a few days more about this, bitmain hasn't even responded yet.


I don't think blocksize is a problem that a lot of people make it out to be.  We have exponentially increase hashrate and growth in users (and lately price, however that can fluxuate), increasing network speeds, decreasing hardware and network costs.  Seems crazy that we are arguing over a few MB every 10 minutes.
Anyways, besides that point, about the people who "found it," even ignoring the targeted attack campaign against Bitmain, I considering myself a reasonable person.  Yes, if Bitmain is blocking SegWit because they only want to maintain ASICBOOSt advantage, I would agree that is a problem.  If Bitmain is shipping hardware with sloppy remote access features, yes we need to investigate into that.  However Bitmain is making a product that you have the option to buy, I think we need to use free market principles here, and if you don't like their business or products then buy elsewhere.    The problem is, other companies make ASIC secretly and for their own use only to mine.  Should we be getting mad at more companies that *don't* sell high quality ASIC hardware?  That seems crazy
Also, about Bitcoin network security issue and the Antbleed.  Maybe it can be a Bitcoin network problem, however it is being used as an attack against Bitmain.  Great branding/theatrics/releasing for a good show to try to cause maximum pain and damage to Bitmain.  Obviously, if security concerns were the main issue, the problem would not be addressed like a TMZ article.

The miners who are "blocking" SegWit want to activate BU, which can allow much bigger blocks than SegWit, or Classic which is 8MB block.  So, if miners really wanted to keep block small, they would support SegWit, or not support anything.


Right now, fee per block is about $2500, and block reward per block is 12.5BTC ($16,000).   So fees is only 13% of the revenue miners make, the block reward is still almost 8x more.   So block reward is miner main income source by far.


I am not talking about you making more money, I am talking about total miner revenue.  Miners get paid in Bitcoin, so yes as value of Bitcoin in $ increases, miners as a whole make more revenue.

there's proof of a hack!  Coins in addresses.  I don't think you stole anything Zane, afaik you were in remote location and just did customer service.  Also I don't think that Bitfinex company is going to evenly split all the stolen money between employees and "keep everyone secret."  But pretty much every exchange hack is inside job somehow, mostly its employees who stare at all this bitcoin all day, and think of how easy it would be that they could steal it and no one would know.  Do you think your boss or employee would tell you about it if he did take it?  How can you be sure they didn't take it or another employee at your company?
Employees/owner of the company are the most likely person to steal the fund based on history, and if it was an external hack, 100% someone just connect to your computer and orchestrate the whole thing, then that doesn't speak too highly of your security either.

Well, the correct thing to say should have been "Core supporters," not all of the core developers themselves.  There is a distinction, a developer is not automatically included into this group.
What I am talking about, is Core supporters who seem to be coordinated and very focused on trying to discredit Jihan/Bitmain as much as possible.  Is this an attack on someone, or a true statement?  Would you agree or disagree with this statement?
As far as I can tell that is not an attack, just an observation.  However, I will still take their argument at face value regardless of who or where it comes from.  About Antbleed, lets wait a few days, let some real security experts weight in, get a Bitmain response, and then see how the situation looks.

ok, so there is no proof and we shouldn't expect to see any.  The problem is, obviously nullc is  enemy for Jihan, so why would anyone just trust his word on this when he has so much to benefit?


About these other points, its really out of my comfortable level since it seems like a complex issue.  It seems like almost every mining pool does some empty blocks.
Also, you have no idea what % of ASIC are using this.  If its a big amount, besides just 1 company, then SegWit would break the mining pretty significantly.

SegWit + Blocksize increase would disable covert AB
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:48:58
If that was true, miners would set soft limits on blocks (like only mine 750kb or 500kb max blocks, to drive up fees.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:20:34
SegWit is pretty decent tech, however I think the problem for most people who dismiss it or are opposed to it, isn't the tech itself.  I think most people "oppose SegWit" its not about the technology, there are a few criticisms, but nothing too major.
People oppose SegWit, because choosing SegWit means no further blocksize increase (Core is stated on record that current high fee's are OK, and transaction delays are OK, LN will solve every possible problem in the future).  So SegWit may give 1.9MB blocksize increase, however the blocks are already full for almost a year now.  Even if we open SegWit now, we are going to have full blocks again in likely only a few months.  then its gunna be the same gridlock again with transactions and fees and more deadlock and bickering.  We should be able to solve this problem easily and before it came to be a serious issue (like it should have been solved over a year ago)
So by keeping blocks capped, it is forcing other alternatives to pick up the slack (for example LN, Scnorr, Altcoins).
Even Jihan/Bitmain signed onto Hong Kong agreement last year, which was SegWit + 2MB blocksize.  So, most people are "against SegWit" simply because its being pushed as a way to not increase the blocksize , and those people want bigger blocks and dont want to rely 100% on LN *which isn't even deployed yet.*

How do we find out when they will scale?  Can we at know at what point they think scaling is required, like $5 fees, $10 fees, $50 fees, $500 fee?  2 years, 10 years 50 years?

Core backed out of the Hong Kong agreement last year, which Jihan and most Chinese miners supported.  It was SegWit + 2MB hardfork blocksize increase.  So yes, Jihan supported SegWit last year, but later Core decided they didn't want to increase blocksize, so they cancelled the agreement and release SegWit only.  So, if $1 fee is not enough for Core to increase blocksize, what fee is needed where Core will agree to Blocksize increase HF?  You don't know, because they won't release that information.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:45:25
This is still a non-argument, since you can just say that Bitmain patent it, and then not using it to protect the network against abuse.  The fact that a mining company has a patent on something relating to mining is not out of ordinary.  
You are trying to also say that Bitmain is *using* ASICBOOSt to get unfair advantage, and blocks SegWit because of this.  This is not a statement that can be backed up with evidence.
@_date: 2017-04-27 03:50:54

@_date: 2017-04-27 08:22:01
true, but we have a microscope over Bitmain, but ignoring all the other companies in the ecosystem as if everything is perfectly OK with them, and Bitmain is only ones with a problem.  Gives false assumptions that others companies aren't using Asicboost, or have similar Antbleed functions
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:01:55
ok, so the issues is with propagation, bigger blocks like say 20MB block, may take 40 seconds to download, so miners have to wait for 40 sec extra out of 10 minutes block generation time, which would be about 6% longer time than 1MB block.  So does this mean that small miners will have slower internet speed because they are poorer?  Wouldn't this issue effect everyone equally.
I am just trying to understand, I heard a lot of different explanations about it, and I still don't understand the scenario exactly, so trying to find out.
I do understand the Node size problem, every full node has to download the FULL blockchain, and verify it before they can prune it.  So if Blockchain gets to 500GB, this will be a big setback for new users to run a node.
I am working on a solution to that!

OK, I understand that argument, but Jihan/Bitmain signed onto HK agreement which was SegWit + 2MB HF last year, and it seems like he is keeping up his side as far as I can tell.  Dev's decided to pull the "2MB HF" part and make it only SegWit, which then JIhan started to oppose.
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:42:15
I'll admit is a bad flaw in the design or incomplete implementation.  I don't think anyone will deny that.  Most likely careless/lazy mistake, people who do not like Antpool scaling politics will say its intentionally hostile.  Seems to already be fixed now in just a few hours with new builds ready.
However it doesn't change the scaling debate and is not related just because Bitmain is related to Antpool which doesn't signal SegWit currently.
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:38:58

@_date: 2017-04-21 20:02:38
You are making a mistake with your example, the engineers and scientists in your example are employed by the train companies.  Thus, they are just doing a job to their boss, and the boss/train company tells them the specification and they make it happen.   For example "we need a train to go here to here, carry this many people, go this fast, please make it happen."
In your scenario, you have the Bitcoin Core (open source) developers confused in their role as being employed by a parent company, unless you are referring to Blockstream as their boss giving the directions on how the network should be built?  If so, what the specification that Blockstream is allowing them to build?  Can you please clarify your stance and your example, there are still things that don't make sense.
Also, for every time you lose your temper and call someone stupid, it just makes it seems like you are frustrated or don't understand the issues well.  So my suggestion is to just try to stick to clear statements without attack people and your point will come across much better.
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:36:02


I don't.    Even if a MITM was able to exploit the Antminer and make miners stop, it seems like it would be pretty easy (changing 2 lines of port forwarding) to patch and quickly be up and running again?

So all miners are the enemy, or just ones with lots of hash rate, or just ones with lots of hash rate who disagree with you?
The problem is, mining relies on specialized equipment, which very few companies makes.  Most companies that make specialized ASIC, do not release them to the public, and just keep them for in-house mining.  If you can make a box that essentially prints money, then you have incentive to keep it yourself and use it ... which is what most ASIC manufacturers do.

I don't know, most people who had funds on Finex during the time of the "hack" ended up settling for 20-30% value right away, because that was the only option that was given to them.  So this is not Bitfinex paying back the 120k bitcoins they lost, they are paying back like 30,000 BTC value *at time time of the hack*, but since the price has doubled since the back, it would be about 15,000 with todays market value.  
So Bitfinex is actually paying back between 10-30% estimate of the lost value, and calling it "settled."  The customers are still taking most of the loss on this "hack,"  **Bitfinex did not pay back 120k bitcoin**

obviously they are spending a significant portion of their time trying to find any chinks in the armor or weak spot, which resulted in reverse engineering an ASIC.  However, nullc doesn't say which company made the ASIC, and doesn't provide any evidence of it either.
Thinking critically would say there are several reasons for not revealing the name, for example if he was not sure with the results or didn't have any results, then it could be considered libel to make a direct accusation.  He could at least reveal his data and information to give us more information, instead of just taking his word.  
I am pretty sure that if he *could* have called Bitcoin/Jihan out by name, he would have.  He isn't being a nice guy when its clear that his point of view that Jihan is trying to ruin Bitcoin by blocking his SegWit proposal and the obvious goal is to try to get the community turned against him.
About the actual issue, if it turns out to be true, I'm still not sure the implications if every ASIC that uses this becomes worthless, or it can be modified to just work "normally" without the boost with slight performance decrease.

yes, that is why hardware wallets use 24 seed backups, so in case your device is stolen or breaks, you have a backup.

The pattern has become very clear, there must be huge teams of people researching 24/7 on anything and everything to do with Jihan.
If you dont like his miners, or they have software you don't like, then dont buy them.  Maybe Bitfury will sell you some miners.
As far as I can tell, if you dont want this "antbleed" thing or whatever you can change 1 line in your host file and it will disable it.

SegWit is tested, mathematically it will be equivalent roughly 1.9MB of current block size based on today's average transaction type.  Seems like such a hassle to go through another scaling debate in 6 months again, this issue has been dragging on for almost 2 years now.

@_date: 2017-04-21 19:25:07


Witness data still needs to be in the block fully, and propagate over the network fully.  "SegWit" as a blocksize increase is true, its actually increasing the blocksize.  People around this sub like to use the word "Decentralization," saying smaller blocks are good, because it improves decentralization and fights mining cartels.  Bigger blocks, it is claimed, lead to centralization because of higher propagation times, which hurt smaller miners.
So SegWit is just data that needs to be transmitted, so it contributes to centralization just as much as non-witness data.     It is given a discount just because of the new block weighting system, which changes blocks to 4MB unit size, maintaining 1MB block for transaction data for softfork reason, and having up to 3MB extra space for Sig data (which will in every way contribute to "centralization").  SegWit is effective estimate 1.9MB blocksize increase based on current transactions.


You are still incorrect, because what you are trying to do, is just pick the group of core software developers, and claim they are the ultimate authority in Bitcoin (as if Bitcoin was just a computer science problem).  You can look at economic consensus, (miners and holders), and find quite the opposite.
Apparently you will pick any metric that agrees with your viewpoint, then disclaim anything else as being invalid.

right, thats because NYA.  NYA activated SegWit, and increased the blocksize to 2MB together.  The 2MB was delayed 3 months, but it is still linked to the plan.  If you abandon NYA, then you goto pre-NYA days, which SegWit had 30-40% support, not enough to activate.
Maybe you think UASF activated SegWit, well thats fine, in that case you can use UASF again and fork off 2x clients, preserving user choice, which core 0.15 software has and you can run now.
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:27:46

You can't provide a single piece of evidence that Antpool ever used it on mainnet, and then, Antpool agreed for HK agreement SegWit, then later NYA agreement SegWit.  Antpool activated SegWit for you which we have today.  I can't believe people would still try to use this as an argument.

False, Core can maintain lead by simply supporting 2x.  "unwilling to compromise" is funny.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:02:08
Lets call it for what it is.  Miners knew SegWit would not activate because it was unpopular.  2x was created as a compromise to unite communities and move forward, which worked to activate SW.
Lying just to get SegWit passed then switching before 2x activates is just that, lying to get your way.  Trying to say its a "circumstance change" is another lie.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:45:36


literally in your previous comment, you made the argument that UASF caused 2x, which led to SW activation.  So you are admitting that 2x was responsible for SW activation, but make an unprovable claim that it was forced by UASF hats.


I can prove my argument very easily.  SW needs 95% miner support to activate, it did so several weeks ago because of NYA miners signalling for the SegWit, which was led up to before with near 100% miner NYA agreement in blocks.  Its timestamped and dated in the blockchain, therefore proven.

@_date: 2017-10-25 09:26:29
This would only work (a bribe) for a few hours or until the bribe runs out.  After the bribe runs out, the network hash rate would return to normal.
Also, you have to factor in miners will consider long term incentives too.  If someone were just to bribe miners for 1 week even, but it would hurt the long term profitability (like for example, changing the total coin cap or inflation rate), then it would be something miners would have to consider.

@_date: 2017-10-03 14:59:08
I still agree that Coinbase should support both parts of the fork.  Bitcoin presplit = 1x + 2x after split. Ideally they would support trading and withdrawal of each one.  As for the naming, maybe they should just keep it 1x and 2x, until a "winner" appears.  I can't see to much of an argument outside of politics to keep BTC favoring one chain or the other.  So I agree the market should sort it out eventually..

it was actually Game Of Thrones, Season 7 which activated SegWit.  The time period matches up perfectly.
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:48:49
the fair way to distribute coins is to just split them, and then Bitcoin = 1x + 2x.  If Core is going to force a 1x split then the exchanges need to be able to deal with that, they will need to modify their backend systems to account for it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:34:28
Probably the best bet would just make 1 Bitcoin =  2x + 1x each.  So, Coinbase should prepare for both of them, support both of them, and both of them should be named something other than Bitcoin.  Eventually, once things solve themselves out, then that can be "Bitcoin" name.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:17:38
While this is true about SW security, this doesn't make sense for the fork, since 1x and 2x are both SegWit, so there won't be any difference.  it must be something else.

If you want to undo NYA, then to keep your dignity then you should undo both SegWit and 2MB, and start where you were before NYA.  Otherwise it just seems like you only want to honor part of NYA agreement, and not all of it.  So you take advantage of it when it helps you, then dump it out when it doesn't.
You should be able to activate SegWit again with UASF afterwards right?

You can solve transaction malleability without SegWit, it is already done in other implementation.  Separating witness data is mostly to keep 1MB blocksize, and adding in 3MB extra space, while being able to maintain softfork/1MB block.  The malleability fix is nice that does come with it, but other ways to do this also.

It can't be a payment method and still retain is current (high) value.   The cost per transaction is currently $8.  In otherwords, mining is currently way over inflated, so I think people are trying to reconcile this "gap," which is why we hear Bitcoin is not a payment network anymore.

[Linux is a perfect example](
the business model is to generate revenue off ancillary services and halo of products.  So what is that for Blockstream?  Payment channels/lighting, many people are speculating they are purposely guiding the design of SegWit so they can profit the most off it by providing lighting networks or whatever.
Or maybe that is all false, and they are developing the best bitcoin possible, I can accept that.  They really haven't been clear about their business model however, and most of that is behind closed doors anyways so its none of our business unless you are a shareholder.
Basically the only information we have is what we see, which is SegWit and there are some clues about that but its still speculation.

It remains to be seen how strong this ViaBTC pool is and if they will continue to block SegWit 95% threshold.  If they are firm, and continue to block, then it seems like there will have to start being compromises.

is SegWit being termed as safe scaling now?  It seems like they are completely rewriting the concept of blocks and nodes, separating signature out with new data structure on top of block size.

For them to be able to actually lock down their product, they need their product to be distinct from a Rasberry Pi, but right now it isn't.  So this will be a complex task (maybe some sort of error checker to make sure the bitcoin miner is attached and functioning and is 21 inc sourced or else the machine wont run).
However, they claim their machine is for developers, I can't think of a better way to piss off developers than making everything proprietary/locked down.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:10:32
Blockstream was not invited to the scaling solution?  I find that hard to believe.  If it really was a coup, then why are they even including SegWit at all, they could just skip that and jump straight to easy and simple blocksize increase.

each individual can, but exchanges can't.  They will have to offer "UASF-BTC" and "BTC" as 2 separate coins.


You just said 30% of the hash rate may signal UASF, that means the network will split 30/70 into 2 different chains.  Also, the difficulty adjustment will be really hard for UASF chain.

ASICBOOST is not even an issue for SegWit or why Blockstream wants SegWit.  Also it will be SegWit soft fork which is the same as current plant, its not SegWit Hard Fork (HF 2MB comes later within 6 months).  So its not different than other SegWit

Bullshit.  First off, even if you are assuming he does run ASICBOOST, which he doesn't, that would be 20% efficiency increase on electricty only.  Electricity is just 1 of many costs in a mining center and operation.  So in reality that would translate to under 5% "advantage."
Also, SegWit doesn't block or significantly slowdown covert ASICBOOST, so saying he opposes it becuase "muh advantage" is also wrong.

@_date: 2016-10-12 13:47:50


But isn't this a bit misleading, since SegWit creates the new signature data block, that technically isn't a "block" but sits next to them?  So the total size remains the same compared to other scaling solution, but its just a change of terminology that the signature no longer counts towards "block" size?  So you get the illusion of more transactions without increasing "block size," but this is just ignoring the signature data which will still be needed?

You realize SegWit is 30% signal, even assuming every SegWit miner decided to join UASF, thats still only 30%.  Which means 70% will be on the main Bitcoin chain.  Do you understand that part?
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:26:31
like when they stalled at XT and other big block proposal last year to "wait for SegWit" ?  Or was that Core?

If you read the proposal, you see Luuk injected his own small block proposal in it, reducing the total blocksize so the 2MB HF + SegWit isnt' 8MB total block.  So, he obviously has his own agenda here of trying to keep blocks as small as possible which is why he wanted to be the first to author an official proposal.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:15:48


He did speak on the old forums, when the time came "We can make blockszie = 2MB" or something like that

This is not all that bad in itself, however the way Coinbase does it, they approve your purchase, let your bank send the money, then after 5 days THEN they tell you "security concern, risk, blah blah" and cancel your order with an automated email.  I can't imagine a more hostile experience to go through with a company.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:08:00
lol, there were ready proposals (many) 2 years ago, Core stalled them so they could have "SegWit," which was just finally ready a few months ago (Novermber 2016).  SegWit is malleability fix, that also gives some extra block space.  Not a scaling solution!  The scaling "solution" that BLockstream/UASF/Core folks actually talk about is 2nd layer, SegWit only helps those other solutions which will be ready at some point in the future hopefully?  And will be effective and useful hopefully?

Lighting basically doesn't exist now, anyone can try to develop it if they want.   Maybe in 2-3 years if and when it becomes substantial, then doesn't that seem like a better chance to permanently change/alter the Bitcoin protocol instead of now?
Lighting doesn't exist, so how can you design SegWit to accurately facilitate it today?
@_date: 2015-10-01 21:01:43
is this 100 per day only? and is it 3% fee?
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:06:32
you are ignoring replay attack.  Also, I find it funny that you refuse to Hard Fork because its too dangerous to cause a chain split, yet UASF is exactly that a chain split.  So basically aren't you just saying, you don't want bigger blocks at all cost, and would chain split to prevent it?

cool as in, you lose your Bitcoins forever?  
2FA is different,  in our context it simply proves you have a cell phone or authenticating device in physicaly possession.  So a would be thief would have to hack your password and physically steal your authenticator in person to crack your account.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:13:31
So you support UASF hard fork, because you opposed other hard fork?  That's some highly questionable logic as well.
Also, SegWit UASF transactions can easily be spent by miners on the other chain, so I don't think you will see many serious transactions with SegWit if there are 2 chains.

There was XT, BIP100, Classic, they are all very stable and simple.
SegWit makes about 20 core changes to the bitcoin protocol, that's why it needs to be developed and tested over several years.  You can raise the blocksize very easy (like MAX_BLOCKSIZE = 4MB) in a few lines of code.
Very simply to do.  Core and Blockstream oppose this not because its not tested or easy to do, but they make up excuses like "too much size will clog nodes" and stuff like that, economic consequences.

I'm not sure if this is that dangerous.  The coins were stolen, therefore they are part of a crime.  So, if BTCE sold the coins, and they knew about the crime, then they could possibly be guilty of helping the criminals launder money.  So BTCE is protecting themselves a bit here.
Edit: Although the smarter thing would be to trace the money into bank accounts, then follow the bank accounts to the criminals without alerting them.

I don't really think Core has sufficiently provided an answer to the question "Why SegWit?"  Yes, there are some immediate problems like full blocks and malleability that SegWit addresses, but SegWit also is a dramatic rewriting of some of the core Bitcoin functionality and includes many other changes and rewrites which seem questionable.  Its like, if I was thristy and went to McDonlads and asked for a drink, and they said yeah but I have to buy the full combo meal as the only way to get the drink.
The given answers seem to be "second layer" scaling and "lighting" but these seem so far off and uncertain that it definitely seems questionable to commit to a permanent change NOW when we don't even have much information about how the future will be.   Maybe in 1-2 when we have more information of how scaling will work for the future of Bitcoin clearly, then making dramatic changes to the core Bitcoin protocol will be needed.  Doing it now just seems questionable and forced (I say forced because this is the only way to get any sort of block size increase now through this package deal).
@_date: 2016-05-22 04:52:07
thanks for reply.  I am not sure how much sense this makes though?  Your first part is basically saying, the more transactions on Bitcoin network, the larger the blockchain gets, and the arder it is to run a node and this clogs/stalls the network.  So more transactions hurts Bitcoin?

If paypal does a security review, they will ask to call to verify your phone number or send a text (automated), in more extreme cases they will ask for you to scan bank statement/ID.  However they will never deny you for no reason, and they will always give you a very clear list of steps you can do to fix the problem quickly.   With Coinbase you have to give "Coinbase Justin" a handjob and maybe he will approve your transfers.

basically, the current main backing of Bitcoin simply wants the price to go up.  Could care the least about anything else, would bend over backward for the government if they thought it would give a temporary increase in returns.  Heck, the security at Coinbase/Circle is multiple times the level of established bodies like Paypal, makes Paypal look like a pretty chill place actually.  The current leadership has the attitude of sucking up as much as possible to regulators.
Which begs the question, when will they start blacklisting coins, increasing maximum # of coins, reducing privacy, etc... hard-coding this into the protocol.  If Bitcoin leaders think it will make them a quick buck, pump up the price temporarily I wouldn't be surprised at all to see this coming soon.

I think I made my point clear earlier.  You double your chance if any hardware fail happens or theft, you are locked out of your own coins forever.  With your logic, 10 password multisig would be the safest way to store bitcoins, which seems pretty counterintuitive.

So you are saying because an altcoin did something, that there is demand?
@_date: 2016-05-04 01:29:41
not exactly.  if you were the worlds largest holder of Bitcoin, you wouldn't have to have the ability to spend those coins accessible.  So, it would be hidden or hard to find.  Also, someone could follow him to see where he is hiding the information.  So, its easier to say "at some point in the future I will release the coins" that way someone can't follow you and know you are holding the keys in a safety deposit box, or a lawyer, or a relatives location.

not exactly.  Craig Wright is doing all this, because he somehow knows it is impossible for "real Satoshi" to come out and easily disprove him.  She, he certainly has some inside information as to who Satoshi was (now deceased), or he himself was part of the team.
It would be much too brazen to claim to be Satoshi, when the real Satoshi is out there and could easily disprove it.  CW appears to care greatly about his self image (see Linkedin Page), so if he was totally lying, it would be a gamble at suicide.

UASF creates 2 independent chains by definition.  Do you understand it?  It forks off everyone who doesn't signal SegWit (which is 70% of the network).


UASF is protocol BIP148, any node or miner that runs it will enforce it.  70% of miners will continue as normal, its not a choice or an option, the UASF people are forking *themselves* off the chain.
I would suggest researching more about what it actually does.

You are completely deaf the whole time.  People who think Jihan oppose SegWit because of ASICBOOST are pretty clueless, since they don't use it on mainnet ever, and already supported SegWit last year.
They oppose SegWit because its too small a block increase to be a real scaling solution.

Doubtful, Bitpay/Coinbase/Circle bend over backwards to have exceeding regulation and compliance.   Coinbase even cancelled an account of a business I used to purchase from, because one of the other products they had available was a CBD type skin lotion (by the way, CBD is semi-legal in US now and you can buy directly off Amazon).

So is your solution, to send a transfer to Coinbase, wait 7 days, then have your friend open a Coinbase account, wait another 7 days?
Not to mention, Coinbase limits your account heavily for the first few months, so you would only likely be able to do $50 every few days.  So this wire transfer may take you several months to send the whole amount.
Also, you are claiming that the bank is charging you a 7.5% exchange rate fee, which in no world is possible.  Reality they charge ballpark 3% exchange rate.

This will be a long step, since Paypal offers buyer protection which is not possible with Bitcoin.  There are a few workarounds, however I think paypal being a gateway to facilitate Bitcoin trade would come before that (implementation: Buy/Sell Bitcoins on paypal for cash, input send and receive address, disputes can be solved by Blockchain proof of transaction).  The only issue is someone hacking a Paypal account, buying Bitcoin with stolen funds .. so there would probably be limits and possibly even several day escrow periods.

Ok, so the majority of the computer/hashing power is not used to actually solve or confirm transactions (3 per second max), rather its to solve this arbitrary math problem to compete for block reward.
Ok answer me this, once all the mining is done (or even at the next or next next halving), how do you expect the network to react to handle this?
I would expect that the hashing rate is WAYYYYY overkill right now than needed to actually process transactions, so probably 99.9% of the hash power is just to compete for the reward and not related to transactions?

The problem is, CC theory says CO2 is causing all these problems, so we need to declare war on CO2 (a clear odorless non-toxic gas).
So we have all major governments in the worlds spending hundreds of billions of dollars to fight a colorless odorless gas.  However, you seem to be mixing this in together with polluting oceans/waterways/killing species/toxic chemicals and environmental damage.  So they are separate issues, and this "war on carbon" is environmental resources that could be spent otherwise.  
Around the world there are starving kids and terrible poverty, toxic pollution, etc.  Climate Change folks think carbon is going to melt ice caps and essentially wipe out humanity in about 50 years.  Therefore whatever they say is the most important thing possible.  Earth ecosystem is much more complicated than we really understand now.

There are plenty of good things about Bitcoin, like ease of use, anyone can be a bank, sending international payments with low fee, "hack proof" (if done correctly) that do not have to do with the price.
If the price goes up because people like these features, and want to get in, then good!  However just encouraging people to buy Bitcoin to drive up the price, or to get increased return % on investment I think is a problematic strategy, because in down markets people feel lied to and will turn (into Buttcoiners).  If the price does drop to $500 again in the future, then everyone who saw this Billboard will be pretty sour.

@_date: 2016-07-28 21:31:56
ok, so in your example, you can get Bitcoin from a BTM close to you, and send it instantly.  It will still be about 6%-10% fee for the exchange.  Western Union would have service that costs similar.
Also, the thread title clearly states "large payment"

That's what censorship does, and why it is largely ineffective.

Even if they accept and spend Bitcoin directly, this doesn't factor in that the sending company has to open a Coinbase acct (if they don't have one), go through examination/verification, then wire Coinbase money (which I believe takes them 7 days to arrive?)

technically, miners can activate SegWit and refuse to mine SW transactions, also users can refuse to make SW transactions.  I guess we will see.

I am also pretty sure ASICBOOST isn't being used by Antminer at all, and ANTBLEED is a simple fix with software patch and not a "miner backdoor" which you folks here ate hook, line and sinker.
So if Jihan doesn't run BU, why does he signal for it?  He wants higher fees you may say, but Antpool does SPV mining, and has some empty blocks (so they collect 0 extra from fees, only block reward).
You can see LukeJR actual poll here that he made, look at the results
Most "users" and businesses want lower fees and quicker confirmation time.  That is the main issue that is important today.    People don't care about quadratic hashing fix or malleability.  Core just astroturfs really hard and forces people to accept SegWit, but most business just want Bitcoin to "work" and just trust Core to do the right thing without really looking over the details.  Blockstream is now using the "hostage" of congested blocks and high fees to force SegWit into the ecosystem as the only possible way to scale, refusing anything else, so people who support it will do so because they just want some relief to the current terrible situation with the state of Bitcoin.
They have squandered their leadership position as lead maintainers of Bitcoin in order to force unpopular project, hold Bitcoin hostage and now Bitcoin is in bad shape because of it, and they will soon lose that privledge with UAFH/SegWit2x.  Those Core developers who were silent or did not try to listen to the community or compromise will lose some credibility now as the main implementation is being handed over to jgarzic.   
Unless you think UASF will succeed, this will be the last hope, however it will probably require a POW change which I don't see really happening or going anywhere.

I understand how it works, it creates a trust/banking network like you described.  Will be pretty useless for single payment transactions and requires *trust*.  


LN can run on BU and other implementations, so its not a good argument against increasing blocksize or for activating SegWit.  The only reason you would want to keep blocksize small is to *force* transactions off blockchain, thus dictating to people "you must use this type of channel or payment type because I am the central planner and I say so"


I can like LN and still run BU, and LN can run on BU fine.  I think any implementation or upgrade should be able to run and whether its effective or not doesn't really effect the argument.  If its success and useful then people will use it, and if its not then they won't use it.  However LN is still very far off, and just theory/ideas.  It makes little sense to base your entire strategy of blocksize restriction and upgrade path based on tech that isn't even ready yet?  I think thats jumping the gun.  BU says that if people want to use LN they can, and if they want to do on-chain txn they can.  If LN really can offer something good then it will succeed on its own merit. 


I'm waiting for someone to prove me wrong or provide new info, but not making very good progress on that.

going on your logic, activating SegWit will remove AB which no doubt you are convinced Jihan uses.  So how does SegWit2x preserve their profit?

you mean the scam that Barry Silbert, BitFury, BTCC are also pushing?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:32:21
1) SegWit doesn't block ASICBOOST, you need a separate fix on top of SegWit to stop covert AB.
2) You can offer 0 proof, and 0 proof points to them actually using it on mainnet.  Bitmain already stated they don't use it in production.  Evidence shows they do not use it.
3) Just like Antbleed is claimed to be malicious backdoor, which is basically a non-issue and was already patched in 5 hours.
Your only real argument against big block, is some argument about blocks being too big and causing bloat or using too much bandwidth, however there are other solutions coming that would make these not too big a problem, as well as technology improvement with time.

RIP ASICBOOST failed argument
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:00:42


source ?  pretty sure most Core leader are "never big blocker"


Bitcoin is always improving protocol.  Fact is, SegWit accomplished a few things, at a big cost and is sloppily done.  If there were other options on the table for quadratic hashing fix and malleability, then possibly SegWit would be canned completely.
Also, why don't you support the option of SegWit + 2MB HF combined in one?  This would guarantee segwit implementation and have bigger block to make Jihan crew happy.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:31:32
i dont understand what that means?
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:49:02
Jihan is supporting SegWit2x, which is SegWit SF which will "kill his ASICBOOST" correct?

not really a lie, miners are supporting SegWit (and also 2MB HF)
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:37:56
The community have been trying to get bigger blocks for 3 years now.  In case you are new, Core has been stalling this entire time.  Finally, SegWit is ready 6 months ago, but they removed 2MB HF Block Size agreement, and you think its justified to make the rational argument that *other people* are blocking scaling now?  Very dishonest.
SegWit is not a significant scaling improvement, even if it gives 2MB block equivalent for transactions, Bitcoin has been growing exponentially.  Its a fact that many top Core dev's see no problem with massive fees and congestion.  They honestly do not think its a problem.  But quadratic scaling which won't even be a problem for maybe a decade is extremely important to fix now, immediately right away.  Their values are not in line with the community or users.

when did they fool you before?
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:31:03
Here is where that conspiracy theory logically fails


Jihan wanted BU, which would allow miners to control blocksize from this point on through signalling methods, so essentially lets miners control and increase the blocksize as needed.
What they "Settled" for, with SegWit2x, is nothing close to what they wanted.  SegWit2x, assuming 2MB HF is blocked and protested by Core after, is SegWitSF which blocks "muh ASICBOOST."  So why would they concede this , all for a few months of higher fees, which many times they didn't even collect because they mine SPV/empty blocks?  Notice how Core is getting exactly what they wanted, SegWit full activation as SF?


We all know that Blockstream/Core is the main ones who abuse Social Media and create hostile environment ( are all mass hysteria hype), Bitmain doesn't do that type of attack.  At most they have which has public moderation logs and is for open discussion.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:08:08
Define contentious?  Yes, it can do a lot of damage, however most likely UASF will do no damage, since it will just be a few people forking themselves off into the wilderness.
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:46:47
basically the exact same worded announcement coordinated.  Notice how they say they support SegWit , but not 2MB HF?  Its clearly they are setting up just to rename SegWit to SegWit2x and ignore HF part.  The whole part of SegWit2x is a *compromise* between big blockers and SegWit, however their wording is no compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:19:22
yes, its true that users and devs may be unhappy, and can leave the Bitcoin ecosystem.  You can see the gigantic rise of alt/cryptos as example of this

Its unlikely UASF will ever get anywhere, its just being used as a "threat" but only people actually buy into it.  If BIP148 did happen, and BU activates on legacy chain, then all miners on legacy chain would be forced to upgrade to BU compatible client (to accept the bigger blocks).
Since everyone would be upgrading anyways, wipeout protections would be pretty simple to implement.  So this scenario in real world won't play out like UASF'ers think it will.  Also, for UASF to get longer chain, then it would need a majority of miners/hash rate.  Then, in that case, it would be valid if gets more hash rate than other chain, then most miners support it so it should reorg (that is OK, its how Bitcoin works)
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:33:30
I mean, says I encrypt my BIP32 key pair with "password" then wouldn't that be vulnerable to a brute force attack?   ie: BIP32 isn't in itself immune from Brute force, but it allows you to make brute force basically impossible (in the example you gave, by using 8192 bytes of random data) by selecting a sufficient complex password
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:59:20


actually no, they supported Blocksize increase , then kept lowering and lowering the threshold, then finally they do not want any blocksize increase.


F2Pool has been signalling SegWit for months now, are you serious?


thats because Bitcoin lost its market share.  Its rational consumer behavior which you most likely will refuse to understand.


LN won't solve many problems, what use cases actually require an open 2 way channel for payments?  Maybe payments between exchanges or something of that nature.   I'd love to hear you answer that.  You have just been sold a shiny box and don't know whats inside.


bad faith or incompetence, I don't really think either one is better in this circumstance.

@_date: 2017-06-08 09:04:51
you support BU also correct?
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:31:06
fact.  Say UASF manages to get every SegWit miner, and signals 30%.  That will leave other network with a large BU majority, so bigger blocks will activate on the bigger network.   UASF wont be able to reorg that later.   Say UASF gets a lot less than 30%, then block delay will be too long, probably will never make it past a few days.
Only way UASF wins, is if it gets majority hash power.  Thats how Bitcoin works!

It's hard to take you serious since you seem to have lost critical thought, so Jihan and 1 friend own 50-60% hash power, yet BU signals 40% , why is that?  Jihan could have easily forked with 60% hash power already.
Couldn't I just say Blockstream owns 30% SegWit activation support, because SegWit gets 30% hash rate support?  How does your logic work for valid arguments and non-valid.


just lol.  How many Twitter users support BIP141?  1 like = 1 hash power?

BIP148 nodes would reject larger BU blocks, so I doubt they would reabsorb BU chain if the longest chain risk would possibly become an issue.   It would be very simple, BU could make their own UASF code rejecting SegWit chain, just like UASF rejected non-Segwit blocks.
