Seems like a good use case for an cryptocurrency escrow service.

This line of thought makes a lot of assumptions. And aside from that, your conclusion is to never hold... so apparently there is no such thing as hedging your bets either. 
If you think it's going up then buy more, if you think it's going down then sell, if you think it's going to be stable then sell? 
Seems like a recipe for going broke to me. That said, if it works for you then who am I to judge.

A lot of fud in that piece. The author has no idea what cryptocurrency and the blockchain are even all about or why the value went up so quickly. The piece is just opinion and uneducated speculation (at least in regard to crypto. 
“Just look at how bitcoin prices suddenly took off. Will gold coins be next?” 
That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works. Lol

Remember that bitcoin and crypto in general is still at an infant stage. Adoption takes time. That said, China recently stated that they are planning to start handling taxes and invoices on a blockchain. That chain won't be bitcoin of course, but that doesn't matter. There will be a number of successful mediatory coins that will automatically exchange whichever crypto you're using (a la Bitcoin) into the one you need for that payment. 
Many other governments are looking into similar uses for blockchain technology as well.

A single government would not be able to kill Bitcoin at all let alone in 2 days. It would require a coordinated effort between governments to destroy it - and even then individuals would be able to keep it going (even if on a smaller scale).

Take care of your debt first so that you won't panic in the volatile nature of crypto markets. As a general rule - never invest borrowed money.
One of the primary draws toward crypto is financial freedom. Using money that could be paying a loan back keeps you in financial bondage.
That's just my advice anyway.
