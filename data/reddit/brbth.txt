that's nice.  But when are they going to gives us the ability to use set the reply-to field, so we can get custom domain email at Proton without having proton be the MX for the domain?

the problem with bisq is that you are associating your bank account with the bank account of some random person who could easily be criminal or money launderer.  
It's just not worth the risk.

OP specifically  said that he was going to connect it to the internet occasionally to make transactions.

american here, i pronounce it like 'toe'.  so closer to your first example than your second.

Requiring an email is very off-putting.  I don't want an ongoing relationship with your company, I just want to buy a copy of your program and use it.

They aren't secure at all if you connect them to the interner occasionally, as the OP plans on doing.

I hope you still have your emergency fund in a reasonably stable fiat currency.
Bitcoin's value could easily be cut in half from here, or worse.

For anyone wondering if this is too technical  -- give it a shot.  I am a average programmer, bad at math and with only a vague understanding of how bitcoin transactions work.  And I found the videos to be approachable and enlightening.

What exactly is "reserve risk"?  How is it computed?
Google seemed to be returning hits for an unrelated concept with the same name.

The owners of the New York Stock Exchange were getting jealous of all the fees collected by Coinbase and decided that they wanted in on the crypto market.
So they are making their own exchange, called Bakkt.
The difference being that it will be more "legit" (safer, more regulated)  than Coinbase, so big money investors (e.g. pension funds) can legally and safely invest in Bitcoin.  
This has the potential to bring billions of dollars of investment money into Bitcoin, which most people assume will drive up the price.
It's about as far from "ICO bullshit" as you can get.
The "Bakkt" name is presumably a play on the word "backed", and likely refers to the fact that all futures trades on this platform will be settled in actual Bitcoin, as opposed to just being abstract bets on Bitcoin's price.  I believe this means that actual bitcoin must be on hand to back up each futures contract.

I think the bitcoin subreddit may be one of the worst places to look for economic insight.  There are lots of faddish and extreme viewpoints represented here.

It could also be outlawed, surpassed by a better coin, or have a serious flaw found in the math.
It's the last one that worries me the most.
The thing that gives me the most hope is the fact that so much big money is being put into building infrastructure around it.  A lot of very smart, very rich people are betting big on it being a success.

It's true that banks have a legal mandate to do AML, and also true that many large banks get away with or are insufficiently punished for large scale financial malfeasance.
But saying that there is a relationship between those two facts strikes me as either paranoid or disingenuous.
 I support KYC because, properly implemented in a just, fair and private way, it makes life harder for terrorists, drug cartels and bad-acting billionaires.
What people should advocate for is just government and fair application of the laws, not doing away with the laws altogether.

Thanks for the insight and get some sleep. :)

it looks like it is not always tweeting every 10 minutes.
why is the right wrong score scaled, and why is it always 1.0?
Can you publish the percentage of correct guesses over the last 48 hours?   The graphic might be visually misleading -- the red bars have more visual weight than the gray bars.

Arbitrage keeps the prices in line between markets, and is the reason why the futures market can affect the spot market.

Halving is the best english. 
Halvening is what some people call it to be cute (it sounds like more of an event).
Halfing is never correct.
