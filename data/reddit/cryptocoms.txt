I believe its possible that Mt. Gox could use your funds while showing a balance in your account. Should they have had an issue with your funds it would be to their advantage to buy Bitcoin at a lower price in order to repopulate your account with Bitcoins. 
Realize for a while now Mt. Gox has been the only one who could take out Fiat from Mt. Gox

I am not going to drudge through Japanese laws pertaining to business regulations. Mt Gox is a registered business in Tokyo. I am not saying we will see jail time or that money will be recovered or that the owner of Mt Gox wont make a lot of money. But there are regulations in regards to bad business practices. 
Gox has had a bad reputation for a while. The reason to stick around is that there is many millions still to be made.

Im not stating it as fact just that there is the possibility.

Absolutely.  It was tough bit we are really proud of doing it!

Just because you see that you have Bitcoin in your account on Mt. Gox doesn't mean you actually do.

There are laws regarding malicious business practices. Financially there will be no recovery I agree. But if you have followed the practices of the owner of Mt. Gox you would understand why he would try and stay in business as long as possible but spend as little money as possible to do it. 
I have said nothing about a trustless system or "doing the right thing" on the contrary I think that Mt. Gox will do anything but the right thing. Unless you think that the right thing is what is best for the owner of Mt. Gox.

Just make returns in USD. Bitcoin users understand the risks ... it will make user less likely to return products :)

Completely agree

Incorporate Bitcoin into google wallet, good adsense and adwords with Bitcoin.

This is a great way to gain visibility in the marketplace. Gift Cards/Store credit is what many of our clients are offering for refunds. 
Bitcoin is especially helpful for international sales and reducing fees.
Make sure to use a good merchant service company like bitpay or coinbase.
Bitcoins.com is a great way to gain more knowledge about bitcoin in general.
Let us know if there is anything we can help with!

In order to stay in business they need to pay back their customers. Also Mt. Gox is located in Japan which isn't a third world country where it would be easy to run away from malicious business practices.

Australia has become very Bitcoin friendly with many businesses popping up. This is great to see!
