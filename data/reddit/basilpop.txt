What exactly is not working in Darkcoin? Masternodes secure the network and are distributed on [many different hosting services]( and no one was able to de-anonymize a single DarkSend transaction, despite many claims to the contrary after which nobody actually delivered. We even have a [demonstration video of instant transactions in action]( "Fundamental distributed consenus reasons" is just a disingenuous phrase without a single fact to back it up. **Let the downvotes rain!**

"Talk is cheap" and ["Seeing is believing"]( ;) That's another upcoming feature, instantly confirmed transactions. Here's [how it works](
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:11:11
That's just typical for DRK-critics: Operating on outdated information and unwilling to update their perspective. Darkcoin has been [opensource in its entirety]( for several months now. Also: If you thought it to be closed source until now, how can you tell it contained "systemic failures"? The only failure I see here is on your part.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:39:22


Maybe you can be more specific? This seems to apply to Bitcoin as well, which would make no sense.


No. Unpaid full nodes in Bitcoin create incentive problems and Masternodes fixed that. CoinJoin was a starting point for DarkSend. It has developed far above and beyond that.


What a serious objection: "It's too good to be true, I will not accept it." 


No. Masternodes are used to lock transactions until they propagate among them. Consensus is not "broken", it is created, only faster.


Masternodes are built on top of the blockchain. Of course you still need it. The confirmations are held in limbo by the nodes until miners confirm them. That is the very principle of locking the tx. Also the concept is being explored by others to make tx faster in bitcoin-core. Nothing "laughable" with that last I checked in @_date: 2015-01-18 01:08:03
Here's the [whitepaper]( It works on top of another innovation called Masternodes, so they'd have to be in place first.
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:38:13
Ugh, FINALLY! They fixed the "can't send more than 1000 BTC"-bug. Been waiting for ages. *downloads*
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:25:52
I don't know which kind of "taken over" you mean, so I will debunk both:
1. As an owner of a single Masternode no one can "take it over" from you, since your collateral of 1000 DRK never leaves your wallet.
2. Taking over the entire Masternode network is prohibitively expensive because there are currently over 2000 Masternodes and the attacker would need to buy almost all DRK in existence for a 51% attack (the same kind of "threat" against Bitcoin by the way and no one screams out for a solution to that). Even then the attacker would buy themselves only a miniscule chance of deanonynmizing a DarkSend transaction, which would be the only point for a takeover.
[Here is a table]( with a MN count of 1300 showing the probability of having 8 rogue nodes selected. Note that for the last value the attacker would have to buy more coins than exist to setup that amount of rogue Masternodes. So in conclusion no: A problem that will never occur doesn't need a solution.
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:59:55
Or, you know, you could [simply integrate Instant transactions with an arbitrary amount of confirmations into the protocol itself]( instead of relying on 3rd parties.
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:57:41
Full source code is posted here in the comments by and me. Go ahead, take a look and compile it yourself. As for the reason to it having been closed source in the beginning: Evan didn't want to release an unfinished product with errors until he was confident enough with the features. As the main feature "DarkSend" matured and main priorities were met the code was released into the wild. This procedure was communicated in the very beginning and Evan followed through with his promise. By the way he won the ["Proof of Honor" Award]( for his integrity as a developer.
@_date: 2015-08-08 12:34:11
And yet when you search the site you can't find a single article directly about [Monero]( **or** [Bytecoin]( ("Specifications" article aside ofc).

@_date: 2015-07-15 19:43:47
I'll just quote the whitepaper for you:


transactions. Once a quorum has been formed, the inputs of the transaction are locked to only
be spendable in a specific transaction, a transaction lock takes about 4 seconds to be set
currently on the network. If consensus is reached on a lock by the Masternode network, all
conflicting transactions or conflicting blocks would be rejected thereafter, unless they matched
the exact transaction ID of the lock in place.
Edit: That was just a general overview. The full whitepaper on InstantX itself is [right here](
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:33:44
Dash solved that problem by having full nodes create a secondary network layer locking transactions instantly with 5 confirmations among the nodes. Ofc it only becomes spendable once it's actually been mined, but it effectively prevents double-spending attacks. It's called InstantX and has been successfully working from day one. Anyone can try it on [the testnet]( or [watch this demo](
Edit: I know altcoins are frowned upon here, but if you downvote please consider replying with some useful reasoning bc this comment pertains directly to the issue discussed here.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:19:13


That was from March and that feature's about to be released, so yeah. Any more questions?
Thanks to incentivized and professionally hosted Masternodes Dash's network is even stronger than Bitcoins: We have 2700 full nodes with a tiny userbase compared to Bitcoin while Bitcoin is huge and has a measly 6000.
Our blockchain syncs almost [20 times faster than Bitcoin's]( and you dare to belittle Dash with "high load" and "hard weather"? Bring it on!
Ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:08:37
The "rest of the nodes" in the network are all the other Masternodes running the same exact InstantX protocol. Every full node in Dash is a Masternode, so naturally they work together. It's like asking why Bitcoin nodes should listen to each others transaction broadcasts: Well because it's written in the code...
The same reason applies to the second question.
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:55:25
Only his butthurt over missing out.
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:55:40
The Moronero devs released their fork in full knowledge of the Bytecoin scam without even checking the crippled miner code. No one is dumb enough to fork a scam without checking the sources for hints of foul play which were undeniably there. One can only assume it was a deliberate decision to release the crippled version and then go all **"Oops! Sorry, we didn't know! Here's the corrected version, enjoy!"** while having mined millions of coins into their own pockets without anyone ever knowing, because, you know:  Invisible blockchain and stuff. Enjoy your "ethical" coin.
@_date: 2015-09-05 08:07:00
This thread is so naive and dumb it's almost cute. You're asking the Madoffs themselves whether they scammed you or not and after they **naturally** tell you they didn't, you bark like a happy litte puppy on their lap "I'm soo relieved". What a ridiculous show...
Anyway: None of the points they made address the fact that they deliberately released Monero to the public **with** the crippled miner. Any responsible non-scamming dev would have made sure the mining process would be fair for everyone **beforehand** which only deliberately did not happen. The invisible blockchain makes their crime perfect because no one can check how much they ninjamined. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 08:07:06
Yes, I am heavily involved in DASH. What did you expect? Moronero has been attacking DASH with ridiculous "instamine" accusations for over a year now and I have shown that they were merely projecting their own crimes on a much more successful competitor in a desperate attempt for attention.

While they enjoy their "freedom" they also give others the freedom to deny them to actually do anything with their own money because last week a "criminal" bought some pot with the coins they got from an exchange.
Bitcoin-core devs don't appear to be willing to reform the currency in a drastic but urgently needed direction. So the negative examples of tracked users/coins will stack up.

[Just 2 posts later the user admits that **IT WAS HIS OWN FAULT** that the code didn't compile]( which exposes you indirectly as a liar. Also establishes a case against your legitimacy to write up this list to begin with.
2. No you don't. Sitting in an ivory tower and theorizing around all day is not progress. Progress is what is actually being done and what is actually working in the real world. Something the entire Monero project evidently knows nothing about. See "no GUI wallet".
3. Simple opinion. No substantial argument here whatsoever.
4. Nice try to turn the burden of evidence.
You're the one making the claim here, so you're delivering the proof.
5. Building another argument out of your unproven claim. Invalid.
6. Wrong presumption therefore false argument. Anonymization takes place before time. Timed attacks are ruled out, but you knew that, you just hoped your audience is ignorant.
7. LOL. As soon as someone fixes the long standing incentive problem with Bitcoin, some idiot comes along and makes up complete trash about how incentives are bad. You are pathetic.
8. Darkcoin is more resilient against Masternode attacks than Bitcoin is against 51% attacks. Try buying a "large portion" of the network. Please by all means. I could use the money.
9. Prove it.
10. *yawn* Another highly theoretical jibber jabber pertaining to Ivory Towers instead of the real world.
Way to make yourself immune against criticism. At least you tried. Well request denied: Monero once again miserably fails to bring up a single legitimate criticism against Darkcoin. [And the market agrees.](

So what if criminals have a hard time getting fiat? Is that supposed to be an argument against financial privacy?
You can't deny anonymity as an urgently required feature for cryptocurrencies and privacy minded users.

Crap-toNote has ONE selling point, [DASH has dozens]( and fixed almost every single problem Bitcoin has. DASH is gonna burn your sphincter with its upcoming ["Evolution"-features]( because in contrast to Monero and the infighting bitcoin-core kindergarten Evan Duffield has delivered on every single feature promise he ever made.

Wrong. Just recently there was a [text post about that very topic]( A number of members expressed the opinion that rewarding full nodes is not necessary.


Wrong again. DarkCoin rewards full nodes for their service and it's impossible to "exploit", whatever that's supposed to mean in that context, because it's hardcoded that you have to prove a certain amount of financial reserves to run it, thus making an attempt to run an arbitrary number of rogue nodes cost prohibitive.

Maybe not a hit squad, but a "downvote to oblivion"-squad, since the only alt we're allowed to mention in this sub seems to carry an autistic dog on its obverse. ~~Btw, the [price]( seems to react favorably to the upcoming InstantX feature ;)~~
Edit: China seems to fall in love with the DRK.

Yeah, does that upset you? Actually it's been rising in value by a lot. Does that upset you, too? What are you going to do about it? :)

XMR = cripple mined Bytecoin-fork with shady NSA origins. I hope you have your downvote brigade ready.

This comment reads like someone's failure to deliver any valid criticism.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:06:04
Nothing to do in the slightest with "courage". Evan could've swept the floor with these guys easily. I'll release a major rebuttal on their falsities myself soon.

Where do I imply it's ok? This isn't about Coinbase, any company can do this because **Bitcoin allows it**.

The rebuttal will be posted as an article on dashpaymagazine.com and dashnation.com along with the video. It'll be linked here on r/dashpay and some other channels, so hard to miss actually. I will give time marks, quotes and then deconstruct all their silly arguments. Why do I not go on the show? Because I'm just a Dash-knowledgeable nobody. I don't have a blog, website, podcast or anything, I'm just an enthusiast who knows a lot about Dash and its history bc I've been with it since February 2014, so almost the beginning.

I hold more than 1 and less than 100. Am I the person running all the nodes?


Yep, it's a scam, except: Nobody was scammed.


So you **are** an idiot then. Thanks for confirming it. Did you know that Dash was almost worthless when it was created? Apparently not. This is not one of your retarded ICO scams with pre-determined coin value. Dash started like Bitcoin at $0. Plus he didn't mine alone as easily proven by looking at the blockchain.


Do you wipe your mouth with toilet paper? I suppose so for all the shit coming out of it. 


Yep, sure he does. Any you totally banged my mom, too.


Damn you Duffield for scamming us by giving the world a great cryptocurrency!! Poor us!
You are exactly the type of person who fails to even conceive of a single coherent argument that isn't so ridiculous it's debunked by simply quoting it and making you read it, just so you realize the utter bullshit you have just written. You are a joke and you made no sense.

It will always remain PoW (with collateralized miners mining) which is the source for entropy to power the Masternode network. The algo will remain X11, too.

Tomorrow. It's almost done. Few details and time markers to add so people can navigate w/o having to listen to the whole thing. **EDIT: You gotta give me an additional 24hrs on this.** I underestimated the range of false claims Chris makes. After listening to it the first time I felt like he kept repeating the same claims over and over again and that I'd be done with it quickly. He sure is an expert at recycling objections from previous podcasts packaging them to fit the current episode. Sorry for the delay. I didn't have a holiday like you did in the US but was rather working as usual here in Europe.
Edit: done.

Reading comprehension much?
The point in question was whether "one person is running all the Masternodes", which can be debunked by **anyone** holding at least 1 Masternode themselves. No one denies anywhere the lead developer holds a significant amount of coins, but far from enough to subvert the system in any way.
Plus: Very good that the dev has many coins, he's incentivized to continue developing the project like he has been in the last 2.5 years without a break. Must be the worst scammer in the world to be 1) a publicly known person and 2) still coding for Dash when he could've left a long time ago, launching another coin anonymously. Either that or your arguments are pretty much bullshit.
