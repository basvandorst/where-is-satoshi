That's also a thing with the Bitcoin reddit. You'd have gotten more upvotes if you'd cut out the downhill parts .... ;)

Same same.

I would wait a bit.

He is technically correct, it could happen.
Although I don't think it is very likely even at this point, it's a possibillity.

The problem is, that when the chain splits, the S1X chain might face a dramatric decrease in hash power. Currently 93% of all miners signal for S2X. If only 7% of miners stay on the btc 1x chain, blocktime will decrease dramatically to about **1 Block every 1-2 hours**.
This means the mempool will explode and practically *no transaction will go through*. Many users will panic sell, making the mempool even larger. *This will lead to a sharp drop in price*, leading to even more miners abandoning the S1X chain. As the difficulty adjusts only every 2000 Blocks, the S1X chain will be in this state for **about half a year**.
The only option left for S1X is an emergency hardfork to implement some kind of EDA. Which would be pointless as the drama was about preventing a hardfork at all cost.
Sorry to tell you, but there is not much anybody can do if the miners decide to leave. This is why everyone is so worried here.
I am always happy to be proven wrong. Don't just delete this comment.

As I just explained, users will follow, if the chain becomes unusable and the price plummits. Users don't care about hash power, but they care about user experience.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:49:09
If half a year is short term to you, okay. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:35:33
Which doesn't really matter. If 90% of the hashpower shifts to the 2X chain, the mempool will explode, and people won't be able to get their transactions through. This could easily lead to panic selling, and subsequently the famous chain death spiral. 
Proof me wrong if you disagree. Don't just delete my comment.

However, a sudden drop in hashpower dictates the eventual death of that chain, without the implemantation of some kind of fast downward difficulty adjustment. Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:50:37
BCH didn't die because the developers implemented **EDA**(Emergency Dificulty Adjustment). This means, that the mining difficulty can be adjusted downwards, before 2000 blocks have been mined. This is the sole reason that BCH hasn't died.
Unfortunately BTC1X does not have this feature and cannot implement it without an emergency hardfork, as described above.
So, if over 90% of hashpower shifts to BTC2X, it won't look good for BTC1X. It's astounding how few people are aware of this problem in this sub.

How come this hasn't been deleted?
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:29:25
Actually no: Hashpower mainly follows profitabiliy as we have seen with BCH. Unfortunately 93% of the hash power is signalling, that they will follow the S2X chain initially. No one can force them.

Bitcoin will only be a store of value, if it is simultaneously a currency. No use, no long term value.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:01:01
As this is r/bitcoin, we should be allowed to discuss bitcoin. 
So, sure. The user doesn't care how much hash power is behind the coin they use. But that's not the problem.
The problem is, that when the chain splits, the S1X chain might face a dramatric decrease in hash power. Currently 93% of all miners signal for S2X. If only 7% of miners stay on the btc 1x chain, blocktime will decrease dramatically to about **1 Block every 1-2 hours**.

Again, I am always happy to be proven wrong.

Yes, if BTC2X is only about 1/10 of the value of BTC1X, some more hashpower might stay. But don't underestimate the purchasing power behind S2X. Because it's majority fork there is good reason to think, that they will have about equal value in the beginning. Time will tell!
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:27:06
Well, if no transaction goes through, I'd consider that unusable. 
As the difficulty adjusts only every 2000 Blocks, the S1X chain may be in this state for about half a year. And then of course longer if more miners leave, which is likely. So there is a good chance, this will never end.
Nice try, but but guilt-by-asscociation is not an agrument.
