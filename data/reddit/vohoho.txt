Bitcoin is limited if they double everybody every 90 days they would have to borrow from the Aliens.   How can people be that stupid asking stupid question like this
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:50:56
So many people here are factoring out the Asian giants when they're awake and trading.   This is worldwide not just the US so is not like they're closing the market at 4 pm everyday.   Just wait until the night time usually another 8-9 billion added to market cap

Playing with alt is like playing with pennies stock you get what you paid for

Cex.io instant with credit cards with higher prices but you can also sell for higher.   500 per day 2000 per month until  verify.   Wesellcrypto also higher and limit to 300 per day.  Localbitcoins

@_date: 2017-05-27 06:54:20
Different circumstances affecting the rise and fall of the coin charts can't predict circumstances such as Japan decided to accept bitcoin Russia will follow or how about a regulated rupee.   Those events didn't occur back in each crash.

Pretty easy you send your kids to states for school then pay someone to get a fake marriage.   Legal now can send money over buying up properties bitcoin or what the hell ever they want 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:44:25

@_date: 2017-05-26 05:27:41
Hold on for dear life from a guy who was drunk and misspelled hold
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:45:29
21000000 but with Satoshi much much more like 20 quadrillion 
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:12:53
Google quantitative easing and that probably surprised you how much money printing the US printed since 2008
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:54:52
Could be up maybe down or not moving at all 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:33:28
So you're calling 3 months about 20-30 billion added to the cap a bubble 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:49:31
It is still relevant you just paying for the premium like Korea was at 4200 not 4200 won but 4200 US DOLLAR
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:24:04
When it goes up too much they will come up with the excuse regulatory then won't give you the coins.   Bitstamp did that to me twice in the last week 
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:40:21
Credit card with 0% interest for a year yep this guy follow trend and did it.   HODL here for a year 
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:20:14
It meant more demand and more are joining the wagon for btc
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:26:48
Is 1100 won per dollar
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:16:05
Do you know anything about quantitative easing? Google that and you will probably figure out something about printing money
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:49:41
Get a ticket to Las Vegas round-trip of course 1 hand on red win cash out fly back take 32k put it in bitcoin.   Keep the rest and if bitcoin worth nothing repeat the process.   Do not forget me when you're rich 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:43:51
But when you sell back is the overpriced that you bought is not like you're selling back at US price
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:50:11

@_date: 2017-05-26 23:42:01
Why do do thing exchanges crash or ran out of coins maybe something gotta do with people signing up and buying.   I'm guessing that's all 
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:38:49
Altcoin depended on bitcoin if bitcoin crashes what you think would happen to others. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:49:53
Bitcoin highest was 2800 not 3800 so do some research and reading before posting 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:35:18
BTC is limited that's I have to say.   
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:48:04
You can't look up gladiacoin Orr fundstream only idiots would fall for those traps
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:32:47
Cap at 21 million btc of those countless were lost so it is less than 21 million btc ever existed. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:57:08
Satoshi 1 btc = 100000000 Satoshi unit dividing is easy 
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:16:01
Not really bitcoin is trading into the billion now so a few million not going to swing that much. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:26:13
Most of the comments here are so bullish I'm worried lol.   Different events dictate different outcome but let hope for the best for everyone. Cheers

Borrow btc to sell at Lower price
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:08:00

@_date: 2017-05-25 21:38:51
We are chump change comparing to the new money flowing in from Japan, Korea,  or the biggest of them all China.   Give it until night time there's a trend like this everyday selling around 6 am here in Cali and buy it back at around 1300 work for me the last few days.

Dot.com boom was in the trillion.   2013 demand was not as high as right now.   Japan adopting bitcoin Russia will follow south America countries hyperinflation currency oh and what did India do with the higher rupee bills?
