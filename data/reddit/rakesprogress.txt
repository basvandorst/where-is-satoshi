Somewhat relevant.  Bitcoin and virtual currency ownership issues in the US and at the CFTC.

Challenging times are ahead for the virtual currency markets. I don't mean this as a sell signal.  But things are happening that will change the market (at least in the US).
1. US virtual currency exchanges are almost certainly going to have to register with the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM).  Is this a bad thing? No, not at all. But many are horribly unprepared for this.  What it means is that those who get blindsided by this are going to take some big public hits and fines.
2. the anonymous nature of virtual currency trading is going to become a bit less anonymous.  OFAC and other regulatory agencies (like the IRS) get really nervous about anonymous money transfers.  OFAC puts out a Specially Designated National's list.   You do business with anyone on this list and ...Bob's Your Convicted Uncle.  Do you really want to be downstream from a BinLaden wallet? Didn't know...couldn't know who it was, right!?  As far as OFAC is concerned. Its a strict liability crime.  Does not matter.
The take away from this is where virtual currency meets other virtual currency; or, where virtual currency meets fiat...expect more regulation.  This does not change the intrinsic value of virtual currency.  Actually, I'll restate.  It's slightly bullish.  More certainty around the issues mentioned makes a warmer pool for wider acceptance by large entities.  But be aware..the "flight by night" operations are in for a rough road.
Just one guy's opinion.
