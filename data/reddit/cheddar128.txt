You should probably figure out what Bitcoin is first through a series of YouTube videos and online research since it would seem you have little knowledge on the subject.
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:48:03
Been buying and hodling crypto for a few years now I just never payed enough attention to how much Coinbase was bending me over

Not only that but people can hack exchanges and steal their coins. They’ll never be able to steal your hardware wallet coins.
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:13:32
Oh. Well it does say the 0.009 BTC resides in the wallet it was originally sent to. I’m not sure how to help from here on out because I’ve only ever used hardware wallets. Sorry mate. You should repost this thread at s time of day when a lot of people will see it.

How do I downvote more than once
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:05:13
It looks like the wallet you sent the 0.28 bitcoin to has already made another transaction which sent the bitcoin somewhere else.
Seems that your bitcoin now resides in this wallet.

Get your account verified to level 3 (super easy) and then buy on Coinbase with a debit/credit card and you’ll get the coins instantly

Fake tweet. Doesn’t even use the right font. It’s a scam to sell you a shitty watch.

I’ve never owned a Trezor but I do believe it’s a great wallet, only issue is that it supports far far less coins than Ledger, and the cheapest Nano is equivalent to the most expensive Trezor.
@_date: 2019-11-16 05:56:44
It’s hit 20k before pal
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:48:15
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2019-11-11 06:56:52
No scammers? Seems like you’re the scammer here pal. Use a reputable exchange.

China had banned bitcoin mining up until a few weeks ago and now banned it again. People from China who want to mine go to neighboring countries to set up their mines.

I hope you know that this is a fucking idiot trying to scam you
@_date: 2019-11-24 09:58:24
There aren’t any Chinese miners anyway. They all mine in other countries.

I’ve done plenty of research. I don’t use Coinbase. I was simply asking if you have any good exchanges that you can share with us since you’re all high and mighty and know better than us.

So you’re getting out because it takes time and energy and it just dropped a few percent? Just HODL it. It will go up like it always does. Like Warren Buffet once said, if you can’t watch your portfolio go down 50%, you shouldn’t be investing.”
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:18:48
Well ya know what they say, if you can’t afford to lose it don’t invest it. It’s cool that you repaid your last loan with your investment but remember it doesn’t always work.

@_date: 2019-11-28 07:29:42
Who in the actual fuck is dumb enough to keep almost 20k on the fucking Coinbase app. A hardware wallet is $50. Even an online wallet is a thousand times more secure than this.
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:12:47
You asked for he best way to prevent yourself being hacked and you’re still gonna choose an online wallet. Hope you don’t value your coins too much!

Ledger and Trezor are both running 30% off sales.

I hope you did your research on the profitability of the miner you’re buying if you don’t know the answer to this.
@_date: 2019-11-12 08:27:26
Nobody knows. It’s all speculation. If we knew we’d all be billionaires.
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:16:08
Ahh yes everyone is gonna sell because some dumb fuck on reddit told them a bear market is coming with no explanation. Keep your price predictions in r/bitcoinmarkets. If you could predict bitcoins price you wouldn’t be working for DoorDash.

Lots of salty people downvoting because you’re asking somewhat of a newbie question. Experienced crypto users know not to input your mnemonic anywhere, so they’re probably annoyed by how often this question is posted. Most people don’t have an issue with these questions because it’s beneficial for new users to learn the benefits of cryptocurrency and we’re glad to help. We’ve all been a beginner at some point.
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:05:48
Imagine downvoting someone because they won’t take an hour out of their day type up what bitcoin mining is when this fuck could google it in 2 seconds

Cybertruck because it doesn’t ship for a while yet and I’d be the first to have it. I’d sell it for 200k and bam. 25 bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:08:29
You either inputted the address incorrectly or got scammed. Can you view the transaction on the blockchain? Does it say it went to your address? You should post the transaction hash and your receiving address here so somebody can take a look.

DO NOT DO THIS. NEVER INPUT YOUR MNEMONIC ANYWHERE. DO NOT SAY IT OVER THE PHONE. DO NOT WRITE IT ON ANY PHONE, TABLET, OR COMPUTER. DO NOT TAKE A PHOTO OF IT. WRITE IT DOWN AND STORE IT WHERE NOBODY CAN FIND IT.
Sorry for the caps. I had to get my point across.

I personally don’t know anybody who runs a large scale mining operation but based on numerous bitcoin mining documentaries, a lot of large scale miners have said that they will HODL until they can make big profits. For example they would HODL around 3-8k and sell a bit at 8k+

If you’re trying to get into crypto, you use a reliable exchange. Coinbase is reliable but fees can be high. Coinbase Pro feed are low. Kraken, Binance, and Bittrex aren’t bad. You’d be a fool to use cashapp.

I’ve had that happen so many times where I’ve had a normal conversation with a friend about something I’ve never googled or put on my phone anywhere and then I get prominent ads for it. It’s crazy. Hackers also have a way of looking/listening for those certain BIP39 words for your mnemonic.
