I don't get it? You can send money to bank accounts for free in most cases. My firm just sent 87 million from the US to the UK for free.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:45:53
What bank are you using? You're getting ripped off. When i moved from Australia to the UK i moved like 50k with transferwise and paid like 20 pounds. That included the FX fees.

There really is no controversy. It's really fucking simple. If the trade was close within 1 year, your tax on the gain is in your normal income bracket. If it was closed after 1 year, your gains are taxed at the long term capital gains rate. It's really simple as fuck...
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:55:50
Uh that would all already be illegal if they concealed it. I don't think there was a single American who got ousted in the Paradise Papers because the law firm would never do anything actually illegal.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:49:43
Huh? It's actually insanely simple bexause it's just like every other form of investment . You are taxed at the regular tax rate if you held the asset for less than a year, and at the long term capital gains rate if you held it for more than a year.
 Plus the IRS  notice 2014-21 laid in the rules and clarification of Bitcoin ages back.

The difference is that pretty much every single thing the CIA does is inheritantly illegal. Spying in foreign countries is pretty much always a crime, and they are not legally allowed to spy on Americans without teaming up with a domestic agency. Their entire mandate is essentially to break international laws, so things like this don't even matter to them.

Lol you don't have to explain your weird take on finance to me,  I've worked in private equity for a very long time and in m&amp;a before that. And an extremely volatile commodity/currency like bitcoin and using basic trend analysis to invest is the stupidest investment proposal ive ever heard.  No one just puts in currencies to hold in a diversified portfolio,  the investnin cash generating l assets or an asset that has built in and predictable  inflationary effect. Cyptocurreny is a neat tool,  but it is not a feasible  investment. 
And on top of all that,  I highly doubt you have diversified significantly outside of bitcoin and only have a tiny percent of your portfolio on bitcoin,  so the diversification effect doesn't even work for you. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:46:26
Why would any normal person (or even moderate investor) ever want to 'invest' in something with as much volatility as bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:21:20
You absolutely cannot use the CAPM  to price bitcoin. It is absolutely unique to equities.  What are you even using for the market risk premium? Currencies don't have one because currencies have a inflationary effect relative to others.  And what about beta? What is the 'market'  you're measuring correlation for? Equities? The usd? That doesn't work because it has nothing to do with equities and the dollar isn't meant to perpetually increase in value. Did you take your first summer finance class so you're throwing out words you don't understand? 
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:37:42
Bitcoin was at ~1000 in 2014. Then it went to ~200 in 2015. Now it is at ~1000 in 2016. Shit is more volatile that a hobo with bipolar disorder. This is not an asset that can be used as currency, who's fundemental need is to have very low volatility.
@_date: 2016-12-31 16:45:18
It is quite literally impossible to predict future volatility. There is no mathematical model in the world that makes sense for predicting it

Bread is incredibly stable in price......

Lol why would I see Bitcoin vs gold? Gold doesn't buy you a loan of bread,  a us dollar does.

Real news at the time when the information  was available...... 
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:59:57
I completely agree.  And if you're paid 1 Bitcoin for a week's worth,  this week you can buy 50 loafs of bread and next week you can buy 5, and the week after you can buy 30. Well that sure as fuck is not something anyone wants. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:03:21
Why would anyone want to store value in something that changes value more than almost any other asset in that class.
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:38:57
In a pure volatility stand pound,  actually VEF has a standard deviation than Bitcoin if you're just looking from mid 2013 to today.... So you're wrong. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:15:40
Why not just put all your money in treasury bonds then? It not only stores the value to a near 100% certainty if held to maturity, you will also be paid for doing so. It will also have zero volatility if you hold to maturity.
Basing investments on hopes and dreams of a demand increase is like putting all your money on red.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:14:44
Wrong.

Lol and you think Venezuela's currency is the model to look up to? Hahaha
@_date: 2016-12-30 12:48:19
That's just wrong though.  Bitcoin was at ~1000 in 2014, ~200 in 2015. Now it's back approaching 1000. I don't think you'd be able to find a penny stock that's more volatile. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:38:34
You guys realize that a mainstream currency is considered worse if volatility is high, right? Relative value to the usd means literally nothing in determining if a a currency is viable. 
And example where relative value means nothing -  the Yen is worth significantly less than the New Zealand Dollar compared to USD but the Yen is an international reserve currency,  and no one gives a fuck about the New Zealand dollar. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:03:36
Source? That sounds like absolute bullshit.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:26:31
What does that even mean? The standard deviation is many many multiples higher than even the most volatile currencies.

Why not use  venmo or (omg) take a credit card payment or any of the thousands of options to take money? It doesn't make sense to receive revenue in a different currency from expenses.

Well don't break federal law then... That's exactly my original point. Jamie Dimon agrees Bitcoin is useful for people breaking the law. It isn't that useful for people who aren't. They're better off using their local currency.

Debit card payments can technically clear in minutes. It's as soon as the merchant sends the transaction info. In some countries it is literally seconds if automated.
And cash is literally instant...
Also why wouldn't credit cards just use regular currency + blockchain? What is the benefit of doing this in some other currency?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:53:37
Actually that's one of the fewest purposes that Jamie Dimon said this is a useful currency. But you'd still have to report you sold the weed or you'd be committing tax fraud.

You are ignoring exchange rates between Bitcoin and fiat. Also you're wrong about the fees - in Europe credit card companies can't charge more than 0.3% of the transaction...

But credit card rewards fucking suck in Europe. They're absolutely incredible in the US. Like 2% cash back cards or cards like the Chase Reserve don't exist outside of America.

But bitcoin is not a credit facility. It was nothing to do with credit cards.
Also credit cards are not only cheaper than Bitcoin, but  actually pay consumers for using them with things like cash back cards. They also offer immense protections in the event of fraud. Bitcoin doesn't offer any of that. So it isn't factually wrong for him to say credit cards are a better payment method.

The Thompson family is not the biggest shareholder either...

Lol i work in private equity. Have been in finance few almost 2 decades... I know what I'm talking about.. 
'they own Reuters?' dude it's fucking public company! And not even in the top 20 share holders! Probably not even in the top 100...
I bet if you added up the wealth of every 'Smith' in the world you'd think they're some insanely powerful family... That's not how it works.. The French Rothschilds have zero relation with the British..
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:38:14
The entire Rothschild family is worth less than Warren Buffet... And the family is so fragmented at this point, it's like assuming everyone who's last name is Smith know each other an interact. 
Even in London their name holds less weight that many other less 'scary' families.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:23:38
 Lady Lynn Rothschild is NOT on the board...As you can see above....


Every single share in public companies in the United States has to be disclosed if it is listed.


Then do more, because this is completely wrong. Below is their 10k. Read it.

Would you rather put your money in an etf and keep it in a safe for 10 years? That's generating dividends and secured by actual assets... This could go anywhere from here.

Wow you looked at their family tree! That says nothing about their power or wealth...
Let's start with any easy question. Where did you come up with your fact that they own Reuters?
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:21:17
That's because he can't afford a half decent lawyer. Keeping anyone in jail without charges for so long only ever happens if you're poor as fuck.
