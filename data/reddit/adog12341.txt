Someone definitely filled the gold goal today!
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:19:24
AH SKEET SKEET SKEET SKEETTTTT
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:55:07
Wow, you're an asshole!
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:38:43
Posting king diamond? Fuck it, have an upvote. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:42:35
Pump yourself to the moon, friend! 
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:30:59
Sounds a lot like some bitcoiners directing a ton of hate at altcoins...
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:44:21
[boo this man!](

Like said, it's probably just a ploy to get more hits from searches, but if Newegg is becoming more BTC friendly it could be a very good sign.  This combined with their Twitter activity could yield some very interesting developments.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:34:05
Wow, I'll have to look out for this next time I'm at the SB mall.

NSA is going to arrest the Bitcoin CEO and confiscate the master servers.  
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:32:32
I couldn't even get my bank to verify...  So now they have my bank info and I have jack shit.
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:17:21
Yea, they just launched so I can understand they're having issues.  Oh well, I can always use coinbase in the meantime :)
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:57:19
I'm assuming this is due to the crosspost.  
Pretty stupid, but whatever.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:49:18
Store and send your own fucking bitcoin if you don't want fees.  They're a service for your convenience, not a charity.
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:58:19
Better hope they don't get the CEO of Bitcoin on the phone though, he'll fork the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:29:04
The rewards for finding a block with be cut in half.
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:57:03
I would tip you all the doge in my wallet but I am going to give it to someone who appreciates it, not some stick in the mud that doesn't know how to have a good time. :)
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:14:03
I'm pretty sure I tried everything EXCEPT that! Ughhh.  It showed as a 0.00 format in the box so I assumed that's how they wanted it.
@_date: 2014-05-28 05:32:06
I wrote a paper on why businesses should accept bitcoin for my english 102 class.  Got an A+ :D
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:00:31
He obviously didn't tighten the fittings...
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:28:12
Steam pls
@_date: 2014-05-28 06:34:08
Thank you very much Khaki! :)
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:17:05
Yep, that's what I tried first.  
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:17:03
If that's your bag, baby.  Yea!
@_date: 2014-10-08 02:44:50
I heard you have to take him out to lunch before he will talk.
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:03:20
Yes.  I put those in and said they were invalid.  I tried many variations of decimals until it eventually just deleted my request...
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:45:17
Looking at the comments in the "new" article is even funnier:




@_date: 2014-05-17 02:48:13
1) what the fuck are you smoking
2) where can I get some?
Chill out you elitist scumbag.  
+10 doge
You know, just to piss you off.
@_date: 2014-08-28 17:48:57
If a hacker can break into a companies server and steal all their customer's CC info, it is broken...
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:21:42
Damn, I don't go to the main campus of Purdue so I get no BTC :(
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:48:36
My guess would be "really fucking good!"
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:57:20
Yea, fuck that guy.
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:27:45
If they're buying $50k worth of servers I almost guarantee they have a line of credit.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:28:14
10%, baby!
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:11:51
Yep I tried different orders too.  Nothing worked.
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:48:17
Credit union FTW.  Multiple coinbase transactions without a peep from them.
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:19:42
(no homo)
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:01:20
Dude wat the fuck is wrong with you? DO YOU HATE MONEY? ARE YOU TRYING TO BANKRUPT YOURSELF LIKE TRUMP DID?
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:54:33
Careful Icarus, you know what happened last time you got too close to the sun...
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:01:46
Bro tried to take his bitcoin!  Bear has to learn. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:33
OH FUCK IT'S AT $500! :(
Must've been an asshat that sold out really cheap, because it's back up to $630.. I don't have much coin (I have like .10) but I'm still happy for the people that have a nice stash. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:05:17
US Dollar dollars. Lol
Congrats on the bet, though.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:41:13
Change doge to 100% and you've got yourself set up for retirement in 2 days.
