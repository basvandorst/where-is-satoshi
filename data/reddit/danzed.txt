Blockchain and Core do not promote decentralization
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:10:54
But there are coins with greater efficiency and non-existent scalability issues which Bitcoin currently faces. Bitcoin's architecture has been untouched since Satoshi published the whitepaper. Since then, Alt's have learned from Bitcoin's design mistakes and teams are creating better versions. Traction of these coins haven't caught on yet because we are still in such an infancy stage where the whole world knows the buzz word BITCOIN and not IOTA, or Nano for example
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:02:34
Guess you're another sheep that thinks Bitcoin is truly decentralized. Here, simple comparison: Projects (coins) that are open source and developed by programmers not belonging to one entity. Oh ya, thats called Github, where any programmer can add, modify and discuss how to make the project better. On the other hand, you have Blockstream and Core with a corporate goal/vision attempting to drive Bitcoin in their direction for control. It's a smart move by them honestly, who wouldn't want to have a hand in the next big tech wave (cryptocurrency). 
What do you think the US has been trying to do with the internet?? Doesn't the fight for Net Neutrality ring some bells for you in this similar instance?!
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:55:23
Hahah, man, anyone that thinks Bitcoin is decentralized is moronic. You know that you're trusting Bitcoin Core and Blockstream which have massive money in the game right?? Tell me how 2 multi-million dollar companies deciding the fate of Bitcoin is decentralized. Is this sub decentralized? No, I'll probably get banned for talking about this openly... So censorship right there. How is that healthy to Bitcoin... 
All my opinions are mine that spend more time outside of r/bitcoin learning about other incredible technology that's out there right now. I suggest you visit the other subs and learn about an array of coins that have some pretty wicked design/architectural features behind them. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:37:55
Man, I don't think you're thinking straight. Answer the question, what is the point of creating digital gold when we're so close to making peer-peer electronic cash a thing? You clearly don't aim high enough...
It's in the word cryptoCURRENCY. CURRENCY, you know what we do with currency? Spend it for goods and services. While you wait years for Bitcoin to become "cash," I'll be using other crypto's to put the purchasing power back into my hands instead of your favored "alternatives."
Think about it man, why are you into cryptocurrency in the first place? To hoard and become rich? Or would you actually like to see incredible technology grow out of this space?...
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:48:03
I’m very educated so your name calling does not phase me. So, question: why is 2nd layer LN the solution to scalability?
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:05:11
Sustained dominance will not be able to be handled by Bitcoin's network. Many coins are able to handle much higher volumes still with exceptional architecture
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:06:18
Altcoins have learned from Bitcoin's original design, which honestly in this crypto space now, is archaic. The coding is cleaner and process is more efficient. We don't need to use 2nd level scaling (LN.....) if the main infrastructure is designed properly
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:17:37
Ok man, all you really do is contradict yourself, you already did that in your previous post to this one. So I’m honestly not sure how much I really want to reply to you because it’s a waste. 
Developers going off by the hundreds and developing their own use cases for multiple cryptos is EXACTLY what we need. Competition breeds the best and Bitcoin is already starting to look ARCHAIC. Free. Market. If you get caught up in a Bitconnect scam, than you’re frankly an idiot. 
How can you mention inflation when Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, do you even know what inflation means?? Bitcoin is anti-inflammatory. 
Do some research before trying to tell me a free market for developers to build what coins they want, is a bad thing... Or go take an economics class
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:26:08
But why can't you have this as a first layer solution like many coins have been able to show?
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:16:10


You're joking right? You're subscribed to this sub and you're not even aware of Bitcoin's PRIMARY USE-CASE?!? 
I'll wait here while you go revisit Satoshi's whitepaper on Bitcoin... You know, the one you guys are supposed to be following. Hint: What's his thesis named? ...
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:43:51
You are delusional if that's what you think. In denial of BCH's better performance and functionality as a store of value AND currency
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:18:54
But, now people have to actually use the LN which requires setup that at the moment isn't too friendly to the average Joe. Other coins can fill this role, thus I am a firm backer of atomic swaps. Let the people choose what coin to use, but make them all spendable. You and a few people above me are basically saying the best idea is to put all your eggs into one basket and develop Bitcoin. Hello, its called a central point of failure, not good. Free market breeds competition, competition breeds better products. iPhone vs Android vs Pixel. These are all good for the space. This can't be argued to the slightest degree
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:02:02
Answer: because a free market in which participants can freely develop and work on any project they desire is healthier for the space in general. 
Now, you never answered my question: Why is 2nd layer LN network the answer to scalability for Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:47:45
Lol no they won't. Banks want something they can control. Don't be such a lambo hunting theorist 
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:27:07
The ideal... That will never happen
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:37:16
I'm sure your issue will be resolved man! Best of luck
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:11:08
You're talking about BCH not scaling and the requirements of block sizes to become dominant "800mb." And here we are with 1mb blocks of Bitcoin yet you're over the moon about how its the best coin in the world...
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:49:49
You should be waiting after November 16. OR after we hit 10k as that is a predicted bubble bursting value
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:58:05
The waters are crystal clear, friend. BCH is the fork that aligns with Satoshi's original version. Close to zero fees, fast transaction rate and able to scale. You haven't explained to me how BCH is a scam coin. You're too busy drinking the waters of Core and Blockstream that is supplied in this subreddit.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:20:49
This is terrible advice. Newcomers to trading should NOT be trading. Practice paper trading first, understanding technicals and do some reading.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:10:56
LN is a corporate (bitcoin core and blockstream) proposal. If you want to subscribe to LN (faster, cheaper fees) you'll have to pay a premium. Google it
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:44:22
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:48:11
Maybe subscribe was a poor choice of words. But it essentially is a side chain which will take transaction fees away from the miners and into the pockets of the developing team that deploys the network
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:51:22
Finally a logical comment. I was just wondering as to why you're concerned about BCH's scaling problem at the moment instead of looking at BTC's current state of affairs.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:04:11
Did you guys know the Lightning network proposal is  subscription based. This is why I fear Core
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:19:22
It currently works far far better than BTC. How can you say it doesn't have "real-world value?"
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:00:52
How so, please explain. Functions as Nakamoto planned bitcoin to do in his original whitepaper. Bitcoin is currently not following the plot. BCH is..
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:53:28
These posts annoy me. Why are you so sure that it won't go down? How do you assure yourself of that?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:46:44
Sounds good. Firstly, Bitcoin does not have 1 developers, it essentially has two groups vying for control of what should be termed "Bitcoin." Secondly, us plebs really know nothing about the industry and especially have no control over prices when whales control most of the coins. What will happen if miners no longer mine the Bitcoin chain and switch to BCH? We're gonna drop well below 6K before you can even say "bitcoin"

Actually, I received my bitcoin in 10 seconds. No exaggeration.
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:16:52
Like the idea. However for people in Canada. There is a service called quickbt. The max they allow you to buy is .2btc. In which you can buy from interac debit. Very simple and easy to use
Edit: Oblig thank you to a kind stranger for Gold! Now what! Ha
@_date: 2015-03-16 01:38:06
No, not at all! It's great. Just your debit card, and you get billed instantly.
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:12:48
Thanks fine Ninja

You're already being tracked anyway. You're on Facebook right? You're being tracked.
@_date: 2015-03-16 02:19:14
 The fee is steep but you are paying for convenice. Hence why I posted this comment in the thread with the phrase "buy a small amount of bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:20:09
Firstly what no one thinks about is the cost of energy. These beginner miners will be paying more for energy than they are making in btc
