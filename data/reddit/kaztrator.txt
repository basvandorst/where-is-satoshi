Front page says "Bitcoin to PayPal is currently disabled."

I've been trading online forever. PP Gift isn't reverseable, it's the whole point. In fact, if you got scammed after sending someone PP gift, you take the loss, as there's no recourse. Best you can hope for is PP refunding you as a one-time courtesy, but they won't chargeback the scammer.

I was once scammed and they did a "one-time courtesy" refund, but I asked if they were going to chargeback the scammer and they said no because it's their policy to not do it for F&amp;F payments regardless of the circumstance. If someone goes through the lengths you described to get a refund, and even send a police report to PayPal, after weeks of investigating, I think they'll just take the loss. That's a "trick" that only works once though, so I can't imagine a scammer ever resorting to do something like that..

PP Gift instant transfers can't be reversed. The only reverseable transfers on PayPal are (1) Goods and Services payments which are being disputed and take 30 days for a dispute resolution, and (2) PP Gift eChecks which are sent if someone funds using their card and can be canceled on the card issuer's end.

I'll most likely ask for Friends &amp; Family, but I don't mind going first if the person has good rep, or if the website has security measures.

So I keep hearing this about chargebacks, but I've traded online and used PayPal forever and have read more terms and spoken to more reps than I would've liked, and never have I ever seen a way to chargeback a PP gift instant transfer. Could you tell me how to do it? It would help if I'm ever scammed after sending a PP gift payment, as every time it's ever happened to me, I've had to take the loss.

Maybe he saved 100 in BTC got a sweet 1000x return in those 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:50:02
Obviously, that's what gains and losses mean. You don't have a loss if you haven't realized the sale.

Does it have to be the same amount of BTC as the parent? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:47:45
If you bought 1 BTC at $500 and traded it for a $5000 Desktop PC when it raised in value, then you’re taxed on the $4500 gain. If you did it backwards. Then the $4500 losses will reduce your tax liability.

My biggest regret in life will forever be knowing about Bitcoin for 7 years and never investing. For fuck's sake, The Good Wife told me BTC was gonna change everything and I didn't listen. It was only $3 a coin. If only I had bought 1, just 1...

Are you suggesting everyone burn through their savings accounts immediately and buy tangible assets or what?

I just converted all my coins on Bittrex to NXT. Every single one. Paid a shit ton in exchange fees, but I think it will ultimately be worth it. I have about 5k coins, so if I get 2500 IGNIS, that's about $6,250 in free money. That's close to my entire crypto investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:21:25
I don't think I understand. All I have to do is spend BTC from the recipient wallet with a high fee? What if that transaction is confirmed and the other one isn't? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:29:35
Loans aren't taxed as income, but Bitcoin's increased value is taxed as capital gains. You have to report your gains and losses every year and pay taxes on them.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:27:13
With 300k in loans, 3000/mo rent, and 35% income tax, saving 20k a year is absurd. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:28:32
What exactly triggers it to be forgotten as opposed to awaiting confirmation? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:18:50
Yup that's me. 
I'm planning on double-downing, and doubling my balance when it's at a lower price. I do believe it will go back up at some point, and I'll withdraw whatever I can't afford later on. The net result would be that I bought in at the crash price. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:51
Care to say what your ROI was? (in terms of %) 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:51:03
Does anyone else have a spending wallet, where you deposit money to buy a specific item, wait for your balance to grow, and then withdraw? Is this advisable or should you just hodl every piece of bitcoin you can get your hands on? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:39:09
Any way to accelerate that process––having the nodes drop the transaction, so my wallet can reclaim the BTC? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:46:03
Anyone want to lend me their bitcoin for 10% of the current price, and I'll give it back to you in 3 months time? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:02:00
Looked into it, but Blockchain Wallet doesn't support either unfortunately. Is it really possible for the transaction to be lost forever? This was hundreds of dollars in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:11:42
Yeah, that's what I was doing. I was sending it to a desktop wallet, but fucked it up. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:13:29
I'm kinda confused on how that works. How exactly does a transaction get returned? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:02:22
It looks like she bought in even earlier than the airdate of January 12 because Bitcoin was trading at $3. If she cashes out today, that's a 2000x return on her investment!
