It looked likely to reach 20k on the second picture that on the first one, in the fisrt one it seemed like going to 1k in the next few months
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:52:08
is this just a healthy 3 year correction to $2k?

@_date: 2019-06-27 09:15:13
aaaaa WTF is going on
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:40:23
I see where you are going with it, however, it is estimated by experts that most gold has already been extracted and is stored above ground (about 158,000 tons) and the annual production of gold is almost negligible so what affects the price is changes in sentiment (market supply and demand of the existing 158k tons).
Yes it could be that most experts are wrong and someone finds several extra tons of gold somewhere or they bring it from outer space or whatever. But then it is also only estimated by experts than cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin cannot be broken but it is something that is not 100% confirmed and if no one has been able to break them doesn't mean someone won't in the future. Both examples are unlikely to happen but not impossible.

My fucking order filled at 12,944
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:03:41
fuck guys I feel like an idiot for going all in at 13k. Are you all still holding?
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:52:12
what's your average now?
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:57:02
gold and silver?
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:24:52
same here probably, I'll keep DCA for many years but what if it's an echo bubble like silver or uranium

@_date: 2019-12-18 16:48:50
Yes some of us are
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:58:34
it might depend on if there is actually a recession next year
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:11:57
what would happen if $3200 doesn't hold?
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:17:35
isn't this the perspective of everyone here? Another perspective could be what happened to silver looking at all time chart
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:59:08
bro, I'm straight up not having a good time
