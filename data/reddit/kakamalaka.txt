Are you guys done jerking each other off?

Yet here we all are

Lo fucking L. Anyone who refers to himself as a "bigboy" on reddit's r/bitcoin in reference to understanding finance certainly is NOT a bigboy. You guys are hilarious
Edit: "the industry". Hahahaha you're great man, never stop

Words words words. I, too, like to sound smart on the internet and have other random people validate my uneducated beliefs.
You "bigboys" in "the industry" sure seem to seek a lot of outside validation while shouting down things you admittedly don't understand

I don't think you or OP are assholes fwiw, but that logic you use is very defeatist and pessimistic.
Why even TRY to save shelter dogs if you're gonna eat meat...
Why even TRY to combat climate change if you still drive a car occassionally...
Why even TRY to recycle if not everything is recyclable/compostable...
Sometimes small steps add up and motivates people to change their behaviors even further. Like me, I don't eat red meat anymore and am slowly cutting down poultry and all I used to eat was steajs, burges, etc.
These shelter dogs are sometimes, quite literally, killed, cremated, and buried if they aren't adopted whereas these purebreds have people lining up to buy them for 10x the cost. So because I plan to roast a turkey on Christmas that makes me a hypocrite for advocating shelter dogs over breeder dogs?

Because they're the same thing?

Hm, I didn't know of something like that!
Makes sense, thanks!

How come you deleted your entire post history over the last 5 years?
