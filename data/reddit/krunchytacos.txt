It's not like it's easy to startup an ISP. I owned and operated one during the 90s. The barrier to entry these days is huge. Legal costs alone would bankrupt most who tried. Then there's building the network. Google spent an estimated 84 million setting up their network in KC alone, and that was just for 150k customers. That doesn't even include the costs of connecting at the home sites.
It's not as if the repeal of NN does anything to make starting an ISP easier.

Perhaps across the country, but it's not like everyone has access to 1000 different providers. 46.1 million households in the US, only have access to one wired provider.

Hardly propaganda, considering those were already the type of actions involving lawsuits, which is why we arrived at NN in the first place.

It's not a government controlled internet, it's about the government stopping ISPs from controlling content. 
Without NN, a company like Comcast or Verizon could filter your access and force you to use their services, or charge you extra when using other content besides the content they want you to access.

I'm talking about frivolous lawsuits from large ISPs that operate in the same space. One of the tactics used to kill off the competition. Suing for things like tampering with equipment, etc. Keep them tied up in court, inhibit construction of the network.

The short would still be valid. You can hold on, but your potential for loss is unlimited. I'm not sure if it works differently in the crypos market, but at least with stocks, there's no expiration. However, the entity that you're borrowing from can close your position at any time and without notice. Which happens when their inventory gets low and they need to fill their buy orders.
