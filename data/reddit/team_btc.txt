Yeah once people are more educated and learn not to display private keys...that problem would be solved. The compromising of you're credit card info you have no control over.

its obviously a relevant argument, cause bitcoin is the "internet" of money. People were EDUCATED on the internet and its uses. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:48:02
LOL same thing couldve been said about the internet in the early 90s. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:39:51
its funny how people choose to do no research on how bitcoin works yet have a million opinions on it
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:00:19
MAN its funny how you guys are trying to fight a revolutionary concept. And this thread started with showing you how much easier it is to get your credit/debit info compared to getting my bitcoin info. Then you brought up how my grandma won't understand the private key/public key concept. LOL

so uh the time spent educating people on how to use the internet was a waste according to your logic. People couldve just let "internet professionals" deal with all the internet stuff and that way that wouldve been someone elses problem. Why spend time educating anyone on anything. Lets just stop educating people cause it's easier that way. secondly you can spread your money out in different ways/wallets and ensure that if some is lost all is not lost. That's what ive done.

I am sticking to the point, I'm comparing the difficulty in early internet use to early bitcoin use. Its too bad your mind cant see the correlation.

Do you forget the next generation of kids are pretty much being born with smart phones and tablets, all the old people that aren't tech savvy don't matter

so youre okay with credit card fraud, to which the cost is passed on to a consumer? makes alot of sense
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:39:02
LMAO you clearly don't get that the guy displayed a private key. That's the equivalent of dropping $20 on the floor and wondering why you lost it. Getting your credit/debit info is easier than stealing my bitcoins. And you guys are worried about $20 when millions in credit card fraud is done every day and the cost of that fraud is passed on to consumers. You're argument is laughable at best.

sorry keys...thanks for correcting me
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:42:02
I can get a cvv, credit card number, date of birth, expiry date, address, zip code, email address off these websites uniccshop.ru / approved1.su for as little as $3.

first of all with the right education on security measures, such as cold storage, brain wallets, paper wallets you can ensure that your money can't be touched. THE RIGHT EDUCATION, which people really don't make the effort of getting. Secondly yeah you'll get your money back if it's compromised but that'll result in higher fees and other costs that are passed on to consumers. I am a btc user and no one can take my money from me. I have taken the proper precautions to ensure no one can take my money, it is next to impossible and it cost me nothing to put those security measures in use.
