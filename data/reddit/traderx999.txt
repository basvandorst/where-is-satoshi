There has been some suggestions that they are just stalling.  Just trying to figure out how to get their money out and then they will let it get forced into bankruptcy. It would not surprise me one bit.

Yes they will continue to increase restrictions and regulations without outright banning Bitcoin and that will confuse a lot of easily misled people.

Yes they do...and it works and will continue to work.  Not nearly enough people who care to vote differently about this.  The politicians and the Power Elite who rule them have pretty much the permission to do whatever they want when it comes to limiting the use of crypto currencies.

Once again, this is not from profit they made recently, but instead it's money that they stole from customers a couple of months ago and now they are giving some of it back.  The haircut was far higher than it should have been and it's because they held back extra money that they could give back later and fool you dumbfucks into thinking it is a good thing

Phil Potter said something directly contrary to what you are saying.   So I believe him over you and he says if they don't convert enough to equity, then they will be forced into bankruptcy.

Sure if you can get a majority of miners to go for it, then you should get it back. I doubt they would agree though in this particular case.

Yes because men are the adventurers and the trailblazers in society...not women.  And nothing against women but the truth is the truth.

You are the 1.76%.  Congratulate yourself for being smarter than 98.24% of your gender, at least in this area.
