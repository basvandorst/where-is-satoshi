Thanks! :) 
And, yes, apparently it was violating their rules. I must've just missed it on my first read through, but they ask that API queries be limited to no more than 1 every 10 seconds. That's totally cool, and I've updated the site to match.

I'm not sure what they're doing behind the scenes, but it's likely they're already optimizing in this way.
A "what is the balance of this address?" query would basically require the site to lookup all transactions into and out of that address and add/subtract as necessary to arrive at the final balance. 
But if the address is unused, then there are no transactions to be found in the blockchain, thus no additional computation.
All you've really done is issue one query looking for any transactions to/from the address in the blockchain which returned "not found". 
I believe that's the same thing that would happen with an "addressfirstseen" query: one query that searches the blockchain for any transactions to/from the address and doesn't find anything. 
Although if there were multiple transactions in the blockchain, "addressfirstseen" would stop looking after it found the first one (in that case, there would be a performance benefit).

Questions like these are why I built the page. :) 
My rational mind knows there's no chance someone will stumble on one of my addresses, but there's still a part of me that's creeped out by this.
