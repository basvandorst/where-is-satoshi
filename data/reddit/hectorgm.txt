I invite you to spell it out.

Actually he is quite explicit on the one feature that Bitcoin does share with money.  You didn't miss this point, because you refer to it in your next paragraph, but nor do you give any reason to reject it.  The fact that contracts can be made up specifying goods and services rather than money doesn't seem to even address the point Golumbia raises.  Please feel free to explain how you think it does.


What exactly is the counterpoint to Golumbia here?  It's not intelligible.  Using a sarcastic tone doesn't refute anything, it just puts one's dogma on display.

Nope.  Golumbia makes an argument carefully explaining why Bitcoin is no threat to money or monetary theory.  You don't actually address a single point he makes.  If you think his points stand so well refuted, you should be citing the refutations rather than making veiled insults about his intellect.

The point here is about the political authority of states to determine value.  An analogy might be the state's monopoly on violence: some anarchist faction could decide to [raise a militia]( and begin to enforce its own police measures, but without authorized exclusive power over its domain it would lack any actual sovereign standing.  Similarly, the fact that people *use* Bitcoin doesn't ipso facto confer value on it, any more than it does for airmiles or seashells.


A wholly unregulated system of money would be of little use to anyone.  Value would fluctuate arbitrarily, making transactions unpredictable.

Agree that complexity is a contingent feature; still don't see how that speaks to the money/currency point Golumbia makes.  Your last 3 bullets each seem to commit the exact conflation he criticizes.  Agreed about black market currency.

Alex Jones, quit trolling.
