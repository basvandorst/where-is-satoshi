So you sold?

This is common advice. Total bullshit of course.

Oh my God you talked her into it didn't you.

There's a difference between a 10% loss and a 100% loss. They are not both equally 'the worst' as one is substantially worse than the other.

Was that a lot of money for you or are you aware you're gambling?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:07:12
So you sold?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:39:25
Huge surprise eh

I don't measure my self worth in any currency.
If you think Bitcoin is a currency at this point you're an idiot. Most people investing buy into the 'btc is a money bank that can only increase in value' pyramid scheme bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:51:03
It would sit in a reserve so that the currency is actually tied to something. Now that reserve (which can totally be used to inflate the currency at will) is in the hands of a few early adopters. There are not enough to make it truly decentralized. Too few people have too many coins.
Right now it's tied to actual currency as well, because that's what people pay their electricity bills with when they mine btc. It's just weighed in favor of early adopters.

Nobody fucking knows. People think they can just sell if push comes to shove and make back at least their initial investment,but that's not what happens during a crash. During a crash transaction times could become days or not go through at all by the point you realize it's crashing.
The truth is with all the new (better, lower transaction fees, shorter transaction times) coins we don't know if Bitcoin is here to stay or if it will be replaced after a crash. If something else takes its place it'll fall close to 0 obviously.
Most investors right now don't ever intend to use it as a currency and big vendors are rolling back on accepting it already. People buy into this 'btc is a money can't that can only increase in value' bullshit, which is obviously no different from a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:28:03
Like a stock that can only go up? An infinite money machine? At nobodies expense? Or do the people who buy too late lose money? Like, you know, a pyramid scheme.

There is no house money. That's other people's dreams. Just saying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:08:27
Now it's good tho? Not inflated anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:49:03
He doesn't. It's a scary thing to admit though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:39:03
No offense, but I can tell you don't have a lot of experience. Not saying I know it all, but I'm just gonna tell you what I think.
You're right when you say Bitcoin supply has a limit. And up to now buyers have obviously been increasing, thus the price went up. You can't talk for the future, but yes you can make an educated guess. Aka  buyers are gonna keep increasing.
I'm not saying buying btc right now is necessarily a bad choice. Just saying you don't know the force behind the current rise in value.
Let's talk about motivation. Why do people buy btc? Most people? Because they think the value will increase. But people are limited, so at some point, the price will have to stagnate if I'm right about most people buying it for future expectations. And then people will stop buying, and sell. The losers are those who bought at the highest point.
You nor anyone knows when people are gonna stop buying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:46
I see. Of the 'this is good for bitcoin' type.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:56
He's not 'day trading' he's gambling. Just sounds cooler that way.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:47:15
I totally believe in Blockchain technology. But I don't think btc is the best coin and I don't think the current price reflects it's current real world value whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:19:09
If that's the case why not just make the full amount at the start and auction it off? Why design it so that the first people become insanely rich on the backs of the last investors like a pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:26
At 0. Much stable. Very currency.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:17
So you're saying... This is good for bitcoin

Used car is a weird way to spell drugs
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:35:46
It's not a legit currency. It's some business owners wanting to jump on the hype train.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:29:23
I was focusing on the "legit" part. Yes it can be used as a currency, but that's a tiny part of what it's used for. No sane person would want their salary to be paid out in bitcoin.

I bought weed online for 25btc

Youre very right, bitcoin would be perfect. But I doubt it'll have caught on that much by then...
I'm travelling with a buddy and we have a one-way flight to Indonesia beginning of august. There we have two nights in a hostel and the rest will be pretty spontaneous. Except for an appointment for a paragliding course two month later in thailand :)
Pretty curious of what I'll be waking up to tomorrow. If its completely crashed I might by some more and then force myself to not look at their value until I start my journey :D What am I talking about I could never keep myself from not checking all the time...

Most people don't realize how happy they should be, not only about the place they have been born in, but also about the time.
As someone who values actually visiting other cultures and seeing great nature very high thinks it's ridiculously inexpensive to do so right now. Also, a ridiculous amount of people work 9-5, watch tv afterwards and spend their time on expensive clothes and silly lie-on-a-beach-get-drunk-in-the-evening-holidays to relieve their stress from the job.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:14:31
I dont have too many more than you either, in fact I obviously wish i had spent more at a time where I could have afforded it.
At 200€ the value of my btc was about 20% of the money I had and since I'm just a student who plans to travel the world from august on, on a pretty low budget, that money is very valuable for me and probably more than I should invest.
