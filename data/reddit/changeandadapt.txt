When fees have come down, I will transfer my coins to a Segwit address.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:34:30
answer that and I'll deliver your lambo

can't be taken seriously with a 3-week old acct. just because aantonop says it's a bubble doesn't mean anything bad for bitcoin or crypto currencies. he may be right. notice how andreas cares more about the tech than the price? that's why we like him. if we wanted someone screaming "MOON" everyday we'd follow someone else.

unrelated to bitcoin, but if this is really all the touchbar is good for, then I'm glad I went with the non-touchbar model. I haven't seen people rave about that extra screen that much, now that I think about it.

how long have you been holding? china ban and flippening were minor stuff. alts will go up but that won't kill BTC. not gonna tell you what to do but I'm holding for sure. it feels nice to ride the waves, it's like the feeling of a boat getting bounced around. you feel like it's gonna roll over but it never does.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:14:45
it's pretty classic whale play, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:18:07
there is some very measured shilling happening. it's very easy to start doubting who's shilling, core or cash? i would advise anyone to stop reading reddit because it's how shills win, by influencing your ideas. notice that i'm not taking any sides here. best advice is to go for a walk right now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:39:52
maybe. but I want to be in the boat to see it through. if you're happy with your gains you can get out. or take back your initial investment and ride peacefully? I've sure been thinking about that one.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:42:14
humour and fun are for children. i'm so far beyond that, I can't even *understand* how you'd find that fun... I obviously consult these fine forums in hopes of 100% serious, adult discussion. the internet is a very serious place after all. ^^^^^/s
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:33:31
it times out? and when that happens do you get the whole amount back including the fee?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:07:15
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:18:58
lol. I'll take a picture of your house from the moon :)
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:07:26
yea sure but first I want 100x gains dude, only then can btc become stable don't you understand
@_date: 2014-08-18 11:46:03
Just got the alarm on my phone. Anyone know what's happening ?
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:28:31
blah blah blah
@_date: 2016-11-10 00:15:49
Absolutely. That's why countries have a cash reserve in btc. Here in switzerland our mountains are full of Bitcoin. (:
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:36:38
skewed as fuck, since people interested in buying btc are more likely to look it up on Google than people interested in buying gold. also you can't infer from the metrics that people are more *interested*, all we know is there are more instances of the search 'buy bitcoin' than 'buy gold'. but we all already know that, right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:22:17
stop flaunting your wealth. any amount.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:08:11
what the fuck dude.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:11:37
just don't bet a body part on this please
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:10:27
multi-wallet support, when?
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:34:11
Hey I can fix that! For money...
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:19:01
hey this is interesting. would you mind taking a minute to direct me to a place where I can learn more about these predictions?
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:57:30
people are still kind of calling Tesla a fad... :(
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:36:41
shit I need to read the code. is it well commented?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:56:34
this is really interesting. I'm happy to have a stake in this.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:02:23
that's probably part of it, but some of them sound like they have an agenda. not trying to be paranoid here, but some of the comments are overblown.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:28:26
I was commenting about this during the dip. Every single comment was repeating the same pessimistic stuff, and they were taking the high ground on people as "it's just rational to cut your losses now, since BTC is heading to 0". It was clearly astroturfing in my eyes, most of these accounts were less than 8 weeks old.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:28:47
I wonder if the doubters here are genuine. There's room for doubt over BTC's future, but this is overblown. It makes sense though, if you think about it: lots of noobs come here in hopes to predict the future, and they'll get worn down if they read lots of pessimistic comments. Claims that BTC is dead (or even more stupid, that crypto is dead) are almost comical... back in 2013 when MtGox crashed, it was a believable statement, but right now? Kind of a stretch. There are hurdles in the way but if you really think they can crash the price to 0, you're not seeing straight. If you really did follow the first rule, it should be easy enough to wait this out. Let things unfold... never get too excited or too pessimistic.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:33:40
the amount of negativity on this sub is staggering. it's also coming from many young accounts... are they noobs who bought high and sold low? or a coordinated move? if you spread negativity you can influence the mood a good bit. wonder where this is going.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:11:31
wouldn't it be plain catastrophic if the price of Bitcoin went below mining cost? then miners would just stop mining this coin and go where their expenses are covered?
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:03:11
is there really a shortage? prices could just go up because demand goes up, Nvidia has us by the balls anyways
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:09:50
this needs to be addressed asap
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:52:17
but that's not instantaneous. it's what the Bcash fools wanted to achieve, I think: miners go away temporarily, sure, but long enough to kill off the coin. or at least that's my understanding.

@_date: 2018-02-16 22:49:07
another thing I find notable about these videos is how they attempt to explain the concept in a few simple (but accurate) words, and fail at getting anyone to understand. expressions like "international information network" or "decentralized currency network" kind of seem understandable, they don't use "big words" or anything. but in reality they are as dense as you can get, each word could be unpacked for hours.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:16:31
the two are not mutually exclusive. of course we're in it for the money, but why do we choose Bitcoin over AAPL stock? I have a stronger feeling of belonging to the peer to peer community, so that orients my choice.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:42:28
wonder how many old timers are panic selling. people from 2012 or before cannot possibly be panicking... I held through years of bear market, how is the current dip supposed to scare me??
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:04:51
yeah that's not how it works, sorry.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:30:25
only when the price is going down tho :p
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:17:53
all these flavors, and you chose to be salty :/
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:00:02
believe, friend. is good advice from very intelligent person.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:37:57
haha wow did you come out of a time machine from 2012? XD
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:15:13
in all seriousness, the despair phase will really be here once the majority of people have lost faith in BTC and cryptocurrencies in general. The 2013/14 crash was like that, and I was a noob, so I believed it. I thought "fuck it, bitcoin was just a meme". This is the real danger. You have to resist this thought, even when it seems like the truest truth. I have no idea if it will happen this time, but I'd say there's a fair chance. Don't lose faith and you'll be smiling during the next bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:16:20
congrats, now all you gotta do is wait 5 years :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:53:06
^ said everyone during every crash before. looks like the despair phase.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:39:36
the mean is on a steady rise on the graph. which is exactly what we're getting.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:33:53
Yep. It's just impressive because 4-digit numbers
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:01:45
wait 6 months.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:39:30
another article using physical coins to illustrate bitcoin. yeesh
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:38:06
no one can answer for you. do you still believe in bitcoin?
