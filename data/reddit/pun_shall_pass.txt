Why would you put anything into crypto if you dont have trust that the coins will rise in or hold their value?
You have to make some assuptions and trust that there will be some reward long term.

kind of a dumb scene to use since in the movie it was literally a moment of refusing to exit while he was on top because of his ego and subsequently losing all he had

Seems to me like you didnt know what you were doing and panic sold when the price started to drop, so I return to my original question

Stuff like this can be a self-fulfilling prophecy though.
- guy says bull run imminent
- news articles get written about it all around
- plebs start buyin en masse
- suddenly bull run
tldr buy

Could you please explain to a noob what that exactly is? As of now I have some money on Coinbase, should I move them to a software wallet?
Ive been trying to research this stuff on my own, but as I found out people are kind of split on this with thinking its a bad thing and people should not trust coinbase with their money and who say the opposite.
What is Segwit2x anyway?

Oh, they have Bitcoin on computers now...
