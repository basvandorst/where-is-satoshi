CoinJar has an app on the App Store you know. Not sure if iPad optimised but it probably works better than the web browser.

Ha, it's already landed in my country. Too late now.

Is there way to increase the BTC limit in CoinJar? I set it too low and can't cash out at all anymore. Support didn't respond.

Does eBay allow HTML in listings? I could integrate a payment option within the listing but for obvious reasons eBay would be very against that. 
Is there a service that converts BTC received at an address into a fiat currency? Then I could just list BTC addresses on listings and an email to receive the post address?

CoinJar is still available to me. (AU)

Is that a... Windows Vista logo?

I signed up for the card having already had a CoinJar account for some time. If anything it's a great exposure for BitCoin when you use it at shops that don't accept it yet.

I've continued to use it because even as a wallet it's very good. BTC markets have nearly same day processing when converting BTC-&gt;AUD-&gt;Bank Account. The site just seems a bit...bare.

Plot Twist: It's full of Dogecoins.

The extremely strange thing is I can still download Blockchain's old app. Even if the only way is when restoring my phone, but it's still there on the store somehow.

I switched a week ago, before this whole 51% chaos started.

This would be more exciting if it was a crater on the moon.

It's supposed to be, that's how their front page works.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:11:01
At least it's the right logo.

Returns? Having downloaded it when it was released I didn't even notice it left.

I wish charities in Australia accepted Bitcoin since we have the services to make it possible.
Would like to see Royal Flying Doctor Service accept bitcoin.

I know this sounds like a good idea but the vending machines where I am let me pay by just tapping my card which is quicker and currently easier than BitCoin. Would be nice though.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:45:43
What about CoinJar?
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:57:10
Might just re-purpose it as a small heater then?

I'm in the souther hemisphere, summer is coming...
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:16:29
I paid with PayPal, is it even possible to get a refund?
If so how?
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:11:46
Not spending them and waiting for them to go up in price is the only hope?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:38:30
Looks like it's crashing now, $542.

I started bitcoin mining in 2011 with GPUs.
So what's your advice since I've already ordered?
