well said. people seem to forget that the powers that be ([inter]national banking houses - basically our Pharaohs) are still here while at that very moment the same people are paying their mortgages off to them..  i am an adult but from time to time i still get astonished by the human naivety

sent doesn't neccesarily mean received &amp; 
almost 0 is the same as "almost virgin"

"almost 0 fees" does NOT mean that there are multiple ways... it simply means that some kind of fee exists.
it sounds to me like one of them retarded commercials, tho it's really simple - EITHER there IS a fee, OR there IS NOT.
"we were never talking about receiving bitcoins" lol, if you go to your bank you expect the wire you just sent also to arrive,right? not exactly what happened here with malleability f̶e̶a̶t̶u̶r̶e̶ bug. you see, the problem with BTC is that you actually have to wait for confirmations. it really is not so complicated to try doublespends every time you pay for something - and every time the seller is waiting for confirmation BTC is becoming obsolete for end-user as he requires transactions do be complete within seconds, not minutes. quicker crypto's &gt; BTC /thread
