Invest sure, but make sure you protect it from hackers with 2 auth. Nothing like losing an investment to robbery by forgetting to lock the correct doors.

Unfortunately I'm going to have to contend that this is true for me. I've had a good portion (under 1k, but that's not just change to me) go lost after a market place went down. My osx machine is teaming with malware I recently discovered.
I thought macs couldn't get viruses!? Wrong.  cat /etc/services shows my box is teaming with life! Did some research I these and I have some very advanced malware that seems to be blocking booting from Tails. Cant install kerpensky virus scanner eithier. A lot of command and control malware, remote desktop protocols, even gps tracking software!  A holes even installed SETI on my box.
Even industrial controllers for factories and hvac systems.  Some nasty shit! I'm probably on a watch list at this point lol.   
Anyway...i recommend 2 factor with yubi key.  As well, only log into your wallet (i choose to host mine on coinbase) from a secured Tails machine. The only large threat to a secured Tails install using torbrowser  is hacked i/o controller or bios firmware, which we havent seen too often in the wild other than from nation states.

Does that mean he gets his eeed via mail too?

Which of the two smells worse?

I was just thinking about a geo aware app that awards bitcoin for tasks. Like..you could be walking down the street and someone could pin small bitcoin awards to something like washing a car. You take a pic when your finished, it gets peer reviewed and then the bitcoin award is released to you.

Sounds as though they shafted you by refusing to respond and closing your case early, perhaps hoping the problem would just go away.  Glad you got your monies back.

Shake rattle and role. Price moves means money for day traders. I wouldn't be surprised if this was manufactured to do just that.

Winklevoss twins are like the suge knight of tech. No wait there's two of them. Winklevoss twins are like the twins in the matrix franchise.

I think people are missing a point of bitcoin. We liked it because the tech was solid and couldn't be manipulated. Now they are adding all this new code in so we have no idea how it will hold up to edge cases and expose unforseen attack vectors.
It's just as risky as a central governed fiat currency at this point.

Theyre just really expensive along with all Apple products in Russia. I worked with some outsourced tech guys from there and each time they returned home they'd buy a mac book pro just to sell it cheaper to their friends back home.

I just care about my privacy and persuit of happiness and I try not to do anything illegal. Who knows though. When you're targetted it's like a cop following you everywhere you drive and eventually he'll fish long enough and get you for an infraction.

An ETF sounds counter intuituve to the way bitcoin works.  Why gamble on a future price when you can just buy the coin without market manipulation

I have coinbase.com linked to my bank account to purchase on a weekly basis. I think I'm up to 3 trillion now. (Adjusted for to-the-moon forecasted inflation)

IMO That's what is hard for newbies to grasp.

But what are BTC version of pennies?  Bits?
