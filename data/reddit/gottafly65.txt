well - that confirms it for me. I was thinking about giving paper wallets this Christmas and wondered if it would be a scummy thing to make a copy of the paper wallet before giving it to them. (it's my own kids so its not like a bait and switch). I just wanted a little insurance in case they lost them...
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:33:46
yeah that was my plan - transferred it from coinbase to gdax, but you cannot currently sell it there - it is frozen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:54:49
okay - I setup an account at hitbtc. I did a test transfer to make sure it works. Sent .001 BCH over and it is not showing up anywhere. So, either that is too small an amount to register or I need to give it some time to show up. Where can I go to see how many confirmations I have on the transfer so I can make sure it is even processing?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:53:13
I'm planning to stop trading for at least a week or longer just to see what happens. I have come up with a pretty good trading scheme that is working for me and getting me nice small increases even during this bull run. However, I'm pretty sure it will not work anymore once next week hits and if I try doing business as usual I will probably start LOSING bitcoin.

got up to go to the bathroom and totally MISSED ENTIRE $17k.... WTF?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:12
I'm hoping for a dump... I started trickle selling some off 3 days ago because I did not see this going... thought we were at ATH back then... ha ha.
So, now I need to see 13,068 to get back in... (no, this is not all my BTC... this is just the part I play idiot with)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:22:29
looks like it could take up to 12 hours to show up... so, now I have to decide if I want to do the full transfer and hope they show up or just wait for gdax to unfreeze and take my chances there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:21:29
I have my coins on a ledger. However on Aug 1st they were on Coinbase. So they just credited me the BCH. 
So - you don't sell Bitcoin forks because you want to have a stake in all possibilities?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:04:19
and.... I think that is why your prices shocked everyone... just tossing some random dates into expedia from DFW to Tokyo for two people is about $1,100 per person... so, that makes your trip $3,486. Still something that could be saved up for or only sell a tiny fraction of your bitcoin... (.17 BTC @ $20k)
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:02:33
I guess I should have used the word "cryptocurrency" instead of "bitcoin" - the are all just against crypto in general.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:59:24
yes - you are correct... I have been trading BTC and ETH and I'm fully aware that there is no guarantee which way they will go or how high/low they will go. I was just interested in checking the math given the numbers presented. This was also based on the price of BTC/ETH at the time I typed it and those have changed now.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:50:02
yeah - I hate to say it, but part of my motivation to not tell is because I don't want someone over my shoulder giving me advice (sell now, sell now) when I've been HODLing since 2013. 
I'm thinking about doing much what you are saying - letting them know about the opportunity again, but not disclosing my own purchases unless they ask and in that case I'm only sharing that info with wife...
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:03:44
I use Trello for my business and had not thought of using it in this way - I think it is pretty cool and plan to read through it and share it with friends/family.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:17:58
you must have a lot of money then. I'm trading and I only have the money that I have in BTC. So, in order for me to buy when it drops to $7200 that means I had to sell some at $7600. Everyone here knows that as soon as you think $x is the high and you sell hoping it will fall... it goes UP... now, you are stuck with fiat that cannot buy back the same BTC you lost. So, you have to wait and wait hoping it will finally drop back down to $7200. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:08
holy shit - just got back in!!!! I was so tempted to give up / loose .02 and just buy back in when it kept soaring past $10k.... but, I held out and got super lucky. I'm not up .012 from where I started... could have been a hell of a lot more if I had started selling off much higher... but damn, each time I sold a little it was ATH and another ATH and another ATH... just glad I didn't lose any.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:21:19
true - just did some math...
if you had $5k to spend you could buy
13.58 ETH which @ $500 would be $6,790
.6053 BTC which @ $10k would be $6,053
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:25:56
yeah, I'm in the same boat as you guys... had a pretty good system where I would sell .02 when it spiked really fast and then buy back .0202 as it dropped. If it kept spiking I just sell another .02 and increase my buy back to .0404 and so on... well DAMN, this rocket has been going straight up since I started my trickle sell at $8,700. So, now I need it to drop to $9146 to get a 1% BTC gain on what I've sold... if I give up my 1% gain I think it would still have to drop to $9288 to end up with the same BTC I started with... I'm an idiot... that is a lot of stress for the minor increase in BTC if I even get that lucky...

transfer to an exchange and selling to USD to buy a dip DOES create a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:30:08
I can remember trying to setup a miner back when it was actually possible... gave up on it before I finished it because whatever... and, could have bought bitcoin back in 2010... but, small town couldn't figure out how to buy them... we all play these mental games with ourselves... IF ONLY... what if I had bought 200 BTC for $1 each and now I would be a millionaire... SURE, but if you had that kind of insight into the future you could also go buy a winning lottery ticket this week. Also, if you knew with 100% certainty that Bitcoin was going to hit some crazy high like $100k per coin... go sell your house and put all your money in. True is... you don't know today just like you didn't know yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:24:29
I did put together an "in case I die" package with instructions for my family. Didn't think about putting a good explanation of HODLing in there - but, I do think I put in my explanation of why I bought and what I thought it could amount to.

I'll chime in too. I just like that my wife and enjoy watching reruns of it while eating dinner and she gets to hear terms that I deal with on a daily basis (programming, 3d printing, etc). Also my wife and I are big Star Trek &amp; Star Wars (original episodes) fans so we get a kick out of that part of the show as well. I'm a 50+ year old programmer who owns bitcoin so I don't know how I fit their demographic.

as others have already said - the sample in the photo has not been used and is just an example. However, it is very likely the seller has recorded all keys for the items he is selling.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:22:35
I've been HODLing since 2013. I just thought I would finally share with them because of possible Wall Street coming up and price getting way high... but, they are not interested because it is crazy risky. I'm okay with this - I just didn't want to be keeping my "money making secret" from them... now that I have shared the news I can drive my future Lambo with no regrets.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:37:14
yeah - ironically, the person that I really want to get in is my wife. She has a large chuck of money she inherited nine years ago and it is just sitting in a credit union barely making interest. She is afraid of investing it anywhere and just holds on to it in case there is "an emergency" in our family (medical / legal / etc). I think she is afraid to spend on anything because you know how nest eggs are... you start dipping into it for one thing and the next you know there is no more nest egg. So, she is pretty protective of it.  I just really want her to understand that whether she buys bitcoin or not - I don't care - it's her money to invest or NOT. But, I want to share this info with her.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:27:15
I totally agree and have read all the "DON'T TRADE" info from people. I've also lost quite a bit learning to trade. As long as I don't get greedy and watch the flow I can get a little here and there. I'm just trying to increase my BTC back up to where it was before I started learning. Then, I'll decide if I want to give up trading or not. Also, I'm not playing with all my BTC... just a portion. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:24:36
you should engrave a QR code on the other side and post the pic here - people would likely send you BTC for the hell of it.

if you are on GDAX there are no fees for limits and stops...
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:33:37
I have absolutely no issue with paying taxes on money I made in bitcoin. I just wish that I could hold off on paying those taxes until 8 years from now when I "cash out" and transfer USD into a bank account (if that kind of transaction is even needed in 8 years). Point is, I'm just not keen on having to report and pay taxes every year just because I'm playing around with trading or holding... then, god forbid 5 years from now bitcoin tanks and the government says "oh sorry, you can only declare a loss if xyz so we don't owe you any of that money you paid us back..."
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:37:36
just to join in your misery and share my pain. I had 2.5 and found out about gdax $0 fee trades. What a great way to slowly increase my 2.5. Wouldn't it be awesome to have 10 coins when I retire in 8 years. Started out easy... doing tiny increases of .0001 or something like that. Quickly realized I was spending 6 hours a day staring at the screen for about a $10 increase... all while ignoring my freelance job that makes 10x that per hour. You know... because the "skills" I'm learning will pay off in the end... I started increasing my trade amounts and taking a bit more risk to speed up the process...so, here I am now DOWN .35 coin after three weeks of messing with this. If instead I had left the coin alone, done my real work and dropped 5% of that back into BTC I would be so much farther ahead. So, my ledger nano S came in yesterday and I'm moving that stuff on there so I will quit being as tempted.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:10:27
I find it funny that everyone in here starts talking about the $100k + jackpot this guy must be digging up... he said he only mined bitcoin for a few weeks... how many could you really get in that time frame back then? I don't know the answer - I'm sure the time required to solve was much lower - so, possibly he did get quite a few bitcoin mined. But, for it to be $200k he would have mined 35-45 coins. Is that possible?

it is not totally fee free to get started... you have to get money transferred into gdax which is like .03 percent or something. Not bad. Then, once you are in gdax (which is coinbase exchange) you can do limit trades for no fees. So, you can just sit there all day trying to trade up/down and the only cost is your mistakes.

I'm sitting at a computer job all day long doing support calls. Off to one side is my laptop running GDAX on a 28" monitor... so, I kinda have a lot of time on my hands to just watch it all day.

can't believe I'm actually hoping for it to drop... after playing "Mr Forex trader dude" I now need it to drop to 5398 so I can get back in without losses... no need to tell me what an idiot I am...
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:21:37
I have no problem paying them - I just thought I would be able to play around with my bitcoin until I retire and then when/if I start actually using them to buy stuff I would announce to family "Hey - guess what? gottafly65 is gonna pay off the house and buy a new car for the wife" (and would then pay my cut to taxes) - kind of like when you have a CD or a 401k that you are just storing your savings in until you retire.

I have never taken the money from coinbase back to my bank. However, I did move some from coinbase over to gDax to do some trading. What I'm reading is that as soon as I "sold those bitcoin to fiat on gdax I must pay taxes on those gains...even though I immediately invested it right back into bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:18:28
I bought at $1,025 and it dropped to less than $300... and stayed low for YEARS...

someone will surely correctly me if I'm wrong - but, I think you only avoided half the fees when you could have avoided even more. I too have coinbase and recently got gDax. With the bank account connected to coinbase you can actually go straight from bank account into gDax and I think it is either 0 fees or lower than coinbase. So, if you go Bank TO gDax (buy bitcoin) TO Coinbase you would get off the cheapest.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:59:37
I'm not sure on the logic here - I transferred some bitcoin to gdax and did a bit of trading. I'm told the second I sold bitcoin to USD on gdax (even though I bought right back into bitcoin on the next dip) I "realized my gains in USD = owe taxes"
I was kinda hoping that I could do some trading and only pay taxes when I converted USD from coinbase to my official brick and motar bank.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:04:00
yeah - I don't have a problem with the justification for paying the taxes... I just wanted to keep my bitcoin a secret from my family until after retirement so I could hopefully surprise everyone with a golden egg in my nest... because of the taxes issue it looks like I will have to tell wife about bitcoin which then opens up the whole - you should sell it and pay this bill OR it's silly and it's going to crazy... it's a pyramid scheme, etc, etc... I've been hodling since 2013 so I'm pretty good about ignoring the bad news and just hodling. My wife will be a different story... every time she hears something on TV she will be freaking and begging me to sell it.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:18:15
ha - no. I don't even have a fraction of that... I'm one of those guys hoping to get one coin...and hoping that one day that coin will be worth $1 million. I know - a long shot... but, better than buying lottery tickets. Also - I have my stuff on a ledger nano. I just put a small bit on gdax to play with trading.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:37:26
totally agree... my plan is to move everything to my nano s before the 25th and then just sit on it for a while. I've been hodling since 2013 so it is not really about the dollars at this point - was just goofing around trying to increase my BTC a by .5 and instead looks like I'm decreasing it by .5 - let that be a lesson to ya boys and girls...

I signed up for gDax. You can transfer money from your bank right into gDax for low or no fees (much less than transferring straight to coinbase). Then, you can watch the market and do a limit buy (no fees) when the price is right. Next, withdraw it out to your hardware wallet or where ever.
