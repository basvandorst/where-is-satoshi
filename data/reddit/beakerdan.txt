Why would you give up then?  Hold it for 10 years and buy a big condo?

I'm not going to lie, I don't have a lot of money in bitcoin, I think this is a bubble, and it'll crash the first time someone from Silk Road/etc is prosecuted.

Well, right now, you can buy things with it.  But all of those things are illegal drugs on SR.  The future of bitcoins depends on what you can spend them on. 
And everybody else, don't downvote him for having an opinion about the future demands for bitcoins.  r/bitcoin shouldn't just be a circlejerk about how bitcoin is going to hit $1m/coin.

I hadn't heard about that, but some quick research suggests that he wasn't found via the bitcoin block chain.

It looks to me like you received a MtGox redeemable code.  Try creating a wallet on MtGox, and redeeming the code, and then if you want, sending the coins from that wallet to your blockchain wallet.

Yup, and you'll be able to pay the owner of the private bridge in bitcoins before crossing them... And the day you need to pay the private fire department, hope that MtGox isn't lagging.

Ah thank you good sir. Now I can't get away.

I'm interested in the economics, but don't have a hand in the market yet.

Yea, but when you cash out, you have to claim the capital gains.

But isn't that still a reason why it would be a fiat currency?  If it turns out there's a flaw in the algorithm, your bitcoins would be worthless.  But if you're using cows as currency, and then no one wants to trade with cows any more, you still get milk and beef.

Begging for a tip?

That isn't a great definition of fiat currency.  I'm not taking a stance on whether bitcoins should be called fiat currency, but a better term is a currency that doesn't have any inherent value.  Using gold: not fiat.  Using cows: not fiat.  Bitcoins: ? (is there an inherent value in 'anonymity'? I'm not sure)

Welcome to the evolving world of bitcoin, where bitcoin exchanges will start charging large fees for transactions, just like traditional banks...

Rule number 1 of the internet: If you say "Not sure if a scam", assume scam and move on.  You may miss out on some small wins...but you avoid a lot of big losses.
