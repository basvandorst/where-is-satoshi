I read this and all I thought is who cares?
They will figure it out if needed.

Totally fair, as I personally would have no idea about the technology behind it and would be focused on other aspects.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:54:01
You are way too focused on the technology aspect and nothing else.  You have shown your lack of macro thinking on this issue and only focused on the technology behind it.  
Which is fair, you're IT.

Not saying it will follow it spot on, but it can help provide some reality to the euphoria from all the profits.

What is this for? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:51:22
Sure.   That would mean we will hit 10k+ valuation in the true bubble.  I'd love that but I seriously doubt we will see that price within these next few months.

Not a lifetime chart.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:16:31
Past bubbles follow this pretty well.

I always look at what this subreddit is saying and will bet against it.  It's a really fun game that works out more often than you would think.

I think a lot of people completely understand this but would rather use a form of currency that is much more widely accepted and now frowned upon by most banks and major financial institutions.  But that's just me, I guess other people prefer to just hold on a currency with a much higher risk for failure.

I have my sources, no need for folks appealing to a market of followers.

It's like this video is directed towards people going into their first Economics course.  Cute

I'm not new to the game, I don't need you telling me how to invest in bitcoin. 
I appreciate all work you put into the reply, but this is a cookie cutter guide to someone who doesn't know how/doesn't want to put in any effort.

To put your trust in a company that shares the same values...?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:04:56
Stop flooding the subreddit with shit like this.  
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:19:45
Sounds like someone has trust issues.  
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:04:17
And now might be the worst time to buy.  You make a lot of assumptions with what seems to be little to no thought.  
At least memes can support your investment decisions.  
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:30:46
That's another way to look at it. I could see that happening, if that were the case.
