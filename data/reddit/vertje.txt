I don't know how many BTC are lost but is It worth fixing the screen on you phone? Or you can buy a Apple lightning digital av adapter so you can use your tv as your phones display (assuming the touch function of your phone is still working) 
Good luck mate :)

Yeah true, but this doesn't mean we have to stick 'forever' with 1mb blocks? Isn't it possible to scale a bit on the blocksize and simultaneous with some secondary level of payment systems?

Maybe people are complaining because the fees ARE high and transactions take longer than usual. Not everything is an attack.....

Cool to see that more &amp; bigger brands in the Netherlands starts to accept Bitcoin. I have a work appointment in Arnhem tomorrow and i'm gonna test it with a Bitcoin payment! Yeah

Woh; many many nodes in the Netherlands (nodes per inhabitants they are no.1) Is there a special reason why?

Not surprising:
- Wealthy country with 130 million inhabitants
+- 20 years low or negative intrest, so people are looking for investments with higher returns.
- Dropped consumption tax on bitcoin a few months ago

Good reaction man

Good news! For sure i'm gonna buy some burgers and pay with BTC. Good so an increasing number of BTC accepting venues in Arnhem (I already pay some of my grosseries in BTC in the supermarket around the corner)

The more competition, the better! 
Ohw and also a more secure netwerk :)

Is there a way to add more fees in order to push the transaction forward?

Still waiting, over 36 hours now... This blocksize limit is killing Bitcoin user experience! 
Edit: While I was typing this it got confirmed..

Thank you for this wonderful app! 
Will the be an option where I can give some addresses different labels?

I thinks this has everything to do with Coinbase adding Litecoin...
