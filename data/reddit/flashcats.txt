I ask you the same thing.

Try paying for that dinner in bitcoins. 
Also, I can only think of one restaurant which you'd need hundreds of dollars for a meal and they don't take credit/debit cards.

Again, I could say the same thing to you. 
You're the one that made the sweeping statement in the first place.

What about business months?
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:51:13
I don't think that is solid logic. Its like saying I've been sick tons of times in life and I've come back so that means it can't die from illness.

What are you talking about? I paid for my college tuition one semester in cash. I had no issues.
Also, I'm a minority so homeland security was probably watching my ass.

You were bad at summarizing the facts because you glossed over all the bad things he did. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:35:58


This is such a fucking bullshit way to explain what he did.

Really? Overstock.com uses Bitcoin and I don't see their executives going to jail.
I wonder if it might have something to do with the goods and services that you could buy on Silk Road.

If that was the case, then he didn't do a very good job of showing it at his trial. 
What evidence did he use to show that?
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:37:52


I think we have very different ideas of what that means.
If someone asks you who was OJ Simpson, do you respond that he was a NFL running back?

You are good at using "just" in inappropriate times.
"Just some dude in SF who liked getting high"
"Just operate the site"

He went to jail for running Silk Road where people sold drugs. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:31:25
There is some paranoid shit going on here.
He was punished for running the Silk Road.
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin unless you think Bitcoin's primary purpose is for illegal goods and services.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:46:33
You do realize that's not the reason he went to jail right?
The murder charges were dropped early in the process.
Also, I'll let you know that solicitation of murder is also illegal and most states have sever punishments. I believe that the police believed that he solicited and paid for six murders.

Tell them if you don't get a refund, you will stand outside of their hotel holding up pictures of the bedbugs and yelling that the hotel will not give you a refund. 
See how fast they change their tune.

That's not what a fall guy is.
A fall guy is an innocent guy convicted so other people can get away.
He is the opposite of fall guy. He was at the top of the food chain and he was taken down.

Banks love Bitcoin. I have no idea where you're coming from.
