I know, and it's only because I've got what's needed right now that I considered it

Which model did you order? if you don't mind my asking. That's a pretty hefty investment

Very nice. I think if I get really lucky on my tax return I'll be halfway to the new jacked up price lol

Is there a lube you recommend?

Absolutely, like I said electricity is relatively cheap here. And I really don't have to worry about climate control fortunately, it stays pretty chilly in-building. Thanks for the encouragement

As waves of adoption spread, I feel pretty strongly that there will be at least another one (when it actually goes mainstream and people try to ride that wave), possibly two depending on how long it takes for everyone else to get on board past that initial swell: the very late adopters. Regular mining would have stopped significantly by then, I can only assume that large firms will have supercomputers, or arrays of ps4s crunching out the new blocks

Not even sure yet, I was working on synchronizing my wallet and setting up another computer as well, thinking about litecoin just for fun with that one. When I get it up and running I'll be sure to let you know
