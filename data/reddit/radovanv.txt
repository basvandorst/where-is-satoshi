Self-reply is very true.
My reply would actually be: most things which we consider to be the "world" are products of man's ingenuity, and  certainly most of the stuff which we trade for money is. So far, my experience leads me to the conclusion that our ingenuity and creativity is infinite. Therefore, the world is infinite.

I thought the sarcasm in my post was obvious. Still new to posting on reddit, I expected a chain of troll posts for replies. 
Thank you for the thoughtful reply, though. I just disagree with point number three, as past performance is all that we can rely on. Since we do not know the future, we can only try to extrapolate likely scenarios from past events.

Economic good: a good that is scarce and valuable. He admits scarcity and argues the "value" part.
He then proceeds to argue that the only reason btc is currently valuable is because people want (demand) it. Schiff neglected to mention that every single good has any value precisely for that reason. People either want assets to use them or because they believe those assets will be valuable in the future (store of value). In this regard, Gold is exactly the same as btc, except that it has a much longer track record. As far as it being replaced by some better currency, that happens to gold all the time (think palladium)
However, Peter is a very smart and educated investor and has a number of valid points on most finance-related subjects.

It isn't out of the woods yet by a long shot. A single address holds more than 1/16 of all currently issued bitcoins, and that is more than enough to significantly move markets.
The whole market cap of $56 billion is also a relatively low sum for an institutional whale.
That being said, market manipulation happens in much more established markets. Gold and silver are a prime example of this. Google it. Also, every year some large bank pays a hefty fine for market manipulation in Forex. Deutsche Bank did it in 2016. This doesn't prevent small day traders from making profits in those markets.
The existence of other cryptos has nothing to do with it, as was previously explained using the example of precious metals.

If that's your problem, then I want to buy your house for -1 billion dollars!

Lambos still await you, young grasshopper!

Sound reasoning? Ok, here we go...
1. Look prices bruh!! Never before at $3800 and you want to sell? Fool!
2.This is only the beginning. Interwebz predicts from $500,000 to $5,000,000 per coin. He would lose most of the gainz if he sells
3. $1,000 in btc in 2009 = 1,000,000,000. Look at dem zeroes. Nuff said!
Point: sell house and car, buy bitcoins and rent, wait 5 years, buy 10 lambos- one for every ho you have.
