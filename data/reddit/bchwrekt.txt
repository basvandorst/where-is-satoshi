Withdrawing all funds.  The accumulation of problems and the sneaky addition of BCH and lack of Segwit implementation is too much to trust Coinbase any longer.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:27
Seriously, you need to pay attention.  Ver is Killing BTC every day in the media.  You want to deny that?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:09:02
You jinxed it
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:51:01
More to the point, are institutional investors pumping up the value of bitcoin only to buy put futures? They make money on both sides if they sell their bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:29:46
Well played!  That sell wall wasn’t even a snack.  20 seconds and done.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:45
And this is why BCH has won the fight.  The battle looms.

I hate everything about this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:14
I ain't never seen anything like this - HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:38:14
sell walls were made to be eatin'!  You can expect it to stay at that sell wall while the buyers tear it down, not necessarily a dip, but resistance.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:02:01
I knew there was no fee from GDAX for the withdrawal, but I had no idea they actually paid the fee.  GO GO GDAX!

Buy on the way down, or on the way up.  Don't try to catch a falling knife, you'll get cut, bro.

Hardly seems "low energy".  They are getting 100x the press BTC is getting.  They grab the uninformed "low hanging fruit" and BTC continues to decline as the ignorant media continues to give them the spotlight.

No, market orders are filled instantly at the market price with a fee.  The Limit order will be filled as your buy/sell “Limit” price is reached and then executed.  It’s possible to have a Limit order only partially executed if the price is moving fast.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:08:41
That sell wall at $17,250 is up to 2,300 now - wonder if the price will slump like that last one did yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:18:12
And then there’s always the sell off after the sellabration.  I just hope the sell off isn’t the same as it was at $10k.  Then again, I don’t have any money ready to buy otherwise I’d  be singing a different tune, lalalala
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:35
Back away from the bong and watch three major news  channels.  Ver is killing it.  If you can’t see that then you are not paying attention.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:52:55
Moving all coins out of GDAX (done) - They dropped the grenade, let's toss it back.

Fucked up, sorry man.  Sell it fast, it’s a crap coin.

Saw it for about 5 seconds, Gulp.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:27
Really?  I think you need to change the channel, bro.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:45:15
Can't believe the order hasn't canceled - the wall is being eaten.  Amazing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:27:35
To be clear for those without coins... BCH is killing BTC in the media game.
Pay the fuck attention shill.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:41:25
Seems odd - Ebay will refund the buyer under ANY/ALL circumstances.  Bitcoin don't play that game.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:53:57
yup, I was thinking about 45 minutes with average trading pressure - that's "a while" in Bitcoin time.

This is why “organizations” have a CEO.  It’s also why BCH is killing BTC right now.  Ver has the media eating out of his hand.
Edit:  just went to cash.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:54:09
That does not appear to be the case, this time, yet.

HODL, man - the futures are looking great!
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:55:45
RUN, don’t walk from Kraken.  GET OUT while you can.  They are an exploding outhouse!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:12:00
HODL!  Seams $17’ish is strong resistance.  Need to clean out the weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:08:08
I can’t down-vote your ass enough.  
You don’t understand any of this do you?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:09
Buddy, my point is narrow... I am referring to driving the media narrative over the past 72 hours.  
As far as crush, please be certain, compare the BTC chart with that of the BCH chart and perhaps we can agree on what I was referring to in my post about “crushed”.  
I’m a BTC champion, but I am smart enough to recognize a +10 strike.  I hope you are as well or your coins will soon be mine.
Edit:  bad English all around, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:20:45
Take a look at look at December and January Futures price.  HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:32:24
It's working.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:27:10
I think from today's earlier selloff on the news of BCH being offered on GDAX/Coinbase that a firm floor was set at  in the short term.  I concede that $12K could be support with another 24 hours of the Ver show WoRdWiDe!
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:00:13
I can't understand why anyone would want to get in front of this wall to sell?  This seems like a sure sign that things are going to run up once that wall is eaten.  Am I missing something?  
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:59:38
Yup, and it will take a while to eat that wall based on 24 hour volume.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:42:47
Dont feel bad, I did literally the exact same thing.  Now hoping it dont crash through the floor.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:24:22
Into coingbase/gdax?  eh... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:16
Sure, okay, annoyed ... see ya tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:06:49
Ah, great man!  Thanks!  I didn’t realize that existed in there.  Looked at advanced under Limit but not Stop.  Really appreciate you pointing that out.  Assumed it was more about the order processing, ie fill or kill, etc.  and there it is :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:35
Buy order placed at $9k - BCH Wrekt BTC.  Well done, Ver.  I hate you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:48
There is nothing beautiful about this.  BTC is weak and it's being crushed by a shitcoin.  The concept of BTC is pretty, but pretty aint winning.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:31:16
Today I wanted to test a new hardware wallet.  I transferred the lowest amount GDAX would allow, 0.0001 BTC ($1.75).  There was no fee for me to make that transfer and it took approximately 3 hours.  My HW now has 0.0001 BTC ($1.75) in it, no fee was charged to me.  However, looking at the Bitcoin Transaction I can see that there was a fee of 0.00001818 BTC (approx $0.30 USD at the time).   I would like to know is who paid this fee?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:38:05
I'm with ya - my thought was large futures trader and that wall will disappear as soon as it's hit.
edit:  The wall hasn't disappeared and it's being eatin' - amazing.  Based on daily volume this could take while.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:22:16
49 minutes later, looks like we're real close to 'back up there', $17,221
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:45:20
Sounds like that could be a "good thing" for Ebay to start providing sellers some level of fraud protection.

@_date: 2017-12-12 02:21:41
Use Limit - no fee.  Stop is a market order and fee based.  I don’t see a “stop limit” option with GDAX, so limit it is.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:02:32
Pretty much the best comment in the thread. BTC was unusable when I tried to demonstrate it to associates today.  Sadly, I was a day late in selling it all.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:24:00
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:08
Setup a buy limit order at your target price - hopefully, the exchange will be able to fill when it hits.  Better than trying to catch a falling knife.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:39:25
Ding ding ding - so yeah, point made.  Is Kraken truly the shittiest of all the shitty?  My experience is they are offline more than online.

I hope you're right, cause this dip didn't turn out so well for the waiters.  I've loaded the gun and looking for dip next weekend and hope to get back in under $11K

Really appreciate your time, Buddy - I have a few coins and use Trezor and the Nano S - I concur that one should not store coins on exchange unless actively trading.  This was the first thing I learned before buying my first few coins 
I’m moving larger money now and .. fuck kraken.  CB is “better”, but CRAP compared to TDAmeritrade.  Thus, my question.
I just wanted to thank you, once again, for your excellent input. I really appreciate it and I’m sure the community does well.

sell low, buy high?  HODL
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:36:50
Doubtful, my experience is that it is better to know which is the shittiest so you can just avoid that and hope for better.
