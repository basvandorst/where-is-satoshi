Dude. You need to diversity both within cryptocurrency and outside. Fund your 401K/IRA  or retirement accounts. Pay down your debt if you have any. Save some cold hard fiat currency. And buy some cryptocurrency. Enjoy your life also. You might drop dead tomorrow. What are you gonna do with these money if you are dead.

The point of bitcoin is that you cannot so "fuck you" or "good riddance" to anyone. Chinese people cannot easily convert fiat to BTC but they can still use BTC. Ain't nobody can stop them. You know what's gonna happen. A shit tonne of Chinese people in America and elsewhere are gonna buy BTC and send it to Chinese people. The people who send the BTC are gonna get paid in fiat. China just created another market. They should just let exchanges operate legally.

When I saw the $1000 hike last week I thought to myself about how how on gym sometimes I see these assholes running on treadmill at 12mph. Fuckers make so much noise and they crash after literally 30 seconds. Meanwhile the little old lady walking at a brisk speed right next to them at 3 mph goes onto walk for an entire hour to several hours. I want slow and steady and logarithmic bitcoin price appreciation. Also with valid, solid fundamental. Otherwise it's like that asshole from gym.

Jaxx is 3rd party wallet. Right? Yes. I need to pull them off Jaxx. Where do I put it. How do I get a truly offline wallet address. Jaxx split my bitcoin in shitonne of wallets address. I want them in one or fewer address. 
How does hardware wallet generate address? And let say that it does generate an address offline. When I send btc to this address, how does it actually go there? Or does it not go there at all. It's just recorded in blockchain and done deal?
I ain't planning on spending anytime soon. But how do I spend when I do want to spend when I'm a billionaire?  
I should probably order one of those hardware wallet and start playing around with it.

It kind of unfair to take the example of Zimbabwe and hark on rest of the world. For the most part, banking system works. Remember bitcoin only came into being 7 years ago. And even to this day, it's a very small part of overall world financial market. Banking worked for us for thousands of years.
Zimbabwe is an odd case. Here was a country relatively well-off that got a idiot for a ruler and now they have 100 trillion dollars note. 
I would really like to have some of these notes. Can I buy it from someone somewhere?

If I do in fact become millionaire, I don't plan on buying a lambo. All I want is to eat one lobster meal till satisfaction. I don't want to think about money. I don't want to think about the impact this meal will have on my wallet. I just want to enjoy one lobster meal. Beyond that all my money will go toward various investment that helps my family. Maybe also two chicks at the same time. Just once in my life. That's all.

World's GDP is $110 trillion. It's possible for BTC to capture approximately 15% of that. If BTC is to be 17Trillion.
Also, 1 btc = $1m means BTC total market cap would be 2 trillion and 100 billion. Knowing there is going to be only 21BTC and if 1 satoshi = 1 US cent. BTC can easily become 2 trillion. 
Right now it's 95 ish billion. If BTC goes up 30% each year, in 12 years it will be 2 trillion. And don't forget during the 12 years, world GDP will probably double. Unless people fuck it up. 
Trust me. All of these numbers make sense in  my mind. I'm still set on my red Lambo.

Shorting a stock/bitcoin is basically you borrow money from someone and you tell them that you are going to buy 100 stocks of something with their money. And in week or month or whatever time span later you promise to give them back the price of that 100 stocks back to the person you borrow money from. 
Let say you give me $1000. I buy 10 stocks and I promise you that I'll pay you back the value of these 10 stocks in a week. You agree that you will take the stock value. A month later, the 10 stocks are say worth $100. Now you give the buy $100 of stocks. You made $900. Now if the stock price went up and say the 10 stocks are worth $50000 after you are term is up, you have to pay the the guy $50000. That's basically what happened to OP. Bitcoin price went up. So no he's gotta pay.

People need to learn to distinguish between blog and news. Bloggers and journalist. Although it's becoming harder and harder to distinguish between the two each day because everything is now fucking opinion. Everything is interjected with opinion.

One of the main reason BTC is going down is because of China. China might be banning bitcoin in totality and permanently. They have some big communist kumbaya party going on now and they are gonna ban bitcoin. That's why price went down. If China does ban bitcoin in totality, then price will drop down to low $2000, IMO. And it make take several years for it to get back up to $6000. 
Holding for 10+ years might pay off a little, if that happens.

What if I have my BTC in JAXX and have backed up the Private Key in hardcopy. 
My understanding is that JAXX stores things offline. Also if JAXX decides to convert to the atlcoin, I'll still have my PK from current bitcoin and I can go back in the real/current bitcoin chain and still have access to my real/current bitcoin. 
I also understand that coinbase doesn't give you access to your private key. Therefore if they change over to new new altcoin, you are forked. Because you don't have the private key and can't go to the real/current bitcoin to get your fund. 
I further understand that because I have my PK through JAXX and hard copy, I will have both the real/current bitcoin and will also have same number for altcoin after the hard fork. Lets say current/real bit coin is valued $5000 now. The altcoin is valued at $500. I'll just get $500 more since my private key are same on both blockchains. Sort of like what happened with Bitcoin Cash few months ago. 
Am I a jackass bumpkin for my understanding above or am I right on the money?

A lot of opponent of bitcoin are insane. They are perfectly fine with nearly 200+ (maybe more) fiat (national) currencies existing along side each other but they get their panties in a bunch about another one existing that's arguably better than all of those 200+ national fiat currencies combined. National currencies ain't going away for hundreds of year. Nor is bitcoin/concurrency. Get the fuck on with time and modernity and fucking progress.

That's what I'm hoping for. I hope it will stabilize once 1 Satoshi  = 0.01 USD. Think about this. Most of out transaction ends in some sort of cents. Speaking mostly about American experience here. 
When 1 Satoshi  =  1 cents or 1 BTC = $1,000,000 and transaction/network fee fixed to few cents, then when BTC will start to replace fiat. I think. We pay about 10% tax on all transaction. Add another 1% network fee. And people won't notice. If I'm buying a cup of coffee for $3 and pay $0.30 tax and $0.06 network fee and it totals $3.33, I won't mind. But if I'm buying $3 coffee and paying $4 network fee, I'd not want to use BTC. 
I don't know if important and top men are working on reducing network fee to negligible amount. Sure miners would mind. But at some point, national government or even UN need to start mining not for profit but for utility of humanity. Especially if energy costs keeps going down.
Eventually though I hope humanity can become like that of the one in Star Trek. Money-less society where everyone gets what they want. And anything anyone does, they do for pure joy and self-satisfaction.

Yeah. I guess. I can make a paper wallet with dice roll. Then send $1 to it. Then sweep that paper wallet into some app. if that's successful then you know it's working. But you don't know if you got the PK right without doing sweep. As soon as you sweep, you got your private key in an app or in a networked device. So you create a new one. Then how do you make sure your new one is valid. You sweep. But then it's on a networked device again. Fuck. You create a new one. Then you are stuck in an infinite loop. At some point, you gotta risk it.
