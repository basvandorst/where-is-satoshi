Spend it. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:04:43
It's adjustable on Blockchain wallet. But that the recommended. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:24:08
Changes a lot for me, right here right now.

What is BS? You saying it's not true?  Why you mad bro?

Just sent $10 in LTC for 1 cent. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:17:29
Thanks for the constructive advice. Appreciated.

How long was you tx conformation? I'm still waiting 8 hours plus!!!! Anyone else in this mess today?
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:35:01
Yeah, must be no one. That would explain the 17x increase in value in 9 months...
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:08:51
LiteCoin very easy. So...
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:17:43
Guess Loaf wallet for Lite coin is better... 1 cent fee for $10 tx. Bye BTC!! ��������
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:39:43
What is your rec for wallets for daily smal tx? Like $5-500 daily? Fees have been cheap, and usually fast but Vary for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:49:23
This one took 9 hours plus BTW... driving people away from usage. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:00:57
That shouldn't be case. I'm here for the micro tx and micro fees. Not this.

All Hodlers will be on one coin, all users will be on another. Which one will have more value? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:48:38
Blockchain wallet you can pick fee.  So...
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:06:27
8 cents on sept 30... same wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:44:32
Today I moved that out of wallet for 5 cent fee and 10 min confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:14:48
Except I just sent $10 in LTC for 1 cent. Ok
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:18:04
All have gone through. Today just a pain in ass as I needed the performance of the past week. Cheep fees and fast confirmation. Today not so much. Weird. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:10:29
Love it!!
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:59:25
2 weeks ago they were 5 cents for $75 tx 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:27:09
My 8 hour ago tx just conformed.  The one I sent 10 hours ago still without confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:02:20
Fees were 5 cents last week. If you aren't doing many tx per day maybe you haven't noticed. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:56:16
Yeah boy
