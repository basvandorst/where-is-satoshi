You damn necrophiliac... knew there was something odd about you.
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:22:46
Some people believe that what you are talking about is when 2 different people or groups of people tap into the Akashic Records, or universal knowledge. Pretty interesting concept.
@_date: 2019-07-28 05:16:39
STFU... you had your chance.

No body like a CHOMO.  Specially in prison, that’s where real justice happens if you are a CHOMO.

Who suicided him?
@_date: 2019-11-09 02:22:11
He got scammed unfortunately
@_date: 2019-11-28 15:38:27
Yeah think about what China is doing.  With their centralized digital currency, they will have a ledger of every damn transaction on a blockchain that they force citizens to use.  Complete totalitarian control. That’s why blockchain should always be decentralized.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:25:43
I wonder what the government does with those coins? ��
@_date: 2019-11-02 21:39:56
Any one with money...

I think 9280 (euros)was the price when he took the screen shot, and he expects a bounce off of the trend line into a symmetrical triangle. After that, I hope it’s nothing but up.
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:35:51
Plus everything we think we know could be wrong
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:03:27
That’s classic!  Nice catch

I’m sure this guy is brilliant and knows a lot about economic history, but he is dumb as nails when it comes to the future. 
Just like Uber and lyft, BITCOIN is a catalyst for change that is making old industries’s buttholes pucker around the world ...
Stay green my friends.  ������

This would be a dream come true to pay of my student debt!  You are very very lucky, get a trusted wealth management specialist, pay your debt off, live humbly off of interest,  and of course. HODL THE REST

Ohh yeah the US dollar is “stronger” than ever.  Add a little bit of negative interest, not to mention another black swan event and WE ARE FUCKED
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:49:21
Just use a candle man... no need to buy wax with precious BTC
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:07:43
Person who bought the ledger bought a compromised one...
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:42:53
Time traveler was right!  Lol
@_date: 2019-06-11 01:27:58
Now you are going to lose other people’s money?  FUCK OFF
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:39:44
It’s the FUTURE.   Either buy into it or not.
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:23:58
That’s not true

LA gets it.
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:45:57
BTC goes at the beat of its own drum.
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:54:02
Let your own research guide your subject matter for your doc... then you will have your own unique take on what BITCOIN is for us now and in the future.  You are the next generation to really get MASS adoption to happen. Be creative and fuck what any one thinks.
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:06:00
Read my post below.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:47:14
Just do some damn research and you will understand what I am talking about.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:46:32
Because crypto homeboy.  Welcome to the big leagues
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:35:02
Cars will be a lot different in 20 years. I didn’t say gone
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:23:03
This guys fucks ��
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:21:01
Why on earth would anyone use BTC to buy a depreciating asset?
@_date: 2019-10-16 19:38:35
Time traveler states it will be much higher than that by the end of this month. ��������
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:49:37
This is brilliant.  What a good way to make more BTC
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:12:07
One billion dollars
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:00:29
Exactly. Not only that, when AI and AV take over with ride sharing (which it will!), only super wealthy people will buy vehicles because the cost of taking an Uber like service will be far cheaper then owning a car. 
The dude who posted this obviously is stuck in the present and past, and doesn’t understand the direction that the automotive market will be going in the next 20 years.
@_date: 2019-12-29 23:36:54
If you did your research you would of bought BTC by now.
@_date: 2019-12-29 23:46:51
You shouldn’t be so sensitive. 
I’m not being underhanded in anyway, if I didn’t think you were smart I would flat out tell you, but I don’t know you so that doesn’t make very much sense. 
All I’m saying is, do your own research. Don’t ask the internet on  how you should spend your money...
YOU FUCKING RUBE
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:04:52
Maybe you shouldn’t  have bought it and stop asking for hands outs loser
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:07:50
Maybe you should say you are joking in your title then. Looks like you are asking for handouts ... DUH
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:30:12
 
Don’t get me wrong, I think this is amazing for mass adoption. 
Bitcoin can be used as a currency even though it is used more like a store of value right now. 
I’m just saying I would never use BTC to buy something like a Ford that loses its value the minute it hits the road. Now if you buy a Car like a 911 gt2 RS, then you are using your BTC in a good way.  Or if you use your BTC to buy property or a house you are golden. But never use it for an everyday driver..
Also, I love cars... I design cars for a living, but that doesn’t mean I will let that get in the way of my common sense.
Edit:  thanks for the downvotes fuck faces...
@_date: 2019-12-27 20:56:38
That’s a sloppy ass curve my friend.  Lovely math behind that curvature huh?

Hahahah can’t beat them join them.  Hahahahaha
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:10:48
Slow the spinning down so you can see the BTC symbol more clearly.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:22:04
Tried again and it works. Looks great my dude!  Nice job man, now let’s get that on all the blockchain gaming platforms!  Or convince Nintendo to add this to all their Mario games. ��
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:17:39
Thats was fast. But I can’t see the animation now
