May I ask a stupid question?
Q: Unless you're one of the founders or miners of cryptocurrency, how do you get coin without revealing your identity?
I asked is becos you will need a WALLET and to fund it either by bank wire/bank transfer/credit card - any of these ways will leave behind records.
I imagine criminals may buy from those who acquire the crypto currency via traditional methods from the black market?
If so, how on earth can there be any real cryprocurrency (that is 100% not traceable ) for folks who do not buy from the black market eg. those who bought the coins using Coinbase?

Unlike Bitcoin, there is nothing ‘crypto’ about Libra. It may not be transparent to folks, but it will definitely be 100%, totally, and completely under the control of the banking cartel...  Libra is an attempt by the global banking cabals to enslave the world. In another word, Libra is the global version of Federal Reserve, it’s gonna be the ‘Global Reserve‘ that will ‘print global currency’ out of thin air (and charge everyone fees/interest for that).

I am not sure if thats the correct definition for stablecoin. As far as I know, stablecoin simply means it's backed by something. That doesn't mean it must be also "cryptic" as in cryptocurrency. = owner's ID unknown.
I consider Libra a scam by calling itself a cryptocurrency. It's a virtual currency (whereby Identity of owners is known).
It's actually just another PayPal except they issue a currency of their own as default medium of exchange.

True. But no government like a system they have no control like Bitcoin either.
As the article pointed out, the only reason why government in the west has not ban Bitcoin is becos the cabals are trying to learn from Bitcoins. It would appear Libra is proof they have learned enough .
My take is as soon as they're done learning and unless the cabal can find a s way to control Bitcoin, that will the the end of Bitcoin and all other nonsense coins.
Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Bitcoin. It's just that I don't see how Bitcoin can last forever unless merchants take it as payment on widespread basis. It's not money unless you can use it buy loaf of bread or a carton of milk. That's my point.
BTW, the problem is not U.S., American dominance is actually steered by globalist cabal who are not even American. Evidence - Libra is based out of Switzerland. So is the global banking cartel.
Coincidence? There is no coincidence.
Stay tuned, I am trying to put up a plan for you guys. I think there is a way out.
Anyone interest to be a part or help to steer an alternative global currency (not cryptocurrency)?

If the budget is couple of $ trillions per year, does it make sense to say just divide the budget with 365 = that is what is required per day?
