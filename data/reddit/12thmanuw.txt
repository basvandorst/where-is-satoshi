But then why did you call is FUD if what he is saying is right? Why not just say it's nothing new and doesn't contribute anything meaningful? Also, I know a lot of people who know 100% they will not learn anything new about bitcoin by watching cnbc but they still watch because it's exciting to see how for the most part, successful financial advisers who know a lot about investing but not shit about bitcoin, how they wade into the industry. Lastly, I'm glad you don't need to hear it, perhaps you know more than a lot of other people on this sub though. Have you noticed how many noob questions get posted everyday? Try sorting by New and you will see.

hahahah totally right?! I love watching these idiots invest in bitcoin and then lose their money! /s
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:39
This happened to me. It was terrifying because after you send the btc to a new address it logs you out, you can't create a new account, when you try to log in with your previous account it says "no account found" or something like that. No transaction ID. After i transferred my funds I was trippin because they didn't come quickly. I had no recourse. BUT... They came and everything was swell. My advice to you? Transfer your funds ASAP!!!! You've lost your account, you are risking losing your money by leaving it in what THEY consider a fraudulent/illegal account. (My account was banned because the state i was living in wasn't supported or something. Weird though because it happened suddenly even though I had a coinbase for awhile and everything was okay.)

Receiving your private passphrase on a device that is connected to the internet is not as secure as a hardware wallet. It should be a temporary solution until you can setup a wallet that can shield itself from online threats.

man dude, that is SO not ledger's fault and the fact that you are bashing them when in reality, it is your mistake, I think is kind of silly. Look at the average confirmation time.
It's 60 minutes right now. Of coarse it's not going to get confirmed in under 10 minutes, especially with everything going on right now. I agree that what happened to you is wrong and is a problem, however, it's 100% not ledgers fault. This is why places like Steam are not accepting bitcoin for transactions like this. That's not steams fault though.

Give me a fucking break bro. Seriously? Danger of being BORING. You know bitcoin will be boring AF if it becomes adopted as a worldwide currency right? People will just use it in their everyday lives, not think about it, just benefit from all of its glory. Which means.. They won't be checking bitcoin prices every 2 seconds.. Which i'll admit, is pretty fucking fun and addicting. But fuck off with this FUD because someone said futures are a major step towards legitimizing the digital currency which is dampening and reducing the volatility of its price. They aren't saying it's going to crash to zero, they aren't saying it's a bubble with no evidence, they aren't saying to stay away. They are simply stating what is happening. Which is, since Sunday bitcoin prices are more stable than before Sunday. If that gives you fear, uncertainty, and doubt about bitcoin then gtfo. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:47:27
first, many bitcoin atms do not sell, you can only purchase bitcoin. Second, have you looked at the exchange rates on atms? They are ridiculous. Last time i was at the atm, one bitcoin was something like 8,800 dollars and they were only giving you $5500 if you were selling. 3rd, most bitcoin atms have a cap at around $4,500 so you can't even sell a full bitcoin. 4th, if you have coinbase why would you ever sell at a bitcoin atm? You can just deposit USD into your bank account with coinbase by selling your bitcoin there. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:08:19

Summary of article:

Welcome! Your question can be answered by looking over on the sidebar (desktop site). The FAQ is very informative and then a few links below that is "How to buy bitcoins worldwide." Good luck! 
btw, don't do your transactions on your smart phone. Someone made a thread today of someone hacking their phone in an attempt to get their coins. use a hardware wallet, especially for $1000 worth.

Sounds like it. I did the same thing. I had a wallet on  my phone, didn't write down my recovery passphrase. Forgot about the btc, then wiped my phone clean and sold it. I lost the btc...still sucks thinking about it. $300 worth of btc as of June 2013 would be worth $51,000 today.

This is how it works. When you create a wallet, whether it is on your phone or your computer, it will give you a PUBLIC address. This is an address you can use to give to your friends, people who owe you money, people who buy your products. Your also have a PRIVATE address. This is what gives you access to that corresponding wallet. Where did you get the specific gibberish characters you are referring to? For reference, all bitcoin is held on the blockchain. You don't actually hold them on your wallet, but rather, your wallet gives you access to these coins on the blockchain. Without a wallet, even if you can see your funds, you can't access them without access to your wallet. but it sounds like you might have this! So where did you get that address?

sorry, your $50 is gone. If you have a mobile phone you can download the electrum bitcoin wallet from the app store. Write down your recovery pass phrase and protect it somewhere safe. When you want to buy coins from the atm, open up the wallet app on your phone, press the RECEIVE button, then scan your address from your phone into the ATM using the scanner on the ATM. Then after purchasing from the ATM you should see your coin balance in your wallet on your phone. Good luck

you will download a wallet on your smart phone. Electrum is one I have used but there are many on the app store. Write down your private keys. This will save you if you break your phone or lose it on the way to the atm. Then on coinbase go to accounts, then click on SEND under bitcoin. It will ask for an address to send to. Then open the wallet on your phone and click on RECEIVE. It will give you an address. Input that address to the corresponding box on coinbase. Send funds. (tip. Send your funds to gdax (use your coinbase account to log in. Then use gdax to send your funds to your phone).

Your underlying assumption regarding intended purpose may be wrong though. A lot of people use it more as a store of value. Whether that is the intended use or not, nobody knows. But i think your experience says a lot about current limits of btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:50:05
Yeah it could be $350 by tomorrow or $275 by next week. Who knows. But if bitcoin hits $1,000,000 your $300 would be equal to something like $20,000.

I'm familiar with Mike Lofgren's, "The Deep State" and some other literature revolving around the "deep state". Many of the arguments I think are better explained by the presidential-paradox theory along with elite theory. However, nothing within the literature revolving around deep state will lead you to believe that one, the world order that elites are pressing for will be done using the UN as a vehicle for that goal. 2, how a global currency would be implemented. It's an interesting conversation though. Do you think if we were to have a world currency, for the sake of discussion, would the IMF be more influential in making that happen or instead, the World Bank? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:24
Go with a hardware wallet. Way better than a paper wallet. Also, your coins are not stored on the physical device itself, but rather just your private keys. It will be your job to maintain and keep your private keys safe. If you lose your ledger, you do not lose your funds. Just open up any other bitcoin wallet, input your word recovery passphrase, and you have your coins. If you lose your passphrase though AND lose your wallet, you have lost your funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:08
use coinbase to purchase your coins. Transfer your coins immediately to a hardware wallet like ledger nano s. 
This is my personal opinion and what i would do. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:25:54
I agree man, can't disagree with you there. However, confirmation times were pretty low a few days ago which would have been fine. But of coarse when futures came into play on Sunday it caused a huge spike. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:10:12
It's like me asking you to send me my $50 and you say, "okay, where should I send it?" and me saying, "anywhere. just put a random address on the envelope that doesn't exist, make sure you put no return address either." When you input a receive address into the ATM, it send the money to that specific address. If you input random numbers, your coin is most likely lost forever. If you have your transaction ID you could try contacting RocketCoin to give them an updated and legit address.

 From my understanding (could be totally wrong), you are taxed on capital gains and the profit you have accrued when and only when you convert your btc to usd. 
*Most countries consider Bitcoin and crypto-currencies as capital assets, and so any gains made are taxed like capital gains. So if you make profits from selling your coins, those profits are taxed. If you make losses, you may be able to deduct the losses and reduce your taxes.*
However, i'm reading that any purchases you make with btc must account for gains. But if you purchased your btc say from a friend in another country, how are you supposed to determine your gains since the price fluctuations so much? Anyone know?
thanks y'all

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:17:07
Sorry but it's gone forever. If you buy anymore cryptocurrency you should refrain from keeping your coins on any exchange. It's not safe and you don't own your coins. A hardware wallet is the way to go.

This is part of the reason why you always hear that you should never store your money on an exchange. Google "coinbase horror stories". It sucks but they can close your account at any time without much recourse. Thankfully for you though, you live in a state that supports other exchanges and methods for obtaining bitcoin, you haven't lost access to your funds, and this is an opportunity to move your money to a much safer method of storing. I kept my bitcoin on coinbase and hadn't planned on moving it until i was forced to. I'm SO glad it happened though because i feel MUCH safer having full control of my coins and money. I don't have to worry about losing them anymore.

Many may disagree with the ethics of taxation and whether or not it is theft. However, tax law is tax law (capital gains tax). Ever heard the saying, only two sure things in life are taxes and death? I think rather than saying the IRS is corrupt and needing to tell everyone, a more useful tactic will be to learn how we can all help each other manage our earnings and not get in trouble by the IRS. You do NOT want to be on the opposite side of the IRS with agents knocking on your door.

 I'm aware of the literature. Have you ever lived in a country where the social contract broke down? Trust me, it's not outdated. Also, the idea of human rights is also very old. That outdated too?

Isn't the attack over though?

Lol. Welcome my friend.

Sounds like you have some underlying issues going on. Don't take it personal, really. The $30 or so lost to the overdraft fee and the double charge by coinmama are extremely small and non important issues compared to financial responsibility and being smart with your money. You bought Bitcoin because I'm assuming you want to make money right? Or be rich in the future? Dude.. there are already proven paths to financial stability. You are young I'm assuming by how you call people assholes when you hear what you don't want to hear. Being young and wanting to invest is good. You have time and compounding interest on your side. If you put 20% of your income away in your 20s, 30% in your 30s, and 40% in your 40, YOU WILL BE FINE. I don't see any problem myself putting that 20% into Bitcoin but man.. you need an emergency fund unless you are like 15 and live with your parents. And dude.... What kind of fool thinks advice for an emergency fund isn't help? Sounds like ur the asshole here...

 Are you familiar with the know your customer banking laws? You  seem surprised. The government gives police legal authority to kill people, lock people up in solitary confinement for years, and detain people for years with absolutely no charges. They have a monopoly on legitimate violence. You can't honestly think that when you sign up on an exchange that your information is protected from the government ? ESPECIALLY when it comes to taxes. Also, crpytos are anonymous. You don't need to use an exchange.
It's the opinion of many smart people that government's are going to try and crush us (crypto holders). They could make holding BTC or using it illegal, whatever they want in order to tax and remain in power. Asking for customer information is the start but definitely not the end. Who knows what will happen but buying Bitcoin anonymously is never a bad idea. It should be preferred if possible! So I'm totally with you, it's messed up, but we shouldn't be surprised.

Did you read the article? He doesn't sound like someone 'refusing' to change. He is saying he doesn't think his company offer an advantage to their customers yet . Several times he states, "right now" as if he is aware that things may change in the future. DBS is a super innovative company and one of the largest banks in Asia. To say they are doomed is kind of insane... He is like every other older financial advisor out there right now when it comes to cryptocurrency. They don't understand it completely , are skepitcal, and already know how to get rich. This will cause hesitation and many to play the "wait and see" game. Doesn't mean he is refusing and their company is doomed though.

Or super happy. There is litterally no way to know either way. But yeah, I'm in it for the long term hold. My girl wants to never ever sell and just give it to our kids (we don't even have kids yet).

Nice article. very informative. Thanks for sharing

Seriously. I hope this is fake.

You paid over $12 in fees to send 13 dollars. What is left is your .84 cents. Your fees were like 800satoshi/b man.. sorry. Next time make sure you look at how much the fee is. It probably was so similar to your original send amount that it got glossed over.

You need an emergency fund with a few months of expenses before you go overdrafting your account buying Bitcoin. A $126 charge shouldnt cause an overdraft for someone who is looking to invest.

one google search says no reliable. I would never give all my money for them to invest for me anyway.

You don't think there is a wealthy elite class in Zimbabwe? They don't even have a state currency man. It'd be surprising if they DIDN'T have Bitcoin there..

Lol @ the social contract being outdated. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:15:28
She's 25 and already makes six figures. I'm a professor who makes shit compared to her. She already owns a house too. We live soley off her income and use mine to save and buy Bitcoin. It's working out so far.
