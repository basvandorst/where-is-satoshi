I agree it's a fustercluck right now.
Make a reasonable effort to keep track of your cost basis and gains, report these on your return and pay what's due.  I don't see the IRS coming after folks who are doing this, they're going after the folks who report nothing.
We don't even have a single authoritative source on the actual price of Bitcoin right now, and neither does the IRS.  Say you trade into an altcoin want to record your cost basis.  Which price do you use?  Bitstamp?  GDAX?  Pick the lowest?  Pick the highest?  It's all up in the air right now.

Everyone says after the big ATH crash.  They said this at the top of the $1k mark when it started to crash and at the top of the $600 mark when it started to crash and every other one before.
I agree now is a good time to *temporarily* exit because a downturn is definitely inevitable.  We'll probably see $7k or lower before it's done.
You will regret not getting back in on this dip.  It's an excellent opportunity to cash out some dividends, or reinvest all at a lower rate.

Plenty of info available with a Google search.  The biggest solar panels I've seen are 300W and they cost around $400 so you would need at least 7 to provide 2,000W.  And remember it only provides that wattage in full sun at the peak of the day.

Of course, if your certain the wallet contains BTC and not BCH it can be transferred to any other Bitcoin wallet.  On Coinbase just go to your Bitcoin wallet and click Receive, this will generate an address you can use to send funds into your Coinbase wallet.

Firstly do *NOT* use the wallet from Bitcoin dot com.  **[ is the official website for Bitcoin.
There are no age limits for using the wallet.  If you want to buy Bitcoin, you'll have to use an exchange like   There, you'll need a checking account and form of ID like a driver's license, and if you're under 18, you'll need parental consent.

Coinbase is an exchange platform for buying/selling Bitcoin, not really a wallet.  You can store your Bitcoins there but it's not recommended.
You definitely cannot mine anything with Coinbase.
As for the ID verification, this is required.  Coinbase is basically a bank so you'll need proper ID to open an account with them.

Most bots will have dozens of different parameters you can set to control their behavior.
One simple behavior configuration might be to tell the bot to always put in buy orders at 0.5% below current market price, hoping to buy in during downswing.  The bot will place an order at 0.5% below market, and as the market rises, continue to raise the bid.
When a price dip occurs the order is filled it might immediately place a sell order at 1% above the purchase price, hoping to make 1% profit.  In a market that's swinging up and down violently throughout the day, you might be able to make 1% profit several times.

If you have the private key you're fine, but recommend moving the coins ASAP to a new address.
If the computers were physically stolen you need to report it to the police.
As suggested if you know the wallet address, you can look it up on the block explorer and see if the coins have moved.  You might be able to track where they're going.  
Are you saying the Bitcoin was part of a recent divorce settlement?  Depending on how that went, I would be suspect of your former spouse.

Unfortunately the network is insanely congested right now and only the highest-fee transactions are getting confirmations quickly.
Your transactions are around 100sat/byte.  Transactions with that fee were confirming fine a couple days ago but right now are going to be stuck in the mempool for awhile.  I'm guessing you have a couple days before this will confirm.
You can try the [ViaBTC Transaction Accelerator]( and see if you get lucky.  They only accept 100 transactions per hour but if you get in, you'll have a confirmation in the next block they find.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:05:36
Yeah, trading bots are a thing, been this way since the first exchanges came online.  They'll always be a thing in cryptos just like they are on the regular stock market.
I used to think that ETH and LTC, since they both trade against the dollar, would probably be somewhat "immune" to large BTC swings but they aren't because they still trade against BTC as well.

Show me your initial investment cost, electricity costs, and returns on investment since you started mining.  Like I said above, with free electricity and/or cooling it's a lot easier to make ROI.  
Not a noob at this.  I ran a fair sized mining farm back in 2013-2015.

Coinbase has a "beta" capital gains report available that will show all your sells, cost basis and gains.  It's not super great right now, but I'm sure it will get better.
Consult a tax professional on the best way to report your gains.
- Yes, you only pay taxes on the gains when you sell.  If you purchased BTC for $1,000 and that BTC is now worth $18,000 you have not *realized* any gains until you sell it for cash.
- If you can demonstrate that at least a year passed between when you purchased and sold, you qualify for the lower "long term" capital gains rate.  For most people, this will be 15%.  If you did not hold your BTC for more than a year, it's treated like normal income and will be taxed at your normal income rate.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:40:48
Who knows what may happen.  At least you can say you own some Bitcoin.  I think the days of 1,000+% gains are gone but getting double or triple your money in a year or less is definitely possible.  I wouldn't bet the whole farm on it, but if you've got some money to spare, why not.
Who knows, maybe years from now we'll think $10k Bitcoin was cheap.

I'm actually really pissed about Segwit and the way it was implemented.  The Core team should have increased the blocksize to 2mb at the same time as implementing Segwit.
I understand the reasoning behind keeping the block size small and streamlined and all the benefits of Segwit, LN and other off-chain scaling solutions.  But these are still months away (and have been for months/years) and a 2mb block size is still pretty damn small.
Implementing Segwit isn't exactly an overnight development effort and exchanges that are passing fees down to users aren't exactly super incentivised to put forth that effort because it doesn't help them with anything.  As with anything, when it requires your users to change something on their end, they drag their feet getting it done unless it benefits them personally.
2mb blocks would instantly doubled transaction capacity and given the network some breathing room while exchanges converted over, and would have made an EXCELLENT short-term solution while we wait for the better, longer-term ones.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:29:32
OK, so 20sat/byte isn't *too* low.  You can [see here]( that 20sat transactions were confirming just fine around 4 days ago (first purple bar up fron the bottom).  Transaction volume has been pretty insane the past few days but it's tapering off now, I imagine it will confirm in another day or two.

Here's a few good reasons:
- Equifax data breach 2017: 143 million (half the US population) customer SSN's and other private credit information compromised
- JP Morgan Chase data breach 2014: 76 million customers account information stolen
- Target data breach 2013: 110 million customers credit card information stolen
To transact virtually any goods in the world today an exchange of data is required which, if the data were stolen by a third party, could be harmful to the persons involved in that transaction.  It requires a certain level of trust between the two parties and all the intermediaries that touch the data in-between.
Bitcoin eliminates this because it's trustless.  It requires no trust because the only data exchanged are transaction ID's and wallet addresses which are part of the public ledger and available for anyone to see.  I give you money, you give me stuff, end of transaction.  No personally identifiable information is exchanged and the only parties involved are the sender and receiver, there are no intermediaries.

If you're buying a small amounts (like $10) the fees can add up to a pretty big percentage of the price.

First, talk to a tax expert because I'm not one.  Since there is no IRS reporting requirement (yet) on cryptos you would need to provide your own documentation on what was your cost basis and the amount you sold for.

Well, you don't make money when you trade at a loss.  But you do get to pay less taxes as a result.  If you purchase Bitcoin for $10k and sell for $8k you get to deduct $2k on your taxes for the loss in value.

The price of Bitcoin on July 15 was $2186.  If you had just purchased $20 worth of Bitcoin on July 15 it would now be worth $102.  This is my point, you're usually better off just buying Bitcoin.

Well if you mined $0.25 worth of Bitcoin back when it was worth $300, that would be around 0.0008 BTC.  Today that would be worth around $10.50.

I mean an authoritative source for the current Bitcoin price.  When it comes to trading altcoins, to record your cost basis you need to know what was the price of Bitcoin the moment you made your trade.  The problem is, there is no single authoritative source for the price of Bitcoin.
GDAX, Gemini and Bitstamp's "current" Bitcoin price might differ by as much as 3-5% at any given moment.  Which one do you use to record your cost basis?

One way to get a low-fee transaction to confirm is to convince a mining pool to force the transaction to be included in the next block they mine.  ViaBTC provides this as a free service, but only 100 transactions per hour.  This doesn't get you confirmed in the next block, just in the next block *they* mine (which might be hours, but probably not days).

The second link is referring to transactions with a fee of over 231 satosh *per byte* will take 0-30 minutes to confirm.  Your fee of 18,200 satoshi may or may not be that high depending on the size (in bytes) of your transaction.

Talk to a tax specialist.  There are methods by which you can gift property or money to others tax-free (for them) but if you're using it as a way to avoid taxes by just having them return all or part of it later that's definitely not OK.

This behavior is by design in Bitcoin.  The very last Bitcoin will be mined somewhere around the year 2140.  At that time, there will be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, and that's all there will ever be.

Mining verifies the authenticity of the ledger.  Every Bitcoin wallet uses the same protocol for verifying the ledger.  There are very specific rules and mathematical equations (cryptography) that must be performed on each transaction and block.  It's self-regulating because you can't change the rules without invalidating every previous transaction which used the old validation rules, and you can't alter an old transaction without making it break the current validation rules.
In the case of one person hacking both the ledger and rules simultaneously to forge a transaction, majority rules.  As the forged transaction is broadcast across the network, every Bitcoin client (again, tens of thousands, maybe millions) verifies it using their rules, which are still the un-hacked original rules, and the transaction is invalidated.  The only way to forge transactions is to get at least 51% of the Bitcoin users to agree to do it - which is another reason why the bigger network is stronger.
I definitely agree that easier ways to spend BTC for day to day transactions need to be developed.  We're getting there.  More and more people are beginning to accept BTC every day.
As for the value, yeah, there is a lot of hype right now.  You do realize you can buy fractions of Bitcoin all the way down to 0.00000001 BTC correct?  You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin if you want to invest or are curious how it works, you can just buy $15 or $20 worth if you want.

The 1099K does not apply to individuals.  If you are a business and you accept Bitcoin as payments (or credit cards for that matter) the company which processes these payments for you issues a 1099K at the end of the year if your *business* transactions were more than 100 transactions and $20,000.

Unfortunately waiting is probably what you're going to have to do.  10-20sat/byte fees were confirming just fine within 3-4 days ago, they probably will be again in a few days.
If you think you're missing a huge opportunity on an altcoin, just wait, another one will come along shortly.  And remember how quickly FOMO can turn against you.
It's really difficult for most wallets to accurately estimate fees.  Anything important, always double-check to actual amount you're using as a fee and make sure it's enough.

Because it's possible they are the very reason the market has climbed so high in the past month, they are acquiring massive amounts of BTC.  When the CME market opens, they short the fuck out of it.  After they open their short positions, they sell all their newly acquired, and now high-priced BTC causing the price to tumble.  Next, they close their short positions and make a shitload of money on both sides.

First, calm down and make sure you don't do anything that might compromise the wallet on your offline machine :).  Frustrated, panicked users are the source of many lost Bitcoins.
Sorry I'm not familiar with the Armory wallet.  If your wallet had a ton of addresses it will have a ton of private keys, you need to find the right key for that address.
In the Bitcoin Core debug window, you can type this command to get the private key for a specific address:
    dumpprivkey (yourbitcoinaddress)
Not sure if Armory has a console window for doing this

The "perfect" algorithm doesn't exist.  There are algorithms designed for certain market trends but things change FAST in crypto and it's very volatile to wild swings due to breaking news and other unpredictable factors.  Somebody farts in China these days and the price could drop 5% in 5 minutes.

Probably not.  My guess on what happens next, is that the IRS will go through the data on these people and try to make a determination on who probably owes capital gains.
For example, if you purchased $20,000 worth of Bitcoin but never sold any, they probably don't care.  Since you haven't sold yet, you didn't make any money, so you owe nothing.
If it's obvious through someone's transaction history that they bought and sold many times, and made money doing this, that person is going to get a letter from the IRS.

Talk to your accountant, because I'm not one.  I'm betting this will be considered normal income if you receive it as a form of payment for goods or services.  It will be taxed at the cash value of the Bitcoin the day you receive it, and whatever is your normal income tax rate.  You don't have to sell it immediately if you don't want to, but you are on the hook for it's value as income, no different than if you received the payment in cash.
For the purpose of capital gains, whatever the value was at the day you received it is your cost basis.  If you sell them at a later date and they're worth more, you'd have to pay capital gains tax on the gains.  Not double taxed.  If they were worth $11,000 when you were paid, and you later sold for $12,000, you would owe capital gains on the $1,000 increase in value.
As for whether or not you should do this . . . kinda up to you.  Personally I'd take the payment in Bitcoin, cash out you're not willing to risk in BTC immediately, save the rest in a hardware wallet.  Welcome to the 21 Million club.

Mining Bitcoin with your CPU or GPU isn't really possible anymore.  You could run your machine all year and only end up with a few cents.
If you want to mine, try other altcoins.  Those using the X11 algorithm and a few others can still be mined with GPU.

Under no circumstances would I consider a 5BTC purchase through LocalBitcoins.  WAAAAY too many crooks out there.
You can use a Bitcoin ATM nearby if you have one.  They have smaller limits, but you could probably get the purchase done in a few trips.
You don't owe taxes on Bitcoin until you sell it for a price higher than you purchased.  And then, you only owe taxes on what you made, not the base amount you spent.  Just buy it now on Coinbase, transfer it to a hardware wallet for safekeeping.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:43:40
How are you sure of this?  Did you confirm they were on the offline machine when you first put them there?
You need to get your wallet syncd up with the network.  Go get a USB hard drive if you don't have enough space on the machine itself.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:49:27
I would like to understand more about this as well.  My understanding is that everything is cash-settled so there is no actual Bitcoin exchanging hands at all.  
Kinda works like a pawn shop that buys/sells gold.  What they do doesn't affect the price at all, they just buy/sell at whatever is the current market price.  When the market is going up, they lose out a little.  When the market goes down, they win a little.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:18:01
Lying on your tax return carries really steep penalties.  If you had $1,000,000 worth of BTC and tried to avoid paying your ~$200k tax and the IRS came after you for it a year or two later (likely) you might owe $400k or more in back taxes and penalties.
I in no way condone this but if you're talking about a few grand it's something you would probably get away with, at least for now because there are no IRS reporting requirements for companies exchanging BTC for USD.  Taxes on $2k gains would only be around $500 or so and the IRS isn't actively hunting down people who might owe a couple hundred bucks in extra taxes.  
Sometime in the future, it's likely that exchanges like Coinbase are going to start reporting transactions over a certain dollar amount to the IRS when you exchange for USD.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:30:39

You place an order on the exchange to buy Bitcoin.  When the order fills, you get Bitcoin.
You place an order on the exchange to sell Bitcoin.  When the order fills, you get $$.
This is what bots do, they just do it way faster than you can.  They look at order history and candle charts and many other factors and try to decide the best time to buy and sell.  
You may think this is a goldmine but it's not.  Bots are very risky and much like day-trading, it's just as easy to lose your ass as it is to make money if you don't know what you're doing.

It's being used as a generic term.  They aren't mining *Bitcoin* they're mining other cryptocurrencies like Monero.

Bad PSU.
For what it's worth, I used to run a pretty good sized mining farm back in 2014-2015.  $99 PSU's were never worth their trouble for running mining rigs. They may be "rated"  for 1200W but just can't handle running at 80-90% capacity 24/7.  Once I switched to the higher end PSU's like Rosewill, Thermaltake, etc. I had way fewer problems.

I think eventually they will do the same to other exchanges which deal in $USD-to-crypto trading.  They will probably require that exchanges which deal in $USD must report form 1099-DIV for capital gains or they'll make up another form like 1099-CRYPT for cryptos only.  The issue for them is going to be determining cost basis for when someone didn't purchase their BTC on the exchange, but transfers BTC into the exchange and sells it.
For the altcoin exchanges, yeah who knows, it's all up in the air.  I can't see them possibly regulating that.
If you recently cashed out into $USD you should really calculate your gains and report it on your 2017 return, and pay the taxes on it.  Don't wait for them to come hunting you down because it might be a couple years from now.  The penalties for under-paying are really steep and can easily double (or more) the amount you owe.

Inevitably this will happen.  The IRS works *SLOW* as fuck.  Like, right now, they are probably working on who gets audited for the 2014-2015 tax years which is probably why they asked for records from that time period.
Eventually they will require exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini to start reporting this on a 1099-DIV or they'll come up with a new form 1099-CRYPT or something.
The hard part will be determining cost basis for some transactions.  If you earned BTC through mining or purchased it at an ATM or LocalBitcoins, then sold it on Coinbase, the only thing Coinbase knows is what you sold it for, they don't know your cost basis, so they can't calculate your gains.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:38:37

Until you sell them you haven't gained anything so you owe no taxes.  When you sell, if you made money, you owe taxes on the amount you made.  Buy one BTC for $9,000 sell it for $30,000 and you owe capital gains tax on $21,000.
There is no $20,000 minimum.  Any amount earned is subject to capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:49:06
Well yeah, of course, the tax rate isn't 100% so you get to keep most of it.  Capital gains I think is 15-20% depending on some conditions.  If you made $10,000 on Bitcoin, you pay $2k in taxes, keep $8k.
You could, I suppose, just never sell, and spend your Bitcoin instead.  This is sortof a grey area and no one really knows how or if something like this could be taxed.

Of course there's always a chance larger blocks may be needed in the future.  But, disk storage is getting cheaper every year, at a rate much faster than Bitcoin is growing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:45:41
Well some people will definitely go to extraordinary lengths :)
I think at least, since Bitcoin isn't considered currency, you could probably still claim lost Bitcoin as a loss on your return in the same way you could claim a loss on any other property like a house fire or theft of a car and you didn't have insurance on them.  So, you can deduct the value of those BTC on your taxes, you don't really "make money" on this but you pay less taxes.  Not a tax expert but there are some limits on how you can claim losses on things like damage &amp; theft.  
If the loss is large, the IRS is probably going to want to see some documentation on how it was valued, this is where things could get weird.  Without the private key you can't prove that you ever owned the coins.  I could just pick some random address on Blockchain.info with 100BTC in it and be like "Yeah, that was mine, but I lost the private key, so I'm claiming a $1million loss on my return."  
That also brings into light all sorts of other questions.  If you lost your key, you probably don't know *when* you lost it, so when do you calculate value on the loss, when you discovered the key was lost?  Value of BTC at the end of the the tax year?
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:34:52

I agree it is definitely hard for the average person to understand, it's a different way of thinking.  We're used to having centralized authoritative sources for things like this, and Bitcoin doesn't.  The blockchain is the authoritative source, and it exists everywhere.
The fact that the ledger involves "millions of 1s and 0s" spread out over thousands of computers is a strong point, not a weakness.  There are tens of thousands, perhaps even millions of copies of the Bitcoin blockchain out there on servers and people's desktops and laptops, and *every single one of them is 100% identical*, down to every last 1 and 0.  If that's not strong verification of it's authenticity, I don't know what is.

The largest are located in areas where A) there is cheap electricity and B) it's a colder climate so they don't have to pay for cooling of the hardware.
It's a numbers game with Bitcoin mining.  You *can* make money but it's a very small percentage.  Spend $1,500 on mining hardware might net you $150 over 8-10 months if you have cheap power.  By the time you make ROI, the diff has increased so much you're only making a few cents each day, so the only way to continue making money is to buy more miners.
This numbers game is why it works for multi-million dollar companies.  A small return of 10-15% on a million dollar is $150 grand.  Plus, when you buy $1million worth of ASICs, you get it at a pretty steep discount.
You have to ask, would you be better off just buying $1,500 in Bitcoin now and holding it for 8-10 months while the price grows?

@_date: 2017-12-02 05:48:13
You think this because you don't understand how cryptocurrencies work.
Let's talk about trust for a minute.  When you use "old" digital money like credit cards, you require a trusted third-party (in most case several third parties) to facilitate the transaction.  When your credit card is entered into a website:
- Website operator sends that info to a payment gateway (could be one of hundreds)
- who then sends it to merchant account provider (website operator's bank)
- who then sends it to a payment network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- who then contacts the issuing bank to verify funds
- who then sends the funds to the merchant account provider via the ACH network
- who then sends the funds to the website operator's bank account via the ACH network
The notion here is that you have to *trust* that these third parties are doing their job correctly.  You must trust that they are securing the data as it's being transmitted and that they are keeping a proper ledger of everyone's balances.  You must trust that they properly contacted the bank and funds were withdrawn and transmitted to the recipient.  The information they transmit (card number, expiration date, security code) is very sensitive and you must trust that they are protecting it.
With Bitcoin every piece of this transaction is handled without any sensitive information being transmitted, ever.  No trust is needed, because the transaction records are all public, so you have a copy and I have a copy and so does everyone else.  The ledger cannot be forged or manipulated because of the way blockchain transactions work - every transaction has a piece of it that is derived from the transaction before it, like links in a chain.  Once a transaction is completed, it is impossible to forge it later to different accounts or amounts.  The process of mining verifies the authenticity of transactions using math &amp; cryptography and more miners we have, and the larger the network becomes, the more confidence we gain in properly confirming transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:52:23
CoinBase.com is definitely the easiest way to quickly sell and have the funds deposited in your bank account.  I have been using them for years.
You can still keep your coins on BlockChain.info or elsewhere, just create an account on CoinBase, go through the procedure to link your checking account so it's ready to go.  When you're ready to sell, just transfer your BTC to CoinBase and sell.

Because what you are describing defeats Bitcoin's idea of a global, universal and generally accepted electronic currency.  
You may not remember this, but most of Europe worked this way for centuries.  Each country had their own currency, and only accepted their own local currency.  It was a pain in the ass, because when you traveled from Germany to Switzerland you had to exchange all your Deutschmarks for Francs and then back again when you came home, and if you were unlucky, the rate of exchange dropped while you were there and you ended up with less money than when you started.  People who traveled frequently had to carry a wallet full of all sorts of different currencies just to be able to buy coffee or teat depending on where they were.
Today, we have the Euro, universal currency accepted in almost all European countries.

Been there, although at *MUCH* smaller amounts than you're talking.  Doing this with what equates to ~$2million with (obviously) no experience market trading . . . that's just plain stupid.  You either A) Just inherited a ton of money and don't know WTF you're doing or B) A millionaire celebrity or pro athlete who doesn't know WTF he's doing.
It's *SUPER* easy to get caught up in the hype when a coin goes berzerk.  You see gains of 10, 20 or 30% in a span of hours and you're like OH DAMN I NEED TO GET IN ON THAT.  Problem is, at that point, it's already too late.  All you're doing is sealing in profits for the people who bought 12-24 hours earlier and are now looking to cash out.  
Cooler heads prevail.  To be good at trading cryptos you really have to keep your ear to the ground.  It's practically a full-time job just researching and keeping up to date on new developments &amp; rumors.  News about coins and the markets move at light speed.
I traded like this heavily back in 2013-2014 when BTC was well under $1,000, back when having 10-20 BTC wasn't exactly "big money."  I quit when I was down to my last 5 BTC or so, worth maybe $1,800 at the time, decided to just get out of the game, forget about cryptos and see what happens in a few years.

It does have cheaper fees.  The price is also usually around 1% lower.  [Here is a screenshot]( of the GDAX and Coinbase prices side-by-side.  Coinbase shows $10,018.84 while GDAX (tab at the top left) shows $9,969.09
You have two choices:
If you want to buy BTC **now** you have to use Coinbase and pay the fee.
If you want to avoid the fee then you have to do a bank transfer to GDAX and place your order there.

I would say chances are pretty good that BCash will pump again sometime between now and Christmas and we may see BTC at $8,000 levels as a result.  Keep your fiat up there on the exchange and wait.

"Shorting" refers to the process of making money in a declining market.  In this case, you could benefit from both sides.
1. Buy lots of Bitcoin now, price of BTC goes up.
2. Open a short position on CME when the futures go live.  Basically, you're betting that the price of Bitcoin will go down.
3. Sell lots of Bitcoin you purchased in step 1.  Price of Bitcoin goes down.  Profit.
4. Close your short position on CME. More profit.

Absolutely inevitable.  Personally I don't see our current administration (USA) embracing this technology.  I'm actually hoping the current mania dies down and the price stabilizes a bit so Bitcoin can continue to run "under the radar" a bit more until we have new leadership in Washington.
My concern is, if it blows up too much right now, the regulations will be way too heavy-handed.

You would need around 30kW of solar panels to be able to run 10x Antminers.  And around 150-200kWh worth of battery bank for the nighttime.

Go ahead and get your account setup and verified on GDAX now, make a small $20 deposit if you have to just to get the ball rolling.  Transfers from your checking account to GDAX usually happen in 1-2 days once your account is fully verified.  If I initiate a transfer in the morning, it usually hits GDAX the next business day.
If you want to sell your ETF's and have the cash ready go ahead if you can do that without losing too much in fees for the sell &amp; transfer.
BUT -- 
I honestly think there's a good chance it may pull WAY back before we see any substantial upward movement.  We might see $8k or even $7k again before we see $12k.  There are people out there who bought BTC at $5700 less than 3 weeks ago, who can sell all the way down to $6k and still make profit.

You'll need to make sure to manage the capacity of your circuits and the amount of power you're drawing from them.  A standard 15A breaker can only handle 1800W max so if your miners require 1500W that's only enough for one miner, if you try to plug two into the same circuit you'll trip the breaker.
Back in 2014 I ran a medium-sized mining farm of 6x Antminer S3's and a couple GPU mining rigs.  The Antminers used around 550W each so I was able to get two on each 15A circuit in my house.  I had to spread them around in different rooms and use extension cords to keep them from tripping breakers.
As I said above, they also generate an insane amount of heat.  I had mine setup in a rental that was unoccupied, it's a 1200sqft home, and with the Antminers and GPU rigs going I didn't use a drop of propane that entire winter for heating.

You never lose money until you sell for less than where you bought.  This is why you never invest more than you can afford to lose - so you can afford to wait for the price to come back up.

My brother-in-law brought it up, we started talking about it a bit, I told them about how hard-core into cryptos I was back in 2014-2015 and I still had some BTC leftover from that.  Once that was said all anyone could do was ask how much I had and how much I've made.  I just told them that anything under $10k I consider cheap and if they want to invest Coinbase is probably the easiest way to do so.

It is not profitable at 18c per kWh for electric costs.
The amount of BTC you mine will decrease by around 10-12% per month, or 5-6% every two weeks.
Cooling is also an issue on larger mining farms.  This can add significantly to your electric cost.

I've actually thought about this many times.  I run a web hosting company and yeah, monthly subscription is pretty much our payment model, set it and forget it.  Dealing with sending out invoices and chasing down customers for payments would add enormous overhead not to mention screwing with your cash flow.
I would imagine that solutions for this will emerge as time goes on.  For example, online wallet providers could easily provide a service to handle sending scheduled payments, although that would still be dependent on the customer setting up the schedule.

Disagree about the charting &amp; analysis.  Market analysis is more psychology than anything and it doesn't matter if it's trading soybeans or tech or oil it follows very similar patterns.

Possibly.  But if you need the $5k back now that might be the fastest/best way to get it or prevent it from leaving your checking account if it hasn't yet.
The alternative might be that $5k leaves your checking account today, and it takes a week before you're able to work out with Coinbase to get access to your account, then another several days to  sell the BTC and transfer it back.  Meanwhile, BTC might crash.  You have to weigh the risks on how important getting that $5k back is.

There are no winners here, only losers.
This battle does nothing but show the rest of the world how juvenile and immature the crypto world is.  Different groups fighting over whose code is the real bitcoin, no one can agree on how to change protocols to improve the network.  
Not to mention how easily the markets can be manipulated by a few.  You want public acceptance of Bitcoin as a real store of value and payment/banking system?  We were getting close . . . but now, not for years.  I'd like to think that BTC will come out of this stronger &amp; better but I really think no good will come of this at all, regardless of whether BCH or BTC comes out on top.  The confidence and stability offered by cryptos has been shaken forever.

If you're in the USA you're probably paying around 12 cents per kWh.  Most miners use around 1500w which is about as much as you can safely draw from a standard 15A electrical outlet.
1500w x 24h per day = 1080 kWh per month or roughly $130/month in electicity costs
In the winter months your actual costs ends up being a little less than that because miners put out a lot of heat, so you end up with a lower heating bill.
In the summer months, the opposite, since you're placing more load on your AC system.  It's basically like trying to run a space heater and your AC at the same time.

I totally agree with this sentiment, I think Coinbase and GDAX are great.  Definitely one of the best exchanges/trading platforms out there.  Honestly I think most of the hate is coming from newcomers bitching about the length of setup times and being butt-hurt about how they can't buy as quick or as much as they wanted (FOMO).
I had very little issues over the past few days.  The website got glitchy and slow a few times, less than 5-10 minutes.  I was on there all day during the mania.
Building infrastructure that can scale up to 8x or 10x your baseline quickly isn't easy or cheap.  I'm sure they're setup to handle surging in traffic but maybe this one was a bit over their surge capacity.
I will still continue to use GDAX due to it's awesome web interface and ZERO fees for trades and withdrawals.  Sure, their initial setup is a little slow due to the verification requirements and what not, but once you're setup and verified, it's probably the best platform out there.

If 10k is a "huge" loan for you do not do this.  Invest what you can, when you can.  10€ per week, 20€ per week, whatever you can afford.  If you got the loan for $10k, then lost it all, could you comfortably afford to repay it?  If the answer is no, then don't do it.
I know there are lots of stories floating around of $100 worth of Bitcoin being worth $60million now but I believe the days of those gains are long gone.  I think there's a good chance you could still gain 50% or double, maybe even triple your money in the next year, but as others will say, never invest more than you can afford to lose.

The Resources section on bitcoin.org has information on how the block rewards are structured.
Coinmarketcap.com shows the current total coins in circulation.  
A new block of 12.5 coins is minted approximately every 10 minutes.  Every 210,000 blocks, the reward is halved.  The next "halvening" should occur on or near June 12, 2020.
The last Bitcoin will be mined somewhere around the year 2140.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:40
Bank transfer takes the same amount of time.  GDAX is using an exchange so you can either buy at current market price, or pick your own price and hope you get it.
If you pick your own price (limit order) there are zero fees.  Market orders are 0.25% fee I think.

BTC difficulty on average increases 6% every two weeks so be sure to include that in your calculations for ROI.  Also, block rewards are not 12.5 BTC but usually around 14-15 BTC including transaction fees.
In the winter they're great since they do a fantastic job heating your house.  In the summer it sucks because your AC bill will be 2x higher.  Keep that in mind as well.
Been awhile since I did all the math but if you're in the USA and have to pay for electricity at standard $0.12/kWh rates it's probably not profitable.

Personally I don't think it's that big of a deal.  There is already a lot of Wall Street money in Bitcoin.  It's true that due to financial regulations, big investment companies like Schwab and the like cannot invest their customer's money in Bitcoin, but nothing is stopping them from investing their own money.  I'm sure they are already doing it.  All this does is open another door to allow a few more people to get in that weren't able to before.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:01:49
I don't think something like that would necessarily kill Bitcoin, but would definitely discourage or harm the adoption.

There are no normal people on :)  Any estimates you get from here are probably going to be overly bullish.
Do your own research.  Take everything you hear from any source with a grain of salt.
My opinion, which is worth just as little as anyone else's:
- We will probably see $9k again before we see $11k.  We might even see $7k again.
- Maybe close out the year around $11-12k
- Next year $20k
- 5 years $100k is a bit of a moonshot but not entirely outside the realm of possibility.  Governments will obviously begin regulatory actions (or attempts at regulation/laws at least) well before that so that will play a major role in how things go.  In the USA, I just don't see our current administration embracing this technology so we may need to wait until we have some new bodies in Washington before we hit here.

Did you use a wire transfer or regular ACH transfer?  Wires are faster but higher fees.  Using regular ACH I don't see how you could get money into Coinbase as a brand new user that fast.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:23:05
If you're wanting an easy way to buy once, or weekly on a schedule or whatever, it's probably the best for US customers.
If you're looking to actively buy/sell frequently to take profit, signup at Coinbase, then switch over to their trading platform GDAX.

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:52:01
Coinbase is a fine choice, but you're right you do have to wait several days before you receive them if you're a new customer.  It's not that big of a deal if you're planning to hold long-term, you buy now at today's price, you just don't take delivery for ~10 days while they make sure the money is cleared.
As for long-term storage, paper wallet in a safe is a good choice, also the Trezor or Ledger Nano hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:59:45
Coinbase wouldn't be the best way to take advantage of this due to the fees.  On the GDAX exchange you can buy/sell for zero fees on limit orders, and most other exchanges only charge around 0.25%
And yeah, you're right, generally it's only worth it for larger amounts.

I get you, yeah there's plenty of that here too, everyone wants to get rich.  But I truly believe the core of this community is for the betterment of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.  And it's my belief that the Bitcoin Core developers have taken that stance as well.  
I do not see that over on mostly they're just butt-hurt and trash-talking on My point is, the core backers/creators/developers behind the BCash currency itself, they don't give a fuck about the success of their project, they're just in it for the money.

You are sure that the wallet.dat in that location is the one you think contains transactions?  If you didn't copy it there manually, the one that's there now was created by the Bitcoin client the first time you fired it up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:03:18
If you don't have your old phone you're kinda fucked.
The exchanges where you used 2FA, you need to contact them directly and figure out how to verify your identity and have them remove 2FA.  There is no other way.
Next time, use Authy whenever possible instead of Google Auth.  Or, save the code they give you when you setup 2FA, you can use this to setup on another phone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:58:55
Sorry man but this was your screw-up, it's not Gemini's fault you screwed up your 2-factor authentication. Authy has a method by which you can migrate to another phone or number without disruption, you didn't do it correctly.
I understand the frustration but the crypto world is chock-full of crooks and gaining access to someone's exchange account is just one of many ways they are constantly trying to steal money.

That's why I think bits is probably the best way to do that.  ~~You'd have three decimal places but other than that it would be just like dollars &amp; cents.  0.001bits = 1 Satoshi which is the smallest unit of BTC currently available.~~
Derp I'm an idiot and cannot count, it would be like dollars and cents.  0.01bit = 1 Satoshi
Now we just need to come up with a symbol to distinguish BTC from bits.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:00:09
For that kindof money skip Coinbase and use GDAX which is their exchange platform.  You will pay through the nose in fees using Coinbase.  If you're in Minnesota, Wyoming or Hawaii and cannot use GDAX then use Gemini.
GDAX and Gemini both start out with daily or weekly limits around $10k but will raise them to $50k practically just for the asking.  You can get $100k+ with a bit more documentation and time.
As mentioned below, there's just no way to make it happen by today or tomorrow, but by the end of next week, definitely.

There is nothing stopping this from happening sometime in the future, it would likely require a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:58:33
Yeah, I think they make newbies wait longer for the transfers to clear just because there are so many crooks in crypto.  I almost always get transfers in/out of GDAX the next business day, at most the day after that.  Maybe I'm just lucky and my bank is awesome but that's been my experience.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:41:29
Stay away from USDT.  Transfer your BTC to Coinbase or Gemini and link your checking account.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:19:48
I think there's a fair chance it might, and it may shake the crypto industry in terrible ways.
As far as public acceptance goes, cryptos are still in the "toddler" stage.  What future can cryptos have if some rogue group of hackers/developers can just make a copy of all your money, make your old money worth shit and force you to use new money in a horrible, bloody, forced transition period lasting months in-between?  Yeah, I know that's not *actually* what happened (well, it is kinda) but that's what it's going to sound like.
Is this seriously OK?  No, it's not.  This might set back the public's acceptance of cryptos for years.
BCH has some good ground to stand on.  Increasing the block size to address the immediate concern of high transaction fees and long confirmation times was a good call.  Sometimes, a good solution you can implement *now* is better than the perfect solution that takes a month (or a year, or two).  
I also agree adding Segwit is a good step forward, and a much better long-term solution, but it requires changes at the merchants &amp; exchanges to take advantage of it.  The problem is, it was too little too late.  There should have been no Segwit soft fork.  There should have been Segwit2X and it should have happened the same time BCH was created.
Honestly I'm fine with whatever.  I cashed out to fiat at BTC $7200, heading to the Winchester for a pint and wait for this whole thing to blow over.

Short answer: Yes you have to provide all this info and NO do not make it up.  Coinbase is a legitimate bank FDIC insured and everything.  Opening an account with them basically follows all the same rules as opening a checking account.

10 day in the USA at least, not sure about the UK.  You might be able to get it faster if you use a wire transfer but that comes with some hefty fees.  If you're planning on holding long-term, doesn't really matter as long as you still get it.  
I'm not aware of anywhere to get BTC faster than Coinbase unless you're willing to pay a high premium.  Once you're setup and verified with them it's super easy and instant to buy additional BTC.

There's also tons of fresh, new, weak hands who just bought their first BTC on pure hype/mania and are looking to make a few bucks.  These newcomers are not HODLERS.
We're not out of the woods yet, not for at least another few days.  
Next week, all those newbies who bought over Thanksgiving break are going to take delivery of their BTC after the Coinbase waiting period and it will have already gained 15-20%.

Use Gemini if you want, I don't care.  On Coinbase, once the verification process is complete you can do instant buys &amp; sells.  Zero waiting.  Click a button and BTC is available the next second.  I like that.

It's likely to happen in ~18 days from this post, or two diff adjustments from now.  That would probably be the *best* time to attack if it's going to happen.
Make no mistake, this was the reason for the new EDA that BCash implemented a week ago.  This will make it easier to convince miners to come over to BCash and stay there.
Note that ~20 days will also almost exactly coincide with CME's start of trading on BTC futures.  A huge crash within a day or two of Bitcoin's first futures trading market will shake Wall Street confidence in huge ways.  BCash's hope is, after this, no other Wall Street entities will want to touch Bitcoin.  BCash supporters are going to short the fuck out of it, and with CME it will never be easier to do so.

Limit orders just mean you set your own price.  If you want to try and buy 1 BTC for $9,899 you put in an order for that and it sits in the order book until someone takes it.  Of course, there's always a chance no one takes it and you never get any BTC.

I have similar stories about Bitcoin and half a dozen other cryptos over the years.  It happens man.

I believe it is possible, but pretty unlikely at this point.  I think their opportunity to outlaw it passed some time ago.  Big banks are getting in on the action now, and I think we can all agree the US government isn't going to take away a method they use to make money.
If Bitcoin can survive another 10ish years, we will start to see enormous changes.  Candidates running for President and Congress and will likely be Gen Xers or Millennials who grew up with the Internet and will understand the power of this technology.  Right now, I hate to say it, but our regulators are just too old and set in their ways to change.

That's a little different.  If your solar panels are over-producing and your net-metering agreement is way in the positive, I say talk with your landlord about it and see what she says.  Whether you offer to cut her in on profits is up to you.
A 1500W mining rig will consume about 1080kWh per month.  You can probably take a look at past bills and see how much that would chew into the surplus power produced by the panels.

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:44:59
Absolutely that is the plan.  As the price of BCH goes up, it will attract more miners.  True, the new DAA will (supposedly) quickly adjust the difficulty up to maintain ~10min blocks, but meanwhile, BTC has no such adjustment and block times there will get longer and profitability will go lower.
This is the "death spiral" the BCH folks are on about.  I'm not sure where the breaking point is, but there is a threshold at which the price of BCH will be high enough, and enough miners have left BTC, where it will be very, very hard to recover from.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:30:12
Make no mistake, I certainly don't think they'll be successful, this is just my take on what I think is coming up.  I mean, I'll admit there is a *chance* but it's pretty slim.
BCash has a devout following but those in control don't give a flying fuck about BCash, BTC or cryptos in general.  They're wealthy and powerful and like everyone else with wealth and power, all they care about is more wealth and more power.
Roger Ver wants BCash to take over not because he believes in the currency itself, but because he believes it will make him a great deal of money.  Same goes for Craig Wright and the rest of his cronies.  This power struggle has the potential to set back the general acceptance of cryptos by years, and they couldn't give a fuck.  The sooner his followers realize this, the better off the crypto space will be.

If you want it cheaper you have to wait for a bank transfer.  Buying with a CC is the most expensive way to purchase.

Pretty much, yeah.
There have been in the past, and are more in the works, cryptocurrencies that do actually use that processing power for other tasks.  [PrimeCoin]( for example is one of the oldest, it uses that processing power to find new prime numbers.
[Golem]( and [Elastic]( are cryptocurrency works-in-progress trying to build a decentralized supercomputer using blockchain technology.
Golem is geared mostly towards rendering CGI graphics and movies.
Elastic is a little more generalized.  Basically, if you have a task that requires computing power, you can build it out on the Elastic network, and any computer connected can contribute some CPU power to help complete the task.  They are rewarded for this in Elastic coins (XEL)

This is a pretty big concern of mine and the reason I'm mostly in fiat right now.  
There are a lot of very new and very weak hands that just bought their first BTC's.  When it falls it will domino downwards as these newcomers panic sell.
LOTS of new investors came into their first Bitcoins over the weekend and this week.  Coinbase users don't actually have their BTC yet because of the 10 day waiting period - they will take posession of it on around 12/5 and it's already gained at least 15%, possibly even more by then.  Many of them will sell and take their profits right away.

Unfortunately you probably just need to wait to hear from them.  It's only been one business day since it happened and I'm sure they are inundated with new user setups/verifications right now.  
You can try calling your bank and ask if they can prevent the ACH from going out or dispute the debit card transaction if the hacker purchased that way, hopefully that will at least freeze the transfer so you have the $5k back to pay bills.

The majority of miners are located in :
- Colder climates where the heat of mining equipment is not an issue or is beneficial
- Countries/areas where electricity is cheap or free
10x Antminer S9's are going to use about 15kW.  You can't just plug them all into one outlet, you'd need ten separate 15A circuits to run that.  You might even need to upgrade your main breaker panel.
15kW x 24 hours x 30 days a month at $0.18 per kWh is almost $2,000/month in electric costs.
They are also going to generate a ton of heat, probably in the neighborhood of 30,000 BTU's.  If it's cold where you live right now not an huge issue if you have a window and can get some circulation going to pull in outside air.  If not, you're gonna need around 3tons of AC to keep them from overheating.  This will cost several thousand to setup and another several hundred per month in electricity costs to run.
if you have $40k to invest, just buy Bitcoin with it.

It will even out eventually because people will do exactly what you've explained.

It's not the perfect solution - but it's a very good short-term fix until the perfect solution is ready.  Bitcoin cannot survive another year at current fees &amp; confirmation times waiting for Segwit acceptance and Lightning Network.

Doesn't really solve anything.  The billion dollar warehouses full of ASICS would just transform into billion dollar warehouses full of GPU mining rigs.  There's a fair chance it might even result in higher electricity costs.
NVidia and AMD would love it.

Seriously the constant price posts have got to stop

Why don't you buy your dad a Rolex instead?  Much better than rubbing it in his nose.  This will just leave a bad taste in his mouth and make him think even less of Bitcoin.
Or better yet, just show him the current price and what you have, and try to educate him again or even send him a little BTC to get started himself.

AES Encrypted text file on OneDrive, Google Drive or your choice of cloud provider.  Tattoo the AES key on the inside of your thigh.
For that matter, I guess you could just tattoo the phrase on the inside of your thigh, but that means at least one other person would know it.  Unless you're good with a tattoo gun.

"Old money" on Wall Street doesn't understand and refuses to try to understand what Bitcoin is.  It is simultaneously a currency, a bank, and an automated clearing house for processing payments.
They complain that it's unregulated but it actually *is* very strongly regulated - by the rules of the network and protocol.  
They complain it has no "backing" and that its value is "based on nothing" but the US dollar is no different.  The dollar's value is based on people's faith and confidence in the government - Bitcoin is based on people's faith and confidence in the network.

Sorry I misread - I thought it was 8700 vs 8781.  Maybe the spread they charge on EUR is different but 10% is WAY too high.

Your best bet is to take the phone to a repair shop and try to get it working again.  
If you are certain the phone will restore access to those BTC, it might be worth paying a fair chunk to have it repaired.  Just make sure they understand they *CANNOT* factory reset the phone.

Where is the location of your wallet.dat?  If you're using Windows the default location is C:\Users\&lt;yourusername&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin

As others have said, hire an accountant.  If you can document that your Bitcoin were acquired more than a year ago you can probably quality for long-term capital gains could be as low as 15%.

I have a friend who whines about this constantly (not just BTC, any crypto), it drives me nuts.   200% gains over the course of a few weeks, then constant complaints about how "this is bullshit man I'm losing money now" when it pulls back 15%
I'm a long-term HODLER.  Sure it gets exciting at volatile times to check the price every day and see the growth but when it slows down I just forget about it for awhile and check back in a few months.  And I get happier every time I do it.

This one happens to be the Coinbase app, but there are many others.  [Winkdex]( is another and they have a decent mobile site so you don't have to install anything.
