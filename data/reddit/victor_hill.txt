Peter is not the guy you want to listen to if you are looking for guidance crypto wise... But at the current point, bitcoin is a measure of crypto adoption and wealth accumulation. Lightning network, if successful, will bring the transactional side of Bitcoin to use as well.

You should dispute his claim to shut down the miners. It's just fud.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:39:26
Meh, they still own low amounts on average. Adoption is cool, and from an economic perspective, as long as you have more it's even better!
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:54:34
It does affect bitcoin in terms of accessibility. And you missed my point completely.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:48:47
ICOs are usually nothing but projects and visions, without a product or a real plan. Most of them should fail, nothing is wrong with it.

And neither of these two gentlemen are trustworthy enough to follow, as much of experts that they are. BIAS towards any side aside, try to form opinions based on your research of the financial and markets in general! Cheers folks!
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:46:31
Exactly. After all, they are trying to make a profit as well. And as for the technology, if it's good it'll prevail.
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:59:58
Why does wealth of other concern you? BTC was not made to distribute wealth (not entirely) but rather to improve means of paying. And even as it is, cryptos are the biggest wealth distribution event in history. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:01:12
No big apparel brands accept Bitcoin, and the whole fashion industry is lacking in understanding/supporting cryptocurrency. Thanks for being the pioneer! Good luck with your business!
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:26:44
And why should they?
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:04:24
Welcome to the future people
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:07:01
Thanks for this! Makes it a bit easier to understand what Lightning actually is.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:40:10
I got it on 3 exchanges. so yeah, i see most of the answers come close to that. 2-5 i guess.
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:25:30
No need to charge miners more. They spend electricity, sure, but the only thing governments ever did was subsidizing investments and businesses in some way, even subsidizing the costs of electricity as well. No reason to do this. They can regulate it in some other way. Also, with such high price of kwh in New York, there is no reason to mine when living there at all.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:11:23
So close to that round number. After that, i'll save you a spot on the train to the moon mate!
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:51:59
How so? I stated that many altcoins will fall, but you have to see further ahead. After the dot com crash which was WAY bigger than this, good companies prevailed and became industry leaders. Aren't we hoping for that?
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:28:06
Thanks for the contribution mate. I can see the time put in the project!
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:15:12
We have come a long way dear Hodlers, but we have a long way to go too. Fasten your seat belts!
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:12:59
Banking is far from dying. This shouldn't be a war, but a gradual improvement. However, making it a war can just smother bitcoin with regulations
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:30:49
This is the time of one of the greatest wealth distribution in history, and we have a few ways to go in terms of gradual adoption and integration vs full blown war vs current economy. Let's see where the road takes us...
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:35:27
Hm, maybe making it a bit less overwhelming background wise
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:15:16
People don't even realize how small the Crypto market is right now... This is the new "internet", not a fraud that will crash and die out. But as far as many altcoins go, they might have the same faith as the unsuccessful dot com companies...
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:03:41
Anything for the community, my friend!
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:41:26
Oh that title, surely makes you look. Interesting nonetheless 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:57:43
No. Not at that low amounts sadly. Fees will eat you up
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:42:26
No need to be surprised, or disgusted for that matter. They are allowed to do it, and why should we care? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:05:30
And what a nice job you have done! Love both the fashion and the crypto enthusiasm
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:59:48
Unless you trade it, just set it and forget it. After all, this is just a small wave in the sea of bull and bear runs, which will eventually make bitcoin grand and great and widely accepted. Net your profits then!
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:56:42
People in the US have a problem with spending and trading BTC, but your point has meaning behind it. Sure transactions will keep BTC up and running, but we have to wait for it to be operational and worth spending to actually spend it, vs it being worth investing.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:10:31
Response to the title: No.
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:24:19
If you think of it that way, then think of BTC as war against banks and a hedge against the end of the economy as we know it. And from that perspective, it will never win. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:58:10
Thanks for the content mate! Enjoyed reading it and learned something! Cheers
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:55:48
We are getting there guys, just you wait.
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:16:36
Oh. My. God. This picture is pure amazingness! 
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:11:12
Exactly! It's a constant battle between what we are ready to pay and what they are ready to mine for.
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:56:17
And it turned out it was a good opportunity to buy. Sure sell/buy walls come and go, but general non manipulated supp/res zones will always be there, unless something big comes to eat them up.
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:31:31
Love her point of view. Nice representative of the crypto world!
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:48:59
Have some faith...
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:48:22
There is a lot of buy orders at 6400... That might be the bottom. Let's see what time tells us
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:03:47
Love the enthusiasm! 
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:34:29
Bitcoins stability increase might not be so bad. Markets will mature over time
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:46:09
All i said is that bitcoins stability increase might not be so bad. Didnt say its at this point or at any point for that matter... And markets WILL mature over time. As for this moment in time, we are just waiting for adoption...
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:31:59
Yeh my thoughts were that even though the model is old, Im pretty sure most advertisers would be buying for link juice and not actual clicks to their website, but then i guess if the site doesn't get the right promotion its wasted money anyway. Bit of a gamble, I wont bite the bullet just yet, will just keep a close eye on it.
Out of interest, what was the podcast?
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:11:41
Yeh i agree, hence why i was asking, just havent seen this done with bitcoin before or rewards for that matter
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:10:10
ha a bit harsh, was merely looking for advice. I saw this on bitcointalk and wanted some feedback. But thanks anyway
