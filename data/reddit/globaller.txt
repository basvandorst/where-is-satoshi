Great story.  I hope you give yourself a way to buy/earn more Bitcoins.  You can have more chapters in this story.

Thanks for sharing!  Andreas always gives helpful perspective.

Money sent.  Great to see the community showing him some love.  I just want him to buy and hold BTC with it.

TulipCoins, I noticed your main purpose is to pour negativity onto people who are into Bitcoin.  Is that such a fulfilling hobby for you?  I'm not into religion but I don't hang around churches hurling insults at those who attend.  If I'm right about my views I can just go about my day.  I don't need to make it my life's work to explain why I think they're idiots.  
Don't you have something more constructive and positive to do with your time?

It could have been worse.  Let's see what the next draft looks like.  
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:52:48
I wouldn't say that's the best part....But sure that's nice too.  
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:43:09
I use Coinbase and have had no problems with them.  I would definitely suggest that over Mt Gox.  I don't even go by Gox prices.  
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:58:53
Not sure why that got downvoted.  I like the idea.  Wealthy investors are part of this too.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:33:29
I have done the same, and I keep adding slowly.

I agree that for me college was good socially but I could have been successful in business without it.  I learned more in jobs and real life than I ever did in school.  
College is a good investment for certain career paths, but it shouldn't be considered the universal solution for everyone who wants a good job.  
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:23:07
Coinbase has always been good to me

What kind of Bitcoin startup?  (if you're allowed to give basic concept)  And what kind of timeline do you think most Bitcoin startups have from inception to bringing product to market?  
I ask because I'm curious when this year we'll see all these new ideas hitting the market.  I'm assuming most of them started in late 2013
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:31:47
I thought the more interesting comment came after the interview when he said that pretty much everyone he talks to in Silicon Valley thinks this is "the next big thing" and they really mean it.  
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:16:25
It feels like its been way too long since we all felt this happy.  It's great to see the good times back!  And so much beer to celebrate.  Gotta love the vibes!

Great work, but slightly gay lol.  Can you work on a Gentlemen Rally too?  (ideally more clothed)

Bitcoin darwinism
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:48:38
I've done the same thing.  I told myself to stop buying a few different times.  And each time I've gone past it.  It's money I could technically afford to lose, but I'd be pissed if I did.  That being said, we only get so many big investment opportunities if we aren't privy to inside information.  So I see this as an opportunity to set my family up for life if I'm right.  
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:33:40
I think that products and apps will be produced which remove the complicated elements that laymen don't understand.  Kind of like how AOL made internet for dummies. 
The thing I'm most interested to see this year is what kind of applications Silicon Valley will bring to market which facilitate the movement/use of Bitcoins in everyday life.  That will be a huge step which can lead to more adoption by consumers and retailers.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:08:25
I agree with the idea of having a list and focusing our tipping on 10-20 influencers.  If they see a deluge of tips coming in, they'll take notice.  $1 tip wouldn't make most people open an account.  
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:37:12
$10 sent.  Great idea!  Good for the community, good karma, and good for Dorian after dealing with this media frenzy.

Thank you!  Everyone is spending so much time focusing on the security.  It's 0.1 BTC!  I like the artistry.  Surprised nobody was more impressed with the look.  
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:05:36
I'm with you.  
@_date: 2014-01-03 13:41:45
Sorry if this seems snobbish, but its only $150 in BTC.  That's hardly a major loss, right?  I mean even for a college kid that's no tragedy.  
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:01:11
Great idea.  I just emailed him about it.  
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:47:35
Thanks for that link.  I just wrote to Cuomo.  I think everyone should do that in a civilized and well articulated manner.  
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:49:35
I got that same response yesterday that you did, and the tone/language impressed me as well.  
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:09:29
Agreed.  Anyone who reads news or stays aware of new developments would at least have heard of Bitcoin.  If the average Joe hasn't decided to take the chance yet, we dont' need to hold the train for them.  It's leaving the station.  Get onboard or catch up later at a higher price.  
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:18:57
Much better than some of the fools they usually have on CNBC who give stale arguments against BTC.  More opened minded host too.  
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:17:31
I like their overall rationale and 20% discount to encourage use.  Digital advertising people appreciating digital currency.  Makes sense to me.  
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:57:57
I've been buying from $17 to $1000 and on the way down.  It's a long term play.  Accumulation.  
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:11:04
Done.  It's good to reference how much you spend with them in a year.  
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:45:44
This is huge!  This is actually the first company I use regularly that now accepts Bitcoin.  As one of their high spenders I made a point to email them and give some praise.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:39:30
It doesn't matter if he bought at a better price, he still has a lot of money invested.  I got my first 100 BTC at a good price, and my next 100 at a high price.  I haven't lost money but I've put a lot in now.  What matters is his overall message about the big picture
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:13:09
Seems like its because of government selling coins from Silk Road.  I bought in at $590 because I still like the price.  Don't worry.  A few months from now you'll be glad you bought.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:33:36
I'm ready to help tomorrow.  Just let us know some of the choice targets.  I'll review them to make sure I like them of course.  But I welcome your suggestions for influencers.  
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:08:34
You're an idiot for telling everyone to sell now, and then buy later for a trip to the moon.  How old are you?  
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:59:33
Added my vote.  
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:14:50
You seem like a scared kid.  I'm not taking investment advice from someone holding 3 coins.  
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:03:12
I like your intention, but I think you'll need a compelling 1-sheeter that you can quickly hand to them with all the info on it.  I'm a NYer and that commuting scene is fast moving people who don't want to sit and hear someone preach about anything.  I'd say just have a really well designed piece of paper for each person who's interested and have $1 of Bitcoin on it.  
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:34:40
buy high, get high, and wait a couple years.

I loved his Bitcoin work.  But he really turned me off with his denial of man made climate change.  That's basically flat earther stuff to me at this point.  When I questioned him about it he was a real jerk and then blocked me.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:00:44
I loved this post when it was originally written.  Cool that his 2017 prediction still lines up.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:10:35
As someone who's working on a Caribbean plan myself, can I ask how you met all the Bitcoin millionaires in the Caribbean?  
Also, my understanding is the St Kitts process should take less than 3 months.  How come it took 1 year for your friends to get the passport?
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:42:50
DM me the details of that planning group if you're open to me taking a look.  I'm in the planning mindset lately and only have a few friends who are Bitcoin millionaires.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:36:48
Sold most at $600, was immediately relieved I was able to unload it on someone.  Still waiting on Coinbase to release the rest and hoping there are still buyers at a reasonable price when that time comes.

I own a home there too.  Does that help?  Considering you use the Russian propaganda word junta I assume you're from there.  So please, go back to enjoying your great country.  Don't let me distract your view of the world.

I bought a simbit based on the presentation and my personal preferences of the tiles.
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:49:43
I know, it's too much.  We want to encourage new users, but are we really that impressed that someone came up with $200?  I said that once and was quickly downvoted and called a snob.  I'm not rich, but don't post unless you're announcing 100 coins or an achievement that most of us couldn't do as easily.  
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:44:40
You seem very confused about what you're talking about.  
A.  I've been to Ukraine.  I like it.  Good people and good food.  
B.  Banksy didn't make that art about Ukrainians.  It's a popular piece against violence.  
C.  In 2014 the people bravely stood up against a Kremlin-backed president who was corrupt and breaking away from Europe towards Russia.  The violence was that president attacking the protesters.  
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:29:54
Great article.  I needed that.  
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:07:24
You bought 1 coin and you're worried?  If that amount is too much for you to lose you really shouldn't be doing this.  
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:59:18
This is great.  He needs to be on making the rounds on CNBC and other channels instead of the less knowledgeable people who are framing the debate.

Once the infrastructure starts being deployed I think the growth will be exponential.  Depends how long it takes to get that in place.  But I'd say $5,000 in 2014
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:10:53
My gut says to hold.  I could get out now with six figures.  But I believe in the idea.  If I'm wrong I can live with it.  If I'm right I can live well thanks to my instincts.  I'll take that chance.  But thanks for the warning.  ;-)
