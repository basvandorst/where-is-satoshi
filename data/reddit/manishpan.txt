Hi I posted this on another thread and you had my account deleted -  why was that?
I'm from the UK and work/live in China and use OKCoin and I can confirm some of them don't like foreigners. Hopefully you won't have to deal with this guy 霍比特（招行）Cai Can. In the past it took about 20 mins to get my money into OKcoin but with this guy it took almost 2 hours. It would have taken longer but I raised a support call and complained and someone called him and asked him to transfer the money. All I can put it down to is that he doesn't like foreigners, I was polite all the way through but he'd refuse to respond and waited upto 20 minutes without any reason each time. And as a parting present he flagged me as a risk so I had to spend almost 3 hours more having my ID checked again. He's one of the few guys that can transfer money and speak English so I had no choice. The first time I went through him he gave wrong bank details so I had to spend 30 mins trying to figure out why it was failing (you'd think he'd be copying and pasting his own details to me?).

Hi Chris
thanks it was my OKcoin account that was deleted, on the CN website.
Would be nice to know exactly why it was deleted without notification or reason.
Especially as I had passed the security check. 
The only reason I could come up with was that someone didn't like me posting something bad about OKcoin on this website.
I'll wait for your response.
