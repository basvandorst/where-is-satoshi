You're talking about properties that are intrinsic to Bitcoin, whereas they are not intrinsic to fiat. Bitcoin is not a security.

Don't disagree, but that's not really the point of the question.

Usually a security (an asset whose value is secured by the value of some other asset) stands in front of a hard commodity, or promise of value, or "an interest in a company" and its future revenue, and on and on. For instance, look at the definition of a security from the Securities Act of 1933. [1] In this sense -- and especially the legal sense -- Bitcoin is _not_ a security. [2]
The fact that it has no central authority is interesting and useful, even revolutionary, but this property in itself is not convertible into physical value. Rather, decentralization is a property of Bitcoin's utility which you mention. Moreover, one can argue that decentralization is the principal -- and _only_ -- utility that Bitcoin truly adds to digital currency.
Unlike other commodities like pork bellies or metal, where the utility of eating them or building with them is intrinsic and stable, the utility of Bitcoin as a method of decentralization is very much unstable. For the sake of argument, if the world suddenly decides that the complexity of decentralization outweighs the benefits, then the intrinsic value of Bitcoin's utility is 0.

Actually, at the level of micromanagement that Bezos practices combined with the fear that he strikes in his employees, I wouldn't be surprised if this was true.

Well, the fact that brainwallets use this scheme does not make it any more secure. Brainwallets are easily hackable [1] and even a scheme with a long password is far less secure than a randomly generated password. 
Still a cool idea!

This is really cool, but a little scary that anyone can guess your paraphrase. It would be awesome if you could import your own PGP keys, etc.

Sure, I think a lot of people assert the unsophisticated question of whether "Bitcoin will replace the dollar" or "be the next currency". Well, Bitcoin is not really a currency. For this reason it doesn't "need" to be backed by anything. But whether using such an instrument as currency is a good idea is another question.

Look dude, if we're going to live in Libertarian nirvana, it doesn't matter if we start with the drug dealers and prostitutes.

I disagree. The army doesn't back the dollar. The army merely makes sure that the U.S. doesn't go out of business. The government backs the dollar in the sense that it is legal tender -- that is, that merchants and individuals by law must accept dollars as payments for debt. 
The same is not true for Bitcoin. Miners do make sure that the Bitcoin system operates, but they do in no way give Bitcoin a legal tender status. No one has to accept Bitcoin. In this sense, it is not even a currency.

What's the backstory?
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:51:24
It seems logical to me that the value of fiat money is backed by the resiliency of the state to exist and to provide through its power certain guarantees about its money -- like the ability to issue it and provide legal protections to its holders.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

I don't think that's my point. My point is that the utility of fiat currency comes from its status as legal tender, which is provided by law, which is provided by the government. Whether governments abuse their currencies is a separate issue. 
As such, fiat money can be looked at as a security of sorts (backed by government's law to give it utility) where Bitcoin is not a security. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:13:28
Not to defend this guy, but he's mostly not saying anything very controversial. He's right that Bitcoin is not backed by anything (not a security) like money, and this is all a grand experiment to see if something like that can work. He's bearish and is entitled to his opinion.
As for the "we already use digital cash" argument, that just demonstrates that he is not a technical person and is not qualified to judge bitcoin or other digital systems on that basis. Can safely ignore.

Well, sure, but why does one need a hardware box for this? Just signup for "PaywallPass", load it up with Bitcoin or USD, and you have the same service in software.
I guess this box could be useful for inter-machine communication. My drone automatically pays your airspace toll, perhaps. My imagination is still failing to come up with something that would be useful today -- perhaps I have no imagination.
