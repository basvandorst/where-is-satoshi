Because BIP39 specifies how to represent a seed as a 24 word human readable phrase.
The 24 word format is for convenience only. It represents a number that is then used to deterministically derive the private and public keys.

How do you guys feel about portfolio tracking software? I am working on developing one currently because I am dissatisfied with what is out there and once it is ready for users I was planning on posting about it to Reddit. Would an announcement post be welcome in Even if you don’t care about day to day price movement my software will support things like calculating taxes for the US and Norway (because the latter is where I myself live) at least, and so I think it will have utility to a lot of people.
What do you guys think?

More transactions to the address have appeared.
Are any of these from you? If so, which of them? And do they bear any significance?
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:58:40


But are they intentional or only there because of random chance? Reminds me of the movie  [The Number 23 (2007)](

When you use the “₿” that way — as substitute for a regular “B” — I am reminded of the Spoderman MS Paint drawings haha.

Lol I thought your comment said “they are all prisoners, they’ll be gone soon” and was like “haha gonna send them to Australia?”

Thanks, I discovered today that the app I've been using was a total piece of trash that has been reporting wildly incorrect numbers. God damn it! So I remembered seeing your post about using Google Sheets and I came back here for it. Made a copy of it and filled it out. Thank you for making this sheet :)

On a nation level probably yes. For transactions between businesses or people though; only if you are talking about deposits.
I’d sell you something for a USD deposit, but USD cash would be pretty useless to me.

I live in Norway. Basically the only thing I would be able to do with USD cash would be to take it to the bank or a foreign exchange and pay a fee to have it exchanged into my own currency.
There is one or two cloth retailing companies that I know of that take some foreign currencies including Euros, Swedish kronor and Danish kroner, but even those stores do not accept USD cash that I know of.
Perhaps some grocery stores and restaurants might accept payment in USD cash even though they don’t advertise doing so, but if they did the exchange rate would be unfavorable to the customer for sure.
All in all, USD cash would be a pain in the ass to find a place to use and once I found some place to use it it’d cost me more.
Hence USD cash would be pretty useless to me, and I would not accept payment in it.
