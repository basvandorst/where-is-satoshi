Probably lead to some kind of pump regardless of the outcome with tory brexit or the big changes labour proposes. But do ye really think he's a communist? He wants to re-nationalise (some fully, some partially) bodies that were already previously publically owned. Royal mail, british gas, BT, railways all of which isn't revolutionary as it used to be owned by the public. These services &amp; UK were never considered communist.
Sadly for public services (yay more binmen strikes!), NHS and the local councils the tories will very likely win, but that should be a good thing for crypto as they're moving the country towards instability with the focus on accepting no deal and increased individualism.

Yeah that's what I meant, some services fully, some partially, openreach is a division of BT, so partial.
Yeah he's a politician so inherently a wanker, but communist is over the top IMO. You can believe in mixed and/or regulated markets and not be one. People going down the divergent routes of calling Corbyn a communist and Boris a nazi (not saying you said that, just some people do) seems to extreme to allow reasonable discourse. But that's only my opinion of course, and I appreciate your response!

Not sure if you're mocking or not, but if anything this description to an outsider would make bitcoin sound like a ponzi scheme lol

RoIreland would veto any decision by the rest of the EU that would result in a hard border with Northern Ireland so they would fully oppose kicking the UK out with no deal. The ball is currently in the UK's court to make a decision that the EU is happy with.
