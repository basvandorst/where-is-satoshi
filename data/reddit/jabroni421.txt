Satoshi didn’t want to sell the idea of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:06:05
Uhh i don’t know how do to that.
When can normal ppl use LN?
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:20:35
Haha lol 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:43:56
All alt coins are pump and dumps?
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:29:17
Did bitcoin not start like that?
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:56:33
Yes. Like xrb 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:03:27
Which ones?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:38
What fees do you get when you buy from these businesses?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:52:57
I thought the whole point of bitcoin was the block chain technology?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:36:50
This guy fux
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:38:51
What about xrb?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:51:40
How will LN come up short?
Process times? Transaction fee? Failed transactions?
What are people worried about?
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:53:41
You don’t understand the Donald.
The only hate there is for Islamic extremism, which like you claim is based on merit, not prejudice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:37:00
What % was the fee I’m buying $30 worth?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:26:15
Yea, bc competition is bad /s
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:24:07
What are the odds rn?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:58:45
Thirded. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:04
Mostly 2.5 to 3 % 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:59:10
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:42:02
You sound like a douche FYI 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:44:25
So what is the average transaction fee? What would the % fee be of a $1.00 purchase for a soda or something?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:28:06
How does LN process the transaction differently than miners on the block chain?  Why not just implement LN solution in place of the block chain? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:54:21
So let them compete. If it’s a scam it will fail. Why would you want to stifle competition? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:09:55
Lol this guy^
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:10:56
But can what you perceive as “malicious intent” hurt investors? How?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:10:02
How do you cash out a physical bitcoin?
Or convert it to a digital one? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:19:44
Is Bitcoin Cash a Ponzi scheme? Is there any malicious intent that can hurt investors?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:02:55
Not rhetorical. I’ve just sent in and out of coinbase which I️ hear is a rip-off. What are the fees between two users?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:31:16
When can I use lightning network?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:04
4 hours later.... 
i hope you bought low, you could have doubled up by now!
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:00:14
Is the fee a true percentage of transaction or a set amount independent of transaction amount?
Aka, does this still prohibit small transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:30:21
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:10:01
Wow! That was incredibly hateful.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:50:46
Can confirm, new user here. No idea what I'm doing. Not buying Altcoin. Buying only bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:47:10
The Donald and this subreddit are the two actual positive places on reddit right now.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:19:27
Listen to what I mean not what I say. What matters here?
Think about what layer the majority of transactions are on.  Don’t knit pick. This is a good convo.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:21:45
You don’t “only” have to worry about fees.  But it should be a top 5 concern.  If you want to punch someone bc of a comment about fees that means there is a real concern with a large enough user base and also you should seek therapy, or start lifting weights.  Get that toxic masculinity out somehow lol.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:36:32
Why? Isn't coinbase protecting us from whatever vulnerability BTC has with S2X payments getting mixed up?
@_date: 2019-04-08 03:27:00
I don’t see a way to pay that little and have the transaction confirmed. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 03:37:03
I’m talking about just sending a bitcoin from my wallet to a friend’s wallet, or even a small merchants wallet.  
The fees I’m seeing are extraordinary.
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:26:15
The value is in the medium of exchange.  You can’t say something has value because it has value.
The fees on all layers are too high (relative to credit card fees). 
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:35:39
3) especially with all of the fees
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:55:22
Anything over “free” is too expensive
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:41:27
Is there mining software you can run on a computer at work?
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:51:11
Is coinbase acceptable?
New to the game, missed out on bitcoin gold this week. It sux.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:23:08
Uhh, this is me. How do I do this? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:06:01
I second this^
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:46:37
How does electrum handle the forks?
