Ding ding ding 
You have dug too deep into the ideology of HODL, please exit stage left

Haha exactly, although I assume he already owns all those things. He made a fortune of off is IT expertise obviously.

You are and idiot, but not for the reasons you think you are. You made the right decision not buying a lottery ticket because you had no information that would suggest that ticket would win and making decisions based of no information is what idiots do. The fact that you actually think you had a chance at winning the lottery and are now mad at yourself is what makes you wrong 
The point is the lottery is a scam, just because someone walks away with money doesn't mean it isn't a scam

It's always the same shpeel when someone says something bad about bitcoin here, "oh you just don't understand" "you don't have the same mindset as we do" but never do the people here care about understanding someone else's perspective from outside the positive reinforcement bubble that is this sub.
And then the new price is used as validation against past criticism. Despite the fact the people pumping the brakes on this sub who get covered in downvotes don't give a shit about the price.

I'm not shilling against bitcoin, I come here to learn by listening to what others have to say. When I disagree I view it as an opportunity to learn more. I think I'm right obviously but if I end up being wrong, I'll own up to it.

This type of response is literally exactly what I was talking about. Word for word I could not have created a more accurate description of the exact issue this sub has that I was referencing in my original reply. 
From calling me ignorant, to saying only you understand, only you "get" it, even to your "strong IT background", to using the price to validate your feelings when I just claimed the price wasn't the basis of my criticism. All the way home to telling me back to my cave. 
I'm so astounded someone could craft such a beautiful response I'm questioning whether or not this is satirical. Please don't delete this.

Making too much sense for r/bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:31:08
You have problems 
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:43:18
Ohh that's a good one 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:31:21
Or we could just listen to the people who identified them forwards instead of downvoting them because they were non believers 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:05:35
Take a second to reflect on the fact that because we just disagreed with you, we have to be shills 
You believe you are so smart and well informed that anybody who could have a conflicting viewpoint has to be a hired disrupter who goes on reddit to plant dissent to crash the price of bitcoin. I think you would be well served by trying to understand people you disagree with.

I think it's a shitty asset that nobody should invest in, and ultimately will be worth a fraction of what it is now. But trying to time the market no matter what your confidence level is is never a smart thing to do with your money. It only ever is if you have inside information which I don't 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:07:26
Damn I didn't expect to see someone making sense in this sub 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:23:01
I'll give you a hint: we haven't reached it yet

I will eat a brick if this comment is at still positive karma in 3 hours. The hodl bots are coming 
Edit: if you were dumb enough to believe bitcoin would stay at 20k you would probably be dumb enough to believe I would eat a brick
