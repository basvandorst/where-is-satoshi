The opposite could happen if only a very small percentage of the total supply (~15 million bitcoins) holders want to sell more after the halving. The halving increase is pretty insignificant if you compare it to the total supply now.
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:09:54
Not really. Because the Bitcoin price is 98% based on speculation and not real world usage. Most coins are already mined. Imho the smaller supply increase rate after the halving is not significant in context.

The hardware wallets purpose is to securely send bitcoin. It's an offline pc replacement. Not a safe. 
To just store it you can use an encrypted $5 USB stick with the same result...
To keep the seed safe split it with 2 of 3 or 3 of 5 multisig and store it at secure locations. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:24:49
It was a ledger and the seller just included a paper with a seed word list. The buyer used it.

For just using crypto exchanges are ok. But using crypto and investing life savings into it is completely different. You better research anything you put your life savings into. 
And no, hardware wallet scams are not prevalent. I haven't seen a serious one you would fall for if you did one hour research beforehand. 
Phishing sites are much trickier. 
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:47:48
If that's your agenda fair enough, i agree they aren't secure, but for many payment scenarios you just don't need absolute certainty/security at the moment of payment. An 'advice' (as satoshi called it) that a transaction was send to the network might be enough. So ignoring their existence doesn't seem wise to me.

Reality check: that was in the middle of the 2013 bubble and one day later the price swung between $750 and $390. Everyone would've dismissed it instantly as gambling not investing. A few days later the price was &gt;$1000 and the bubble popped. 
Only 3 years later in late 2016/early 2017 prices rose above &gt;$1000 again.

I used to think similar but 2MB won't help you anymore. There are just too many users now. And the majority doesn't transact onchain because the fees are too high. I only transact with altcoins since months. My feeling is we would need at least 12MB blocks to reduce the fees back to &lt;= $1 because by increasing the blocksize users will switch back to onchain bitcoin transactions. 
TBH i don't think Bitcoin will solve that anytime soon. However the solution for user is easy, just switch to an altcoin.

Absolutely not. You always make a physical backup. I have my seed memorized but you still need a physical backup.
Your setup is ridiculously unsafe, memory loss will make you lose everything. You always can get into an accident, get ill, you aren't getting younger. Memory failing is a serious risk.


Well, if someone has physical access the $5 wrench attack always works anyway, there is no perfect security.


Also applies to hardware wallets, well, he can just force you anyway to enter the pin.


Depends on how often you move the coins, i don't see which attacks surface area is increased


Literally everyone advices to make physical backups. You are failing at security basics 101, i can't count the number of posts i read about people forgetting stuff and losing access to things because they thought they were smart. There is no perfect security. You can easily split the seed multisig style and store it at multiple locations, that's pretty secure.

5% sounds about right.
A big german newspaper (Spiegel.de) did a survey a few days ago:
4.3% are already invested in crypto currencies. (Above 9% for 18-39 year olds, not just Bitcoin though)
Now, what you need to know: germans don't invest. Only ~14% own stocks. It wouldn't surprise me at all if other western countries are way higher up already.
The poll is also weighted considering the population ("women don't invest") and you need to register. Non-weighted poll is at &gt;11%. So it's at least semi-legit considering it's an online survey.

Why cringe? I'm the first person that dismisses overprices items but i don't think that's the case for hardware wallets.
You have to consider they are not cheap usb storage sticks but actually more similiar to an offline computer. They also sell in a niche market and develop free software for it all the time with excellent support.
The price is very fair in my opinion. TBH i would even pay considerably more for it.

I think LN is supposed for micro, small and high volume channels between parties which will move most tx offchain. That's scaling on a fundamental level. I think even bcashers want a 2-layer eventually. It just doesn't make sense to store coffee transactions onchain. In any case you still need enough blocksize for LN settlement so $5000 should be fine to transact onchain with a fee.
World money is pretty far away, either LN and later blocksize increases work out or another blockchain will take over naturally. In the long-term blockchain can't be stopped or restricted. The best system will eventually win. Unless you are a die-hard BTC maximalist you don't need to worry about that.

For Electrum or Mycelium you need an offline PC setup. That's really inconvienent.
It really depends on how much worth you have to secure and how often you have to move it. I personally wouldn't trust a hardware wallet with 6+ figures but below that i would take the very small risk, in the end it's about balancing convenience and security.

Well, that wasn't requested by OP. And if you go by amount (not holders, most people are poor anyway) most USD is also not used to buy/sell goods/products.
@_date: 2018-08-20 03:13:03
Bitcoin is not really deflationary though. Currently it's inflationary and it will ever only experience deflation if private keys get lost. That won't be very many once crypto becomes more mature. So the deflation rate will be way lower than 1% (probably way lower than 0.1%) when miners run out of coins to mine. How does this beat investing in stocks?
Bitcoin will protect you to not get robbed by the government by inflation, nothing more.

Isn't a monero transaction monstrous in size and therefore even more unscaleable than bitcoin?

We're still trying to make mbtc or bits happen? Both are way too controversial, they will never receive widespread adoption. 
Just roll with Satoshis already, they actually work fine. People are used to work with larger numbers in the millions.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:31:02
Well that theory of yours was proven wrong already years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:33:15
Nope. Basically a hardware wallet is an offline computer. (Think raspberry pi but even smaller). It never connects to the Internet. It only accepts unsigned transactions, signs them offline and sends them back via USB. With a real offline PC you do the same but instead of a USB cable you have to use a USB stick to transfer the unsigned transaction to the offline PC, sign it there and transfer it back to your regular PC. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:23:31
Well, looks like the majority of ordinary people are silently taxed then, thanks for backing him up.

What makes you think no one spends them? That's most likely rumors the get-rich-quick guys spread in the first place. I spend them every time i have the chance to pay with btc. They will be replaced at a lower price in this bear market which is extra nice.

This is a really bad idea. 28 years in crypto is an eternity. I give it a 90% chance bitcoin will be replaced by something better (which is not even in development today) in 28 years.  
Cash it out and invest the 210 bitcoins in something not high risk high reward.

Don't waste your time writing about them. The last normal people left r/btc months ago. 
All that's left is a hate fueled circlejerk.
I think at this point even the r/buttcoin users are less bitter. 
It's kind of sad because i was a r/btc supporter after its creation. Unfortunately it failed big time in becoming a good bitcoin sub.   
@_date: 2016-01-22 09:08:14
Depends. It's gambling / very high risk investing. If you like gambling sure why not.
But next time don't ask in a bitcoin forum. It's the same as asking in a xbox forum if you should buy a xbox or in an apple forum asking if you should buy an apple pc. 
Not the smartest thing to do.
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:06:12
It will crash and burn because bitcoin can't support many more users at the moment. It's unknown if your scenario will be technically possible in the future.

Bitcoin bubbles sometimes and the halving is coming. Look at the transaction volume during bubble periods. It's like driving blindfolded in the middle of the street while hoping there is no oncoming traffic.
@_date: 2016-01-07 06:57:42
I don't think so.
The developers would probably need tons of money transmitter licences etc. too much effort for the majority of game companies. And companies capable of doing it wouldn't invest in a bitcoin game.
And whats the advantage of bitcoin for that scenario? You would need to wait for every transaction. Custom ingame currency with cashout option would be more flexible. At that point you can use fiat/paypal as well.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:25:47
I may not understand the question because in the end the devs have absolutely no power at all. The devs only run the show until the majority disagrees. 
So by "do what they can" you mean writing mean blog posts and flaming the new fork?

@_date: 2017-03-30 14:13:05
1,6 TB per year in the 2020s? Sounds like nothing to me. And only if 32MB blocks are full in which case everyone here is rich as fuck anyway.   
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:58:30
Yeah, because non-americans are used to femto units. I'm from EU and Bitcoin SI units is top 5 most stupid ideas ever. It's like you people don't even want mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:55:39
Disagreed, i don't think your counter-counter arguments are very good. Understanding Bitcoins and Satoshis isn't very hard compared to almost all other suggestions.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:22:06
That's true. But rbtc is an echochamber too because everyone who posts pro-core/segwit stuff is downvoted into oblivion, therefore no one posts there.
@_date: 2016-01-18 11:06:09
Faulty logic. Registering at a bitcoin exchange is the equivalent to register for a visa card. Both are a pain in the ass. Once you are registered it's easy.

Yes. But the bitcoin project is more than just code.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:54:29
If BU hardforks with &gt;75% your bitcoin core coins will be worthless...
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:49:47
Even this compromise would be hard to get through now. This should have been done a year ago. BU isn't really desperate at the moment, they steadily increase in hashrate. Why would they want a compromise? 
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:29:33
The price would spike and quickly drop to previous levels once the people realize bitcoin can't even handle 0.1% of the volume needed for mass adoption. Ask again in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:25:14
Yes it is. ;)
You are free to search for older threads about censorship and bitcoin classic before the creation of rbtc. This sub was completely different back then.
I visit this sub since early 2013 and i'm supporting segwit not BU. But this subs moderation is the worst i've ever seen.
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:37:13
Hm? You can fork it anyway if enough people want it. It's open source.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:34:51
I agree. I support the core longterm scalability plans. But it's not enough, especially in the shorter term. Forking to classic and potentially losing developers is also disastrous.
A 2mb fork from core itself would be by far the best option for bitcoin.
Once it's clear the classic fork will happen and the core devs are not announcing a 2mb fork i really have to wonder who they develop for. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:47:59


I'm no expert but i think that's the point. That's why mmorpgs explicitly prohibit trading ingame currency for real money even outside of the mmorpg.

I don't see it. If the market wouldn't like it the price would already decline.

Uhm, the blog post reads like "dumb community vs. core developers". But actually it's the classic devs, miners &amp; exchanges vs. core devs. The uneducated (reddit)-community has no power at all. So the blog post makes no sense to me whatsoever. Or are you trying to say classic devs and miners don't know the technology behind bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-03-16 19:33:27
Bitcoin price range in november 2017 was $5,900 - $10,000. That's a long way off from a 90% loss.

To send fiat you also need to proof your identity first. You just already set it up. After that it's easy with bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:13:38
Big block support was always high in the reddit community. It was only after the banning of many big block supporters (and the creation of rbtc) that rbitcoin overwhelmingly supported the "slow scaling" method.

@_date: 2017-08-14 16:46:20
Not really. You just hold an extra % of your stack as your spendable 
portion. You just rebuy once it's empty.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:03:33
Hodl doesn't mean don't spend. The obvious thing to do is spend and rebuy the coins with soon to be worthless fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:26:36
Would be interesting to read such a proposal because to me it sounds impossible in your pov.
And you just created a very cheap attack vector. 
Even if 100% of real bitcoin users want to change the consensus a bad actor can easily stall bitcoin indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-01-20 07:06:23
Do we know if the other 75% want a larger blocksize at all? It seems like smaller blocks are better for miners in the short term? Maybe they just wait until unconfirmed transactions are a huge problem.

Really appreciate your comments. Changed my view a bit.
But that sounds like a serious fundamental flaw which will almost guarantee Bitcoin won't stay the dominant blockchain in the future. 
It will be very easy for bad actors (state actors, a highly funded competing chain or even an organized buttcoin crowd) to stall Bitcoin indefinitely. 
I think even most small blockers agree we'll have to hardfork somewhere down the road to unlock the most potential.

The only fatal error was to reuse your password. 
Why you would store any of that data on Evernode is beyond me. You store it basically on another persons PC. Same shit as Teamviewer accounts. Some Evernode intern is probably on a spending spree with your Bitcoins.
But seeing that you reused your password it's highly likely you used it in other places too. 
Maybe look up haveibeenpwned.com.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:32:11


Did they really? This list would be way more helpful if it were categorized into neutral and opposed to segwit2x. Then one could take it seriously.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:36:50
Your scenario would be the most likely if most bitcoin holdlers were rational and well informed. But what will imho happen is everyone will dump their 1x and 2x coins as soon as possible for fiat instead of facing a difficult situation where they can't move their coins, making both chains unprofitable to mine in the first place.


I thought this were true, but maybe you should tell this to the BCH miners as they didn't seem to get the memo.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:13:04
No one says only buy with Bitcoin. Just where you are able to.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:55:36

You didn't lose $5000.
You spent $5000 for gambling entertainment.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:36:23
Todays volume is over 3 billion dollars so i'm positive you can sell the tiny amount of 500 bitcoins without a problem.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:27:11
By your logic no one will use any currency anymore and only buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:28:14


I agree, but even better if you rebuy the spent Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:59:13
Sure. Either with new software tech (for example IOTA claims unlimited scaleablity) or eventually hardware and internet speed will be so fast they are not limiting anymore. But this may take 25+ years.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:47:28


Yes, people would do exactly that if they could use investements as currency! With Bitcoin you can. Bitcoin is investement and currency.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:08:01


If 80% miners leave the chain the value will drop tremendously because Bitcoin becomes unusable.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:13:06
"The current signalling percentages are a result of BitMain trying to get people to think that SegWit is on the way in order to hurt BIP148's chances."
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:10:04
So where are your calculations in the first place? As a software engineer i would have expected reasoning with something other than your mere feelings. But don't worry, don't even core devs do that.


If you calculate for future numbers you need also take into account future hardware and bandwith, also what is the optimal node count? It heavily influences the calculation. Good luck.

Famous last words.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:10:57
If there are no more miners these nodes are not defining the consensus rules. Because the network is dead.
You can't have consensus in a dead network. There is nothing to define.
Therefore the consensus of the segwit2x nodes is what will define bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:29:13
That will be a glorious day.

By that logic my regular currency is also too valueable to spend on regular stuff because i can easily buy Bitcoins with it instead.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:43:43
One man's coffee is another man's weekly income.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:25:16
By that logic you can never hardfork upgrade bitcoin, because there will always a few miners and nodes left on the old chain?
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:57:14


It will not be "disrupted", right. 
The network will basically just stop if 80%+ of miners jump ship.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:48:27
Easily. I could already upgrade 4x to 400 mbps. In certain cities there are already 1 gbps connections (10x) available. In 10 years this will be in the mass market.
A quick google search shows ISPs already doing 10 gbps (100x) tests.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:33:17
You sell if you need to buy something? Just like with your regular currency...
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:23:22
Did you reply to the wrong comment? I'm not saying you should put all your money in Bitcoin.
What i'm saying is spending either Bitcoin or USD doesn't matter at all as long as you rebuy.
HODL and spending is not contradictory.

$800 doesn't need crazy adoption. If there were crazy adoption bitcoin price wouldn't even be in the 4 digits anymore. 
And normal adoption is happening. 
Also we just halved the supply increase. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:50:11
So "rebuy" the bitcoins before you spend them? It's basically to support the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
You spent the USD either way.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:19:15
I really don't get what you are saying. 
The bitcoin creator himself stated:










Are you saying Satoshi wanted to create an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:52:04
Hold vs spend doesn't make sense. You spend the USD amount anyway. Every USD spent could've been converted to BTC and therefore is also potentially lost Bitcoin profit.
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:09:18
I think that feeling only happens as long as the average person can still afford one bitcoin rather easily. Once the price hits a few thousand dollars people will switch to fractions, bits or whatever.
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:28:42

Huh? My internet bandwidth increased by a factor of 16 since 2009.
People with shitty internet/bandwidth limit can't sync the full chain whether it's 2MB or 8MB. 
So the argument is kind of nonsense.
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:23:19
You are betting on falling price:
1. Borrow Bitcoins from someone. 
2. Sell those Bitcoins immediately. 
3. If the price is low enough buy back the same amount of Bitcoins and give them back.
You have money left which is your profit. Lending out and borrowing is an  automatic process on exchanges.

@_date: 2018-06-25 07:24:43
Just like it works well for buttcoin since 2011. Every crash they can celebrate. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:05:32
So what's the plan?
 Can we please prevent another even greater crash?
Imho most of the economy and community will side with Core.
But if 80%+ miners leave the chain it will be ununsable for a long period of time. This will cause a mega crash and completely destroy the trust and value of Bitcoin.
The only solution i see is a POW change which will result in the same outcome. Maybe only a drop to triple digits instead of double digits like in the dead chain scenario.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:17:12
No. But maybe the continued price growth will start a bubble. You will know it if the price increases &gt;10% every few days.

@_date: 2019-06-24 19:28:45
No. Not compareable in the slightest. 
Robbing a bank account is extremely difficult. There is a high chance the bank will get suspicious and trigger alarms, the funds are reversible etc. 
It's even more risky than storing $12,000,000 in form of gold in your home, which would already be considered insane by most people. 
Simply because you can't reverse a crypto robbery. You can catch the gold thief and get your gold back, but you won't get your crypto back ever.


The $5 wrench attack is not a story but a method. The same method was used by the robbers but with a drill instead of a wrench. Sounds even more effective.

@_date: 2019-10-28 07:55:07
Hardware wallets are not a paper wallet replacement, you need a paper wallet backup anyway. Paper wallets are horrible for spending/sending, that's where hardware wallet come in.

More people becoming aware of the technology.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:59:15
Wow, most methods listed here are not safe at all. I only hope you guys don't store your life savings in it.
You can't store an unencrypted seed in your home because of theft. But you also can't encrypt it because that makes your passphrase the single point of failure instead of your seed.
Every storage method i would even begin to consider somewhat safe needs to be based on multisig. How many and where you store the parts depends on the person/situation.
Also, memorizing the seed is an easily added redundancy without additional attack vector (ignoring the $5 wrench attack because that can break almost any setup, unless you are in some weird situation where the money is worth more than your life).
If you have fire, theft and memory loss covered you should be pretty safe.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:02
I don't understand this comment. If you just line it up the Mt. Gox peak would clearly not be visible because it's way more up than 1000% from the beginning. You wouldn't even see the first bubble in 2011.

@_date: 2019-02-17 21:25:11
Exactly. And in 2015 a lot of people were like "it will never bubble again, it's too late to invest, crypto is useless anyway" just like right now. Can't wait to repeat the exact same cycle in ~2023+...
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:45:04
Yeah i had some doubts because the fee situation is a PITA for Bitcoin newbies. Wouldn't be unusual to see more fee/no confirmation posts. But those downvotes can't be organic so you are clearly in the right. 
@_date: 2019-06-15 02:54:08
Unless you are talking about a dedicated airgaped setup the answer is security of course. A password manager won't help you against serious malware (nothing does but an offline setup/hardware wallet). The only question is if the risk is high enough to spend $100 out of 0.065BTC. I don't think so.

Do you really think currently almost 1% of all fiat has entered Bitcoin? I think that's not the case, not even close.
I didn't check if the fiat numbers are correct but that calculation is probably based on the common fallacy that crypto market cap actually means something, but actually it's almost completely meaningless because it's heavily inflated in various ways.
I would be surprised if you could extract even 10% of the market cap value back to fiat.

No one talks about it because it means the chain is unusable with $200 fees and practically dead. No one wants to talk about possible loser scenarios.

It won't be different. Usually it breaks ATH, rises an order of magnitude (to $100,000+ in the next cycle) after which it crashes down at least 80% but stays above the previous ATH.

No, no it won't. $10k to $1M is only a x100 now. 
Early 2013 to 2017 was a x2000. A lot of people already knew about it back in 2013. Sure, a few people got rich hodling but most people sold after x2 to x10 which didn't make them rich. 
It's just too risky for the average holder to sit out those x100 gains. And even if, you need to invest at least $10k in a highly speculative asset to become barely a millionaire.

Nodes are only important as long as there are miners. Without miners there are no blocks to validate. The current chain doesn't have a fast difficulty adjustment algo like BCH. It's quite possible the chain just stops if 90%+ miners switch all at once. So no matter how many nodes run whatever version it will be meaningless.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:01:15
The "coffee cost me $10,350 x years ago" viewpoint never made sense to me.
If you see it that way you also must consider every spare dollar that was lying around at your bank account at that time. The $100 you didn't invest would be worth $100,000 now too. Not converting it to Bitcoin did cost you 99,900$.
In conclusion, if you are absolutely sure Bitcoin will rise in value it doesn't even make sense to hold any fiat money. Just holding fiat money will cost you regardless. And if you don't hold fiat you have to pay with Bitcoin. It makes no difference.

It doesn't matter if it's hacked or your PC is seriously infected.
The chrome app is just an interface. It has no way of getting your private keys which are stored on the hardware wallet.
Your PC sends the unsigned transaction to the wallet, the wallet hardware signs the transaction with the private key and sends the signed transaction back to the PC. At no point in time the private keys can be accessed by the potentially infected PC. 
You can validate the address on the ledger screen, so even last second address changing malware is taken care of. 
It's pretty secure but no security is perfect. £350k justifies even better security, glacier protocol and/or multiple paper/hardware wallets etc. letting that amount of money sit on an online PC is just insane.

Just because the old network isn't open to arbitrary changes and still exists doesn't mean it'll still be called Bitcoin. Just like ETC isn't ETH anymore. In the end the whole ecosystem will decide which chain to call Bitcoin. If people see 2X as an attack they will sell it into the ground, easy as that.
Ignoring a few days of forced agreement mining shenanigans miners will follow the chain most people want to buy. So ultimately the statement "hashrate does determine what Bitcoin is" is true, but only indirectly, because they have to follow the value.

I can't understand your reasoning because if you are sure the price goes up it doesn't make sense to hold fiat in the first place. Therefore in your case you would absolutely want to pay with bitcoin and avoid holding fiat altogether. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:43:58
I don't see Bitcoin as just an asset. More like a currency which is not yet widespread spendable. 
Because i fully believe Bitcoin is superior to fiat and other investments i'm all-in. Therefore hodl doesn't mean don't spend (because i need to survive and buy things) but rather don't sell/convert to inferior currencies and investments.
So i'm hodling forever, not with a goal but because i see it as the best place to store value.

Many major addresses are reused (&gt;50% of all coins are currently vulnerable) and all addresses before 2012 are unsafe. So while your cold storage might be "safe" (as long as you don't try to move any coins) it will also be completely worthless for a long time. 
Bitcoin might survive, your blockchain stored wealth will not. That's what most people care about.

Well, that sounds rather urgent. You can't wait until the breakthrough was made or all that is left is upgrading a worthless chain. You need to code it, decide what happens with the millions of unsafe old coins and get consensus well before 10 years to be on the safe side. That will take years by itself if started right now.
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:27:06
Nice try overlooking the elephant in the room.


Millions of Bitcoins are stored in vulnerable addresses, that means your "safe" coins will be worth $0. That's not what people storing their wealth in Bitcoin would call safe.

@_date: 2018-03-11 14:49:49
Bitcoin is still very young and mainstream just discovered it in 2017. You can't expect it to be universally accepted by now. That will be a slow multi year process in the best case. Your expectations are way too high. If it is universally accepted you can buy your $1M Bitcoins.
If you know your shops and already own Bitcoins actually paying with it is not harder than with paypal. 
As for store of value, you obviously can't use it for short-term critical amounts. But it's an excellent niche store of value for high-risk high-reward long-term storage you don't want the goverment to notice (or just hide it from other people because you are actually part of the government). The same thing here, if it were a universally good store of value we wouldn't trade at just $9k.

Splitting the seed (at different physical locations) + memorizing is the way to go imho. 
Memorizing a story with 24 words is actually really easy and probably even more resistent to memory loss than most passwords.
Encrypting the seed doesn't make much sense, because than you have just worry about safely storing the passphrase instead of the seed. And if you store the passphrase in another place it's basically the same as bad seed splitting.
Therefore can't see how digital solutions are any good as they require passphrases anyway.

The problem is you don't see the reality but reddit circlejerk propaganda. Currently and in the near future bitcoin is nothing like gold. Gold is a conservative investment whereas bitcoin is still a highly speculative one. It's like black and white. Crypto is highly speculative *borderline gambling*. People already forgot 2013 and the fallout, it's ridiculous. "This time it's different -can't just crash back to $500".


That's all true if you want to use it as money/gold. But in reality 90%+ of crypto is speculation. For a speculative asset you take into account risks and potential.


Because the market says so. The market is made of people. People see the potential of ETH outweights the risks, compared to Bitcoin where there are less risks but also less potential.
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:47:50

Because losing money is a huge psychological burden for many people? It will inevitable crash/correct (and recover eventually). And you are the first they will blame.
Have fun damaging relationships over this.
Bitcoin is high risk speculating. Many people can't handle it. I would never introduce anyone to bitcoin who doesn't mention it to me first.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:04:33


Same, but reality doesn't care about idealism.


I don't really care about more centralization if that is what it takes to develop it properly. Both ETH and Bitcoin are far far away from maximum potential. Priority  must be fast development. Full decentralization must be an end goal though.


It's a bit like saying the computer market shouldn't be worth more than the calculator market in 1995 because it's less mature and computer hacks can happen. The potential of ETH is just way greater.

What do you even mean by that? Of course you can accept transactions with 0 confirmations. If it's a good idea is another story. The biggest german food delivery service accepts 0 conf since years without problems it seems.

There is like no real evidence that CW or Kleiman had anything to do with the development of bitcoin at all. Everything is backdate-faked or easily made up. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:41:58
Nope. Bitcoin market share is still at alltime low levels. People moved to other coins that's why bitcoin increased 2x in price and ethereum 20x.

Just to clarify: did you buy or sell &gt;12.000 EUR amounts through bitcoin.de (from your bank account)? Or just moved that amounts from bitcoin.de to polo and back?

That's why i invested in the Ethereum ICO.

Nice arbitrary timeframe. Look at the ratio since yesterday. Or the last 6 months. ETH is up like 2400%, way more than BTC.
The critical point is the ratio. ETH always gains ratio in a rally but loses in a crash. But now it's up so much it will flip way sooner than previously if we rally again.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:10:09


Often repeated false information, by the end of 2013 it had less than 1/3 of total volume.
"From 20 October through to 23 December, the average daily trading volume on BTC China has been 55,216 BTC, while Mt. Gox and Bitstamp have averaged exchanging 34,192 and 32,235 BTC per day, respectively."
Of course the BTC China volume was fake but Bitstamp was also a big exchange back then.

lol, obviously 10% was just a random number to give you some idea. 34% is bad enough but apple has actually also over $100b in debt. So a bit over 10% then. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:34:53
Wasn't that supposed to be a hoax 2 years ago? Officials denied they have 200k Bitcoins and people guessed they probably seized $200k in Bitcoin, not 200k Bitcoins. Source is a random twitter account? Oh god.
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:43:56
Well, there is just no better solution. Blocksize increase would only reduce fees in the short term. BCH only has low fees because it's not used. You can fill up 32MB in no time with low fee spam, look at Veriblock. What do you think happens if more companies like that pop up? They could fill 100MB blocks by themselves. BCH already failed their blocksize tests at like 22MB? For a cash replacement you need gigabyte blocks. You realize the difference in scaling between 22 and 1000+? It's decades away to be possible to do onchain in a decentralized manner and BCH is currently about to prove it.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:00:45
Mainly its a precaution for when Bitcoin enters 6 digits, also having $6k and having $6k to spare for highly speculative investments is a huge difference.

That advice only applies if you don't need a ridiculous moonshot to make some money in the first place. Cashing out pocket money to limit your possible profit by 50% is a very bad deal.

Not everyone can run a full node. That will always be true. Especially if you live in the forest. ;) You don't have to live in SF, just not in a rural area with shitty internet. There can be enough nodes hosted in cities all over the world. 
Not even necressarily in the US, which has shitty internet compared to many other countries.

A dishonorable move like this would probably piss off big players (bitmain) and motivate them to take even more drastic moves in the future, resulting in a net negative for Bitcoin.

SMS 2FA? Why is this even provided by Coinbase? Everyone knows it's not secure. If it didn't hit a professional in the field i would say Coinbase is partly responsible. That's like allowing users to set 3 digit passwords.

Ah, technical details, you don't seem to know what most people mean by "on ledger" is just "not lightning". Unless the discussion is especially technical of course. That's why you can't conclude "OP asked for on ledger payment. 0-conf transactions aren't on ledger." from OPs post.

We are in a bubble. But not a Bitcoin one. Look at the crypto market capitalization. Bitcoin is less and less relevant unfortunately. 45% market share and declining.

Why would you do that? It's way less safe and completely impractical. Seems like you don't understand the attacks.
They work once your device is operating. So you need to know the PIN/PW in the first place.

What's your point? I already uploaded way more than 200GB/month during the torrent era in 2004, 13 years ago. No one cares about a few rural nodes in the outback.

That's one option. Another one is to just use a non-premium blockchain to buy coffee. You don't need a high security blockchain for pocket change. Crypto can (and does) already scale in that way now.

Transactions are pretty much instant. If and how many confirmations you need can depend on a lot of things.

Oh, this must be trolling right? Ok, i'll answer just in case you are really clueless.
Because your post indicates you don't even understand Bitcoin security practices 101.
Before you advice people, please do research, fucking Dunning–Kruger in action.


Is this a serious question?


No. The point of Bitcoin offline storage/security is that it never touches the internet. **You do that by signing transactions offline. That's the whole point of an offline raspberry pi or a hardware wallet in the first place.**


No one is arguing this. A hardware wallet is encrypted too. The point is you adviced people to use an raspberry pi because you misunderstood the article. The attacks in the article are more of academic nature, i personally don't know for what you need to attack the private key if you have access to the device in the first place.


NO. NO. Oh god no. Did you just compare Bitcoin attack vectors to email and online banking ones? Don't you realize the attacker/malware only needs to get your private key and that's it? All is gone?
You can't compare it to online banking in the slightest: Bitcoin doesn't have 2FA/TAN, Bitcoin doesn't have daily limits, Bitcoin doesn't block suspicious transactions, Bitcoin doesn't have banks and a police force who will deal with that for you. 
Stealing your Bitcoins is fucking easy in comparison.
I'm just glad you probably don't hold that much or you would've done your research. Many people here hold 6 figures+, you can't just half-ass your security with Bitcoin.




If you want to go overparanoid with Bitcoin you use something like this: 
This will probably blow your mind.

Somewhat agreed, it will crash down hard once really bad news come around. And they will eventually. But my guess is the entire crypto market will collapse. Bitcoin will do a bit better but still lose USD value. 
Currently it's 2013 in overdrive. I already can see the day suicide hotlines are thrown around again because the amount of dumb money investing more than they are willing to lose is staggering.
