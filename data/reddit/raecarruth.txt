Sounds just like PayPal or the conventional fiat money banking system.

Nobel Prize is bullshit.
This guy's achievement is there for the world to see - no need for a silly prize.

It's priced at 7.58 but the price was lower earlier this year.
To be honest that domain is useless to anyone who doesn't own the matching .co.uk or .com site.

Electrum is lightweight and n00b friendly.

A large part of Africa has hardly seen computers?
Nice display of ignorance and bigotry there.
The man is in Ghana, not the freaking Gobi Desert.
Try educating yourself.
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:22:44
No sir.

There were bitpay adverts on the side and they ran bitpay commercials during the breaks.
I don't think it was about being a 'good guy', this was about ensuring that potential customers connect bitcoin with bitpay.

This looks so much like the sites I'm used to seeing on the Dark Web...
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:02:02
Thanks. Why the reposts?

Your statement is predicated upon ignorance. You have attached a label to a situation that does not pertain this case. He is in Ghana, the people there have access to computers. You decided that you would make a blanket negative statement based upon your own narrow minded, limited experience and knowledge of 'Africa' - such a label is indeed bigoted.

They added 2FA. Surely that negates this issue? (I'm no crypto expert, just asking).

What happened that so many people seem to have suffered security breaches this Thanksgiving?

Armory looks better by the day...

Not at that price...

This isn't nearly as bad as the African moon project (or whatever it is called) but I take your point.
It could be genuine ignorance or it could be that the OP is just tailoring his message for a largely ignorant crowd. This is what they are used to, sadly.

This clown has abused enough platforms to promote his scams.
It's about time the community said "enough".
Goodbye Garza.
Lol at $20 Paycoin. (0.019 btc at the time of writing)
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:18:20
Or that. I feel the same about the Africa Moon project. To be fair this dude hasn't put his hand out for any money yet.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:57:47
An unjustified negative impression is also bigotry, this is what you displayed. Why relay an opinion that has nothing to do with the story?
Keep lying to yourself.

"God awful wankers"?
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:58:52
Nice work.
This is very much necessary.

Right, so after a while you come to learn the limitations of Coinbase and graduate to something else.
@_date: 2019-02-05 13:09:19
Most Indians are not using Bitcoin. They should be more concerned at how their own senseless policies have destabilized the Rupee.
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:02:08
There aren't that many 'Buddhists' in India (relative to Hindus) and the people who lived through Partition might want to talk to you about your whole 'non-violent' spiel.

Reasonable fees are fine but 10% is pretty steep - that's often the entire profit margin gone.

No, he means that he doesn't know what he is talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:51:02
I don't get why anyone who isn't a complete n00b continues to use Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-07-03 09:23:38
A blessing in disguise.

I knew the British government was moronic but this is hilarious.

Becoming? 
The financial services industry is entwined with the political landscape.

Probably looking for ways to move his illicit funds.
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:13:57
21% sounds like a lowball figure.
No one is happy with the 'fees'.
You also need to factor in all the people who were turned off by the eBay/PayPal marriage,

I always feel for people who have invested their entire life's work into a system that is nothing but a scam.

Do you need to pin your mast to one or the other?

This project has dragged on quite a bit, sadly.

This season has been horrendous so far.
@_date: 2016-07-15 13:25:30
The second episode was even worse than the first. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:32:59
This guy is the worst side show in tech right now.

LOL.
