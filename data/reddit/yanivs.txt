We're going to add Namecoin and Primecoin soon. More information can be found in the article that was just written about us on [CoinDesk](

We are working on API's and are open to suggestions. We are storing all of the coins offline (Please allow up to 24 hours for withdrawals). You can deposit by sending us cryptos. We are looking for integrating advanced features (stop loss, options, etc.) once we have the basic features working immaculately. Limits already exist and are being implemented.
As far as push ups, I can do at least 20 (That's right Shamoon, I'm doing 5 more than you)

I'm not sure alt coins will ever pick up. It'll be hard for them to beat bitcoin. Why would anyone use litecoins when you have a perfectly functional bitcoin system?

So you agree.. It's not right.. New world order?

We have noticed that as well and are looking into it. Are you on chrome?

No sir (maam?), we have the regulatory aspect covered on cryptocurrency. We are looking to implement fiat in the near future which is proving to be the more heavily regulated issue by the individual states.

Oh I see what you're saying. So do you believe that the prominence of alt coins will be heavily based on the niche applications they have? Or perhaps that new alt coins will be required for these new applications and we will need new alt coins with entirely different properties?

Freedom of Commerce.. Why is it that I can be told how to store or exchange money but can practice any religion and can say what I want?

We are still open to suggestions about that but as OP stated, we are leaning towards a maker/taker (rebate model) similar to what was implemented on bitfloor.

Thanks for the tip, will do!

I was thinking more along the lines of certain businesses benefitting from having no cap on the minting of the coin so it will be more prominent in an industry that values steady inflation. Or perhaps an application that requires quicker transaction times will lean more towards a coin where the average block discovery time is lower.
What properties do you believe are more valuable or have a brighter future?

Being a meta-exchange was our initial plan. This[ blog post]( should answer your question. 
TL;DR: We had to  change our business plan to get the ball rolling in the short term but are still looking to be a meta-exchange in the long run.

You construct a sentence that executes the trade as if you are saying the trade to someone else.
In this example I am buying 10 BTC with my LTC at a price of 33 LTC per BTC. In other words, I will use 330 LTC to receive 10 BTC assuming that there is a counter party to complete the order.

So after doing some more research, I have found out that some of the major differences between bicoins and alt coins are the following design choices:
* Coin cap
* Proof of work vs. proof of stake
* Hashing methodology (some are designed against ASIC mining)
* Average time for block discovery
What other design choices do you want to see (ie: some coins have a random "jackpot" block)? What configuration do you think will make the ideal coin?

Please email support with your information and we'll take care of it from there =)

We are working on fiat integration but unfortunately we are dependent on other parties for compliance. While we sort that out we decided to launch a beta without fiat.
