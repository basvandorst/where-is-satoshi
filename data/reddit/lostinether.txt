People generating multisig wallets typically already generate the keys on separate computers, patenting this obvious process for increased security is insanity and stifles innovation.

First how does PoW have more "development paths forward" and what does that even mean?
Also 21.co device is laughably bad speaking as a developer.
PoW rewards those who have access to manufacturing or who can afford massive server farms. It suffers from the same problem. 
Each have problems but you are claiming this problem is unique to PoS and it is clearly and demonstratively not.

I don't see how proof-of-work doesn't reward the already rich. Only people who can compete now are those with enough money to build a Bitcoin mining farm.

Since forever? I have several devices around me I was able to obtain for free including a leap motion.

That point I agree with but I don't see how that necessarily rewards the rich. 
Many good Stake system give around 1% of interest on stake which is less than most savings accounts.

I'm so innovative that I realized that any computer is a Bitcoin computer making their product obsolete for my Bitcoin development :)

Speaking as a developer, we typically get offered dev devices for free or usually at reduced cost. 
If they wanted to get developer interest they would have released the code and possibly instructions to run it on a raspberry pi.
They are selling a 400 USD hardware dongle that most developers don't need or could easily do themselves with raspberry pi 2's we already own.

How as asking you to prove your claim a cop out? It is basic logic, if you make a claim you have to be able to support it. Otherwise the claim is meaningless.
You would not need to reverse engineer anything because they are all open source.

Seems like "finetch sector" is taking credit for what a random hacker did.
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:12:55
So you don't want to disprove people because you won't profit from it? Seems like an easy cop out.
Are you suggesting you would have to have the capital to buy up more than half the available stake because as you buy it the value would increase to the point you could no longer afford it.
Edit: And for the same reason people with half the mining power are unlikely to do double spending attacks the same goes for people with half the stake. Doing so would ruin their the value of their holdings.

How can you make this claim when there are several working examples of it operating longer than a year without any major security issues.

As a developer who regularly adds TCP connections to various devices I find it insulting that I need their device to integrate Bitcoin with a raspberry pi.

That is exactly what it means, the code is open and the developers would happily talk to you about it. There is no reverse engineering required, all that is required in education on the topic.
On the other hand it would require you to have enough knowledge of how consensus works in a distributed system and a some knowledge of programming.
You are using a lot of ad-homs, making wild claims and have yet to provide any actual proof or demonstrations. In fact no one has been able to in over a year of operation of several cryptocurrencies operating on a proof of stake algorithm. 
While there are obvious issues with both approaches, because there is no free lunch, you are making wild claims that one is unanimously superior and the other in unanimously flawed without any support. Which just seems to point to your lack of knowledge on how these systems work and what each of their benefits and drawbacks are.
PS: I have read and know the source code well to both the popular proof of work and proof of stake cryptocurrencies, if you can not say the same thing maybe you should back out of this conversation with some grace before continuing to defend your specious claims. I don't have political or financial viewpoint, I look at it from an engineering perspective.

As a developer it is a pretty poor dev starter kit, if they wanted to get devs interested they would have released code and possibly a guide to run it on an arm device. Not overcharged for a raspberry pi 2 which most of us own already, and we usually get dev devices free or at reduced cost, not 400% marked up.

Not impressed.

The beauty of computers is that any computer is a Bitcoin computer. A computer is a function to a developer, it takes inputs and puts out outputs. It is sad that we have been trained to think they are only for browsing the internet and email so we can slowly be resold their infinite possibilities back to us one feature at a time.

Can we agree there are better alternatives than to stooping to games played by the old guard of technology companies.
