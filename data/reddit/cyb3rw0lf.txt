"credit" is not borrowing currency, it is borrowing newly created bank credit.. it did not exist before the purchase &amp; exists only as debt.
fractional reserve debt based banking will lose out to cheap transmissions of positive value bitcoin

First, learn about taxed &amp; how to properly fill out your forms. If you are not a Fed employee income taxes do not apply to you. 
HERE'S THE LIBERATING TRUTH IN A NUTSHELL: The income tax is a benign, Constitutional tax that simply doesn't apply to the earnings of most Americans.
Most people are to stupid to understand they are being robbed.. and the ones who do know are to chickens to standup to the it's machine. Yet with their own forms the truth is hidden.
