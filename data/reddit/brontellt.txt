This story is what started the bubble in late in 2013. A buddy sending this story to me is what spurred me to buy in.
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:21:00
My point was that I'm likely not the only one to approach spending BTC this way. Coinbase has functionality built in to replenish your holdings as you spend, so obviously they see this as a feature that will be desired by the masses, also. For me personally, the cost of the exchange fee is $ well spent to avoid missing out on the potential upside of holding BTC long term.  
I want to spend BTC to help build the ecosystem and support companies that are utilizing Bitcoin early on, while keeping my BTC holdings constant.

Micro payments. Allows your company to monetize on a per video / per minute basis.
@_date: 2014-06-12 04:45:27
I dont understand why we should expect a discount? And what discount would you expect when the merchant is saving only a few percent on transaction fees? I get yeah it will help spur along adoption but it just feels forced and i think its asking a lot from merchants. Let the benefits of BTC make themselves evident w/o the gimmicks.
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:13:46
Well not really because the site isn't actually accepting new users, you still need to request an invite.  Once this goes live and the acquisition of BTC is as simple as described in the video, it should get interesting.

Im a cord cutter currently but this may just have swayed me back to the dark side. If i went back to dish, because I already have a coinbase acct, I would simply set up a recurring monthly buy in the same amount as my DISH bill to replenish my supply. Pretty certain many of us would do this and thus have no downward pressure effect on the price.
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:41:25
Do you actually have a source to back this up? I had a feeling this would be the case.  Couldn't be better timing if its true.
Edit : typo
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:13:30
I cut the cord a while back and im pissed that this might drag me back onto Dish, even though I dont really have a desire for cable again. Its just so damn cool that they did this
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:14:59
BC this is how it always works, people dumping ltc to ride btc upside. Ltc will recover and then follow btc up, it just lags behind a bit.
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:20:35
Unfortunately, yes.  But I guess its still good that we're getting exposure beyond the financial/tech outlets that BTC is typically covered in.
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:10:33
Cool improvement this time around is that they will be using the blockchain to pick and verify the winner.  This should hopefully improve the % of users that actually donate - some were skeptical last time about how the winner was picked.
These kinds of things are going to show the world what Bitcoin is actually capable of beyond being a digital currency.
@_date: 2014-06-10 20:18:34
He must not have liquidated all of it, as he's paying employees in BTC, according to the story.
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:35:43
From a selling btc perspective, it would make more sense to imagine sending fiat back to a debit card linked to bank account as opposed to a credit card? I could be misunderstanding completely.
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:19:16
Whether they're right or wrong, they are contributing more to the community than this post is. The guys consistently posting charts and TA on r/bitcoinmarkets invest a lot of time in their daily posts and I personally look forward to reading what they have to say every day, even though I've never once bought or sold on their analysis.
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:55:03
Well that's irrational.  You lost confidence in an article that made simply mentioned her name and an article she wrote (the article referenced was actually fairly well written and accurate), disregarding the rest of the information provided? 
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:11:03
Its actually EXACTLY like the previous climbs.  We should do a slow and steady climb for a few more weeks prior to the big run up.

I had the same overwhelming feeling again today that I had in oct last yr. So I bought a few more coins - one each being dedicated to each of my kids. At 18 the coins are theirs. Either they'll pay for their college, or they'll be worth nothin.

To help build the ecosystem and support merchants adopting BTC early on. To me, the 1% is well worth not missing out on the potential upside of holding BTC long term.
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:09:32
Were not that far away from the next bubble. Too much positive happening right now.  Sell walls like that are put up and pulled back down all the time, so I wouldnt expect all 5k BTC needing to be sold to move beyond $480. Theyll pull it if they see a surge of buying building
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:27:33
This is on the front page of Yahoo right now
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:47:18
I'm mostly playing devils advocate and agree with most of the above.
The one part of widespread adoption I'm looking forward to is transacting with businesses overseas.  We do a lot of business with companies in countries like Lithuania and Nigeria - we aren't willing to take credit cards due to the chargeback risk and the high fees associated with large transactions.  We default to taking payment via wire, which is cheap, however we always wait until the wire clears prior to shipping, which delays everything a few days.
@_date: 2014-07-15 18:29:35
Should be fun with the all star game in town!
@_date: 2014-05-17 09:33:12
We only just had our first two months ago. Im screwed if we end up with twins on the next go round...
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:00:25
Same here, they always buy something in the $500-800 range, have it shipped overnight so they get it right away, then a week later chargeback.  We lose every time even though we provide tons of info.  We've essentially locked down all available security features the Auth.net offers, to the point of real customers not being able to check out - so not only do we lose from the charebacks, we ALSO lose out on potential real customers...  Woof
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:34:07
Who knows, I find it hard to believe that their posts have THAT much sway in any direction.  I've made my only BTC purchases based on pure gut instincts and the general feeling I get having read this sub every day.  Hasnt let me down as of yet - hard to go wrong really if you adopt the buy and hold mentality.  I do hope that their theory of the bubble cycle continues a couple more times! 
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:35:46
My first home purchase turned into my first rental property when I bought my second home, so sometimes they're one in the same.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:42:51
People have been saying the exact same thing for the entire history of Bitcoin.  @ $1 ea, $10 ea, $60 ea, etc.  And it will continue in the future @ $1000 ea, $4000 ea, etc.  You also dont have to buy full Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:43:21
This was also on the front page of Yahoo finance, great to be back on the front page with good news.
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:11:24
If thats the case, then there doesnt seem to be much value in btc from the consumer side and were going to be fighting an uphill battle in reaching widespread adoption. As a merchant, im not going to go through the hassle of btc and do it for LESS $ at the end of the day.
@_date: 2014-12-24 15:58:59
Give it some time, jeez. The winner was just confirmed a few hours ago. If you look at the winners thread, many are donating $5+. Bah humbug

This is the part I dont get. If we as merchants have to offer a discount to incentivize customers to use bitcoin in order to avoid CC fes, isnt it a wash?
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:18:27
A little early to start demanding a things wouldnt you say? Lets support the merchants getting this rolling on the front end and be happy they accept it at all.
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:03:04
Anyone know of any major retailers that use this system?
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:14:35
Are they using the term CC and debit card interchangeably? That was my assumption.
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:46:58
Aw hell yes! Just got two more chargebacks today! This is the best.
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:31:28
No but LTC did just get added to BTCChina as of a few hrs ago, Huobi is next.
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:28:02
Now this is a great idea. It not only gives BTC visibility but also highlights a feature that wasn't possible previous to BTC. Imagine if someday on the bottom of the screen where they show their name/trunk color, they also included a QR code to directly support your favorite fighter.

From a consumer perspective I think it's great to buy from Amazon instead of direct, that way I actually have recourse if they dont fulfill with a quality product or worse, any product at all. I dont personally have a lot of faith in BTC hardware companies actually shipping the gear after getting prepayments

Screenshot of CNN Money  Its a pretty rudimentary explanation of BTC but it does highlight the risks and benefits pretty fairly I thought.  The anonymity to buy drugs part was frustrating.
I guess a good unbiased introduction for those that have no idea what BTC is.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:01:38
I fight that feeling everyday, too. But imagine the opposite feeling if this all comes crashing down. I don't believe it will but it could.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:41:19
Same happened to me - I emailed them politely explaining the situation and sent as much info as I could including screenshots/scan of my DL etc.   Just got an email that they honored my original price and they pushed the transaction thru, already have the BTCs in my wallet.  They also whitelisted me.  Just email them politely and they will take care of it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:50:34
We haven't, posted a link to our site here but it got buried. It should be pretty seamless though once we start moving product in BTC as we have auto convert to usd set up with coinbase. Hopefully see the first btc deal soon!

@_date: 2013-11-04 23:01:58
Actually, I currently hold 80% LTC / 20% BTC; so I guess that says I believe the general idea of Crypto will flourish, and that in the short term LTC may have a better upside from an investment perspective.  But who knows.  I'd probably prefer to be 50/50 in each.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:09:06
At what market cap do you think the banks would be interested/threatened enough to get involved? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:36:35
Hoping Coinbase/Bitstamp etc are fully functioning soon as we could be missing a huge opportunity of new interest if those people are A) unable to purchase B) left with a bad taste in their mouth upon trying when confronted with the current issues...
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:57:50
We just incorporated btc portal into our checkout but haven't seen much traction. Have you guys? We do enterprise hardware, b2b. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:21:12
But remember, you haven't actually LOST anything until you sell, just like you haven't actually MADE anything until you sell.  If it loses 50% of its value tomorrow you have lost nothing until you actually liquidate the BTC (which I would not recommend if that did happen). 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:06:52
Agree also.  We sell enterprise IT hardware and have been waiting to ship 4 racks of storage to Nigeria for close to a month because our customer has been limited to one $10k wire transaction per day.  If we had used Bitcoin (which we now accept) the funds would have been trasferred and the freight would be half way to Nigeria by now...  Our company will see a HUGE savings once we start ramping up our use of Bitcoin in B2B transactions.  Problem is that Bitcoin is typically held by individuals at this point, not corps.  Hoping that will change soon.
