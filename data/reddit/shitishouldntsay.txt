Oh my bad.  It must be someone else that is down voting only the comments I make to you almost immediately after I make them.

Who pays for them? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:01:48
What about people that would like to use them but don't have money? Just no school or roads for them. They can just stay right where they are and teach themselves? What about military. Should we just defend ourselves? Taxes pay for a lot of stuff that we don't want to do without.

If there are no taxes there is no government. tell me of one place on earth with No government. A power vacuum will cause someone to come calling. 
Lets say it works out perfectly and the free market takes over. We still end up with no federal oversight. No workman's comp no minimum wage no OSHA MSHA. Corporations are allowed to do whatever they want to make as much money as they want with only the free market to check them. Nothing could possibly go wrong with that. 
No Public Police forces. That means no one tracking counterfeit money or looking for your kids when they are being ransomed back to you. The entirety of America would be the wild west but with modern culture and weapons. (unless you can afford the private police.)
No free ambulance or fire trucks. If you house is on fire you better be standing out front with your credit card. Have a heart attack better have money available so they can pick you up. 
Utility companies (Water, Gas, Electricity, Sewage) would no longer be regulated. They could just do whatever they want. You think coal is bad, I bet they can make more money burning used tires to make power. Don't like it stop buying power and let the free market sort it out. 
No more EPA or the government Regulations in general. Think Flint Michigan water but for everyone that cant afford to clean it. Sewage getting pumped into rivers. Waste being dumped where ever people where to poor to do anything about it. In Poor areas sewage and waste would be a real issue. With no regulations human waste would run in the gutters. No one in these areas would have immunizations so disease would run rampant. 
 
Even if foreign invaders never showed we would become something I don't want to be a part of. The few would prosper and everyone else would descend into poverty. If you had running water and electricity in your shack you would be doing good. There would be shanty towns full of the poor and uneducated in every major city. Crime would be out of control. Fire could wipe out entire communities. Dead bodies would lie rotting in the streets. Large swaths of major cities would have no roads, power, or running water. Ill just pay my tax's.

I'll play along and say this works for roads. What about all the other things that taxes pay for? Should we let the free market take over the military? What happens if you're suddenly disabled and can't work anymore, time to put you out to pasture. Put a bullet in you?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:56:39


There is no public police force. I should just save up my money and hire private police to shoot / arrest the home owner (dirty pedo). I get to keep the house and the company that owns the police made money. Free market at its best.

Well, thanks for the downvote with no explanation. From a casual user's perspective, Bitcoin is useless. 3 hours now and still no confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:12:43


You linked to one website. A website that is a little less than credible. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:00:25
You guys are awful hung up on the roads. They are only a small part of taxes. Who is going to pay the police to monitor your roads or go after people that use them without paying? Who is going to respond to accidents on your road? There will be no requirements to mark hazardous waste being transported on your roads (that may just be in mettle drums because there are nor rules for how to transport now either) so be carful if their is a fire. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:46:47


Give me an example of a first world society without taxation. 


No they wouldn't. There would be people burdened with familial, driving them even further into poverty than before. 


I'm in the US. It would be pandemonium. The streets would run red with blood for years. That's before anyone from outside the US even tried to take us over. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:30:42
Taxes go to many, many, many, more things than just roads and schools.I didn't have time to list them all.


Good, so if you aren't driving your not being taxed for it. If you are driving you are getting taxed. If the tax is coming from something other that that and you cant afford the tax then you can get a refund. Seems like a non issue.

The difference is the amount of money. You can have someone killed for the cost of a couple of month rent. You cant get away with it for that amount because of things like the police. 
Lets look at a place like Detroit. Lets take away all of the things being paid for by taxes there. It would be a war zone. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:13:41
I think you would be speaking Russian or Chinese right now because they would have come over and taken everything a long time ago.

Many things can happen without the threat of force. Including many horrible things. Im not worried about the ability of good people to do good things Im worried about the abilities of people without good intentions and the lack of the appropriate checks and balances to stop them.

A couple of states still have civil forfeiture without proper due presses. We fix this by changing the laws.
 Without the government, there is no oversite "Police" could do anything without repercussions of any kind. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:55:17


Yet no working real world examples. 


They are all part of the same question. How do you expect a country to survive with no infrastructure or order. 
Ill ask you one question at a time so you don't get overwhelmed. This is a two parter, so bear with me. 
Who gets to decide what is right / good, and what is wrong? Who punishes people that do wrong? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:24:16
Can you provide a single example of a society with no government that worked? 
I can give you more examples of poverty leading to lawlessness than you can of anarchy leading to a prosperous society. 


Important work is a very subjective thing. Is burning witches to help bring Christianity back important work? Probably depends on who you are talking too. 
I could give you 100 examples of the above. The thing I want you to think about the most is that some people consider accumulating power and wealth the most important work. You are talking about a world where they get to make 100% of the decisions. We no regulations you can want to do "Important work" but if it buts heads with someone that has money and power that work will stop one way or the other. 
At least the people with power can tell all their followers how important the work they are doing is. Meanwhile they ending up more in debt to the company store then they where the day before. (This has happened in American history and took near military action on the governments part to stop.)

Thanks for the information. 
Just as an update, This transaction has still not gone through 17 hours later.

What if you want to go somewhere that only a few people want to go. Do you pay thousands of dollars a mile? Are their just large areas of the country with no roads because the demand was low?  
The only reason we have the interstate system now is that the military wanted to be able to travel anywhere in the country more easily. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:47:57
Lets just take away police, courts, and jail. that will make it better. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:18:12
Police, judges, government in general would prevent you. All things played for by taxes. A contract means nothing without laws that are informed to back them up. The pedo part I put in because given enough money you could just pay the private police for a pedo conviction. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:21:54
If we didn't have taxes we wouldn't be a country. We would have long since been taken over by another super-powered. Not to mention things like the Dust Bowl would still be blowing across America. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:17:18
I think there were just a lot of people trying to use BTC tonight for the fight that hadn't used it in a long time. (Why im here)
 It's been almost 5 hours since I made a transaction and I still have not gotten a single confirmation. Im disappointed with the functionality of the coin now compared to a year ago.  Im a user, not an investor. Im not going to be running out to buy any more BTC until something gets sorted. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:20:53
Without taxes we'd have nothing more than a militia firing muskets vs nuclear super powers with funding to do things like weapons development and  provideing their armys food through the winter. Food in general would be a lot more expensive in America due to a lack of farm subsidies. The Dust Bowl would still be going on if we didn't have taxes. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:26:24
Well I'm a fan of schools and roads and stuff so, I'm pro tax myself. I do think we could do a better job spending the taxes that are collected.

Anarchy has existed and failed. Many times. 
I consider myself a libertarian and I can't understand why you would want these things: 
 
If you found yourself with no money
* You couldn't get an education.
* Your children couldn't get an education. 
* You couldn't  get medical attention, even in an emergency.
* You couldn't travel freely even to better your situation.
* You wouldn't get protection from fraud or criminal activity.
* Employers could pay below living wage and give company credit to cause indentured servitude. 
Even people that managed not to get pulled into poverty would still be living in a nightmare. 
* Anyone with money could make any rules they wanted. 
* Anyone that could sway public opinion could do what ever they wanted.(Manson, Jim Jones, ) 
* Religions would run a muck. You would have large areas of the country under shire law or being run by Christian fundamentalists. People would be getting stoned for being raped.
 
Explain to me how with no government or tax revenue, the above would not happen....

I was trying to make a bet on the fight tonight. Looks like I might not make it in time. I turned down the fee to .0001 and It looks like it's going to take a bit.

People who can't afford taxes generally get a refund.

I imagine it would be more like the examples we already have. They mostly work in war zones. (Like the one America would become if there were no tax.)

I thought it was a big deal in Europe also. Im streaming it on sky. 
They are paying each fighter around 6 million for the fight win or lose. Anyway, I was just trying to gamble and got surprised by the state of things.
