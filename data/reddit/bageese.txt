Not at this time, however, we have for purchase "Space Points" on our website, and we are exploring the possibility of making those vouchers tradable in game.

For us the newsworthy bit is that we're able to let everyone who wants to play, actually play. It's not just a soundbite that we're an international game. I can't tell you how many emails and support requests I've gotten to accept payment in a local currency. In our game you can be on a team with people from Austrailia, Brazil, Japan, and the UK all at once. It's really awesome for us that bitcoin will allow  all of our players to enjoy the game, not just Americans and Europeans. :)

Thank you! If you have any questions let me know! I know our tutorial isn't exactly the best. :)

At first I thought we were, but another dev linked a website that had a ton of other games. Zynga also accepts bitcoin too, but I'm not sure what games they offer. I'll do some digging and get back to you soon. :)
Edit:  has a collection of games. 
I did some more checking, and I think we might be the first non-casino and non-flash game to accept bitcoin! Holy crap! 
Edit2: No we're not I found some more games hunting on that site. :) But we're close enough!

I know it's not native linux support and we use wine, but don't discount us because of that. The lead programmer on Star Sonata uses linux and ONLY linux, and he's also a big player in the game! He makes sure that it works perfectly on wine. You really should give it a shot. :) I use linux (ubuntu) for work, and I play the game on there, and I swear it runs better on linux than windows sometimes. :P
