@_date: 2017-12-13 20:20:38
i have been trying for like 2 weeks now...50+ attempts..i could probably hack coinbase faster than they could verify my ID...
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:16:50
i like it
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:00:41
on question...can i transfer BTC to my hardware wallet even if its not plugged into the PC?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:07:05
but if its in original packaging and no sign of entry..
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:40:17
but if it does not have any wireless support...what kind of black magic is this?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:36:32
hahaha will do:)
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:42:30
when is this in CET (like germany for example)
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:36:11
but how can you crop it if you can only click use this photo...if you take a shot from smartphone
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:39:20
hahaha i know right...his book is very good tho
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:12:37

@_date: 2017-12-10 17:41:39

@_date: 2017-12-11 08:14:31
i am looking long term
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:08:10
well i was thinking of buying bitcoins when they were like 300$, but i didnt because i thought that this was a currency only for dark web...needles to say i hate myself ever since
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:46:01
ok so this is like 2 hours for me
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:19:53

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:18:23
what would happen if coinbase got hacked? we have our IDs on it...i am so paranoid
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:05:04
i got into it partly because i hope to create some profit and partly because i am bored af and dont have any other hobbies..
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:53:12

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:04:18

@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:57
around 15$ for 200 satoshis/byte...and that is not very fast
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:17:01

hello darkness my old friend...i had to upload my ID approx 50 times...no joke, it took me about 2 weeks of constant uploading until they finally surrendered..so my advice is that you just keep uploading until these retards give up.
