Hi.  I'm the 'stupid customer' who didn't buy a fake ID and am over 21 (which they know because I have a verified account with them) so I have no reason to need one.  I wish Coinbase would send my information to the police or whoever handles the laws on these things.  I think that'd be a fun legal battle to drag them through -- **because I didn't ever order one** 
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:32:38
That's an interesting take.  I would give my friend my credit card to pick up dinner with on the way home or something though.  I'll need to do some digging when I'm back tomorrow and see if I can find when that was and if there's a random table somewhere in my house from a forger or (and probably more likely) Coinbase is just stupid.
Even if that is what happened, Coinbase handled this pretty badly in my mind.

Eh I have no idea.  The only thing I can think of is like a table or something my roommate bought off a guy on craigslist who accepted BTC.  He asked if he could use my Coinbase and pay me back, so I said go crazy.

Hi.  I'm said customer.  I wasn't slandering them, though I wasn't being nice either.  They turned off my Coinbase account with no warning or reason. 
I also absolutely did not buy a fake ID -- at least not with bitcoins and not recently lol... I'm over 21 so I have no idea why I'd need one.  I already offered to go through my transactions one by one with Coinbase. 
In the end it doesn't matter too much though because I'm using Circle now but it's still annoying and I think this is really shitty customer service.  Coinbase will tell random people on Reddit about my account more than they'll tell me?  That's fucked up.

Also it seems to show they're tracking well more than just the direct recipient of their coins - which seems to be serious overreaching in my mind.

Anyone know what's up?  This has never happened before and happened twice in a row tonight.  Emailed them to ask what's up.  Not holding my breath for a response though given their support people.

The better part of this is that **I didn't buy a fake ID** I'm over 21 and have no idea why I'd need one.  Coinbase isn't responding to my emails though so life goes on. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 00:51:29
I totally forget I ever did that until today when I started going through transactions.  Unfortunately Coinbase isn't going to tell me which transaction they identified as an issue, so it doesn't matter either way. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:01:49
I mix all my coins (as previously stated) because I like the idea of anonymity that BTC gives.  If I was going to do something illegal, don't you think I'd use coins that were mixed...?
My Coinbase account has been used to send coins not directly to a mixer like maybe three times in total?  And all three times were when friends were interested in BTC and wanted to play around or buy something with them. 
Also I don't need a fake ID.  I needed one when I was 17 but am well able to legally drink nowadays.  Coinbase should send my information to the police or FBI or whoever keeps track of those things.  I'd love to get to go through a whole legal mess with them!  It'd be a fun way to spend a week.

I am US based, but definitely never sent coins to gambling sites or anything.  I'm good to go with Circle now so it doesn't matter too much but I would still be really interested to find out why I was shut down.
else mentioned that he thought someone who received some of my mixed coins may have used them for illegal purposes or what not, but that shows the Coinbase is investigating transactions really far away from the source...
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:50:03
Lol very correct :'( 
No other service does (or is supposed to do) instant transactions though, right?  I haven't found one but again I might be totally wrong.

[I responded to them.](
If Coinbase really thought I was laundering money or buying fake identities (because I'm totally am a future Dark Net mastermind in the making) then I'm not sure that Reddit is the right place to facilitate a conversation regarding it.

Just finished my Circle account and deposited cash!  Looking forward to using it, but still super curious as what happened with Coinbase...  though I may never know haha
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:47:07
The issue with Circle is that it takes like 3 days or whatever for money to deposit before you can buy coins.  Coinbase give me BTC instantly, then pulls from my bank account in a day or two. 
Or I could be totally wrong... if so, let me know.

I can for 100% certain say this is not the case (though it would be hilarious, so up vote for you)
Even if I did... why would that be something Coinbase would feel to 1) hide from me until I called them out on Reddit or 2) ask about on Reddit instead of over email? 
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:45:55
Uhhh not true?  Feel free to DM or email me with details.  I'm more than happy to provide records of all purchases made with my BTC -- though I really don't think I should have to do that.
Either way I'm using Circle now so I don't really care anymore.  
@_date: 2014-07-28 21:25:43
Will have to try this tonight.  Thanks!

There shouldn't be any bodies at base camp... getting there is incredibly accessible.  It's more like a picnic in many circumstances.  
Place a flag at camp 5 and get back to me.
