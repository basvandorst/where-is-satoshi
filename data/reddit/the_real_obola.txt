"It will be" ... doesn't mean it is now. Until now is just another messenger with a simple wallet (that sometimes didn't work well).  
If "will be" a real wallet in few months/years from now will be too late... another ones will take place and who knows maybe without any  "bank sponsor contest"

Those "normal average persons" are just lazy sheeple that prefer to give all his rights/wages/freedom to the govs/banks. Leave them alone if they don't want to be their own bank.  
I want freedom and be my own bank, I have my own BTC wallet with private keys secured stored. I really don't care about those sheeple. Is their problem not mine.  
Mass adoption doesn't mean usage of wallets. Adoption means open mind to the reality, what the banks are really doing with their lives.

I did that for a client of mine (hotel/restaurant). We put a router with free wifi with the SSID Bitcoin_only and a big sign that accept btc. Not only people start to pay with BTC but they give also tips in btc for the free wifi.  
Definitely a Bitcoin Wifi and a big BTC sign help things...

Because you are new... I will give you an advice: don't focus on the btc daily price, speculations or other BS. Focus on how to earn/obtain as fast as you can and as much as you can more btc. Store them, use them, earn more. Later you will thank me for this advice.  
The price is just a distraction...
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:07:16
Price really doesn't matter so much but the adoption and faith that bitcoin will bring total freedom from evil IMF and banksters...
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:44:13
that the trick. the banksters can print endless worthless fiat money to fool you to take them. Instead, btc is limited. Just imagine what happen if now will be announced that they mined the last ounce of gold on this planet.... everybody will start buying gold like crazy.

Haha you consider yourself a bitcoiner just because you "invested" in bitcoin. This "investement" in bitcoin is hilarious.  
A bitcoiner is the one that mine, earn, use (buying with btc) and most important believe in bitcoin.  
Buying some btc just for your "investment" doesn't mean you are a bitcoiner. You trust only your "investment" that will bring you more profit in FIAT not in BTC.  
Once you said "invest in BTC" means you think in future profit in fiat because you paid with fiat those "investments"...  
Start EARNING in BTC not "investing". If you really want to invest in BTC, put some coins into a bitcoin startup or already started bitcoin company. That will be a REAL Bitcoin investment.

I have a XAPO card. I finish the registration on mychoice site and the card was activated. Later tested in a grocery and works great.  
XAPO is using a 3rd party card supplier not their own. What they are doing is keeping your btc wallet and making an instant exchange from btc to fiat when you pay with that card.
I suggest you to start over the registration and if not just call the mychoice support.  
I think this is the best option for the transition to full bitcoin world...

HODL! And make more. Start with some faucets. I heard the epay.info is paying well. They have like  14 faucets in a rotator. You can make like 100-200k satoshis per day or more if you have time...  
Or just start to work for bitcoins
@_date: 2015-06-25 11:37:58
I have/use XAPO debit card. Quite happy with them. You have a btc wallet with vault option also. From that wallet you can spend in btc directly or is used directly when you pay to a merchant with XAPO VISA debit card.   
Or you can use that wallet just to send some coins in there when you know that you will spend it through that xapo visa card.  
The conversion is instant at a medium rate. I really don't care so much about the rate because I use to pay with that visa card very few times, only when there is no option to pay in btc. usually I pay 99% of my spending in BTC (also I'm paid 100% in btc) using direct payment in btc or services like cashila.  
You can have also a link between BitWage account that can send your wages into btc to that xapo card. They have an agreement or so.

this will be obsolete in few months. I use electrum instead of core wallet.  
Electrum self executable have like 18MB plus some kb of the wallet. So on the same USB you put the core, I can have electrum and Multibit also, plus some other important documents (ID copies etc).  
Also this USB to be encrypted (means when you plug it to ask you a password). Bitlocker from Win7 does this very well.

Stop using this stupid term "invest in bitcoin".  
If you want to buy bitcoin is that you "invest" in YOUR future not in bitcoin.

Because the banks didn't like it and they realize that bitcoin will take them out of game... So the banks are doing anything possible to stop bitcoin. But their efforts are useless, so now they will try to be more relaxed about it and will start using (some of them) the blockchain like a "way of transport" of money.  
And this hate towards bitcoin is coming from those govs that are manipulated heavily by banks. Don't forget that govs are backed by banks not by the people...

I had the same issue like Great_Stefan. A month ago I was sending to a new getgems user some satoshis. I didn't check immediately the transaction, as I saw that my friend received the satoshis almost instant. But after few days I was checking my getgems wallet address in the blockchain and I saw that transaction with huge fee, almost 20 times bigger than what I sent to my friend.  
No explanation from getgemz wallet. Strange that in the getgemz balance I was able to see the correct balance (including that fee) but if I go to my wallet address in blockchain is missing that "fee".  
This is not quite transparent from getgemz...

My landlord just accept BTC. I initiate him in btc few months ago and now he thanks me! I just got a 10% discount from him.  
Groceries? Asking also the shop if they accept BTC ended up in accepting BTC. Asking is the simple way....  
Paying all other bills... just search on internet, there are at least 3-4 websites that facilitate you to pay in BTC all your fiat bills.  
You are in a situation that you have to pay in fiat? No problem, using the xapo card is an axcellent way to get rid of banks. Your btc wallet in xapo will exchange instant in fiat and pay the te merchant through xapo card. BTW xapo card works well with Bitwage too.

Some was happy to do it, some they asked him how to do it but in the end he receive now all in btc... Imagine from there the next step: the landlord will start paying in btc too and so on...

@_date: 2015-06-05 08:03:28
for the only one reason: paper shit money are endless, bitcoin is limited. Govs can't handle a currency that is limited, because the banks will not support them anymore. Maybe you don't the chain: banks (with endless paper money) are supporting the govs to make the laws for THEM (not for the people), govs give to the people some change (from those paper shit money) and the people are paying the profit of banks... If you replace the paper money with bitcoin in this chain, the balance will the other way around.  
If we suppose that a gov will buy 99% of bitcoin in circulation, what do you think the bitcoiners will do? Will move along from bitcoin and create new one. Gov will lose all, the papers and the bitcoins. Let them do it.

That is the story presented by MSM and Troika. But what they don't say is that the FR and DE banks was financing Greece to buy tanks and submarines and other heavy military equipment from... other FR and DE companies. Greece ended up with a military budget highest in the whole EU, when NOBODY was threatening Greece. Then the Greek gov (of that time) start spending more and more with credits from same FR and DE banks. But nobody says... hey stop taking over and over money from those. meanwhile the debt traders was trading greek debt like crazy until Greece suddenly wake up in this shity situation.  
There is on youtube a documentary (german docu!) about the whole  greek debt history. s I said before, look for the "Lagarde list"... follow the money not the poor greek population that now have to pay what others spent in their name...

If he really want to fight for freedom and liberty, free trade and rights, then we should hear more from him saying more about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the essence of all of these. And if he understand that bitcoin will do all of those maybe he will fight for Bitcoin.  
Maybe he need a Bitcoin advisory in his campaign staff and I didn't see any one of them. Maybe Andreas will be good for that but I'm sure Andreas will not mix with politics...  
Also I want to see if all the BTC donations goes to pay his campaign suppliers directly in BTC. If those BTC from donations are exchanged back to fiat, is worthless all the movement of BTC donations. If the circle is not complete, is just a game of catching your tail...

Good move! I did the same with my clients (I'm a freelancer): who was really rejecting totally to pay me in btc I stop working with them. Who was accepting but don't have yet btc, they pay me through BitWage in fiat (and i receive btc). Those who are happy to pay me in btc are getting discounts for my services.  
Now the number of btc clients is increasing... and all my income is only in btc :)

when you "store" btc you are not storing in your house, you have them in the blockchain. How you secure them... there are many options, but I will NEVER let the private keys in hands of others... like banks.  
If you are not capable to secure your bits then you don't deserve them. My mom has more than 65 years old, but after few hours explaining what options she have to secure her bits, now she manage many wallets with a very good dexterity. Is just about a state of mind...

is not difficult. I'm paid for my job 100% in btc so I spend also 99% in btc. The rest I use xapo card when is really impossible to pay with btc. You just have to find your regular merchants to accept btc. Or convince them. I convince my landlord and now he's the happiest man in the world. I use also cashila like online service to pay fiat bills. There are many others out there, you just have to look for them.  
You will never see on TV a commercial about where to pay in btc... so do your research.  
I'm happy to fuck the banks not paying in fiat!
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:40:34
yep you are right. People forgot what happen in Cyprus just few years ago. And soon will be in all over EU... This is a reminder: don't trust your gov, they are controlled by banks. Fuck the banks, live long Bitcoin!

Varoukakis words remind me about bitcoin consensus: "Democracy deserved a boost in euro-related matters. We just delivered it. Let the people decide. (Funny how radical this concept sounds!)".  
People should wake up and see the real advantage of bitcoin: the true democracy and freedom.

I use cashila.com to pay bills that don't accept btc (yet) There are many others out there, like you said you have to be creative and find them. I convinced my landlord to accept the rent in btc (now is a happy man). I use xapo visa debit card to pay expenses in fiat when there is no option to pay in btc. But most of my expenses are directly in btc. and I earn 100% in btc :)  
So... FUCK THE BANKS!  
Advice for you: instead of exchanging all the time back in local currency you should insist every day to pay in btc. You will have simplified all the things and you fuck the banks more :)

When Andreas will the Greek PM, then will be light....
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:46:39
You better ask your employer to pay you in btc from now on. That will make much easier for you.  
I really don't understand why everybody wants to buy bitcoin but not earning, working for bitcoin.  
If you insist to be paid in BTC, your employer/client will be interested to obtain BTC also by accepting BTC for his company's products/services so will be easier for him to pay you in BTC. Then your close circle is closed....

You still miss the point. Forget about the price. Even if one day like you say the 1BTC= millions of fiat, nobody will want those fiat money because will be a clear death for the fiat money.  
The point is to start earning BTC not buying/selling.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:10:02
I think that's just a market manipulation to bring more people to use the exchange. Greeks can't use their bank account and also they don't have cash. So the question is how do they buy btc if they don't have fiat? Even gold was stopped for trading by greek central bank.  
If the stats are from before they close the banks maybe can be something, but now is useless. Who bought btc with all fiat that they had available before closing they made a good move but now... is impossible.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:20:16

yes you can if you first export the keys from your core wallet, then  you can import/restore it in electrum.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:40:56
Also there is the "Lagarde list" ...
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:17:12
just save that wallet file wherever you want and open it when you want from any location. First also encrypt it.  
If you lose it also you can recover it from the 12 words passphrase. What do you need more?  
The wallet file is important not the path to the app files.  
I use electrum for years with many wallet files. I have stored them also on usb sticks when I travel. Open them from there also there is no problem. You can use also the standalone executable on that usb. No need to install. No single issue.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:22:42
Yes I know they can have account in other countries. They already move their money into DE banks, but not all. And majority are too poor to open another account in other country. You need to go in the other country, take your temporary residence ID, go to a local bank open up account, so they will need more days to do this. And just to open a bank account? They are too lazy or ignorant.  
I travel a lot in EU and I have several residency IDs. I see many people too ignorant to do something with their future. And they deserved to be framed... When you try to explain them what really is going on, they think you are the crazy one.... So fuck them! Who is not listening, is their problem I will not waste my time explaining them how to secure their future.

I never used an online password keeper. Is the worst solution to keep safe your pwd. Those passwords are like fiat in a bank: are not your anymore.  
Even an encrypted text file will be better than those LastPass shit.  
Nowadays a home NAS is quite cheap and easy to configure it like your own private cloud server, with all you need including encrypted notes (pwd files), syncing files, email, web, movies, music, docs, storing wallets, blockchains etc.  
Why should I use a public hosted password manager when I have my own encrypted pwd server...  
Why should I use a public hosted email server when I can have my own private email server with private domain...  
Why should I use a public hosted web server when I can have my own private web server...  
Why should I use a public hosted dropshit when I can have my own private storage online server...  
And the list can go on and on and on...

If you really like to earn btc from faucets I recommend you the epay.info rotator. My mom (65 yrs old) have a lot of free time and she's earning like 100k satoshis/day just doing this faucet. She made first BTC in few months and she's very happy like you, she felt the bitcoin magic...

I think they are the only ones that mention also the homeschooling.  
Regarding bitcoin, they don't say if they will fight for large adoption of bitcoin. Their mention is sort of ambiguous, just an acceptance but not a follow up. Maybe they realized that with bitcoin/blockchain large adoption, the politicians will became obsolete.  
I think many politicians are aware of this and all of them will be discreet in this matter.

Also those who was selling drugs on SR... That makes me think that Ross was a patsy used together with the SR (another "creation" of the feds) to criminalize bitcoin but not catching those who was really criminals - drug sellers.  
My main question is: if they already have full control of all traffic of SR, so they know who was selling too. But they did nothing to those. Maybe also those was feds, like we know the whole war on drugs is a fakery.

Enter 2-3 times/day and take your coins into your xapo wallet.  
To start using BTC is quite good option.  
If you really like and have time, try also the faucet rotator from epay.info. Instant payment or weekly and quite good rewards. My mother is using it and she make quite good holding.

That wasn't answer my question: what happen if we do nothing, just let it like it is?  
If we are really concerned about how much we have to pay for miners, why we don't create a protocol to pay them based on how many transactions they process.  
If Satoshi suggested that is better with 1MB block size, he knows something. Or Gavin knows more but he didn't want to tell us more...

First put 21inc chips together with the TPP. You will not be allowed to change anything from those chips. Are not your property even if you bought that device containing the chip.  
What if you want that the chip will mine only for you, directly to your wallet address? Is not allowed. If I have my own miner will mine for me not for others and I am 100% in control of it.  
Watch this video, is just a clue part of the entire plan (start from min 22:50:

If you really can't see that fiat is worthless I think you are living in a another world, the world of slaves that they blind follow what gov said.  
I'm paid for my work 100% in BTC, I spend in BTC. If I really don't have another option but paying with fiat I use the XAPO card (it's a normal VISA) that is converting instant from my BTC balance in fiat and make the payment.  
I really prefer that you will continue using all the fiat you like and me accumulating as much as I can bitcoins. Later you will be the one that will cry...  
I really don't want to explain you why the fiat is worthless, because is useless to explain you if you still don't see it.

Explain more. You want to send fiat, you want that the person receive fiat or btc?  
The best easy way is to send BTC (wallet to wallet) and then the person can withdraw EUR from any ATM (no bank acc required) fiat with the service from bit2me.  
Also the XAPO card is good. The person in Spain can apply for one (in 7 days receive it) and you just send btc to his XAPO btc wallet. He can withdraw or pay directly with that XAPO card (it's a VISA). The payment is made instant exchanging the btc in fiat at the moment.

I'm a freelancer. I'm totally off the banks from Jan 2015. I use BitWage + Xapo card. My work is paid 100% in BTC to a BitWage account or directly to one of my wallets or directly to my Xapo btc wallet. Depends on who is paying and how they prefer.  
Last year I started with BitWage in fiat. So I received the payment in fiat into a BitWage bank account (not in my name) and they converted in BTC. From there I can transfer them to any of my wallets.  
Then i started with Xapo card. Sometimes I have to pay in fiat, but I don't have anymore fiat so Xapo is good to go.  
Now I really don't care about fiat and fucking banks.  
EDIT: I don't use exclusively the xapo card. That one is just transitory and in rare cases when I need to pay with fiat. But normally I use many other btc wallets directly.

On the back of the Apple watch there is a light that has to penetrate your skin and see your blood before the watch will accept the fact that it is being worn. This is part of the heart monitor function. At first I thought this had to be a hoax, but the apple blogs confirm it is real. Apple refuses to comment.  
Because of this, people who have tattoos on their wrist cannot use the apple watch to do much of anything, not even make calls or receive notifications because tattoos block the watch from seeing their blood. They can't make online purchases or do anything that requires security because the apple watch wants to see your blood to prove it is you wearing it, and if it cannot it will not enable even basic features.

Those who hoard bitcoins just to sell later for thousands of fiat, I think they miss the point.  
Hoarding bitcoins to sell them later is useless. When more and more people will start using BTC the fiat became more and more worthless so nobody will want/accept it anymore.  
So those who think will be millionaires in fiat because they sold their coins, yes will be millionaires but in something that nobody will accept it anymore. Just for wiping their butt.  
I hoard also but also I spend and paid in BTC. Circle is closed, very few times I touch fiat, indirectly.

they will see nothing not even like a message because sending btc is like making a btc transaction wallet - wallet.   
I think they should (or already) develop now 2 things:  
- how to send to a group chat some btc, how are split between participants  
- how to send to a non-gems but telegram user some btc, like changetip by email.  
What I saw it cool is that you have that mobile wallet/chat app but the wallet is linked to a counterwallet.io account that you can open it only with those 12 words seed that you generate when you create first time the gemz wallet. So keep in mind to save them. This is cool because if you loose your mobile you still can have access to your btc from counterwallet.io. Of course you can restore your wallet in a new downloaded gemz app from those 12 words. I tested works perfect.

@_date: 2015-01-29 09:34:03
Don't take my critics wrong. I like to see many bitcoin apps on the market, that will help to a better adoption.  
But the way you start to promote your new app is wrong. Never compare it with other apps, but focus on what features you have. For a non-released app starting comparing with others that already exist will have from the start a bad step.  
Also using all those useless "social content" will make it another LINE or VIBER app that is huuuuge for a mobile. 50-60Mb for a mobile app is useless. Many users want cheap phones, and those phone comes with few space for apps. Just imagine a user with Viber, Line, Telegram , Whatsapp, and your Sendchat in his phone. That is crashing! Forget the social content and market is useless. NOBODY will use it!

Mail header it is relevant. Otherwise all the spam you will get in your inbox not into spam folder. If you look at the end of an email header you will have this: Received-SPF: None ("my email server": info does not designate

FIAT is inflationary, Bitcoin is deflationary. Just see the last decision of ECB to print more 19.000€/second, how sounds that for you?

remember: bitcoin is not designed for governments, is for the people, to the people, for the people.  
All govs, whatever side they have, at the end will be corrupted by the power.  
Bitcoin is cutting that rope between power and corruption so for sure the govs doesn't like it (bitcoin) and will do everything in power to stop it or at least slow down the adoption.  
Like Andreas said: "Bitcoin is not “unregulated”. It is regulated by algorithm instead of being regulated by government bureaucracies. Un-corrupted."

It is possible if the originated server is not secured and well configured the MX records, TXT, SPF settings in their domain records.   
If you see the last line in your header info: Received-SPF: None ("my email server": info does not designate

That means was using the domain s7.ru to send from multibit.com and that is not authorized by standards of SMTP.

@_date: 2015-01-28 21:15:36
I don't want to advocate other apps, but your comparison is misleading.  
- why is not mentioning that getgemz also can send gemz (like altcoins), so you put a red cross there. misleading.  
- why you don't put for gemz that you can access your wallet from counterwallet.io. misleading.  
- gems is already on the market, so you can't compare something that is not even have finished the funding campaign (you still have left 8 days to finish the crowodfunding + the developing time). misleading.  
- gemz is already developing the exchange, from what I understand (there is a post on bitcointalk.org about it).  
- why do you put 50m users database and for getgemz unavailable? If you top up 50m users from telegram to sendchat, why don't you put also for getgemz that is using the same. misleading.  
- Creators Market (Allow users to create and sell social content) - WTF is that? I need to chat and send/receive btc not making social content. BTW what is used for that social content?  
- SendChat Store (To purchase stickers, photo filters - you name this a feature?  
Come on guys be more realistic. At least do your job, your app and then let the market to decide the features comparison.

why don't you just put one of your wallet address (multibit, electrum, mycelium, airbitz, getgemz or whatever personal wallet) to receive bitcoins.

But, this time they send to BCC no TO, as you can see in the header info, the To field is info  
The thing is that I couldn't identify which source was compromised because of that BCC. But I will look into server logs and see if I can trace more.

Watch out guys, some Russians are sending fake links to a new Multibit wallet.  
First of all Multibit is .org not .com, then always watch the headers details of suspicious emails. As you can see was sent from a RU servers and nothing related with Multibit.
Then a wallet company never will send you the link directly to a download. So checking multibit.com goes to a fake page.  
Always make updates from the original page NOT EMAIL FROM LINKS!  
This is strange because yesterday I answer to a post related with multibit error. But I'm vigilant, always.

Ah and is based on the same platform like Telegram messenger (secured encrypted) so all your contacts (even if they don't use btc) also will be there.

I suggested you to introduce ES and FR because I know their attitude about a web only in EN: they close it, not giving any chance. But if they see their language... continue and buy.  
The lack of multilanguage pages for btc in EU is affecting directly the adoption. See in NL? Most of dutch are speaking English, so the adoption is huge!

You should make one that put real bitcoin businesses ads. I mean contact all the businesses from a Bitcoin Boulevard for example and put their banner on your faucet. The users will earn coins, you earn coins, owners earn visits/customers, all in btc. Closed circle, everybody wins. Think about this.  
Right now on 99% of faucets you see only other referral links from other faucets or non-bitcoin related ads (I saw even one from Western Union or Self Bank - who the fuck will click on those?!)

Yeah, why we have decentralized exchanges, decentralized mining, decentralized money but not decentralized market apps. Is not about jailbreaking or installing an app, is about what you said, a barrier from these giant corporations.  
If I see your app in an open market, try it, like it, pay it and done. Without any "approval" from Google/Apple. The market itself will say it all. I know they will come up with the bullshit "for your safety" we keep filtering. Is not their business my safety, is my business. If I'm dumb and don't know how to protect myself I fully deserve to be hacked/raped/stolen. That's in human nature. But if I'm smart and I know/want to protect myself (and never answer that "I have nothing to hide, I don't care") is not their business to take care of "my security".  
We see everywhere this bullshit: "for your own safety" but in the end is totally against our safety!

Again this nonsense theft ? I wonder how much they paid to cointelegraph to publish this article.  
The idea of a website where to register and pay (!) your own .bit domain is a nonsense.  
I can do it myself with almost no cost, through my own NMC wallet!  
All these domain are just stealing your .bit names and then selling them for more money to you or others.  
Secure your own .bit domain from your own NMC wallet, don't let them fool you...  
Remember, you don't have the private keys, is not your domain, exactly like the bitcoin web wallets.  
I think everybody should secure their own .bit domain from their own nmc wallet. Now when NMC is quite cheap. Later will be crazy...

In any email client you have an option to see the properties of the message or headers. In that "headers" window you can see the whole communication that occurs, from initiator until your email client.

hmm originating server/sender is from it-solutions-nord.de domain. So the "IT company" has their email server compromised. Or is just another fake company that sends spams and trojans. Definitely that attachment contains the CryptoLocker virus.  
Did you buy something from that fishy website it-solutions-nord.de ? For sure they offer "the best IT solutions and products" :)    
They use cointelegraph just to impersonate the sender.  
It's interesting also the last line on the header.

Is not about anti-virus here. None of AV will block a script that you really accept to run it. Normally these kind of ransom virus come from email with an attachment. If the user open the attachment and run it, it's done in 2 seconds.  
The only one I saw blocking this type of virus is malwarebytes, full version with scan in real time.  
In these cases the best protection is your eyes and mind. Do not open the fucking spam. Think twice.  
I saw users that even they know the email was a trap, they said to me: "but it has attached an invoice, I have to see it..." What should I say? Just stupid...

I see you are a really noob.  
First of all bitcoins cannot be taken and put them on a USB. What you can put on a USB is a wallet information. Your bitcoins always will be in the Bitcoin network, on the blockchain. What you should have with you are the private keys (wallet information).  
Advice: never let bitcoins in a web wallet like Coinbase, in special Coinbase.  
To store securely, move them (make a transfer) to a new wallet created with one of these desktop wallets Multibit HD or Electrum. Then save the wallet file into your usb.  
But never keep only 1 copy. USB can be lost, crashed or stolen.  
If you have large amount of BTC, yes a paper wallet is a good option.

For the same reason if you have a bank account with money in it, that not means those are YOUR money. The bank/gov can anytime seize that bank account, without your consent. The bank can anytime shut down the operations and you can no longer withdraw the money.

I think somebody just know your private keys and they imported into another wallet. In that way they don't even need full access to your PC or wallet, whatever password you put.  
Make the test for yourself: import the keys of that wallet into another wallet app or just a new multibit in another PC. You will see that you can use that wallet address in whatever way you want.  
Think where you keep the private keys, if you have them in plain text somewhere, is time to take measures.

Thanks for you answer but still not so well done wallet:  
- where I can see/manage the fee  
- those 12 words never worked to restore the wallet into a desktop wallet (multibit or electrum). BTW, for the last getgemz updates I had to change those 12 words every time.  
- where is the option to export the private keys?  
- As I said, in lolipop Telegram doesn't FORCE me to install ASW... ASW is not only crashing the GG but the others that doesn't need it. So I prefer a clean working phone than a GG app.  
I'm still "watching" the updates of GG hoping that some day will be a nice wallet app. I'm really not interested at all about the "social" features crap. I really want a msg app that can handle a stable handy wallet to send some coins to my friends/family. The GG starts with 5-7MB occupied on the phone and now is installing 35MB (full of crappy stickers and other "Social" BS). Do you really think we are appreciating a wallet app for how many types of stickers you can have?

Even in the original title and the contaxt is a confusion: In title - "Greece is planning to install 1000 Bitcoin ATMs" and then the 1st phrase "Greece is to receive 1,000 Bitcoin ATMs following a partnership between digital currency exchange BTCGreece and cryptocurrency service provider Cubits, according to reports."  
Greece like country, government is not equal with Cubbits and BTCGreece....  
When a noob will search the term "Greece Bitcoin ATM" this post will show up indexed like Greece installed the ATMs that is NOT TRUE and misleading !  
Even if we ignore the title error this is not something that will help greeks to adopt BTC! They don't have euro cash remember ?  
Help them to sell/export their goods for BTC and put in circulation those BTC obtained inside Greece, then you will have a Bitcoin Greek Revolution... not just a bunch of ATMs that will just stay there doing nothing.  
Go on vacation in Greece and insist to pay for their serives/goods in BTC. teach them, inform them, help them, do not extort them.

Any other app installed can be a spyware disguised in a flashlight or game app... That one easily can track your keys, files, bakups etc.  
I suggest to re-ROM that phone with latest CM. A simple factory reset is not enough. A davlik wipe cache is better.  
In CM you have the option also to block all the access default for all apps so you can see what they want to access when is started. CM I think is the best custom ROM for Android. I never trusted the "original" ROMs for any Android phone. I always wipe everything from a new phone and install a latest CM. Then activate the all security access. So then never had problems with anything. Of course I don't install stupid games or flashlights on my phone.

I live only on BTC from jan this year.  
I'm paid 100% in BTC.  
I pay my rent in BTC, I buy groceries in BTC and other stuff online.  
When I really don't have an option to pay in BTC, I use XAPO card, that I fund it with BTC and spend fiat at any merchant. But I use that one very limited.  
The whole thing of "living on BTC" start with being paid in BTC... the rest come easy. Took me few days of demos to my landlord of how to use BTC and then he fully accept my rent in BTC.  
Yes is hard to start but with patience and insisting people will realize that is a good thing to use BTC.  
And I'm spending like 80% of my BTC income and the rest I ... HODL!

I want to pay in bitcoins because:
- I'm paid in bitcoins
- I don't have anymore fiat, I close almost all my bank accounts
- I don't want to give any cent to banks. Any commission paid to banks will fund wars, corruption, slavery. So... fuck the banks!
- with bitcoins the payment is faster and cheaper
- nobody will know exactly from who and to who the transfer was made with bitcoins. No direct traced by NSA and other spies (3rd party marketers)
- bitcoin usage will give me freedom to choose
- nobody will seize my money, nobody will close "my bank", nobody will use my bank account for bail in/out

that will help some few greek guys that still have some cash, but not the entire economy.  
I think this ATM project will fail from the beginning. The poor greeks doesn't have any cash and you want them to come and buy few coins? That not will gonna happen and will not help them in any way. They don't have money to buy BTC. They need help in how to accept BTC from tourists and then they can pay to their local suppliers in BTC and so on the wheel start to move.  
They need support and help for companies that export products to accept BTC from their external clients, then to pay their workers in BTC, so those people can also pay their groceries and other daily stuff with BTC ... and so on. That will really help greek people not 1000 ATM that will stay and wait forever until a poor guy come with a 20€ bill  to change it for few satoshis...  
I see in this 1000 ATM just greed from a company that wants those few euros from the poor guys.

Then "Earlier this year, CoinFox wrote about another cryptoenthusiast, Jack Nickogosian from Coinify, who tried to survive for a month in Denmark using only bitcoins".

Better help them to sell/export their goods for BTC and then the wheel start roll over, but in this case... 1000 ATMs will stay there and nobody will use them because they don't have money!  
1000 ATMs for some poor guys that can withdraw only limited amount of cash from banks you think they will buy BTC? No way! they need to buy food and will keep every cent from those cash to use it for food not for ATM fees.  
Take the example of bitcoin.de - they OXI all fees for greeks. That is a move to help them....

Is not in your possession that data, is not yours anymore. Read again the TOS. By "encrypted" doesn't mean they don't have access to it. That means an intermediary can't catch it when you transfer it. The encryptioon keys are between apple servers and phone, that means both parties can decrypt the data.  
I never use a cloud service to store anything personal and in special a wallet data. If I really need to have something stored and be able to access online I have "my own cloud". Nowadays is very cheap to have a NAS.

Wrong. You never store your bitcoins inside your computer. You store only the keys to enter in possession of those bitcoins. Bitcoins are always in the network, in the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-07-15 20:00:51
Is not about running with your coins... Is about the feeling that you are really in control of your coins. A BTC wallet it is like that: gives you the full control of your coins.  
Did you send BTC with getgemz? Did you checked how much was the fee? Did you have control of that fee?   
If you want to use another address, you don't have that option.  
When was a counterparty wallet was better because you can export the private keys into another wallet and have another control, but now it is not like that, is no longer a counterwallet.  
Are many aspects of the wallet that need to be finished and I don't see this path in their way of developing this app.  
So until is a real finished product I will give it 1 or maximum 2 stars (from 5). Is still in beta, actually have just 7 months...

Nah she just want to give her that money to go shopping. She really hate your bitcoins because are like "another wife". Change the strategy. I had the same with my wife and now she embraced the bitcoin and make shopping in btc only. She always told me hey why you always buy bitcoins when we need to buy that and that and that (useless things). and I said: because later you will buy more and more with these few coins...  
That was in old times, now we are both paid in BTC and spend in BTC. It's a wonderful world...

Take a job and ask to be paid in bitcoins. You will see that is not so difficult to obtain btc. Everybody wants to buy bitcoins but nobody wants to WORK FOR BITCOINS, that is the simple way to have them and the correct way.  
When somebody wants to pay you in fiat why don't you say, I'm under 18 and I can't accept USD but I accept bitcoins and NOBODY can stop that!

there are many services that you can pay in btc even if you they will accept only fiat. cashila.com for example and many others like that.  
If I'm paid 100% in btc why should I care about the btc "price" when I have plenty of options to spend them directly and not selling them?  
They don't accept it? It's up to you how to convince your merchants/suppliers to accept btc. If you can convince them... then you are lost.
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:04:58
I always do that. XAPO is just to have a backup plan when there is no way to pay in BTC. So I use their visa card that take from btc balance, exchange it and pay in fiat.  
But I use it few times. Now you can pay almost everything in btc. And I use more Mycelium, works great.

Always listening Andreas, with his really comfortable voice and the tone and the energy speaking about bitcoin... I think he is the real Satoshi Nakamoto.

Just in this radio show, Andreas always is like finding the right words and phrase them in a way that you can't do anything else but listening. But on the other side, Adam is quite hard to understand.

I never withdraw and I don't have that intention. I use it just to pay directly with it to the merchants that don't want/can't accept btc.

I will give you a "secret formula" if you really want to not give them your identity.  
Use your grandma identity/bank details. Let's be honest in near future she will gonna die anyway (like all of us).  
I use to buy BTC for friends using my grandma's details. They put the fiat in her account, I buy BTC on exchanges like grandma and send them the BTC.  
I don't need it for me because I earn 100% of my income in BTC so no need to buy for me. But I never sell what I earn, just spend in BTC.  
So make a visit to your grandma you have the solution :)

See Mycelium.  
- you can import it into electrum or other wallet (in GG you can't)  
- you have control over the addresses you use (in GG is only one)     
- you know how much is the fee (in GG you don't)

- you can pay fiat invoices with your cashila linked account directly from Mycelium wallet (in GG you can't)

is no longer a counterparty wallet...  
Also the fees are not clear how it works, you don't have a real control of your coins.  
When they push an update you have to register each time the entire account/recover it. For a normal user this is annoying and get complicated.  
They really should put that is in beta or something. Is promising but you can see that is not well finished. And if they don't focus to the real problems but to small things will lose the battle, others will come quick behind.

3. Users hate ads no matter if are paid to see them or not.

If the btc/usd price is still low some that have lot of free time and patience can earn good coins.  
But if the price goes up, the earning goes down because of the ads price.  
My mother makes like 0.4-0.5/mo just doing some faucet rotators, not a lot. She have time and she want to be in this bitcoin train. She can't buy because her pension is too small.  
0.5/mo sounds not a lot of coins but is more than nothing! And it's free...  
Sometimes I sent her some more millions of satoshis just to round up her monthly "BTC income". I'm paid in BTC so for me yes no make much sense those faucets. But I tested them and then told to my mother. She agree and she thinks are funny, just some clicks and you have some satoshis.  
She don't think in being rich but just to insure her future in btc. Soon will be millions of people desperate that they don't have any satoshi... and the fiat will be just shitpaper...

Why need for a bank account when you can be your own bank...  
Use Bitwage instead of a bank account. So the employers will pay you in fiat to a bitwage account and you receive btc and travel where ever you want and spend what you want. if you link the bitwage with a XAPO card you can spend fiat or btc as you like from the same btc account.  
Or the best solution is to be paid in BTC and spend them in BTC....

Telegram will integrate a HD wallet and GG will be history...  
- I don't want to be paid to see ads (like GG), I want to have a good wallet not fancy rewards and interfaces  
- I don't need to use GG to buy coins through Coinbase. If I need coins I will work for them and be paid in btc. Also I don't like at all Coinbase.  
- I don't want ads into my msg app so GG will not have my attention anymore, even if will want to pay me.  
- they focused too much on "pretty design" but not on wallet functionality (see fee management). Before was a counterparty wallet, now is not anymore. So if I want to use it in another wallet app, I can't.  
I hope Telegram will look closer into these UI design and make a better wallet.

Patience, they will get used more and more with bitcoins. Is the best way to accept payment.

Bitcoin in this case is just a payment method. Just send him a regular invoice expressed in your regular currency and somewhere on the invoice put your BTC QR/wallet address. He will send directly to you the BTC, no other intermediaries.  
If you have a e-commerce webpage there are some plugins that you can use:  
  
 - I use this one and works great with Electrum wallet  
Also     
I work like freelancer and I'm invoicing a lot worldwide. I always make a regular invoice and put my wallet address and mention that this invoice will be paid in BTC. No other bank details etc. If the client wants to pay in fiat I use the bank details of my BitWage.co account, so they can pay my invoice in fiat and BitWage will send to my wallet BTC.

use shapeshift.io to exchange instantly btc or other coins into NMC. For the infime amount to buy a .bit domain you can even play some NMC faucets for few days, until your new NMC core is synced :)   
You need 0.02NMC to register your new .bit domain and 0.005 to setup the IP and other details about hosting. I suggest to use your own hosting/IP. Don't close your NMC wallet until the transaction is confirmed !  
I really don't understand those who buy from these pages a .bit domain. NMC was designed to be freedom domains from other intermediaries, to have your OWN domain control, so nobody can seize it or shut it down.

No you get totally wrong.  
You can have 2 situations. Ask your employer to pay you in BTC. If he accept, give him your Xapo wallet address. With the Xapo debit card you can spend anywhere in fiat anytime you want. Your BTC balance will debit the card instantly when the fiat transaction is needed.  
If you want to spend BTC you can do it also from your Xapo wallet. But you always will keep the balance in BTC and never need to have a bank account.  
If the employer don't want/have to pay in BTC, give him the BitWage bank account to deposit your wage. BitWage will transfer immediatelly in BTC to your Xapo wallet.  
Now you get it ? Fuck the banks!

I have one too. I really don't care who is the handler of that card. Is just a temporary "transporter" of the payment made with xapo wallet.  
Remember: that debit card is debited ONLY when you make a payment with that card. The exchange from BTC to fiat is instant. You will never have fiat on that card ! This is the nice thing of this, you always keep your bitcoins in xapo wallet/vault.  
I'm quite happy with this card, I use it only when I don't have any option to pay with BTC.

The donations will never help to stop wars, but instead fueling them. Normally only 1-5% of donations arrived at the real in need ones. The rest is "deviated" to other interests. 
If you really want peace, stop funding the banks, stop funding evil corps, evil govs, boycott all related with them.  
Donating to charities, will just make the war stronger (by stronger arms corp. - see the deal arms between US&amp;Saudis that was agreed right now).

Transnistria is not a country. Is just a part of Moldova, actually is a small land on the other side of the river and is part of Moldova. The russian troops are there "just to keep peace" like other troops of NATO are "keeping peace" in other parts of the world.

Off topic: your user avatar seems really weird for a bitcoiner: Oil &amp; gas Invest AG.... hmmm are you a saudi? "AG" means is a german company, so you are from Germany?

Patience. When the real war against bitcoin will start the .bit domains will be hoarded. You should save your nmc until then and keep alive your .bit domains. Sooner or later many people will find the power of nmc and will come to hoard the .bit domains.

Why do you think websites like this appear now? To steal your info about .bit domain names now and sell them later for big money...

This is not a "refugee crisis", is a planned invasion, we all know that already.  
Instead of letting them in EU we just have to apply the laws, then send them back in their countries.  
US &amp; EU is they really want to help them, they should just stop bombing Middle East and start rebuilding those countries. But they just continue to bomb them.  
Obama (the Nobel price winner) is bombing them instead of making peace...

Now seriously look into BitWage / Xapo card. Your job is like any other job and I respect it.  
Open an account in BitWage, also on Xapo and apply for a xapo card.  
The clients will send the fiat money into BitWage account, you receive BTC that can be linked to a Xapo card/wallet. You can keep them in BTC and spend anytime in fiat through the xapo debit card or just spend the BTC with the xapo mobile wallet. Or transfer them into any other BTC wallet.

Every time I have the opportunity to pay in BTC I feel great that I can screw the banks!  
Screwing the banks is a great feeling and people should try it...  
Storing BTC in Xapo wallet is transitional. I don't keep all my BTC there. I put/buy some BTC in Xapo only when I know that I will make some purchases, doesn't matter if are in BTC or fiat. If I don't make the purchases the BTC stays in Xapo wallet, without any deprecation or seizure or lost. I can take them back into my main btc wallet anytime, instantly. I can spend them in fiat conversion any time is needed, through the debit visa card.

First of all you didn't make any "innovation" with that .bit registering domain. Everybody can do themselves what you do with that website. So the question is why I should keep the domain registration of a .bit domain into your servers instead on my own wallet. So if the gov come and seize your servers, my domains also gone... I will be in the same situation like with the actual .com domains.  
Namecoin was invented exactly to avoid "intermediaries" like your website, decentralize the network...

Insist insist insist. Tell him to try first only with you and tell him that you give a shit for fiat. I did that from oct to dec last year and now From Jan this year I'm paid 100% in btc.... I'm the happiest man now!  
EDIT: giving tips in btc to a non-bitcoiner looks like you give away something that doesn't have so much value for you, but in fact have a lot of value (not now but later). So the non-bitcoiners will think, what should I do with this?  
But rather that giving tips you will come with another approach: making that BTC is desired you will create interest in having some BTC.

What I can add to their comments: I have already several months not using any bank account, just BTC. In Jan this year I closed almost all bank accounts because I start being paid 100% in BTC and then start paying bills only in BTC. This is total freedom and also people around me are happier now.

Sorry but you overreact more to this "crisis" trying to make a big deal with donating bitcoin to those people. That is useless.  
To stop this shit, you better go to your local gov and make them to stop the war in Syria. Send letters to Obama, Putin, Merkel, Hollande, saudis etc to stop that BS nonsense war and most important thing: Stop CIA funding ISIS!  
That will be a real help for poor people not giving them bitcoins.

No bail-in, no seizure of your money, no use of your money.

Electrum is the best. Did you tried also Multibit (not HD)?  
The whole security of a bitcoin wallet resides in those 12 words passphrase. If you don't like it means that you don't like safety for your coins.  
After some weeks using that 12 words passphrase I already have it in my mind. I don't need it to write it on paper. Just a bit of practice and you are done. But if you are lazy to remember only 12 words you deserve to lost your coins.

People should understand for damn last time, once you get your monthly salary in BTC, the wheel start roll over the world.  
The exchanges, ATMs are here just for few time until the fiat will not be welcomed anymore. Will not do any damn "revolution" for bitcoin, just extorting money from those who still believe will be rich by night gambling with the price.  
Once your company will pay you the salary in BTC, the grocery in the corner will start accepting your BTC and also paying his employees in BTC, that's the way we should follow, not the free-day-fee mambo jumbo...

But nooo, Obama (btw the noble peace prize winner) and his friend are just spending lots of money just for a "simple" visit. Or they are making more agreements in arms deal that will make more victims in Syria? Instead of arms deals why they don't make refugee/reconstruction deals ?

I think you get the wrong image. The real bitcoiners are not frustrated at all with the BTC price. Actually they really don't care about the price.  
Only the speculators and opportunists are frustrated with the price.   
A real bitcoiner is concerned more about how to earn/obtain more and more BTC and spend it easy. A real bitcoiner is buying BTC only to put back what he spends in BTC or to accumulate more.   
The rest are just people that have no idea what is really Bitcoin and/or are trying to manipulate the price of BTC in their speculations favour.
@_date: 2015-09-22 08:18:09

No necessary that. The company that I work for (and is not a bitcoin company), initially start buying it for storing value and paying some employees. Now they accept it for their services and is paying more than 50% of employees in BTC.  
I start in mid 2014 explaining to the manager the advantages of bitcoin, he was a bit afraid of it, but one day he was pissed off about some bank comissions and he came back to me asking more details. At the beginning he started using bitwage.co to pay the salaries (yes paying more commissions) in BTC, but then the company start accepting BTC from their clients too and start buying BTC from exchanges like a store of value. Now they are limiting the fiat stored in bank accounts.  
Things getting better and better every day.  
What I can say is that the company is in tourism apartment services operating in EU countries. And I can say that the US, NL and AUS customers are paying more in BTC.  
All is about willing to start something and realize that still using fiat is not viable anymore.  
EDIT: the world didn't see the huge opportunity when Greece entered in trouble. We send them useless ATMs instead of buying from them (goods and services) with BTC. Greeks EXPORTING goods and services for BTC will help them starting a new economy based on BTC and do not depend on banks and fiat anymore. Who will see the advantage from this move will have success later. I don't say will be easy. Will be really hard to start like that but will successful. With those BTC earned from exports, greek companies will pay their employees in BTC and so on the wheel start moving faster and faster in the right direction. That will help greek people and also Bitcoin network.  
I wonder if we can see the volume of transactions of those 1000 ATMs in Greece... tend to zero... because greeks doesn't have money to buy BTC from those ATMs...
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:09:33

Ah yeah I was thinking to send you the link but I thought maybe you will want also to read more about NMC. I think is the most powerful tool together with BTC.  
I suggest to have your own hosting. I have setup my own small server with some of my 10 .bit domains. I have even my own .bit email doimain self hosted. I never use gmail, hotmail shit for emailing. Those are good just for spam trap.  
Nowadays a self hosted server/domain it's easy to setup and keep. If you are not a big company with large traffic and you have just your personal stuff, web, email I strongly suggest to have your own server. You don't need a super computer, a normal computer with good power source and backups is enough. Even a NAS like QNAP can handle perfectly.   
Also keep in mind that you have to renew your .bit domains every year so keep some NMC from now, because are cheap. But soon when more and more people will find out about the beauty of a .bit domain will hoard it...

Bitcoin is more or less like gold.  
Remember in ancient times when all goods was trade in gold coins? Then a "smart" bankster came and said: "put your gold inside my vault and I will give a piece of paper where it says I owe you XX gold".  
Then the stupid people start using those papers but they forgot to check how many papers the bankster created/put in circulation. The bankster just create more an more papers because the gold was already sold/moved and the vault was empty.  
So think about this story, but now you have different situation: in bitcoin world you transfer PROPERTY not value! In gold world you transfer value of that gold...  
So in conclusion, if the banksters will buy the majority of bitcoins, they can NEVER manipulate the volume in circulation and also once they lend some, they HAVE TO transfer the PROPERTY of that bitcoin to the lender.

Sounds good but if we have big miners "controlled" by big banks (see the latest news about 9 big banks interest in using a blockchain technology), the higher fees will end up into their pockets and you will became dependable again of banks that will come up with "solutions" like Coinbase, off-chains etc. So you will be pushed to use those centralized services to be able to have some coins. But actually you are in same shit like actual banking.  
I wonder when Coinbase will start lending coins that actually are never mined and can be used only between coinbase users so will never be on the real blockchain... a some kind of actual FED, printing endless fiat.

FIAT AND BANKS ARE DEAD! Don't spend your energy in this, focus on more important features... create something that in 10 years will be a damn good used app. This features to exchange fiat/btc in few years NOBODY will use it so your app will be just forget it.

That "bitcoin computer" will just spy on people. The 21Inc chip is just a NSA spy chip. The mining thing is just an illusion.  
If you want large adoption start with paying wages in bitcoin and then you will see a revolution... not just an adoption.  
Ask more questions before using it. Start with: what really doing that chip? Mining bitcoins or is mining YOU?! Are you in total control of that device?  
EDIT: yeah yeah downvoting me just confirmed the truth...  I really don't care about downvoting, but is good to see WHO doesn't like the truth...

+1 Nice explanation. I have used also the XAPO card. I can confirm the same experience like you. But I didn't check in detail the fees like you did. I really don't care.  
I have the xapo card "just in case" I can't pay with btc. It's a nice tool for this transition to a full integration of btc.  
I don't keep any fiat in a bank account and also I'm paid 100% in btc. So this card is perfect for me. Usually I spend 80% in btc directly and the rest in fiat through this card.  
Fuck the banks!
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:21:42
My salary is 100% in BTC so how much profit I can make?  
Man seriously even if you have a power plant or a full desert solar plant, you still need machines/miners to make "profit" like you said.  
What is that profit for you? In fiat? Forget it.  
I have also a cloudmining account that is still mining for me. What I earn with those THs is nothing, sometimes maybe is covering the fees I pay for my regular transactions. But I never think will bring me "profit".  
Today's mining is just for huge miners...
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:50:35
In march I open an account on xapo to see how is it, more from curiosity. I'm not a fan of online wallets. Once I have up and running the xapo wallet I received an email saying that they also have launched the xapo debit card so I applied, also to see how is it. In 2 weeks I had the card, (black one :), I activated it and done. I already had some coins in the xapo wallet so I tested in a first grocery. Works like a charm.  
You top up your xapo with btx and with that xapo debit go to any merchant and pay in fiat.  
I use very few times that card because I pay most of my expenses in btc, but is good to have an alternative when there is no option to pay in btc directly.  
I don't withdraw fiat cash from that, fees are quite high and not even necessary, no make sense for me to change back to fiat the coins that I earn them.
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:38:52
explain that to his mom, when she wouldn't be able to withdraw the coins from that coinbase account.... would be simple ?  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY for this problem: the bank can't have control over your money, but I see people going to the same exactly the same problem and don't take the lesson from account seizure (see Greece, Cyprus).  
What makes you think Coinbase will not seize your account if they want or somebody else put pressure on them.  
I don't say "do not use Coinbase". I just warn you guys about the "probabilities" to lose everything. Use Coinbase like an exchange for example, buy, sell, withdraw, don't let all your coins there not even a minute.

I think you just send him the best reasonable answer, make sense this. But how do you see it in 20 years from now? We will rely only in existing off-chain txs so basically we will go to a solution like actual banking. Maybe for that many banks want to use a blockchain solution, they foresee the fees opportunity ?  
So we want more adopters but the fees will be more expensive every day. I don't understand how this will gonna work well because if the banks will enter in this game we are fucked again.

bitcoin.de best place for germans to buy btc. easy, quick, safe. Or just ask your employer to pay you in BTC. That is the best way to obtain BTC. In that way you pass your "problem" to buy BTC to your employer and also you force him a bit to accept BTC for his company. You just start a chain reaction...  
I talking from my experience. I did that, I insisted a bit and now I'm paid 100% in BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:31:40
You should start accepting bitcoin payments in your bar/restaurant and with the btc obtained pay them entirely in btc. They will thank you later.  
Or at least use the combinatio BitWage with Xapo. Works perfect: send the payroll to bitwage and they put the money into their xapo wallet in btc. If they want to spend them in fiat they just have to pay with the xapo card. If they want to keep btc as much as they want, just keep them in the xapo wallet or transfer them into another btc wallet.

People should understand that Coinbase is not selling you REAL BITCOINS! Those coins are just off-chain created tokens in their database and only when you decide to move them from their wallet they will buy/mine/transfer to a real BTC wallet, with tx on blockchain. So people that says "I have tons of BTC in my Coinbase wallet" actually they have NOTHING!

torrents depends on how many seeders are on that torrent and also their speed for upload. Your download speed do not depend on that, but how much your ISP is allocating to your router/connection.  
You should try first on speedtest.net to see if your provider is giving you the service that he promise in the contract. If is not the speed that is in the contract you should make a complain or call the technical support.  
Also a slow download speed can be a sign that your network (not necessary only your pc) is infected with a virus that is using your internet connection heavily...  
Also don't forget to convert correctly the kilobytes and kilobits... are not the same

We are living in a global economy and internet, you don't need to live in a specific country where is accepted only btc.

Where is no way to pay in BTC I use Xapo card (but very few times).  
But I don't think will exist a fully backed economy by BTC. Will be quite difficult. But we will see many altcoins (backed by bitcoin) that will be used like local coins (wherever that will be national, regional, city etc).  
Have a bit more patience and you will see that emerging...

maybe this is a lesson for those who don't believe my words: Coinbase = bank = will seize your coins in any moment they want.  
People should understand what really means: bitcoins are limited to 21millions. This means the race just started to be really "fast &amp; furious". Don't you think that all the online "wallets" wants to have control of your coins exactly like the banks with fiat? Don't you think that the banksters cartel will let this to happen (bitcoin revolution) without their "contribution" ?

circle and coinbase are just another banks. Use a direct deposit in btc and convince the landlords to use the btc and not change them back into fiat. This is the way we have to promote it not going back to other banks like coinbase and circle.  
If the landlords really don't want to accept btc, use cashila.

Don't make too much noise for a political manipulation. If you play with shit you end up being dirty and smelly.  
There are just local elections and that doesn't mean anything about secession. Those links are saying the results for some polls, no elections results, no official referendum. There will be NO independence after the local elections. Will be just elections for local government and nothing more.  
Catalonia to be independent will need to pass a long process. Some people gathering in Barcelona and other cities will not gonna do anything. This what those people gathering there are not understanding. An independence process need to be done political, constitutional and legal. Or military (but don't think will be like that). Or none.  
So stop making noise with this because the rest of the world already knows that is for nothing.

Doesn't matter where, but who I convinced to pay me in BTC and who I convinced to accept my BTC.  
I'm not saying that my "formula" will work anywhere, is about "the will" of people to use it and how you present it to them.  
I can say that I live in a small community, small town, where people are quite close together and one by one they realized that for many of exchanges (local good and services) we can use BTC between us. My next "goal" is to convince the local authorities (Town Hall) to accept BTC for local taxes, payments etc.  
First step was to convince the landlord to accept my rent payment in BTC, then the wheel start rolling...  
I do most of my shopping online and pay my other bills (that still can't pay in BTC) through Cashila and other like that.  
I don't want to make too much publicity of the place where I live because we like to keep our community like it is, undisturbed by others curious.   
My advice: start being paid in BTC and then all things are sorted. There are so many BTC services out there on internet that you never imagine, just a bit of patience and understanding.  
Mass adoption will not come from thousands of ATMs, big companies that are accepting some payments in BTC or nice speeches by famous people.... nah... the adoption will come when people start receiving their incomes in BTC. Yes will be hard to start, for the employers that want to pay in BTC but that is just a step, don't worry.   
Greece for example had a big opportunity but nobody help them to adopt BTC. Instead of offering BTC for their products, companies start to install many ATMs... Wrong! Those people doesn't have any fiat to buy BTC from an ATM... instead they will be happy to do exports of goods and services for BTC, so no euros involved, then those greek companies will start paying their employees in BTC, then the employees start paying for their goods and services in BTC... the wheel start rolling over.

The lyrics:  
You stole all of my cash and broke my heart  
I should have known you’d do it from the start  
I can’t trust you any longer  
Cause cryptography is stronger  
Than the paper your promises are written on  
Your fiat-peddling meddling central bankers  
Are a blight, a curse, a rotten bunch of scammin’ gangsters  
With transactions they’ve been freezing  
And their Quantitative Easing  
It’s no wonder my net worth was almost gone.  
But I’ve finally found something that I can trust  
A currency that never turns to rust  
Bitcoins they ain’t scary  
And they’re non-inflationary  
Unlike dollars, euros, pounds, yen and yuan  
You said that I’m forever in your debt  
With CDOs to leverage your bet  
But there’s a protocol for me  
And I don’t need the KYC  
Which comes in handy buying weed and porn.  
But I’ve finally found something that I can trust  
A currency that never turns to rust  
Bitcoins they ain’t scary  
And they’re non-inflationary  
Unlike dollars, euros, pounds, yen and yuan  
But I’ve finally found something that I can trust  
A currency that never turns to rust  
Bankers say bitcoin’s a no-no  
But I say hats off to Nakamoto  
Bitcoin leaves all the others in its dust

If you always make a conversion to fiat, you always will have a wrong perspective about fee. Look into this ONLY in BTC, never convert. If BTC will be global currency (I doubt it, will be lots of alt/national/coins) then the fees will not be so expensive. As Demotruk said, the fee is not obligatory to be high but due to the number of transactions in a block, the block size. Soon all of this will be resolved in a nice way and that poor dude in Africa will not have to worry about how much is the fee.

So a poor guy in South Africa if he want to buy a bread with some satoshis, will have to wait 3 days until he can get his bread because the others that have more bitcoins can afford to pay a higher fee just to buy their caprice... and the miners will put his bread tx in waiting line forever.   
Don't you think the banks will take advantage of this?

Behind any "prediction" is a manipulation. Is quite easy today to push the public opinion to a result or another because most of the people became lazy to think.  
Watch for example the episode from South Park when they are too lazy to play games, but watching other how they play/comment over games. This is the majority of people doing today in general. They will just be a mass for manipulation. From there is very easy to have a "prediction".  
The big game is not in prediction but in how you can manipulate the opinion in something so you can win that "prediction".

I think everybody just want to profit from these "refugees".  
"Just another time you see how much we need Bitcoin. The refugees may not have a European Bank account, they may not even have a passport, any documents or address but what they do have are mobile phones! All that you need to use Bitcoin and Bitwala to send money to everyone in Europe."  
So basically we just give them a way to send money, that we give them free, to their "beloved brothers" of ISIS.  
Even if there is a poor victim of those wars (I'm sure there are many) his preocupation is NOT how to get quick some bitcoins, but find a shelter for his family. They are refugees, not business man in need of cash...  
People should understand that this "controlled crisis" is just the beginning of a huge exodus of ISIS into EU. 99% of those "refugees" will cut your throat sooner or later in your house...  
Helping the "refugees" with bitcoin, will NOT help in any way bitcoin to thrive...

I'm not saying to eliminate fees, but lowering them. In 20 years from now if more and more people will use bitcoin, every satoshi will worth a lot because bitcoin will scarce. So throwing with lots of satoshis for fees will not be so attractive for new comers, then they will go to alternatives. So at the end bitcoin will not have mass adoption.

From jan this year I am 100% on BTC. I'm paid in BTC, I spend in BTC and I HODL some.  
At the beginning I was struggling but then one by one the opportunities come up. You just have to insist a bit to be paid in BTC then everything around start moving in the right direction.  
Once my landlord accept my rent in BTC, the things start moving faster because he was looking also to pay other bills in BTC.  
Is just a matter of time and patience and understanding of process.

stop thinking in fiat. Is useless. Just earn/buy BTC, spend some and keep a steady minimum amount to HODL.  
Reporting all the time to fiat will not give you any significant information about how rich you are.  
Just hypothetical: in 10 years from now 1BTC= 10000USD, so just imagine how devaluated will be the USD in that moment. That means NOBODY will want those paper money. So you will be rich in something that NOBODY want it, so is useless. You will be sitting on a pile of 10 tons of shit and you will be proud that you are rich in... shit.

Bitcoin can't be regulated by politicians/govs. It's already regulated by math. Let them try but they will fail over and over until they will realize that can't fight against Bitcoin.

If the other part of the trade accept my pink stones is not their business what am I doing with my pink stones obtained from a fair trade.  
I think people should wake up and realize that Bitcoin is the greatest invention in the whole humanity and we get back to the times when nobody was a slave of somebody else that force him to pay tribute because he was using "his" currency.  
The whole "anti-laundering" strategy is based on "anti-non-paying-tribute" to a slave master.

This is not a "refugee crisis", this is a controlled exodus to EU, to fuck up your life,...  
First ask more questions and throw your money out of the window.  
In Germany already start evicting local germans from their homes to make space for syrians   
How you will feel when this will happen with you? Are you willing to donate for them another more 10bucks?  
Some of them already make protests because they are not receiving "halal" food from autorities...  
And this is just the beginning of the problems.

I live entirely by BTC from Jan 2015. In 2014 I was insisting to be paid in BTC only and starting from jan this year I receive only BTC. From March I have closed all my bank accounts, no need anymore.  
I pay my house rent in BTC too, I pay for my online shopping in BTC, I pay other bills with BTC using Cashila (Mycelium connection), I grow my vegetables but also now there is a grocery in my town that start accepting BTC.  
If I travel and I have to pay something in fiat and there is no way to pay with BTC, I use XAPO card, a BTC wallet that makes instant exchanges in fiat when you pay with xapo debit visa card.  
The whole thing start there: pe paid in BTC. Then the wheel start rolling over. I saw many people complaining that can't use BTC but they take it from the wrong way. Buying BTC, holding and waiting that the grocery on your street start accepting it, is not the right way. Convince you boss or clients to pay for your work in BTC, convince your landlord to accept BTC for the rent. Once they realize that is more convenient for them to do that, they will break the chains of banking monopoly and one by one other merchants will do it.  
We have to start the adoption and use with small communities not at global scale. it's easier and more convenient.  
Also we approach wrong the Greece situation: I didn't see any company that goes to Greece and say: Ok I will take your goods/services and I will pay you in BTC. That is a huge opportunity for the entire world to start over. Once the greek companies will start exporting for BTC, they will start paying their employees, suppliers, partners in BTC and the wheel start rolling over... But we send them 1000 ATMs, for what?! They don't have fiat to buy BTC and even if they had, will be a small quantity compared with exports of goods and services.  
EDIT: I live in a small town in EU, we are a small community that help each other. We don't want to promote too much this because we think we will be hoarded by others and we like to live in peace not disturbed. Next goal is to convince the local authorities (Town Hall) to accept BTC for local taxes and services.
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:30:22
Why not? You are the one that works at the FED's fax machine ? :) If is that I will send you a BTC tip through the fax.

Yep good explanation. I will add also, imagine when the rest of the world will understand what really happened... hoarding will be nicely said.

If you already had a Circle account, they already have your details so is useless to delete it (if you think they will remove also your details - they don't).  
Before using any exchange or online wallet service you better ask before giving them all your info and read the fucking TOS! Why nobody read those pages?
@_date: 2015-11-23 10:06:40
You should watch this short clip every morning  and then repeat 10 times: "Coinbase is a bank".

HODL   
If you buy with the idea of selling later you lose anyway. What is the point selling your btc at 10000$ when those fiat are worth goat shit? You give the valuable bitcoin for goat shit.
@_date: 2015-09-17 08:21:25
Wrong question. The right question: how much gold or other valuables will worth that BTC in 2020. In 2020 fiat will no longer exist so is useless to think how much will worth in something worthless...
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:39:37
Ah so is worse than I presumed!

There is no refugee crisis, just a controlled exodus, organized by US&amp;EU, just to fuck up the EU population and impose more drastic rules.  
Why the wealthy arab countries do NOTHING for their "brothers", why those "refugees" are not going to UAE, closer and wealthier... noooo they go to Germany (they don't even stay in Greece or Italy!).... this is a big question
@_date: 2015-09-14 10:59:41
Yep, can be even that the server IP was shared with other sites that have a malicious code and google beeing very "careful" blackisted all from that IP.  
Check here the IP of shapeshift.io server 108.162.201.192   
29 other domains that can be the "evil"... This can happen when you use a shared IP for your server. So guys, don't blame too quick shapeshift, but google...  
A good move from shapeshift will be to rent own IP.

A bitcoiner will never sold his stash or at least use it and buy again. So you are a simple opportunist using bitcoin like an instrument to get rich quick or you are a simple buttcoiner or you don't have any idea about bitcoin.  
So stop manipulating the newbies opinion so you can buy more when the price is going down. We already know these cheap tricks so you better STFU.

I totally agree with the video, I am 100% on bitcoin for about almost 1 year and all bank accounts closed.  
But you should specific that what you described is ONLY for US. In EU there are more easy options like cashila.com and bitboat.net. Cashila can take your wage and convert it in BTC if your employer doesn't want/have bitcoins. From cashila also you can pay any bills using bitcoins from your mycelium wallet.  
I didn't entered in a bank or ATM for about 8 months, I start forgetting what is a bank, but they still remind me that they are the ones that are funding wars and terrorists.  
FUCK THE BANKS!

You should start using direct payments with bitcoins. The feeling that you just FUCK THE BANKS is great!  
Now there are many places where you can pay directly in BTC. I live on Bitcoin from Jan 2015 and all is great.  
Remember this:  
Banks = slavery  
Bitcoin = freedom
@_date: 2015-11-23 10:02:07
Those debit cards (I will not name them bitcoin debit cards) are not designed to be used like consumer. Are created like a transition to full bitcoin payment. To be used ONLY when is no other way to pay directly with bitcoin.  
I have a XAPO card but I use it only 1-3%, the rest I use only my bitcoin wallets (no Coinbase). I'm paid in BTC and I use also Cashila to pay bills with bitcoins, through mycelium wallet.  
People, wake up now is really posible to live on bitcoin. I'm doing that from Jan 2015 and I close all my bank accounts!  
FUCK THE BANKS! Don't let them fool you and be their slave for your entire life!

When you use Coinbase you should remember this: 
@_date: 2015-11-10 09:07:20
If you used Bitcoin Core and didn't saved the wallet.dat file then you have to scan with  deeply and recover that file. This program is free and can find any formatted partition/file.  
Save that wallet.dat file into your newly installed/synced Bitcoin Core and start in normal mode. You will see that your bitcoins are there.  
Ignoring the simple backup rules (copy that wallet.dat file in another place) always create problems.
@_date: 2015-11-22 20:28:36
Just another shill paid by banksters to make you to forget about bitcoin but bringing to attention VISA...  
People forget so easy that behind Coinbase is a big bank... BBVA
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:33:01
Because they lose fiat to be main currency used. Will be goat shit.
@_date: 2015-09-08 10:57:55
yep in addition to this S. Molyneux added some good points 
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:43:27
Before you choose a wallet remember these words: 
@_date: 2015-11-24 09:42:51
Agreed. See also Microsoft, now they give you free OS but using you like their own toy...  
But there are many others alternatives out there.
@_date: 2015-11-11 09:33:09
Bitcoin is doing more than banks. What you mention (bank guarantees, loans, interest, cash withdrawals (fiat)) is to going back to the shit system of fractional reserve. We don't need that anumore. We don't need banks anymore. I can have loans from crowdsourcing directly in btc. I don't need cash withdrawal because I pay directly from my btc wallet. Why I need to pay endless interests to banks? Why I need to be their slave being always in debt? Why I need them to guarantee my money?  
Nothing of these are necessary anymore - FUCK THE BANKS!
@_date: 2015-11-17 09:45:27
This guy doesn't know anything about banks and bitcoin. Banks can't use bitcoin because they will never control it. Banks are obsolete 
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:00:44
Nice e-shop but I don't see any bitcoin sign. If you really want to sell them for BTC, put the price also in BTC or at least a big sign of BTC where you already have the cards.
@_date: 2015-11-23 09:33:01
Why I hate banks?  
Bitcoin = freedom  
Banks = slavery  
FUCK THE BANKS!  
Any banks - bitcoin relation get infected by their greed and evil at the end. Like this Coinbase started nice helping new comers to get a quick wallet (I had one in the early days), but once is touched by banks (see the BBVA investment in Coinbase) is getting worse every day. Mark my words: Coinbase is a bank and will seize your money soon!  
I don't want anymore banks. I'm my own bank now. I close all my bank accounts 11 months ago.
@_date: 2015-11-25 10:22:56

they already have real "war games" like in syria and all over the world, where cia-terrorists earn bitcoins :) for blowing up people...
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:26:06
I agree with that. I liked also the mobile Bitcoin wallet and Mycelium (because I can use the same wallet also into Electrum).  
Actually my mom also use Mycelium and Airbitz. And she play faucets too. A year ago I showed her how to do it and now she really is into it. She's a pensioner so lot of free time eh? Keep her busy and earn some. She read a lot about bitcoin too and discuss with her old lady friends about it.  
I think the approach for the old people, regarding bitcoin is to not give them so much information, but just a little and let them discover more, they are really curious for new things.

@_date: 2015-11-26 14:40:37
Yep. IT services and consultancy, more freelancing. I have 11 months with no use of bank accounts, all closed. Fuck the banks!  
The luck is not that I'm paid in BTC, but the fact that my landlord start accepting my rent in BTC. And from there many others start accepting his BTC and so on the wheel start rolling over.  
This will be a real Bitcoin revolution, when you start be paid in BTC, not when the price goes up. When the price goes up is just a prove that fiat is goat shit...
@_date: 2015-11-17 15:22:31
Good, this should be a lesson to everybody.
@_date: 2015-11-26 20:21:03

No I don't. And there is no adventure, just normal simple life. I don't want to be rich, I don't want to be famous, I don't want to lead. Just to be free and I find that freedom in Bitcoin.  
But yes, I think I am lucky because I live in a small town, close community and educated people.  
You should think about how you put the question of being paid in bitcoins to your employer. Maybe you didn't find the right way that he understand. Not everybody understands Bitcoin in same way. We are here many bitcoiners and I'm sure that not everybody was convinced in the same way to use Bitcoin. You should watch more your boss, see how he thinks, what is his deep desires and come up with something that he will understand. Also my boss was very skeptical many months, but I insisted over and over until I find the right way, for him, to understand it.

yeah for that is huuge campaign to promote their brand new "regulated exchange" so they can make huuge profits from suckers that believe them they are true bitcoiners.... give me break with this BS.  
Don't you think the twins have so much money to pay to all media for interviews, articles, twits etc just to make more noise about what they really did? They just want your money, nothing more, they are veracious opportunists that sees in an exchange (in special in NY where not many companies go to open a bitcoin business) a way to rip you off. Now everything is nice pink but soon you will see...  
And this is not a warning for those who use the exchanges just to buy some bitcoins, is a warning for those who are using exchanges for daily trading and think they will be rich playing with volumes and prices. Those "players" will lose, the ones that just buy for personal use will win at the end.

The sad truth is that many people still don't realize/believe this fucking lie of fractional reserve.

Only good education will truly wake up the population, otherwise is just moving around sheeple.

@_date: 2015-10-06 19:00:37
Stop reading at Step 1 where you recommend wallets that are NOT wallets:  
"Popular Bitcoin wallets (you can use any wallet)  
BlockChain – Global Solution  
Coinbase – Best for US bank wires  
Circle – Best for US Credit/Debit Cards  
BitStamp – Best for EU bank wires  
Local Bitcoins – Local Exchange Finder"  
These ARE NOT WALLETS and this is a bad advice for new commers that accidentally will read your blog.   
Hey guys, new to bitcoin, remember these words: You don't control the key of your wallet, your don't own the bitcoins. Point and simple!  
@_date: 2015-11-11 13:30:27
If you want to "invest" with the idea of selling later for tons of fiat shity papers, that is a bad idea. What you are buying now with $10 you will buy in 1 year with $1000 so that fiat money will be goat shit soon -   
  
But on the other way, you buy (not invest) BTC to use them and store them, that will be a real investment in your future, in your freedom.  
Remember: bitcoins are limited to 21 millions... not like the fiat printed endlessly by big banks!  
When people will realize the difference between fiat and bitcoin will start hoarding bitcoins, but then will be too late, we already mined (put in circulation) already more than half of all bitcoins.  
Bitcoin = be your own bank! FUCK THE BANKS!

I wonder why everybody wants to "buy" bitcoins. Nobody want to EARN, work for bitcoins? That's the correct way to be the owner of bitcoins.

Save this post and let's talk in 1 year... Euro like any other fiat currency are living their last days.  
For your first questions, the answer is look closer to you and you will find the answer. There are many solutions out there that are working just fine only with bitcoin.  
I don't want to buy BTC with euros because I don't want to use banksters instrument for slavery....  
If your employer still not understand your demand to be paid in BTC means that is a bankster slave and you have no need to work there anymore.... if you want to be a free person.  
The mass adoption is not starting with a coffee shop that accept bitcoin, but with a coffee shop that pays his employees with BTC...

First of all I'm glad that people can see that there is one of the other many alternatives to that BS spyware of "bitcoin computer" of 21 Inc. And at more than half of their price!
I know your goal wasn't to be a competitor to 21 inc but definitely this device can mine better than their spyware, but a full plug and play node.

Don't use their services anymore. Or gather some of 100.000 people that go to some banks, demand each like half million credit, IN CASH. If they said they don't have the cash, means that credit is ILLEGAL, they loan money that they don't have them...  
Don't fight against them, leave them alone, use bitcoin only services, demand to be paid in BTC and insist to pay for product and services in BTC.

First make a backup of your wallet file. This is important!  
You can find it in C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Electrum\wallets. That is the default wallet if you didn't save it in another place.  
Then delete all data from that Electrum folder. Or just delete the file blockchain_headers.  
Open up electrum and let it to create a default wallet file, empty. Then go to File - Open and select your wallet file that you already copied. No matter where is saved, just open it.  
Electrum will sync all tx from the beginning, will take a while but not so much.  
This can happen if one of the cache files ir corrupted. Maybe your HDD need a cleanup, defrag or scan for bad sectors.

French people should go more often to school and learn English. Bitcoin is predominated by English information and also most of things that occur in the world are presented more often in English. So in order to be well informed, will be wised to learn English.  
I saw many countries in EU that all their TV channels are doubled, none of the movies are in original version (English) and are doubled with local voices so awful that you can't even watch the movie. This is a big handicap for non-English speaker country because the young people will never be able to speak English.

That term OP_HODL (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) means nothing for many of Core users.  
Instead this extract from change log means a lot for many users:  
"Several Windows users reported that they often need to reindex the
entire blockchain after an unclean shutdown of Bitcoin Core on Windows
(or an unclean shutdown of Windows itself). Although unclean shutdowns
remain unsafe, this release no longer relies on memory-mapped files for
the UTXO database, which significantly reduced the frequency of unclean
shutdowns leading to required reindexes during testing."

+5 points for the initiative  
-1 point for the same web design responsive theme like all bitcoin startups looks like there is no other design in this world  
-1 point for the login with faceboob? Are you kidding? Why you create a bitcoin only page and you don't use BitID ? Facebook? Who the fuck you think will give all details to that motherfucker for his work?  
+1 point list a job for free  
-1 point there is not listed the commission for you. Don't tell me you earn nothing from this.  
0 points for  "grindcrypto you still use that for email? You have your own domain and you don't have your own email? That doesn't look serious...  
In total you have my +3 points! Good job!  
PS advice: try to keep it clean from those clickbait "jobs" like check my page to earn free bits (and goes to faucets and other BS). try to keep only serious jobs. Make it to compete with oDesk/UpWork/fiverr etc.

I see that all the time, when is a "flood/spam/testing" issue with the bitcoin network, we have to increase the fee. I consider this measure a bit of blackmailing. If we will have every month a "movement" like this we will end up in having bigger fees than VISA and we can forget about bitcoin microtransactions. When we will pay a coffee with BTC will have the fee bigger than the coffee and definitely this will be used against the whole Bitcoin by the "others".
You guys, bitcoin devs, can't you find another way to stop these "bad movements" for bitcoin? Or make a standard fee of 500 satoshis for any transaction.  
Yeah I know many of you will come up with "hey you don't have 5000 satoshis to pay a transaction?" but I remember to those ones that bitcoins are limited to 21 millions and EVERY satoshi is important not to spend it like it is nothing. Stop saying that 5k satoshis worth 0.0001 USD or whatever conversion in fiat, I don't care about fiat, I care about my satoshis.

I see many buttcoiners and bitcoiners downvoting your position. I agree with you 100% and I am in the same position like you.  
I still hope that things will get well back soon. Take in consideration that the "enemies" of bitcoin are pushing hard now, with all their forces (still) available because they know that in the end Bitcoin will thrive. And we have to understand that all these hard moments for Bitcoin is making it stronger.  
On the other side, I see a lot of "bitcoiners" that are "in bed with enemy"... I let it here.

Nice shop! Are you delivering to EU also? But I would recommend to put the prices in BTC and bellow in $ if this is a crypto shop, fiat is just something from history...  
Also I don't see the option to pay with BTC/LTC/crypto in the cart. It's showing only USD... so I cancel the order.  
I don't see anywhere on the site the logo Bitcoin accepted here... just BitPay but maybe I don't know what is bitpay (irony). Serioussly, put all prices in BTC and get rid of those usd...

I love bitcoin but I don't see it like a national currency for any country. But I'm 100% sure will be some countries that soon will create their own crypto and will be nice to see that are backed by bitcoin. That will be more reasonable use of a national currency with crypto.  
And each national crypto should have own blockchain and in special a blockchain only for government, so we can trace all gov spending. NO MORE CORRUPTION AND WAR FUNDING.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:58:30
I'm not an anti-gov, but anti banksters in the form they are now. Fiat will not disappear over the night but will be soon in our life time. This transition process take time and also the govs start to understand it. Why do you think some of them ARE interested in creating own blockchains? Because they already know that this game is over.

With the increasing fees of actual network is not surprising your prediction.

I have all my assets in bitcoin and some gold. I dumped all the fiat from banks and closed the accounts months ago.  
I have some stash in bitcoin from early days of mining like you in 2012-2013. I never sold a coin from mining. My mining doesn't cost me anything so I said: these are for "bad days". So I start buying more coins if I want to buy something with bitcoins. But never sell.  
Then from 2015 I start being paid in BTC for my work so I don't need anymore to buy BTC. And never sell.

I'm not saying that will not be fees. I agree with fees, but not monthly increasing fees...  
Bitcoin is suppose to be for everybody the same (costly) not those who can afford to pay higher fee can use it and those who can't afford will wait... Making a reasonable fix fee for any tx will be much appreciated and will attract more users.  
Recently I convinced a guy to use bitcoin and after few weeks come back to me asking why the fees are increasing and this is a BS like any other bank. What you will answer to that?
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:50:07
I really don't care how much will worth my coins in the filthy worthless paper fiat. I'm paid in btc, spend in btc, I start forgetting the fiat.  
If the fiat will end soon why we still think of the value of our btc in fiat? Who will gonna take your fiat and give you btc if they already know that is ended (the fiat)?  
So instead of all the time thinking how much will "cost" in few years think how to obtain more and more btc at no matter actual cost, use them, earn them, make them to circulate. Then you will se the REAL VALUE of BTC...

@_date: 2015-10-20 22:05:14
Watch again Andreas speeches and take notes. In special from this one   
I will tell you how I get my employer to pay me fully in BTC:  
I was requesting to the company to pay me in btc and the director asked why? I took from my wallet a bill of 50eur and I burn it in front of his eyes. He was stunned. I said: you see? Is worthless, you can't even mak too much fire to get warm from it. If you mine btc worth of 50eur you get warmer than this shity paper. And more of this, if you put this 50eur paper in a bank account, is not you money anymore, if you put bitcoins in your wallet, are YOURS forever.
The final point to him was: if you need more fiat money you go the bank and they just put some more digits into your bank account. They don't have physically those money. If they need more they just print more. Did you tried to print more money when you need? No because you go to jail but the banksters no. So with bitcoins, you can't spend/loan bitcoins that you don't have, it's impossible. You see for that banks hate so much bitcoin...
So next days I received my first salary in btc...
@_date: 2015-10-01 21:30:39

So consider you lucky that today you can buy it with $300. Imagine those that will wake up in 2017 to buy 1 BTC...  
So you better find a way TODAY how to EARN (not buy) bitcoins. Then in 2017 you will just watch how they will kill each other those who want to buy... because fiat is living his last days...  
Will be a strange process: banksters will print more and more worthless papers just to be able to have some bitcoins that will less and less mined.  
Here an example

Yeah, personally I have full 5 nodes running in different places. 2 of them are on ADSL (1 10Mbps and 1 20Mbps) and 3 on FO 200Mbps. Those on ADSL I never see a "congestion" in the bandwidth that can affect so much the rest of the activity. If you have the node synced, the rest of the new packets takes few time to sync/download.  
What I can tell is that I saw that those nodes with more bandwidth for upload had less peers connected to download the blocks and on those nodes with FO I saw more nodes connected.  
Maybe in the next Bitcoin Node can be developed a function that detect (or manually set) the maximum upload you have and adjust the number of peers connected so in that way will not overload the connection and also the peers can take in a normal way the new blocks.  
I don't see a real problem in increasing the block size. I was just surprised of that statement...

yeah and with these crazy increasing fees every "attack" you will pay more fees than the parking lot...  
This remember me the time when I was using a bank account (I don't use anymore now and this was one reason I renounce to use them). ING promoting a bank account that you will have 0 fees for any transaction. I said Ok let's try, but then after I deposit some 200 eur, they said I can't withdraw anything because I don't have a minimum 600 eur monthly traffic and only then I will have 0 fees. Fuck them! I put more 400€ then I withdraw all and close the account. FUCK THE BANKS!  
And now, Bitcoin promoted like having almost 0 fees for any amount, but every month we have a "testing attack" that push the fees high up like crazy so you will see going your bitcoin like a river if you are living on bitcoin... HODLers not affected :)  
So WTF! We are back to "banking fees system" ?!

Read the document from this article. The whole situation was planned long time ago...   
The bitcoin companies should stay away from any help movement for "refugees", all ONGs are just a trap and manipulation. These companies are hypocrite when they come up with an action "to help refugees", but in fact they just want to bring to attention their company, oh look at them they help the "poor refugees", what a good company. BULLSHIT! Is just greed...

@_date: 2015-10-02 21:09:43
Yeah I was about to say the same! And I really don't understand why they don't make the jump because is not about not having the technology or resources. Maybe too much politics was affecting their brains and they can't imagine that internet can have a speed of 300Mbps or more.  
I even saw some companies in Europe that start preparing for more ... 1Tbps.   
Pff... "state of the art 15-20Mbps"... that is an ADSL speed. Only in few rural areas of EU (and big areas in France) the fiber optic is not yet installed so they still have ADSL connections or via satellite.

I suggest this topic, due that you are in humanities class. and I know that in Switzerland you have a referendum for each important law/action that have to take place, so your parliament have few "duties".  
Something that will help humanity to get rid of banksters and politicians: a proposed governance system based on a blockchain. With all details necessary. Replacing all politicians and keep the minimum number of clerks.  
From voting platforms and programs (not persons/parties/corrupt persons etc), to debating them. To put in place what people vote, with a system that trace the financing, developing, executing, finalizing.  
A blockchain for education, health care, transport and commerce. Even the foreign affairs can be done through that.

Few months ago I made freelance work. Then I asked the client to pay my invoice in bitcoins. He asked me why and I answered: because fiat doesn't have value anymore for me. I had a 50€ bill with me, I took it and burn it in front of him. I said, you see is just shit because even a decent fire you can't make with fiat...  
From then he pay me 100% in BTC for all my work...

I pointed them to connect only to that public node to sync and to share the blocks only to a specific IP where I have my VPN. All my other wallets are syncing through this VPN.  
When will be a real implementation directly into core app to incentive the nodes maybe I will put all on public access. But sharing my nodes with 21co... NO WAY!  
Why miners can receive something from the network and nodes don't? I'm sure that can be implemented some feature that can measure the bandwidth, time, connections etc from a node and receive something based on that. Or the miner can share the fee with the node...

The price of bitcoin is just an illusion of those who want to get rich in fiat quickly. But being rich in a fiat currency that will not exist anymore soon is also an illusion a nonsense. What you will do with a pile of shity worthless paper money if nobody will use it anymore?  
Do you know how I get my first payment in btc?  
I told to my boss to pay me in btc and he asked why? I took from my wallet a bill of 50eur and I burn it in front of his eyes. He was stunned. I said: you see? is worthless, not even is making too much fire to get warm from it. If you mine btc worth of 50eur you get warmer than this shity paper. And more of this, if you put this 50eur paper in a bank account, is not you money anymore, if you put bitcoins in your wallet, are YOURS forever.  
The final point to him was: if you need more fiat money you go the bank and they just put some more digits into your bank account. They don't have physically those money. If they need more they just print more. Did you tried to print more money when you need? No because you go to jail but the banksters no. So with bitcoins, you can't spend/loan bitcoins that you don't have, it's impossible. You see for that banks hate so much bitcoin...  
So next days I received my first salary in btc...

You put just a question that actually is not expressing anything and you get upvotes, I don't know for what.  
I really don't care about the votes, but in this way you can see who has a troll army behind any user that is pushing an ad here. and we know who is Abell68, is one of the "insiders" of getgemz.  
getgemz lost the trust not only from me but from many other users and not because we have something against them. I said here many times: I was a happy user of getgemz and I recommended to many of my friends. I use it quite long time from the beginning, but in the last months they get lost in the darkness of social media and they are not focused anymore on making a good wallet app with messenger. The reasons that I don't trust it anymore are many and I don't have time and willing to re post them here.

Their "blockchain" is a centralized database. Does nothing to do with a real blockchain.  
Did you saw a client that you can run it on any PC? No  
Is running on their servers and have interconnections between established locations? Yes. But this is not decentralized and is not a blockchain.  
They name it blockchain just to create confusion into those who knows nothing about bitcoin and they want to make the word bitcoin obscure. That's it.  
But you know what? Let them try, will be hilarious to watch how they will fail.

Still you don't have an answer for who is responsible. You can't compare a horse cart with a driverless car.  
When your car get crazy and will drive with 150km/h on a road with 50km/h limit next to a school full of kids, who will pay the consequences? You? Or when the police will stop you for speed, what you gonna say? It wasn't me, was the car... The police definitely will put you in a hospital for "funny guys".  
Ah OK if the manufacturer when will sell you the car will be the FULL responsible for anything can happen, I will be happy to drive that driverless car. But let's be serious, NONE of car manufacturar will give you a blank insurance like that.

You really want to help them?! Then find greek companies that want to export their products/services in exchange for bitcoins. That will be the spark. In that way the greek companies, can pay their employees and suppliers also in BTC and so on... the wheel start rolling.

I know and for that I'm pissed off about this term. Idols/gurus/jesus/preachers means nothing in Bitcoin world... We look like a bunch of sectants making idols some guys. Let's be serious. Why do you think other people look at bitcoiners and say that we are weird nerds? Because we have "jesuses, CEOs, gurus, preachers" etc...  
When they will see a title in the news: "The Bitcoin Jesus make a new statement that predict/make a profecy that the BTC price will rise 500%" will not be taken in the same way like a title "The "best programmer/best financial advisor/best whatever specialist" says that after several calculations the BTC price will rise 50% in few years".  
Normally I don't even read an article that the title contain the words jesus, gurus, preacher. Are just BS.

Ok they can come up with the excuse that they don't know or have knowledge to put a bitcoin payment solution on their web but at least they can put on that page a bitcoin address/QR and say, ok send your bitcoins to this address. That is acceptance. The rest is just BS.

He was talking about fees of exchanging btc to fiat not the fees of the card. There are 2 separate things here and 2 separate companies. The card is NOT issued by Xapo (in all cases - xapo, bit-x, e-coin) and has different types of fees because we are living in a free world and everybody can put their own fees.  
The exchange fees/rates are different story and also is up to each individual that will accept it or not.  
But saying that Xapo is not a good company because they have shady exchange rates doesn't make sense for me. The simple fact that I don't need a bank account to pay something in fiat makes me happy that will just FUCK THE BANKS.

I suggest you to watch again the video. You get it wrong: the video is not talking about how should be the process of exchanging BTC/fiat, but to be more friendly, human and with more information.  
Andreas is right when he says that the majority of persons that enter in contact with a BTM are newbies that have no idea about bitcoin, wallets, QR codes etc. We have to make the BTM for them not for us that we already know these things.

@_date: 2015-10-12 12:00:52
yep, soon bitcoin transactions will be only for few "elite" persons that they don't care about 5k satoshis. So adoption will be less and less (because of increased fees) until Bitcoin will became a dream that didn't became true. Sad but true... Really hurt me to say that because I'm a true beliver in bitcoin and also I'm paid in btc, all my expenses are in btc...
@_date: 2015-10-30 09:56:53
For me really don't care if will be 1billionUSD/BTC.... Will be just goat shit if you think you will gonna sell at that price. When BTC passes the 1:1 parity, from that moment USD worth less and less until is goat shit. Ah if the "fight" will still be between 0.001 and 1 then we can say that is a currency war.  
For those who still hope that buying now at 300 and they will sell at 10.000 I dedicate for them this segment:   
Price doesn't matter in this moment, adoption matter and adoption will be when companies will PAY salaries in BTC.
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:56:44
Try not to. Use as much is possible BTC payments.  
Look also into Xapo wallet/debit card. You can put bitcoin into a xapo wallet and with VISA debit card you can pay instant any merchant in fiat (if they don't accept BTC).
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:35:19
Personally right now I don't use any of exchanges because I'm paid 100% in BTC. But back in time 10-12 months ago I was buying only from exchanges. 5 min using them. Enter - buy - transfer coins to my wallet - close the exchange - bye. Never give the opportunity to be hacked, robbed, scammed.  
Even then I was buying BTC with my grandma details :)  
But yes people are greedy and use the exchanges like their personal wallets or stay with coins in there waiting to sell them to make some bunch of other shity fiat. But those they get what they expect: shit.  
Many of the exchanges are not created to help you to get in the bitcoin train... but to make them rich. If you are smart enough you can find your way do not be trapped into their game.
@_date: 2015-10-23 12:34:34
Move on, bitcoin is not for you. You are not insane, you are just fiat-minded so you are seeing bitcoin from that point of view. When you will change you way of thinking maybe you will be able to be the owner of some bitcoins.  
You see if you start from this: for bitcoins, you are the owner, for fiat, the banksters are the owners.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:06:53
It's an app that you linked with your CC and when you spend something, the change from let's say 45.78 to 50 will buy some satoshis and send them to your wallet.  
I consider it a useless app and also an intrusion into my privacy. Will know every move I will do with my money (aka CC, bank acc).  
You better just work for bitcoin and all is done.

Yeah I know. Holland is quite strange country in this matter. Is the most innovative in internet technology but I think due to their "landscape" is quite hard to penetrate with the fiber all over places.  
For example Spain was many years in a bad situation with limited crap ADSL. Now the main comm company Movistar was installing FO in all major cities. Once that was started, the other concurrent companies started to look into FO also. And is growing faster.  
In Romania, was a boom after 2004-2005 in FO connections. Now they are in the first 5 in the world in connection speed and coverage. It's amazing to see (I was there in a trip) in rural areas old ladies with a laptop browsing at 100Mbps fiber optic connection. I tested myself. And this happen because they skip the ADSL, they jumped from 56k modem to LAN and then those LANs connected directly to FO nodes...  
France is still in the ADSL slow era, indecision to put more money into FO infrastructure will cost them a lot.

There is no such of thing "true bitcoin debit visa".  
1st - why "true"? What the other cards out there are not "true", are false?  
2nd - VISA will never use Bitcoin so can't be Bitcoin VISA card.  
3rd - if you are happy to use that card means you are happy to sell your bitcoins that you already buy them from the same company. Means they are just use you to make more profit. let's not forget who is behind that company.... BBVA a fucking bank!  
4th - using a VISA card we are back to the same shit of master/slave ...   
Use directly your bitcoin wallet and you have freedom...  
Use visa/mastercard, banking system and you are back to slavery...  
MARK MY WORDS
Will not take too long and you will see those with bitcoins and fiat in Coinbase/visa cards, with their accounts seized. And then they are really fucked: no bitcoin, no fiat.

2. "Bitcoin Is Not Official Currency" - my response: why do i need somebody official to tell me which currency is official or not. BTC is global and no need permission to use it! Nobody can stop me using it. Maybe this nice video explain it   
3. "Bitcoin Is As Much Commodity As Currency" - my answer to this: Bitcoin is already a currency. I already have my salary paid in BTC, I already pay my bills in BTC, I already send abroad bitcoins used like money and currency.

You should remember the first bitcoin transaction, few years ago, that was made for 10000 BTC for 1 pizza!  
Soon you will see a transaction to buy a (or 100) pizza for 1 satoshi. I suggest you if you have 2 bits, keep them. Save this post and in few years you will remember.

I just found these 2 keys in registry regarding a file named file.jar  That exe is adding these keys and the jar file in startup. Also after a while will appear on your desktop a file 5380.bat that is referring that file.jar   
I'm not saying that Coinfinity is responsible for this. Maybe they even don't know what is going on on their web. Maybe is the hosting, who knows?  
I also scanned with malwarebytes after MS Essentials alert me about that exe and no detection. Scanning with only one AV doesn't means that you are clean. But knowing well your system and be vigilant, keeps you out of trouble. Ignoring the fact doesn't mean you are safe. So I suggest to look deeper into your system before you restart.

I'm also from a small EU country and I travel quite often all across EU.  
We all know that EU bring many advantages, but don't forget one thing: UK didn't adopt EURO. Have you asked yourself why?  
Because UK for many centuries consider itself a sovereign country and remains like that. All other countries that join into EU and adopt euro they no longer have sovereignty. When you lose control of your national policies you are no longer sovereign.  
The EU idea is great but how was applied was bad, actually the idea was stolen and deviated to other "goals" of the big banks.  
You should read more about the EU treaties and maybe you will understand.

I don't make money with bitcoin, I make bitcoins, working and be paid in BTC.  
People should stop thinking that will make money with buying BTC. What makes you think you will be rich in few years having a pile of shit of paper money that worth nothing?  
Still don't get it?  
Let's think the way around: what you can buy today with 1 BTC and $1? What you will buy in 5 years with 1 BTC and $1?  
The whole thing of "how much will be in 5-10 years the BTC value in fiat" is totally wrong. The thing is "how much BTC you will have in 5-10 years" when people will hoard it because the fiat will worth shit.   
Remember: Bitcoin is deflationary and fiat is inflationary. If you don't know the terms search in wikipedia.

Good question. The passphrase once you change it will be stored in the wallet.dat you change it. You still can use the previous wallet.dat but with the previous passphrase.  
If you want to keep track of the versions/passphrases I suggest you to use a Efficient Password Manager (is offline, stored in in 1 file in your PC/USB/whatever location), where you can even attach the different versions of the .dat . Remember, never use an online password manager.

That is a final prove that bitcoins are money.  
There are 2 questions now:  
- until now govs/media says that bitcoin are not money, are virtual :) and doesn't have any value, so why they are worried now that ISIS is using them? They don't have value right?  
- if they accept it to be money and want to ban the use of them means that should ban also the banks and fiat because ISIS was SELLING OIL TO TURKEY using bank accounts and fiat. Why MSM is not saying anything about this? Why MSM is not saying anything about that France is selling arms and bombs to Saudis for billions and Saudis are giving those arms and bombs to ISIS?

Send him bitcoin from Brazil to his personal wallet (NOT Coinbase or Circle or other BS). Point and simple, no bankster fees, no BS.  
From his personal wallet he can top up a xapo wallet in BTC, instant. That xapo account linked to a xapo debit visa card can pay any merchant in fiat, when there is NO other option to pay in BTC.  
Paying any other fiat bills with your BTC wallet: cashila.com linked to your mycelium wallet.

If you don't know yet, Cashila is a web tool to pay your regular expenses/bills/invoices using your BTC wallet. You can even pair your Mycelium wallet with your Cashila account and pay fiat bills directly from your Mycelium. No need to go to an exchange to convert your BTC to pay fiat bills.  
  
So now Cashila introduce a new service that is the way around of paying bills: you can receive also fiat transfers and be able to convert them in BTC.  
So let's say you do a freelance work for a company in Australia. If that company can't/don't want to pay you directly in BTC, you can provide them the Cashila bank account (see your Cashila account details fro receiving money) and they can make the bank transfer. You receive the fiat and you can convert it instantly in BTC and send the coins to your regular wallet.

All these "news" about bitcoin regulations are just a manipulation for the people that know nothing about bitcoin, to confuse them more and stay away from bitcoin.  
Yes, bitcoin can be slowed down in adoption but never can be regulated by simple laws made by politicians. They are so afraid that they (politicians and govs) will be replaced by Bitcoin and Blockchain that come up all the time with lies.

Last year I was in holiday trip to a small country in EU. So entering in a shop to buy some batteries, worth like 5€ I was thinking just to ask them if they accept BTC.  
But came up another idea to make more interesting.  
So I paid the batteries in cash with a 10€ bill and I said to the attendee: "keep the change or give it to me in BTC if you like, I don't want anymore those worthless papers". The girl was very surprised and smiling asked me why that.  
So I explained her a bit about BTC and show up one of my wallets in my mobile. Immediately she wants to have one in her mobile so we load up Airbitz wallet and I sent her 5€ worth in BTC to her wallet.  
She was so surprised and happy that instantly received the BTC that she went back to tell to her boss about.  
The boss also was very receptive and he give me more batteries worth 5€ (for the change I didn't want to take it back).  
Later few months I check the AirBitz directory and I saw that shop in the list... So they take it seriously now  
Like Andreas said: make the people use BTC and they will love it...

"Bitcoin will survive the banking regulators and oppressive governments. The converse however is unlikely."  
"Bitcoin is not “unregulated”. It is regulated by algorithm instead of being regulated by government bureaucracies. Un-corrupted."  
"Bitcoin is global, decentralized and unstoppable. Let govt try, it will be hilarious to watch."

Don't worry bitcoin doesn't care about all of these you mentioned. Bitcoin is continuing his path and you should act according to his path. Buy/earn steady, no matter is few satoshis or some BTC, spend when you have the occasion to buy something with BTC and never sell back for fiat (you will regret it later).  
Bitcoin need time and people need patience.

I'm a xapo user for several months but never was in need to contact them.  
But my question is why you need to raise the limit on your debit card? First of all that debit card is not managed by xapo, so you have to ask the issuer of that card.  
So you want to withdraw fiat cash from that debit card? Sorry but that is stupid idea. Use xapo card ONLY to pay to merchants that doesn't accept (yet) BTC. Nothing more.  
I think people don't understant the mean of these "debit cards". Are just a transition until everybody will accept BTC. So use it accordingly. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 10:50:57
The fact that it was discovered only for a type of cards doesn't mean will not be working for other cards.  
If somebody else know your BTC address (like in this case your card number) CAN'T use your BTC address for taking your coins (only giving you). But in bank cards case they can use that card number to steal your money.  
What makes you think that is impossible to find also the CVV number? Nothing is impossible with bank cards.  
So Bitcoin wins here! Always wins...

No, I think you don't understand my point: all these price posts are just stupid. This sub is not a trollbox for an exchange. So now that the game is over we will start seeing posts like "sell, sell sell" etc.  
The whole point of pumping and dumping regarding the BTC price is just a game that many don't understand it.  
What really matter (if you think you are a bitcoiner) is to earn (working for) bitcoin, use some and hold some. NEVER SELL to became rich in goat shit! Who think that will buy at 200 and sell at 400 or 10000 is just an opportunist that really didn't understand the whole point to own bitcoin.

Don't force me to accept something that you called "humanity". You want them? Take them to your house and live with them, pay them but don't force me to accept them.

The point (the elephant in the room) is that the whole case was built not to put in jail Ross or the others that trade illegal stuff. But to point out that bitcoin is bad, used for illegal stuff.  
Where are all the traders of illegal stuff, that actually the primary target? Free. Ross is paying for them. We are paying for them.

I started to be paid in BTC from beginning of 2014, this year I started fully paid in BTC. As I said I will never accept anymore fiat, even if I have to lose a client.  
The next step for you will be to ask your providers if they want to be paid in BTC. Then the circle is closing...   
No worry if at the beginning they don't accept, you can use something like this pay all your bills in BTC and they can receive €    
The first innovation of Bitcoin is to accept it, use it and earn it. It's an amazing feeling when you do that because is a direct message to central bankers: "fuck off with your endless printing paper worthless money".  
I think Spain doesn't have so many bitcoin supporters and you are the first one here that I see it. And I think the main reason is because the Spanish media and people are afraid to read or don't understand the media in English. The language is a huge barrier for bitcoin...  
So be a big voice for Bitcoin in your community, in Spanish. Make them understand Bitcoin.

I'm paid only in BTC for my work from Jan this year. You just have to insist to your employer to be paid in BTC. If he's a smart person will ask you more about and finally will end up paying you in BTC. You can start like others says here to use Cashila or BitWage, so your employer don't have to buy BTC exclusively to pay you in BTC, they just have to send the fiat to Cashila or Bitwage bank account and you receive BTC.  
There are many ways to earn BTC but if you wait until somebody will tell you, others will be quicker than you and will have more coins than you in few years until you will accumulate with that app lawnmower...

Own hosting. Make your math and common sense.  
How much you pay for your internet connection, ask for more upload to your ISP and a fix IP.  
Then put a PC with Linux, setup good security and load up your website. Done for life. No other cost, freedom to do whatever you want with your site.  
And make your backups. Always. Use a NAS (see Qnap also they have good servers too).
Also I recommend to store some NMC and buy your .bit domain. In few years this will be mainstream too.

The political solution of the future is Bitcoin (the protocol). Is un-corruptible. But in order to put in place a system based on Bitcoin you need big changes in your actual one, bringing little by little new political forces that at the end will understand what is necessary to make a system based on Bitcoin. You can't go to PP or PSOE or Podemos just asking "hey can you start introducing the Bitcoin in our society?", they will say you are nuts.  
But, first bring a political change that will wake up the dormant people (sheeple) and then you can change little by little the rest.  
Without awakening there is nothing to do.

Again you measure the value of bitcoin in fiat. Even that will be 0,1 USD, I will still have hundreds of bitcoins and still buying with them. You really don't understand that reporting bitcoin to any fiat in any direction is became a nonsense. Ah if you start reporting to gold ounces maybe we can discuss about value... otherwise is just a nonsense.  
Is about trust in a currency. Ask yourself this question: why only central banks have the right to print endless money and you don't ? Who give them that right?

Ok another one.  
I was in an airport, work travel this time, so just a work laptop and a small suitcase. But in my pocket was my USB with Electrum wallet, USB encrypted. No cash.  
So the guy from the checkpoint saw my laptop, my stuff and ask me if I have cash to declare. Immediately come up an idea to test the guy. So I said: "yes I have like 50k worth in € with me". The guy immediately surprised asked me: where are? (the suitcase was already open but just some clothes inside). And I said... in my head (thinking of those 12 words seed) :).  
That put him quite nervous and start looking again into my stuff. he said to open the laptop, take out the battery, stuff like that thinking that I'm a bad guy and is his lucky day.  
Then finally he saw the USB drive, small with some keys. He asked me what I have on that USB. I answer: bitcoins. But there is no law to prohibit me to travel with an usb in my pocket or to show you what I have on that usb. Even if you confiscate it (illegally) I don't care, is encrypted and I can recover the content in 1 minute with what I have in my head.  
So he backed off seeing that he can't do anything. And he let me go.  
But then after I walked away, he came up after me and he apart me from the walking path and in a friendly manner asked me, hey what are those bitcoins...  
I was very surprised by his actions but also quite vigilant, not revealing him too much.  
So I said, hey when you go home, go to bitcoin.org and read more. And I walked away, leaving him looking in vain.

"bitcoin wallet such as circle" - that is not YOUR wallet anymore...  
"full bitcoin bank" = your wallet address is your bank. You don't need another bank/storage to keep your values/property.

Never use a password manager that keeps your info in a cloud. Actually any cloud app/storage is not safe.  
I use an offline (local encrypted database) password manager that also is not installed on my PC, I just keep it on a clean USB and all the time I need it just plug it and use it in a separate PC/laptop.  
Never use same PC for keeping your wallets and browsing, chating, emailing etc. But you can use VMs for easy use.  
Or use your wallets in a self boot Linux usb.  
Many people keep their wallets on their PC open, not encrypted, not backed up just for checking the balance. People! Wake up, to check your balance you can do it with a watch only wallet or just typing your address in a block explorer.  
When you need to do a payment, ALWAYS use a clean PC not used for regular daily stuff.  
And... BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP!

In my point of view of a xapo user, is not designed to be a daily trading exchange or a quick profitable one.  
Is just a nice/easy transition from fiat to BTC, so you don't need to be worry that you can't pay with your regular BTC wallet in a restaurant/parking/shop, so you can use the xapo visa card that exchange instant in fiat what you need to pay from your BTC.  
Usually I keep 20-100€ worth of BTC in that xapo wallet. If I really need more (rare cases) I can instant send some coins from another wallet and make the payment with the visa card. The rest I pay directly with my regular BTC wallets (I have vary on my phone with different amounts).  
So basically I really don't care about the exchange rate of that instant conversion.

just another patsy. bitcoin will continue to thrive.
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:23:27
My answer will give it Andreas:    
No matter what you hold there, BTC, USD, pink stones, bananas, once you deposited are not yours anymore.  
I don't give a shit about FDIC, PIDIC, allDICks insurances.

Satoshi didn't invented mBTC but BTC and he never mentioned in his papers mBTC to be the measure unit. Stop this bullshit mBTC. If you really want to use something smaller use shits or satoshis, that are the real division of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:15:24
Thanks. Your tip will be forwarded to my daughter wallet.  
I think is our duty to teach our children about bitcoin. I suggested also to Andreas to make more presentations in schools/colleges. The future of bitcoin is in hands of our children. I already have 45 years so will take good years until I can see that bitcoin will really thrive, but if our children will be well educated, they can do it in less years.

those 1000 nodes are not down, are just not shown, they just change their IP and unsubscribe from bitnodes.  
I did the same with my 5 nodes machines. When I saw that bitnodes are in fact from the NSA spy company 21 Inc, I changed all my nodes IPs and unsubscribed from bitnodes tracking.  
The whole bitnodes thing I think was a trap to make moders to publish their IP so to be easily tracked by NSA.  
I know many of you are not agree with my assumptions, is your right and your opinion, but you will see later in few months that I was right about this... the truth always win.

Maybe we won’t ever know who created Bitcoin, but the truth is, it doesn’t really matter. Bitcoin belongs to everyone, and the future is ours to build  
Max Keiser: Bitcoin to money equals e=mc2 to physics  
Marc Andersen: The price of BTC has very little to do with the level of creativity of thinking that's going into new Bitcoin apps, or their usefulness.  
Andreas   
1.Bitcoin is both a payment system and a currency  
2.Bitcoin is created electronically and exchanged between users without passing by a financial intermediary  
3.One of the main reasons for the growing popularity of Bitcoin among stores and consumers is that it reduces transaction costs  
4.Bitcoin is a novel solution to a long-standing computer-science prob. That’s what enables its transformational nature  
5.Bitcoin is a Network, not a Coin  
6.Bitcoin is a protocol, not a currency. Currency is just the first app  
7.Bitcoin is money without borders  
8.Bitcoin gives us the ability to transmit value globally, instantly, securely, and is far more valuable than email  
9.Bitcoin is an experiment in the separation of money and state. You’ll be surprised how many will support that  
10.Bitcoin is an invention that allows distributed consensus over a shared asset ledger without counter-party risk  
11.You do not need to spend $1000 to buy a whole bitcoin. You can easily purchase as little as $1 worth, or one milli-bitcoin. Not expensive  
12.Bitcoin will have a successor but only after fiat has been long gone and buried  
13.Why would anyone trust nerd money vs. central bank money? Nerds brought you the Internet. Banks brought you the Great Depression  
14.People who say that bitcoin is not or cannot become a “valid currency” are ignoring the simple, demonstrable fact that it already is  
15.The most interesting disruption comes when a problem is not solved but rather made irrelevant. If Bitcoin works it could do that to payments  
16.Bitcoin won’t “destroy” banks. Like the Internet did with telcos and media, It will simply make banks less relevant and less powerful  
17.Bitcoin is just a testing ground for something else: The digitization of ‘hard’ currency like dollars  
18.There are thousands of pages written about bitcoin. None of them spell it BitCoin. Therefore you have read none of them if you spell it thus  
19.Bitcoin allows the free market of ideas being flooded with innovation without the need to ask for permission  
20."Banks warn of dangers of bitcoin because people already know of the dangers of banks and are looking for choices."  
21."The bitcoin community may be a bunch of weirdo geeks to the media in general, but to me, it is MY bunch of weirdos"  
22."If you want to understand Bitcoin, read the original paper instead of other people’s interpretations of it   
23."Bitcoin is not “unregulated”. It is regulated by algorithm instead of being regulated by government bureaucracies. Un-corrupted."  
24."You are guaranteed to lose your bitcoin investment if you sell at the bottom of a dip. If you hold, you have a chance for recovery."  
25."In the last 3 months, the pace of development by bitcoin tech companies has increased at least 10x. Hundreds of developers joining per month."  
26."Unless something breaks in the bitcoin code that can’t be fixed the fundamentals are no different at $1000 than they were at $1."  
27."On open networks, like the Internet, innovation occurs at the edge without permission. Bitcoin does that with online financial innovation."  
28."Bitcoin’s top innovations are concentrated in the protocol layers above bitcoin, allowing other “apps” and currencies to run on it"  
29."The Internet of Money, bitcoin, is releasing 50 yrs. of pent up innovation in finance, because it offers innovation without permission."  
30."In many countries around the world, if a government bans bitcoin it will instantly be more credible as an alternative choice."  
31."Do you want bitcoin to succeed? Tell two or three people about it, every day, help them get $10 each. Adoption is only thing that matters."  
32."Bitcoin will survive the banking regulators and oppressive governments. The converse however is unlikely."  
33."Almost all the risks to bitcoin are now internal. The external risks now only affect the price, not the survival of bitcoin."  
34."Bitcoin is a company, like trigonometry is. It’s a scientific invention, now part of our culture, unstoppable."  
35."If bitcoin survives, without major good news or major bug, just steady adoption, we’re somewhere between 10k and 100k."  
36."Price is a leading indicator for media attention of Bitcoin and eventual adoption by users."  
37."The vast majority of western societies has no clue what bitcoin is, yet. As they discover it and adopt it, we will keep growing."  
38."Mining provides security for the Bitcoin network, at much lower cost per transaction than other payment networks."  
39."The Internet at first was controversial, geeky and very strongly resisted by governments and telcos. Repeating history with bitcoin"  
40."Countries rejecting bitcoin reminds me of the time when countries were resisting the Internet."  
41."Don’t let the price of bitcoin distract you from the network/protocol."  
42."Most people are yet to understand how disruptive the Bitcoin technology really is."  
43."First you’re curious and jealous of people having it, then you have it, and then you want more. Bitcoin is just like sex."  
44."The Internet giveth us bitcoin, but bitcoin will make the Internet 100x more valuable in the next 5 years."  
45."I can spend hours trying to explain Skype to someone, or they can video their mom and see her smile. Don’t try to learn bitcoin, USE it."  
46."Bitcoin’s success is owed to creativity and innovation. It has nothing to do with the government’s endorsement"  
47."The bitcoin price only follows adoption and purchasing power. We are still in the very very beginning."  
48."Those who make the mistake of thinking bitcoin is expensive today are going to miss two orders of magnitude in next year."  
49."Because bitcoin is a protocol for transmitting value. It will be bigger than Internet and will accelerate Internet."  
50."Bitcoin is way to geeky to ever work for mainstream use. Just like the Internet was in 1991. Oh, wait."  
51."Bitcoin scales from nano-payments to giga-payments on a single network."  
52."Bitcoin is global, decentralized and unstoppable. Let govt try, it will be hilarious to watch."  
53."If you want to read something intelligent about bitcoin, read the source code."  
54."In 2 years people will be shocked they didn’t see the 1,001 uses for Bitcoin back when it was experimental. Tipping apps, P2P, everything."  
55."The identity of bitcoin’s creator is entirely irrelevant. The invention and new science stands independently without influence"  
56."Keep focused on the narrative which will become bitcoin’s destiny: It is not a currency, it is an invention, a protocol, a technology."  
57."Napster paved the way for BitTorrent, iTunes and Spotify; Bitcoin will do same for digital money"  
58."Eventually, banks will embrace bitcoin, just like telcos found a way to make money on Internet."  
59."The first years on the Internet, we got access DESPITE telecom companies, not through them. Now, bitcoin works despite banks, not with them"  
60."Credit cards are a “pull” model: You surrender the keys to your money, and they pull money from you. Bitcoin is a push model; more secure."  
61."The last consumer focused innovation in financial services was credit cards, in the 1950s. There is no industry more ripe for disruption."  
62."The thing about bitcoin being a Ponzi Scheme is that there is no Ponzi and there is no scheme."  
63."Bitcoin doesn’t just disrupt money. It also disrupts the models of modern corporations, macro-economics, nation-states and the Internet"  
64."Bitcoin’s distributed asset ledger is the most important Computer Science invention of the century."  
65."Previously unsolved problem in computer science is to transfer info without duplication. Bitcoin’s solution enforces digital scarcity."  
66."When the regulators come to regulate Bitcoin for your own good, your reply should be ‘Fuck Off!’"  
67. Bitcoin is regulated by math. Banks are regulated by committees that are either completely powerless or entirely "captured" by those they regulate  
Others:  
- Bitcoin is even bulletproof against time-travelers. No one can go back in time and bring a lot of coins to or from future.  
- Bitcoin concepts are just too hard for the bankers to understand  
- These are the fools who would pled that the bitcoin’s cause can never succeed; not understanding the purpose is the struggle against the system as it is  
- Economists and journalists often get caught up in this question: Why does Bitcoin have value? And the answer is very easy. Because it is useful and scarce.”  
- Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.  
- Bitcoin will do to banks what email did to the postal industry  
- The governments of the world have spent hundreds and hundreds of trillions of dollars bailing out a decaying, dickensian, outmoded system called banking, when the solution to the future of finance is peer-to-peer. It’s going to be alternative currencies like bitcoin and it’s not actually going to be a banking system as we had before 2008  
- Bitcoin is getting there but it’s not there yet. When it gets there, expect governments to panic and society to be reshaped into something where governments cannot rely on taxing income nor wealth for running their operations.  
- Gold is the money of kings; silver is the money of gentlemen; bitcoin is the money of technofiles; barter is the money of peasants; but debt is the money of slaves.

compromised from the beginning.  
All "free" and "wonderful" email providers like google, yahoo, hotmail are compromised from the moment you create an account. In special when you use it for bitcoin.  
Change your email into a decent one. Or at least you can buy your own domain and rent a email hosting. Chances are lower to be compromised.  
The amount of spam you receive into your gmail shows the amount of "readers" of your mailbox...

In Jan 2015 I close all my bank accounts because I start being paid only in BTC. My daughter also knows how to use bitcoins. Most important thing is to teach our kids about money and crypto. This is the future for them. Our duty is to give them the start.  
When you are in control of your money you are a free person and you are in control of your future.  
Stop thinking in fiat, think about that your daughter will have to use in the future only bitcoin or any other crypto, that is the most important thing, not how much worth of fiat, tomorrow or next 2-10 years those bitcoins. Fiat will be goat shit soon:   
Everybody is looking to Bitcoin like an investment worth of fiat, but they missed the whole point.

Closed all my bank accounts and never sell for fiat my bitcoins. Always pay directly in BTC.

Don't forget that they can do also:  
- freezing your account  
- taking part or all of your saving for bail-ins  
- selling the information with your buying habits to 3rd parties  
- taking your money directly from your account if you don't pay at time/at all taxes  
- checking your account if you pay taxes, bills etc at time (see the UK new rules that you can't travel abroad if you did not have paid the TV fee)  
- using a bank account you just contribute to the endless printing worthless papers and/or worst just creating new digits in a computer.  
And so on the list can continue...  
And remember: you are NEVER in possession of those money. Those money are not yours, never. The account is in your name but even then you can't take it at home. The money in it, not. Even on the bills is not saying: this 1$ is owned by X, it says, property of FEDs....

Be sure a file named file.jar is not resident in your HDD. That exe actually is putting this jar file in your profile and when you restart the pc is launching a java script, installing a monitor/keylogger.  
So before restarting be sure you don't have the run command in startup
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:41:49

Really? Do you know in which part? Cool didn't know that.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:39:58
 - are 2 images
that jar it was "deposited" by an exe, that first come from the website in form of a temp file _5380.exe. This exe also leave a bat file on your desktop (a hidden file) that contain this command: pause &amp; del "C:\Users\username%\AppData\Roaming\File.jar" &amp; del %0  
Once you restart the PC, without notice of the changes in registry and your user profile, you are fucked. If you get to clean it before restart (as I did it) is no longer a threat. In my case the first warning was from my AV after I visited a website so immediately I checked the system.  
But as I said that windows system I use it with no wallet inside, just for browsing and other minor stuff. But this doesn't mean that a Linux or Mac system is not vulnerable. Maybe that malware on other systems will act in different way.  
In my case was MSIL/Golroted.B - Trojan monitoring software - detected/cleaned by malwarebytes.org scanner in the 1824958719.exe in Temp folder.  
The most important is to be vigilant and know very well your system.

Yes me too, I really don't understand these people/sheeple. Once they see 1 upvote immediately follow the other sheeple without thinking/reading what actually saying in the link.  
Banks/govs they saw that being against bitcoin movement is making it stronger than they think, so they start adopting a less harm position, but just for having time to prepare the next move, to slow down the adoption. Being aggressive will not help them.  
Like Andreas said: "In many countries around the world, if a government bans bitcoin it will instantly be more credible as an alternative choice." So maybe they really listen to him :)

I know that sounds like a conspiracy but nowadays the conspiracies are no longer coincidences, are facts.

Yep true. See the SR case. They didn't go for those who really was buying/selling illegal stuff but they took a poor admin (patsy).

Don't focus on daily price. Think how to obtain/earn BTC as fast as you can and keep them or use them. If you use them, put back the amount you just spent. If you decide to buy, buy small amounts no matter the price, very certain period. Don't play all your savings and hope that in some day will be 1 BTC - 1 million USD. That is a dream.  
When the fiat will not have value anymore and everybody will want to use BTC will be worthless to think that you have now 1 trillion of USD but nobody want them.  
So store BTC as much as you can.... are limited. Anjd most important: use them, buy things, put them back (by earning/buying) in your wallet.

I always afford to buy BTC. Even now when I earn them I still buy with my mother, my wife, my sisters fiat money.  
Only those who are afraid of future are buying only few bits that can afford. When I was earning my income in fiat I was buying btc only with what remains after I paid all the expenses. That is wrong. I start asking all over if they accept my btc until finally 90% they accept. Then I start earning only in BTC. This is the key!

Make an boot USB Linux, put a wallet on it and encrypted. When you need to make a transaction always boot up with that USB, use the wallet and done.  
To check your balances you need just some watch only wallets, can be in many online wallets.  
In this way never get busted like many of here posting their case of robbery (sometimes fake).  
When you travel, put some bits into your mobile wallet on your phone to have them just in case.  
That wallet from USB also you can keep a copy in a HD wallet somewhere, in case you lost the USB or it was seized in some way. Of course that USB you have it encrypted so no ones can boot up with it without your password.

But don't worry, once more and more people will wake up and realize the big lie, they will embrace the bitcoin technology and they throw away the fiat.

The cool thing is that also BTC will never be less than 0$ so anyway will be a gain. Fiat always will loose purchasing power because of endless printing, BTC will gain purchasing power because will stop at 21 millions. For much we are closing to those 21 mil the gain will be bigger...

Giving these "donations" you just make more "attractive" for "refugees". They are like flies to the shit...   
Apply the EU laws for immigration that are still in place. This unverified flood of people just bring more problems into EU so why people should donate? Did somebody check their passports, identities, health, background etc? NO, we just give them donations and tax money.  
Understanding of humanity is if you go in Syria and stop bombing their houses. Why you didn't start a donation campaign in 2011-2012 when US start sending arms and financing ISIS in Syria? Why you wasn't human then to protect the syrians INTO THEIR OWN HOME?!

@_date: 2015-02-07 21:39:41

Try changing the "angle" to the Bitcoin network and implications in daily life, society, administration, resources. Do this only for you first and try answering to the big question: how will be our daily life based on Bitcoin network.  
You will be amazed/terrified/surprised about the result.  
Just imagine a world where the banks, the politicians, the notaries are no longer necessary. And this is just the beginning...  
Currency is not that important, can be bitcoin, can be pink stones or whatever invention. Satoshi created the currency bitcoin just to be able to make the others to understand/adopt/use the Bitcoin network.  
The currency bitcoin does not have any power without Bitcoin the network. It will be just like another currency just played in other way.
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:44:18
Good question. +1  
I will answer with some quotes:  
- "Bitcoin is global" - so if a country wants to adopt it and make it national currency they will need to make an altcoin and connected in some way through sidechains to Bitcoin network.  
- "Bitcoin is a protocol, not a currency. Currency is just the first app" - So again that country should create their own altcoin if they want to have a "national currency", otherwise just use bitcoin and be more open.  
- "Bitcoin is money without borders"  
- "Bitcoin is an experiment in the separation of money and state. You’ll be surprised how many will support that"  
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:03:28
Guys this is a lesson to everybody.  
1. first the notion of property:  
- USD bill if you take it will never be "your property". As you know on that bill it's says that is a federal reserve bill, not your name bill  
- BTC if you take it into your wallet, it's yours forever and nobody can take it from you until you gave the private key  
2. The notion of value:  
- The USD bill you take it now but due to heavy printing of bills by FED, the value of that bill will became less than toilet paper soon.  
- The BTC you take them and you think that are 0.045 BTC - 10$, but in reality you have a prize of 0.302BTC - 70$!  
- If you have an IQ enough to be well informed, even if are 0.045BTC is better than 1$. If not, you take the 1$ and you buy with it a a bunch of toilet paper. Yes the toilet paper is more useful than that 1$ because you wipe your ass more times than a 1$ bill.  
- even if you put the real value in USD of the BTC on that paper, the IQ will say it all if they don't take it.  
3. Sanitation:  
- That USD bill can have millions of diseases on it, including ebola  
- The BTC paper, you just have to scan it, not even touch it.  
LATER EDIT:  
Let's not forget also the whole movement that created this experiment:  
- To the $ bill you can't add more value/dollars  
- To the BTC sign you can always top up with donations. And this is amazing for Bitcoin, the incredible power of crowdfunding, instantly, even if with small amounts and with all love.  
- I can compare this experiment with the one at the beginning of Bitcoin, when the guy paid 10k BTC for a pizza, ordered buy other guy from thousands of miles away. This is the power of Bitcoin!

Nope, is too early, but yes will be a start for many changes in the world. The mainstream adoption is a long process, think about all the processes that involve this, not that everybody will have a wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:58:19
no is not too long. I s quite quick I can say. In order to replace a currency you need to change political will in that country. And most important is that more and more people will wake up like this guy. There are still billions of people that are just slave robots that are not capable to think for themselves. Those need to be awake!  
This is a long process is not just like that to change a currency with another one because once people will realize the power of bitcoin will be real revolutions in some countries.

But still there is hope. Few days ago I was talking with a good friend (non-bitcoiner) about the implications of "GREXIT". And again he was also afraid to accept that to THINK for yourself and be pro-active, ask questions is a good thing.  
Then I show him this amazing video:   
Was stunned. Was like a revelation for him. After few days we met again and knowing me that I'm a bitcoiner, he came with the question: do you think I still can jump in for some coins? And I asked him why now and not a year ago when I was telling him? He answered: because the video you show me few days ago.... makes me think again.  
I felt in that moment so happy.... that another person start thinking.

But will appear gangs that will rob the stash, armies to build to protect those miners, new races - miners, that will do only one thing: mining. The other warriors will have a real fight for resources (mines) and the goblins.... ah the goblins will be the producers of the wowcoins....  
Ah what a wonderful game will start...

Yeah will be a bit tricky to convince your company to pay to a US bank account your salary. But soon Bitwage will have a EU account too. Meanwhile insist to be paid in BTC. Try to explain to the management the advantages of payrolls in BTC and starting with a pilot. Maybe you can speak with more colleagues to make like a small "union" in request. The company then can buy BTC from an exchange (and if they want they can use it like a store of value). There are many ways to do it, depend on your way of convincing...

In terms of comparing technology, seems like a Pentium I PC in early days. But I'm sure will come much better versions of these wallets.

Man, I start buying btc from 2012. In 2011 I was mining with my own GPU. From 2013 I start buying btc from legit, normal pages (bitcoin.de) and never gave problems with my bank for that. I don't care if they track my btc purchases. I'm the one that at the end remains with the btc in MY wallet not in THEIR wallet.  
And from this year I start earning all my income in BTC. So the banks... fuck them!
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:31:55
as I see are many links for trading. Maybe not all newbies want to be a btc reader, maybe they just want to be a bitcoiner, using the bitcoin, to be paid, to spend to hold eyc. Trading btc is just a manipulation of the price and if they think that btc is an investment instrument they will be totally wrong.

This trial was not justice. Was just a setup. The whole story of SR was a setup of FBI and Ross in a patsy role.  
If they want justice, why in first place they didn't "touch" those that actually make commerce with illegal stuff. Those are the first to be incriminated not the one that manage the server.   
The whole case was built to undermine the faith in bitcoin.  
And will be many downvotes to my words because there so many "agents" infiltrated here that they don't want an opinion like this to awake many people. Is inconvenient for them to reveal the "show".
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:47:30
I really don't care if is going to be 0.06USD. Actually I would love to be 0.00000001 USD but that will be really imposible becayse the USD can't be usable in this format :), but anyway I will buy tons of BTC at that price.  
The "price" of BTC is an illusion. People should focus on his real value, not on how much I pay to obtain 1 BTC...  
Maybe now people pay 200USD/BTC but in other place, other people pay just 2 pink stones for 1BTC. What you will say about that? Is the correct "price" ?

I don't have to worry anymore about this. This year I start to be paid full in BTC. Very few things I have to pay in fiat and I'm trying to limit this as much is possible.  
In the past I used to buy regularly BTC from bitcoin.de and I had an option in my online banking to put a name for each bank account. I had one named BITCOIN (sic) and one day somebody from the bank called me for asking me about some details (non-bitcoin related). So when they see the name of the account thay asked me why I put that name. I answered: because I can (?!), you offer me this option and I use it. Also all the money that came into that account I always exchange them for bitcoin, so never will stay there.  
So after my answer, I hear nothing but silence like 2 minutes. I tought they hang up but actually they was like no comment moment.  
But never they harras me about buying bitcoins.  
BTW the bank was/is ING.

Taxes? I'm invoicing in the currency that it's usual in that country and declare it. Bitcoin is a form of payment you don't have to worry about extra taxing because you use it. If you decide to be paid in pink stones, what? You will pay taxes for using pink stones? No. Fuck them with their taxes!

I think is the same Trojan that I mentioned here  
  
and almost infected me.  
So you wasn't so vigilant and/or paid attention of what I was saying then. The Trojan came from a website with bad java script. It seed an .exe in your temp folder, then that exe is copying a file.jar in your user profile, that jar file is re-copying itself when you try to delete it, and putting a hideen bat file on your desktop (so always use show hidden files). That jar file bring a keylogger and a malware that sends data from your pc.  
The malwarebytes.org scanner is cleaning that malware.  
But the most important is to be always vigilant with what happen into your PC. Ignoring suspicious activity is like letting your door open to bad guys.  
I was able to stop it quick and no damage.  
BTW for all my wallets I use a separate PC and not windows.

Wrong, Bitcoin doesn't need so much hashing power. GREED need so much hashing power.  
You know that you can mine bitcoins also with pen and paper...  
Until now only central banks had the "hashing power" to print endless paper money, but now every person in this world can have his "own money printer" but the trick is that these "money" - bitcoins, are not endless, are limited. So there is a race now, who will gonna accumulate more, later will be crazy.

I was a consultant for a dutch company in Spain that is doing that. They pay in BTC 50% of salary to those they want, The nominas are the same in euros but just the payment is in btc/euros. There is no legislation in Spain to stop you to do that.  
Off course they paid me also in BTC for my services. I will never accept to be paid in fiat.
