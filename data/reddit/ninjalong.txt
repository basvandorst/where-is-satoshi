How many merchants accept bitcoin in Korea and is there a website for that list?
@_date: 2015-06-12 07:28:54
awesome work ...seen almost all your vids on youtube
@_date: 2015-06-07 02:49:10
and you expect miners to relay your txs for free? a system that has no incentive will die off sooner than you can say fees. as it is we are paying 6% tax everytime I buy a pack of sweets.
@_date: 2015-06-05 04:02:21
never thought of that.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:38:06
so does that include the bankers that stored btc there...
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:37:38
typo found - "and Couterparty,"
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:25:48
does your account have more than 10 btc? 
@_date: 2015-06-03 07:47:05
he must have lost a lot of coins in the mtgox drama....
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:56:10
yes agree. scammers they are
@_date: 2015-06-26 02:07:24
Going to tell my friend who lives there with her fiancee.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:02:31
Did you try getting Stephen Macaskill, CEO of Amagi Metals.
@_date: 2015-06-17 02:40:53
I thought theymos was a good guy. Can't say the same for scams like Aprilcoin....
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:33:29
good things. good karma work hand in hand.
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:16:13
been doing something similar in Asia for the past 4 year, ping me if you need advise or talk.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:41:54


When Vint Cerf resigns, it won't matter.
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:35:08
totally agree. I think somewhere in 2018 will be the correct year.
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:21:44
Sounds cool. I want to do the same here in Malaysia. Ping me if you can share the download link. Then I'll prep a standard curriculum for it.
@_date: 2015-06-05 04:01:55
they can always use a sexcoin or titcoin blockchain. that will spice things up.
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:23:32
don't think it was hacked, maybe it was just an inside job.
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:24:08
@_date: 2015-12-16 15:14:22
So again what was the  Bitcoin Foundation for? 
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:35:50
Where is this Embassy located?
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:17:00
Same thing happened when I was in Singapore 2 years back for the conference. Seems they only accepted bitcoin during special events. Bummer.
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:18:17
Anyway, there are 19 merchants in Malaysia, yippee. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:26:41

@_date: 2014-08-10 01:27:12
why is it not?
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:09:40


instead of talking about Ethereum, you can provide a reference to the above and also Stellar.org
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:34:01
what? no PPC yet?
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:14:12
So we have the low end cheaper ATMs like SkyHook and the expensive ones from BitAccess and Robocoin. Wonder which vendor will corner the market in the coming 12 months?
@_date: 2014-07-18 02:51:46
nice interface
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:39:39

they are jeolous of 
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:18:37
so basically it's faster or equivalent to WU transfers? 
@_date: 2014-08-15 02:28:32
can you guys add STR? stellar.org
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:21:35

@_date: 2014-08-19 15:14:11
nice. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:20:13
I never sell btc for PayPal and there are a few traders around Malaysia. have not met any dodgy people yet but I will be vigilant.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:04:38
I received my unit back in June 2013. It's in the closet now
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:46:34

Good stuff, I am in contact with a big group of Pinoys in Malaysia too. Buzz me if you need help.
@_date: 2014-01-04 11:56:37
no, through POS mining on PPC, you get 1% pa extra from your existing coins. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:20:05
have that in mind too for some slides, thanks
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:54:20
yeap, pretty awesome news with the big boys coming to play now.
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:18:23
I think this only happens in America.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:04:54
too bad for them....it's free money and they don't want it
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:19:24
lol. will never do it unless I was drunk.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:01:54
indeed, that's what Taximonger is hoping for.

yes, karma is a bitch. don't mess with her
@_date: 2014-05-09 09:28:03
good idea. could work for other countries too.
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:32:28
How about a Bitcoin Wallet that can integrate with other chat apps like WeChat or Whatsapp? That could be so awesome.
@_date: 2014-07-20 03:49:27
I received my 60g miner after 12 months, bad deal. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:09:05

@_date: 2014-07-24 12:38:05
highly unlikely.
@_date: 2014-06-19 09:31:28
Did you add a bitcoin accepted logo on your site or shop.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:20:33

@_date: 2014-10-16 13:24:06

@_date: 2014-11-03 13:52:39
waiting for them to add in more fiat currencies
@_date: 2014-07-24 03:44:58


is it easy to get a Venmo account? I think bitcoin accounts are easier for beginners.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:01:29
instant confirmation. the customer does not have to wait after paying the btc. the app provider has no concerns about double spending.
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:53:07
Stellar is inching up. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 00:05:02

indeed. I see the correlation
@_date: 2014-07-20 03:21:51
Do you think super3 is the only dev on this project? I've seen the due diligence report (by BitAngels) and they have a big team working on this project. Stop stop spreading FUD if you don't have enough facts. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:29:23

@_date: 2014-09-14 15:09:52
Hello from Malaysia. Hoarding happens everywhere but we are trying to change that mentality. We have over 180 people on our btc chat group and we try to meet every weekend at a cafe that accepts btc payments in Damansara Uptown (near Kuala Lumpur). There are 14 merchants that accept bitcoin in Malaysia now - 
@_date: 2014-12-08 06:45:05
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:48:28
ZSim - found it, 
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:45:07
really nice, but can bitcoin breathe without oxygen
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:21:18
Central Bank did not outlaw Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-19 08:17:52
 note to self.
@_date: 2014-08-28 06:28:29
that's also terrible. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:31:25
I got the same spam
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:17:40
clearly the lady does not know what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 09:53:57

++111, 
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:44:25
That's like MYR0.21 for me and it's not cost effective if I paid for anything less than MYR 10 (malaysian ringgit) from this bitcoin wallet. Anyway this wallet has a cool p2p exchange platform.
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:43:29
still 1st in Asia
@_date: 2014-07-05 07:05:07
and a bitcoin rabbit will jump out
@_date: 2014-08-28 08:12:25
lucky you..which part of the world may I ask? 
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:07:16
never got it but will be vigilant, thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-19 08:07:32
1790 upvotes? wow. incredible. I know the Bitcoin Pakistan founder.
@_date: 2014-09-16 05:21:36
the pic is really blurry
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:13:22
I use the BitX App as it has 2FA and its on an Android phone. Much safer than Windoz
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:30:56
agree on that
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:05:43
where's the link to the app?
@_date: 2014-09-13 01:08:54
i got it around midnight, finally it came.
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:50:04

smart people
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:34:04


  - records must be retained for seven years under SOX. 10 years is overkill.
@_date: 2014-10-11 23:29:49
they are having problems with the credit cards, so they need to cover all this fraud issues.
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:24:35
agree. they might be a good ally in the next 12 months. my crystal ball says they will be on-board soon.
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:34:25


noob thinking. isn't DIY entropy generation much more random?

@_date: 2014-12-08 22:46:23
It's a bit slower than WU right? So the convenience/cost factor should be taken into account.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:15:19
hope Apple won't be that evil.
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:52:53
Spoke to the CEO of ipmart earlier and will try to get some bitcoin stats from them.
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:26:35
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:35:35
same thing paypal did last time.
@_date: 2014-09-04 05:56:56
In other words, NON-USA users will be charged a hefty cash advance fee and bitcoins will be bought at a higher price than btc-e or preev.
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:49:22
awesome news....
@_date: 2014-12-15 07:17:09
please use a non-windoz pc too. ie linux, ubuntu, fedora.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:38:25
how can u classify it a scam? 
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:25:16
and do not tell the bankers that bitcoin will distrupt the payment system or financial system. instead say that bitcoin will help improve the situation.
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:36:52
got the 0.00156075 btc, thanks
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:44:55

waiting for that to come online
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:33:36
Good stuff. That's what we are doing in Malaysia too. Over 800 email newletter subscribers for my blog. Over 200 people in our Telegram groups. 2 active meetups weekly in Kuala Lumpur and Kuching. It's about reaching out to the masses and educating them. Kudos to all on-board the bitcoin train.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:29:52
If bitcoin wallets could add a chat or photo sharing function, it could go viral.
@_date: 2014-12-13 00:09:38
took me more than 1 month to learn about mining back in Year 2012. so take it easy.
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:12:00
Global payment system for the masses, the easy way
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:31:19

awesome news, congrats
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:58:30
I'm not in the USA. Will not try CC deposits as they cost a bomb in Malaysia. BTC withdrawals were quick and easy.
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:40:43
Where are you located? USA?
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:50:00
I did the same just now
@_date: 2014-11-03 11:59:22
congrats on the official launch.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:50:09


wow, online vault and password manager that knows nothing about you and your data
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:50:09
wow, you have a lot of time to write them long posts. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:18:50
Looks awesome, will send you guys an email.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:14:28
better yet. get a Mac or Linux based PC
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:12:27
Do not put your bitcoin wallet on a Windoz PC, nuff said. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:14:46
mark. aw3some work. keep it up. I won't be donating any btc for now. But hope the 1 PPC I sent you last year was put to good use. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:55:47
buyers of bitcoin don't mind buying bitcoins from trusted sellers for 5% markup. my experience since 2012.
@_date: 2014-10-11 23:38:14
voted. alibaba login system only accepts max 20 characters and no special chars are allowed. pretty crappy system.
@_date: 2014-08-09 02:47:33
great for traction and PR. I see a lot of payment / ecommerce players from 1.0 web coming on the crypto train
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:09:01
awesome, u rock
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:35:18
thanks. do you use it?
@_date: 2014-08-28 12:27:25
nice for you. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:09:26
I hope not
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:33:10
"We use the Akimbo VISA-branded prepaid card to send you money, so you must sign up!  Click on the card to get enrolled!"
interesting. Wonder if Akimbo knows you are using it to cash out Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:26:59
nope it does not 
@_date: 2014-09-14 22:59:10

never tried it
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:07:08
crazy drama. and this mtgox CEO (Mark) is really an amateur when it comes to having an enterprise level exchange/procedures. Luckily I've never had a btc with them.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:18:46
get them here please
@_date: 2014-09-17 05:24:01
That's 3am, 23 Sept 2014 in Malaysia. I hope I will be awake to see it. thanks

If you do not add  transaction fees to your btc tx, then it will be stuck around 48-72 hours till it is confirmed by the nodes.

@_date: 2014-06-09 09:54:10
The CEO of ipmart has been a big time supporter of bitcoin for a long time and he's able to absorb the risks.
@_date: 2014-08-29 08:30:19
nice, they have this in Malaysia too, 
@_date: 2014-09-12 07:41:52

@_date: 2014-08-20 10:45:52

I tried to get AirAsia onboard the bitcoin train last year but it didn't get much attention. Hoping to restart the process again this year. See the hashtag that I created last year 
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:05:13
thanks for the headsup
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:18:53

@_date: 2014-06-24 13:08:09

@_date: 2014-06-14 08:41:30
Awesome news. They have 5 hotels in Malaysia 
@_date: 2014-09-04 05:57:10
same here. painfully slow.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:37:09
In the coming future, it won't be in just 1 host. You can set the number of hosts where the file will reside. Storj is pretty awesome.
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:12:22
we still need to educated the masses on the benefits of bitcoin. media is always painting it in a bad light
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:25:10
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:31:00
please send a copy of a cat's ass to  to start the process.

btw, I've been using Dell PCs and laptops for more than 8 years now. Ordered 1 PC and had 3 laptops from them. Their customer service in Malaysia is the best compared to other brands like HP, Acer or Lenovo.
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:53:04
Why did you not sell it through a legit exchange like Coinbase or Kraken or Coinsetter?
@_date: 2014-07-30 06:53:32
awesome idea. congrats
@_date: 2014-12-21 14:30:04
awesome design and loads really fast. love it.
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:05:37

Linux is the way to go....for anything important. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 05:23:50
Agree but Asians over here are mostly in it for fast profits and speculation. Same thinking goes for most of the people in our Bitcoin Groups for Malaysia.
@_date: 2014-09-19 08:19:14
now I understand. thanks.
@_date: 2014-07-24 03:44:19

@_date: 2015-05-11 23:11:18
I was at the event, awesome. Devs from all over the world came.
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:35:35
is that a cafe somewhere in China?
@_date: 2014-11-01 14:51:59
that's what I thought when I heard the name for the 1st time
@_date: 2014-08-07 22:38:16
Wait, this is the USA right?
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:51:35
always good to see more merchants onboard the bitcoin train.
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:10:47

@_date: 2014-09-21 07:05:54
the only way to understand bitcoin is to use it. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:15:02
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:08:56
@_date: 2015-05-06 02:03:01
agree totally.
@_date: 2014-09-12 07:40:58
they might end up using the bitcoin blockchain since it is the most popular one.
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:18:24
pretty complicated, will see how I can add in a laymen story to it too...
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:43:45

@_date: 2014-02-10 08:43:29


yes. VeryLongSentence is a better option.
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:29:54
Talk about the tx fees:
1. For Peercoin or PPC, there's something call POS mining. You'll get 1% yearly on your coins.
2. In nxt, there is no mining and you get more coins when you run nodes 24/7.
@_date: 2014-12-29 07:56:57
that will be awesome. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 23:08:58
I can put you in touch with the Coindesk team and they could write about it. PM me or email me bitcoinmalaysia

@_date: 2014-11-01 14:53:51
A dev in our group over here provides the app itself. Passengers send btc to the app; it converts to MYR instantly and the taxi drivers get MYR settled daily. They don't keep any bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:08:53
I'm still waiting for mine.
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:09:44

@_date: 2015-08-11 07:53:10
nothing wrong submitting ID. that's a big compliance cost for exchanges like LBC and the others, but they need to weed out the genuine scammers.
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:54:43
but why don't you want to verify yourself?
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:04:41
every bit helps, here's some tips 
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:53:48
that's a really big spread. I would rather rely on my own OTC suppliers

That is better than the numbers in Malaysia. We have only about 200 members in the telegram groups but it is active. Largest exchange is bitx.co

I prefer hokkien mee than pizza, but poor mice like me cannot be fussy.

ouch, i understand in that case.
@_date: 2016-02-04 23:42:44
bci's API has failed many time last year. such a hassle.
@_date: 2015-07-09 06:18:20
what? was it a 2 bit paint job?
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:08:52


that might take a million years? wait. isn't fiat money fake ?
@_date: 2015-07-30 07:21:28

@_date: 2017-10-09 01:55:04

@_date: 2015-04-28 14:26:25
I've donated 2 days ago. don't see anything wrong.
@_date: 2015-04-15 06:14:17
not that difficult to get money in Malaysia. $30 for a wire transfer is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:26:45
cool. I will try later
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:44:15

@_date: 2015-04-20 22:51:16

@_date: 2015-04-06 07:22:32
funny one. i saw what you did there.
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:41:54
Tell your wife, buying bitcoins is not like buying shares. You are making a change to the world - financially and socially better off. So keep the faith.
@_date: 2015-04-26 13:42:27
glad you bought the pump, I donated some bits earlier. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:38:31
good stuff, I am sending some bits shortly.
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:26:50
here's a big list of charities accepting btc 
@_date: 2015-04-22 09:31:35
MLM style incentive might help
@_date: 2015-09-10 04:26:11
bankers are bogged down by a lot of regulation, that's why innovation is a pain for them
@_date: 2015-04-01 12:20:11
In a plea bargain, TradeFortress agrees to return 72 BTC stolen in 2013 from Coinlenders users.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:43:28

@_date: 2015-04-04 13:02:23

@_date: 2015-04-26 13:12:15

@_date: 2015-09-11 01:54:17

@_date: 2015-04-17 13:09:43

@_date: 2015-04-22 03:20:46

@_date: 2015-04-07 23:37:03
you mean fiat currencies are worth nothing, yawn.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:29:38
true. you win some you lose some
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:04:15


agree, so that is why I had bought $400 worth of bitcoins this morning and parked it at Bitfinex and magnr.
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:59:57
I am sure the solution/consensus will come sooner if not later.
@_date: 2015-04-12 14:21:12

@_date: 2015-04-11 02:24:59

@_date: 2015-04-08 07:08:12
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:14:01

@_date: 2015-04-11 03:27:06

@_date: 2015-09-10 02:57:36
So I tried sweeping a private key into Electrum, basically it crashed the app.
@_date: 2015-04-15 12:10:52

@_date: 2015-04-15 12:09:06
Come to Malaysia. There are a lot of bitcoin users here.
@_date: 2015-09-29 05:45:55

@_date: 2015-03-16 02:43:49
You can also ask them to install Telebit, it's an awesome btc wallet that works on top of the Telegram chat app. They are giving out 250 bits to new users for a limited time.

Hi. I am collecting some bits for this charity near my area. It's an old folks home and there's like 16 old folks in that housing estate. Gonna set up a website where people can just send bits in and I will consolidate and buy them stuff like biscuits and milk end of the month. Cheers bitcoinmalaysia.com EDIT: I visited them back in Feb. It's called the NASCOM house in Setapak, Malaysia.  =&gt; If you want to help, send bits to 14pomWaDLHKejf3jgy52s7RNjt5PAaX9jV

According the the Geek.com technical dictionary:
"Cracker - This is the common term used to describe a malicious hacker. Crackers get into all kinds of mischief, including breaking or "cracking" copy protection on software programs, breaking into systems and causing harm, changing data, or stealing. Hackers regard crackers as a less educated group of individuals that cannot truly create their own work, and simply steal other people's work to cause mischief, or for personal gain." So crackers will crack/hack.

Telegram is an app. Most of the crypto guys are in there.

Good job. First IBM and Samsung, now Intel. Next the world.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:26:29
Great idea. I have used telebit to send free bits the last few days. It's a btc wallet use-able via Telegram

@_date: 2015-02-16 09:32:12
it was a hack on a cold wallet. how many people had access to that wallet? or was it really a hot wallet?

@_date: 2013-10-20 22:24:37
nyanpi - you are based in Japan? I have friends too over there. 2 in fact. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 03:24:15


applies to any demo app I guess
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:48:11
good news. and if you drop by Malaysia, we can have teh tarik.
@_date: 2013-09-22 15:07:01
not worried at all, it's business as usual over there. did you read the thread over at bitcointalk
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:19:20
So many BTC exchanges coming online. Here comes the Bitcoin boom. Here's a few that I noticed: btc.sx ; coinmkt.com ; atlasats.com ; nice...
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:25:54
thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:34:38
China people love hoarding good stuff like this.
@_date: 2013-07-12 08:00:17
giving you some love. thanks for sharing your experiences.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:53:15
none for now. but you never know.
@_date: 2013-07-17 09:07:29
wait, I think you can't "gift" it out anymore
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:27:58
Awesome. Met the Shopify Malaysia team last week and they are attending our sold out Bitcoin meetup this Friday. See 
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:36:15
or the 1.4% from my bank.
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:09:48

i've signed up....
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:16:07
agree, there's plenty out there. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 04:22:12
I think it's the same team from  
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:26:49
congrats indeed to the winner. wished I was awake when it happened. I was in la la land in Malaysia time.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:56:53
Ask her to move to China or Malaysia. Banks over here are not that crazy.
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:52:57
that would be cool. I'm working with a company in N.zealand to do this.
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:49:34
me too. see you guys
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:14:25
pretty cool. Now you can store Nxt and BTC on RPIs.
@_date: 2013-07-16 07:05:18
I've got Asher's email if you need it
@_date: 2013-10-08 11:08:30

yes, but beware of scammers and be vigilant when meeting people F2F
@_date: 2013-08-27 13:52:37
will vote 4u
@_date: 2013-10-20 05:15:13
OP, it should have read Bitcoiner from China....there's plenty of Chinese Bitcoin users like me who are NOT living in China.
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:42:41
They are arriving in Singapore end of Oct 2013
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:07:23
I'm gonna visit their office this Thursday
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:05:16
check out the Singapore map here ( I think Bitcoin lovers will hitting those cafes - CAD, Artistry or Hospoda after the conference )  
@_date: 2013-09-28 16:11:55
Bitcoin Singapore Conference on 15 Nov. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:20:13
thanks, saw it. it closed last year 2012
@_date: 2013-07-07 03:52:21


exactly. I never accept unconfirmed TXs
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:53:54
did you report to their Support Team?
@_date: 2013-05-09 06:55:27
Guys, if you need support, please email torex

Asia is waiting.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:39:22
waitin for USD500....
@_date: 2013-08-24 03:21:37
I beg to differ because I deal with BTC newbies daily on a face to face basis (f2f) and real world encounters are a pain. With Bitcoin, there are network fees and withdrawal fees to deal with, and you also have the 10 min block confirmation and some transactions (tx) can be real slow.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:39:16
@_date: 2013-10-20 05:17:31
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:19:40


















































I think this happens to all startups. They need to scale faster and hire more staff. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:40:56
submitted info to survey, thanks
@_date: 2013-10-20 14:34:10


so many nice people around.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:42:39


Yes, sleeping on someone's couch is usually free but what if you need to buy some shaving cream in the middle of the night and you're out of change. Bitcoin is the solution.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:02:38
how does that sound like an Asian?
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:14:08


I used to do Forex trading but it was too tiring. I think some of the brokers manipulate the data.
@_date: 2013-07-13 08:17:25
there's plenty of good sellers at localbitcoins
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:51:34
wow nice. will tell my friends in Sydney and Perth
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:06:42
"blow stamps" ? sounds weird.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:08:40


u mean USD? lol
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:03:33
some ppl I know sold at USD 150
@_date: 2013-09-23 15:09:18
got it, thanks
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:34:29
huh?? what is hodor.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:40:12
very nice idea
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:04:35
Well I have a few wallets on that site. This data is important when we try to sell the "Bitcoin" idea to local merchants in Asia.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:45:21


looking at it now
@_date: 2013-06-08 14:38:50
hope they can add Malaysian ringgit in
@_date: 2013-05-08 06:26:25
I agree, a balanced article.
@_date: 2013-07-29 04:57:00


doesn't work for NON-US people like me
@_date: 2013-07-10 05:12:57
@_date: 2013-09-28 00:44:03
sounds wrong
@_date: 2013-09-23 06:04:36
who's the founder for this site?
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:06:01
I wish
@_date: 2013-09-28 01:37:04
will do, thanks
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:24:09
yeap. and slow.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:30:24


Yes. the payouts to the first coding contest were evidenced on bitcointalk. I saw it. All the TX IDs were posted. So these people do have trust and integrity.
@_date: 2013-07-14 07:04:45
or use a paper wallet
@_date: 2013-07-18 07:51:24

@_date: 2013-10-13 03:30:56
Newbies getting in Bitcoin is going to have it tough. They don't have much experience with 2FA, strong password management and don't use firewalls or update their antivirus software. They need more to be educated.
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:16:11
congrats on enabling this feature. I currently use BTCquick as I am not based in USA but will try Coinbase once I can get an account in US.
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:44:53
wrong area
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:51:04
You are right. It goes back to trust and integrity. But then you are talking about a supplier that is based in China.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:30:47
lol. I plan to do this during the next marathon in Kuala Lumpur
@_date: 2013-09-28 11:32:26
I'm sure there are more than 50K BTC users in USA? Any good place to find the stats for Bitcoin users on a geographical basis?

never knew 796 could do that, great explanation.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:50:10
How do you define scam? it's headed by Bitangels.co and they've given out bounty for their new projects (TX ID on the blockchain)
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:24:56
I think it's called investing.
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:42:44
pretty simple and compact. it has a "James Bond" feeling to it.
@_date: 2013-07-08 22:27:07


wow. pretty neat
@_date: 2013-07-30 05:12:04
simply beautiful...the girl I mean

@_date: 2013-10-30 07:20:45

@_date: 2013-07-10 02:12:55
yea, sounds better
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:44:50
hope you guys add deposit/withdrawals from Malaysia. There are plenty of Malaysians who travel there for business/studies.
@_date: 2013-08-24 03:17:06
banks? nuff said. bank employees, they are a frustrated lot. KPIs, SLAs, deadlines. It's a dead beat job. What did you expect?
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:06:04
Super cool. This will blow the socks off MtGox...
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:15:52

my friend has been thinking of something similar. will prepare an executive summary sometime in June 2013. Follow us at 
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:11:01
will send them a note too
@_date: 2013-10-30 09:13:04
Well the ticket is expensive because it's held at Fullerton Hotel. Not sure why it had to be a 5 star hotel but I guess they were trying to attract bankers and investors too ? Don't quote me.
@_date: 2013-09-30 15:04:27
what happened?
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:41:41
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:10:19
nice, I shall share on my site. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:24:42
great. hope to get a good follow up.
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:06:07
interesting. now my friend can modify it to show MYR (malaysian ringgit), thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:24:07
always knew bitcoin was sexy
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:12:41
yes, but you'll need someone to hold the POS terminal physically. I think vending machines (Robocoin) are great and if you leave them at an airport, awesome.
@_date: 2013-06-17 23:09:47
now that's weird. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 05:15:54
@_date: 2013-07-09 22:22:02
You can also whatsapp me +601111725850 , see 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:30:28
We have 5 x Whatsapp Groups here (Malaysia) with over 200 people on it. Full of traders, miners and we still get newbies asking - What is Bitcoin. lol
@_date: 2013-10-02 13:51:59
final shipping destination?
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:52:50
it's working now. Blockchain.info is online again
@_date: 2013-09-06 05:50:51
it's loading slowly from Malaysia side.
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:45:11
nice. will add you guys to my LinkedIN
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:31:12


I thought it was DO DA MUN
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:55:21
normally I just copy paste the address I'm sending. minimizes mistakes like this.
@_date: 2013-10-20 14:33:23


you mean your wage history, claims, etc can be exported to Quickbooks?
@_date: 2013-05-14 09:35:34
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:16:59
Trust is a relative word. Even bankers don't use online banking services. So it depends on how informed the users are on this Lamassu Bitcoin 1 way machines and it's useful if a pretty gal stands next to it and show how it's done.
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:03:09
They interviewed him in Singapore Business Times together with some feedback from me. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:05:28
haha. good one.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:50:51
good reply.
@_date: 2013-07-26 16:26:37
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:46:28
same here. Banks says they are compliant to regulations but just google the news and you'll see the scandals involving them.
@_date: 2013-08-01 06:14:50


send them a PM.... 
@_date: 2013-09-24 22:57:32
will try it out later. thanks
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:02:30
registered. pretty slick IU. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 06:54:16
more reason to mine alt coins 
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:40:02


if it comes from a green address? 
@_date: 2013-06-29 06:57:10
I usually go with  3. If you comply and answer honestly, nothing will happen(unless you say "buy drugs on silkroad" or something)
@_date: 2013-07-25 09:20:15
they need a new thread announcing their service on bitcointalk.org and also an account at bitcoin-otc
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:27:05
I got it in my Spam folder too
@_date: 2013-08-12 11:40:39
true. lol

@_date: 2013-11-03 22:27:30
very nice. see you guys there
@_date: 2013-09-26 03:46:25
 - we need more people like you. 
 team - please improve on your security management policies and procedures. I also use your wallet service and a good future roadmap for improvements will gain more users for your company.
@_date: 2013-09-25 03:48:44
seems possible.
@_date: 2013-09-20 23:11:19
Of course you can, a Coinbase account generates BTC addresses for you too.
@_date: 2013-09-20 11:31:44
striking out Singapore as Bitcoin friendly
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:14:17
did it feel cool?
@_date: 2013-08-30 05:30:49
didn't know that. You guys are doing a good thing. You get karma points.
@_date: 2013-10-20 04:49:47
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:17:31
you called the wrong number?
@_date: 2013-09-30 02:32:40
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:38:49
@_date: 2013-05-09 07:40:05
what is the URL for that?
@_date: 2013-09-23 06:58:34
nvm, I found the info here 
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:38:08
that's why I'm mining PPC and will convert them to XBT when the price of BTC increases in the coming few months.
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:22:27
how can I order them?
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:16:57
so does this restaurant really accept BTC?
@_date: 2013-08-12 08:01:03
yes its offline now. see my duplicate post and image. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:34:41
awesome news
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:50:45
ok got it
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:44:31
ah, maybe later
@_date: 2013-08-14 05:22:15
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:54:55
Ask them to use Bitpay
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:51:18
Only shipping estimates given. Haven't heard of anyone receiving one in my Whatsapp groups. But Lamassu vending machines are now shipping.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:02:09
I saw it too. and I nearly choke on my lunch
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:39:19
thanks for the new updates. extra karma points for you.
@_date: 2013-07-18 07:50:49
and you got a tip for that? gee
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:42:15


oh nice. thanks for the clarity
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:03:22
thanks for the link
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:01:32
hope u get ur payout
@_date: 2013-10-12 00:30:18
Pre or Post Customer Support is a highly important area for any online business. Look at MtGox. Hope you guys have a solid "Go to Green" project line up to clear the mess.
@_date: 2013-05-21 07:49:38
quite useless for someone not based in USA
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:07:50
or use lastpass.com
@_date: 2013-06-17 23:06:42
one word - karma. no worries. good people will WIN in the end.
@_date: 2013-08-13 10:44:45
cool site. hope to do one for Malaysia using the MOLpay third party system in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2013-09-28 01:01:29
@_date: 2013-08-28 07:20:56
Cool. A coffee shop in Singapore accepts BTC. Hoping for more to come.
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:26:57
stop stealing. karma is looking for u.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:11:38
5k per unit? I think you are looking at Lamassu units that only sell BTC. Better go for Robocoin ones, that do buy/sell.
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:37:01
ya, humans are so predictable. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 05:45:28
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:41:40
Congrats on the new Exchange. Hope you guys rock Asia later.
@_date: 2013-09-20 11:30:33










Good stuff. Now that's a good feature for physical BTC cards.
@_date: 2013-09-26 03:38:37
this is big. minimum investment is $25,000
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:05:34
ya. good point.
@_date: 2013-07-29 04:56:19
thanks for the link..useful indeed
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:43:24
nice, please add your site on  and coinmap
@_date: 2013-06-07 06:03:02
really nice. will try to add my sites in
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:34:32
I never use the same password on websites. I use a strong random password generator. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 15:07:02
So I'm the presenter and I'm the founder of BitcoinMalaysia.com and BTC-ASIA.com. Email me at admin if you'd like to donate some Bitcoins (I could give away some paper-based 0.01 Bitcoins to the audience), send t-shirts/mousepads/stickers, or other Bitcoin related merchandise. Malaysia is the gateway to Asia and it's time to share some Bitcoin love......Thanks all
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:01:56

must be a new section. never saw it before.

NO FEES for ALL deposits (Local &amp; International COMING SOON ) - Ok. So I will wait before I send my money to your site.

Does MtGox still accept those small trades (below 0.001 BTC?)
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:16:34
congrats on enabling this feature. I currently use BTCquick as I am not based in USA but will try Coinbase once I can get an account in US.
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:21:10
Bitstamp is at 190 now. Almost 200, I can wait.

@_date: 2013-09-13 08:15:16
holy grapes. bad week
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:09:24
I think they should have a bigger budget for security hardening, audits, process, QA.
@_date: 2013-08-02 15:18:13
not everyone has a smartphone. even super techies in my current IT company only have old Nokia dumbphones. So paper wallets are a good idea. Just need to xerox them for long term storage in case they fade away.
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:55:24
Does this affect any Android GA versions?
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:20:02
thanks for accepting bitcoin. you are helping  the XBT economy by doing that.
@_date: 2013-09-25 03:48:28
I foresee BTC price rising after that.

@_date: 2013-08-14 03:36:55
Good idea indeed. I use a few 3G providers in Malaysia myself and some areas are pretty spotty. So instead of carrying around a few dongles, I can just open this app, see what wifi is available and buy it with BTC...
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:01:17
big news. now the price is really going to the moon. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 08:15:40

Tony and his team replied. They need to know the number of Bitcoin users in Asia and how it works. I can answer the second one but it's hard to find updated stats for the first one.
