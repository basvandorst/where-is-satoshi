Scalability needs to be fixed before that happens.

I thought it seemed weird but i wanted to find more on it incase i was wrong. I saw they released a prototype in January of 2015 and figured something had to have happened in those almost three years now.

This is a huge set back within the community. We need to drop the technology part when we set people up with bitcoin. Not everyone needs to know what segwit is or how it makes it better. A basic understanding is big but not all the backdrop. Our next move is mass adoption. Scaling will happened one way or another, but whats the point if everyone is scared off because they do not understand who Satoshi is or about hashing. Short, simple, how to buy, how to send.

Exactly. Im learning how to code because Im looking at Blockchain developing. In this, im learning to write HTML to creat a website. Im looking at how i can use this project to set people up with using cryptos in about 15 minutes, then go into the details where they have a choice to see how it works. In research id look at other websites to see what they did for beginners on how to use the system. They all go into the history of how it started, nodes, mining, and how revolutionary it is. People dont care how it works, just like cars, the internet, cellphones, even their own banking system, they just use them. The system isnt hard to use and while  learning about it all can be fun, its not necessary. People will be curious on their own, once they can start using the system they can start asking how it work and other questions. There is really a lack in this department. Huge opportunity to fit this technology into everyday people lives, the community of nerds just lacks communication.

Mass adoption doesn't require everyone to understand the technology is or how it works, ie. Cars, planes, cellphones, economy/currency, etc. Ive taken it as like any other field that there are experts that they go to when they have a question. The general public is just too stupid or have too much going on in their lives to care how their money operates. As long as they can buy their food and pump their gas, explaining bitcoin to them is a waste of time. Which kind of sucks because I feel like many of us here love this new technology and we want to tell everyone about it.

What are you being rewarded for? Recording transactions. What is your rewards? Bitcoins. How do you make a transaction on the Bitcoin Network? With Bitcoins. So if you need bitcoins to participate on the network in order to make transaction, the reward is granted by system for completing a job. The payment just so happens to be a new asset that can be converted into any other item. With receiving a reward for mining, you use electricity and your hardware depreciated over time. In order to compensate for this the system transfers wealth in forms of bitcoin which people will buy from the miners in order to them participate in the network and transfer their wealth to merchants or other peers in return for tangible goods. Bitcoin is a trading network WITH a reward system. Trading infers that both parties have a valuable item the other wants.

That is false. The entire point is to move bitcoins at lower costs internationally or locally. While Bitcoin is the first one and not entirely effective at it on large scale, its still a monetary vehicle meant to transfer wealth.

Damn straight.
