Could not think of a worse advocate for Bitcoin.

For my use case, transferring bitcoin a few times a month, it isn't really useful even when the UI gets there. You still need a transaction to get ON lightning and one to get OFF before the time lock of the initial transaction, which I remember being 30 days. This won't save you any transaction fees unless you transact very often. If on chain fees are still $10+, even Bitcoin with lightning will cost more monthly than a bank.
Edit: apparently from the Bitcoin wiki channels can actually remain open indefinitely. I remember the original lightning talk implied they would have fixed time, but I guess this hurtle was overcome. I'm hype again!

It's funny how "mainstream"=price increase almost always. I've never had more people talk to me about Bitcoin that in the last few weeks.

Yes there will be an incompatibility at the block level, but without explicit protection each transaction will be compatible on both chains. So if Bob sends Alice 1 Bitcoin, Alice can just broadcast the same (valid, signed) transaction bit for bit onto the 2x chain. Both transactions will be included into different blocks on both chains, so Alice will get Bob's Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x

I wonder if anyone else on this subreddit actually doesn't have a problem with 2x. It seems to be a reasonable change to keep the network useful while offchain solutions are built up while not seriously affecting decentralization (2MB/10 minutes is still reasonable IMO). I don't even see the big conspiracy of how miners will profit from this (won't it decrease transaction fees in the short term?) besides from the high price from a more useful currency. 2x could also be an opportunity for developers to get some non-controversial improvements we've needed for years into the software if a hard fork is happening anyways.
I disagree with comparing this to bitcoin cash, which had no consensus and stubornly refused to implement technology that is clearly beneficial.

Even without lightning, segwit should shrink the mempool
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:32:56
What a ridiculous situation this has been. It was a technically sound improvement, extensively tested and approved by nearly every skilled developer in the crypto space, that was elegantly implemented as a soft fork to minimally disturb outdated clients. It should have been locked in during the first cycle, but it was used as a political card by people who had no actual argument against it so they could get their untested, unrelated upgrades in the protocol too.

Even though bitpay fucked up with PR, their wallet is still open source and you have your private keys and seed! So if you want to switch you can

I agree. 2MB seems like a good solution to make bitcoin remain useful while trustless offchain solutions get built on segwit. I think a well planned 2MB hard fork that includes many of the resturctuing and security features core devs have wanted for years is ideal. Look at the work [Johnson Lau]( has been doing on universally good improvements we could add if we had a hard fork. If a one time block increase to a still reasonable size is what it takes to get full consensus, sounds fine!

Looks a little smaller than the bitmain facility

Well mining will be more profitable if bitcoin's price goes up, which hopefully will happen when it is easier (cheaper) to transact in bitcoin.

Not so sure this is true. Bitcoin exchanges aren't regulated in the same way banks are. I bet if an exchange had in their terms and conditions that they can take your coins they would get away with it even in court. It's like if Valve wanted to take your Steam Trading cards. Not to mention that people using exchanges often aren't even in the same country as the exchange is operated in. Do you really think Bitcoin exchange international law exists?

Bitcoin Cash implemented something called replay protection, which means that a transaction on the Bitcoin Cash network is NOT valid on the bitcoin network. This may not be the case with the 2x split, so anytime you send bitcoin from one address to another, you will effectively be forced to also send it on the other network, as anyone can just rebroadcast the transaction to the other chain and it will be accepted.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:11:11
Everyone needs to remember that this only worked with bcash because of the replay protection that bcash implemented. If something similar is not done with the 2x hard fork (AFAIK the developers have no plan to do this), it will be impossible to send your current coins to just one of the networks as it could easily be replayed on the other.

How are people not in control of their vps? It's just a box you got root access to. Should people stop hosting websites on servers too?

Perhaps you're confused with lightning. Segwit doesn't magically make transactions confirm faster, it just lowers the fee for a given confirmation target.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:41:34
1) you'll want to wait because it can save you a lot of money in fees
2) if the exchange/wallet has enough transaction throughput, your transaction will be batched in a transaction that is included in the next block, which is the fastest it could have confirmed anyways.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:31:34
Yes.
