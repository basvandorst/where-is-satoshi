"You people"
yeah, I have a HORRIBLE political agenda.  I want Bitcoin to go back to low fees and short transaction times.  Aren't I total ass for thinking Bitcoin should be able to operate as a currency and not a store of value.  I would follow up and say "as Satoshi envisioned," but that's not true.  That's pretty much what everyone envisioned for Bitcoin.  It was going to take over the world, replace fiat, give the poor a voice in their own financial freedom.
And we've spent the last 2 years debating on how fix Bitcoin without actually fixing Bitcoin.  I really want SOMETHING to work.  You rolled out Segwit and it has piss poor adoption.  Does Segwit actually lower fees?  From my scanning of Blockchain browsers, it does.  But not by enough to matter.  When a $20 transaction fee is reduced to $15.00, that's better.  But it's not $0.05, where it should be.
And now you're talking about Lightning Network and Lightning Hubs.  Well, Lightning hubs can't mine.  So, they can only make money by charging fees.  I fail to understand how that's going to solve anything in a real world situation.
We now have 2 coins with competing solutions.  One went for bigger blocks and the other went for Segwit and Lightning sometime down the road.  I'm excited to see where each solution goes.
I just either want Lightning here now (I believe it's 18 months late at this point) or Bitcoin Cash accepted at more places.
Anything that allows me to SPEND Bitcoin again would be most welcome.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:04:37
I'll spend some time reading those articles.  My definition of sidechain was any chain/transaction channel/etc that was using Bitcoin that was not on the blockchain, but connected to it.

Seriously?  That's way too much work.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:27:48
Satoshi is long gone.  it would not surprise me if Bitcoin was created by the CIA or NSA to be used in countries with oppressive regimes to help fund revolutionaries.  Then, just like Stuxnet, they lost control of it and it was used for other purposes.
You know the Signal end to end encryption protocol was originally developed by the CIA to allow people in oppressive regimes to communicate with journalists and other resistance people without their government spying on them.  Then it kind of backfired on them and Facebook Messenger, What's App and Signal all adopted their protocol and they lost access to millions of Americans' communication.
Satoshi Nakamoto is probably some brilliant NSA mathematician with a PhD in economics. wonder how his creation went so completely off the rails.

Well, that's kind of an issue, isn't it?  We're always hearing Lightning is around the corner.  At this point in Lightning's development, there should already be a client that is simple to install.
I applaud the work here, but selling Lightning is going to be tough.  It needs to "just work" without people even knowing they're using Lightning.  If you can't scan a QR code at a Pizza parlor and click send for the exact amount of money you're supposed to pay and it just goes, it will be a non-starter for the non-technical crowd.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:19:20
I went cruising through blockchain.info last night looking for segwit addresses starting with 3 and I did not see any lower fees in any of those transaction.  I think the lowest I saw was $27.00 USD, and the highest was $320 USD.  I'll keep browsing.  See what segwit transactions were made in 2018 and what fees were paid.

Umm...  Bitcoin has a HUGE scaling problem right now.  So, I would not say that other coins will have scaling problems.  Their solutions have not been tested at the volume Bitcoin has, but at least they're trying.


I'm not talking about buying a whole Bitcoin.  I'm saying of you have $1000 to invest in Bitcoin right now, or the stock market, you will pay less fees to buy stock right now than you will to buy Bitcoin.  AND, you profits will be totally determined by the time of day you buy Bitcoin.  If you buy in at 1:00 PM ,you could lose you shirt.  But 2:15 PM, and you made a 25% profit.


Gold IS a store of value.  It is not a currency.  It's value is it's scarcity.  Bitcoin is a currency.  What gives it value is the fact that I used to be able to send 10 BTC to my family in Ukraine in under 10 minutes for pennies.  With that gone, the thing that gives it value is also gone.
What serious bug?  And why would it be a disaster?  You do know that Bitcoin originally had one developer.  Then others joined.  That's how this works.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:38:06
A small block size increase (2 MB) is the obvious immediate short term solution to the scaling problem.  And a 2 MB block size is not that big an increase and gets up past the immediate need.
There has to be some reason why a simple block size increase to 2 MB was so fought against.  Sotoshi's idea for how to phase it in was a very good one.  We could have been ready to increase the block size in the protocol years ago without pulling the trigger till we were ready.  But even that was blocked when Gavin tried very hard to enter that commit into GIT HEAD.
I work for a bank.  If we allowed the kind of transaction fees and wait times you're willing to put up with on the blockchain, we would have been out of business a long time ago.  The ONLY thing saving Bitcoin's ass is the bubble that we're in.  And there are forces at work ensuring that bubble stays.

Gold is NOT money.  There is no place I know of where can pay for goods with gold  In the US, it's actually illegal to do so.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:53:24


Even if I just make a side chain between myself and my friends Bob and Larry and neither of us ever makes another sidechain of any kind we're still on the "Lightning Network" and can freely transact with anyone on the entire Lightning network?


So I have to pay for the Lightning Network?  How do they make a profit on the Lightning network?  What is the mechanism for that?  This is not discussed in any of the ELI5 videos.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:57:01
The NSA does not want to control this kind of thing.  They launch it in a country that's an enemy of the US and see what happens.
Look at what happened with Signal.  It was launched as open source to allow dissidents in countries we consider our enemies to communicate without fear of being arrested.  And in the end, it's been adopted by every single major communication platform.  Even Google's Allo uses it for it's secure communication.  Version 0.1 of the code was primitive also.
Our intelligence communities rarely plan far enough ahead in their actions to understand long term consequences.  Hence why blowback such a big problem for the US.  We pretty much created Islamic terrorism, and now we'r upset the are making us a target.

Bitcoin was NEVER supposed to create wealth.  it's value was in using it to buy goods.
Imaging a guy in some country that wants to buy weapons.  The country is in the middle of  civil war.  There is no money to be had anywhere.  You haven't seen a printed fiat bill in weeks.  And even if you did, the vendor you're buying guns from may not even accept it, for fear that money may be worthless if the regime that issued that money topples.
Bitcoin solves all that.  You scan a QR code, transfer a bunch of money, and walk away with a crate full of AK-47s.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:06:19
Yes.  Herculean efforts were made to "increase" the block size without increasing the block size.  i fail to understand how SW is any safer than just doing a 2 MB block.

I did watch several videos.  And they all talk about Lightning networking being sidechains.
No offense, but the definition of this stuff continues to change depending on who you ask and what the argument actually is at the time.
I watched at least a dozen ELI5 videos as they all talk about "lightning channels," which are sidechains.  if you have something that explains the difference between Lightning and sidechain, I'd love to watch it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:00:51
Ok, I'll have a peek.  How can I tell what is a Segwit transaction vs a regular one?

If it was part of the block, then non-upgraded clients could easily read that data.  But they can't.
Are those screen shots supposed to show the exact same transaction one with and one without Segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:42:43
I don't see anything actively being done to turn Bitcoin into a currency again BY THE CORE DEVELOPERS.  The fact that CORE has outsourced the scaling problem to Lightning Labs, and pretty much flipped out at even a small block size increase to 2 MB is pretty insane.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:44:03


It's not.  Hence why the Euro and the Pound are not currency in the US.  They're unusable unless you convert them to something people here accept.  To people in the US, the Euro and the Pound are just a store of value.

Has anyone actually seen cheaper transaction fees with Segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:39:16
I said I needed to vet the list.  I'm not changing the rules.  I'm merely stating that I need verify the list is accurate.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:47:38
The block size itself is still exactly one meg.  That has not changed.  It simply took the signature data out of the block.  That's why it'a called "Segregated Witness."  It segregated the witness data giving more room in the block.
This is not a block size increase, no matter how you cut it.  It's a method to allow more transactions into the same 1 MB block.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:36:20
Um, Satoshi always wanted the blocks to go bigger than 1 MB.  That was always meant to be temporary.  There are quite a few Satoshi posts that say exactly that.  Even Gavin Anderson and Adam Back wanted to increase the block size.

@_date: 2018-01-03 18:14:01
True.  But if there is a HUGE disparity between Segwit and non-segwit that won't matter all that much.  I would hope at this point, there would a big enough disparity that the other variable won't matter.

@_date: 2018-01-15 23:25:07
How do you not see a similarity?  It's a bunch of peer to peer sidechains.  Any time you go "off chain," you're making a sidechain.  That's the only way to do it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:53:27
So I need to scan the QR code of the merchants node.  Then once the side chain is set up, I need to scan the payment QR code.  When I scan the QR code to set up the sidechain, will I be required to fund it to set it up?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:34:30
So, I throw 10 BTC in a side chain with Best Buy. I spend 1 BTC and decide I need the other BTC for something else due to a family emergency.   So I need to close that chain and then create another chain. Or I can just do it all on chain and the high fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:18:49
They like it so much only 11%-15% are using it.
It should have been a hard fork.  That would have gotten better adoption.

@_date: 2018-01-09 03:09:21


I think the exchanges are slow to upgrade BECAUSE it's a soft fork.  They're free to ignore it.  They don't have to do it.
When an Exchange has the choice of either implementing Segwit or BCH (or some other crypto), BCH (or some other crypto) offers a greater profit for them than Segwit does, so they don't bother.  If iit was a hard fork, the choice is to do it, or get left behind.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:58:25
Bitcoin cash is a fork of the original Bitcoin software.  There is no "true bitcoin."  Bitcoin is name, that's all.  bcash is a derogatory name used by Bitcoin Core zealots that Bitcoin cash supporters find offensive.
By that definition alone, it's exactly the same as the n word.
There is no good reason to call it bcash.  It would be more appropriate to abbreviate it as BCH.  Heck, I call Bitcoin BTC all the time, because it's shorter and is a properly acceptable term for Bitcoin.


What are you, 5 years old?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:26:30
I find that solution unacceptable. If you open a side channel, fund it, and then use it for payment, you've just created a checking account.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:40:41


This in itself is a huge issue and the reason why piss poor adoption has happened.
Satoshi's idea for a block size increase was a very good one, and everyone chose to ignore it.  Gavin Anderson chose to commit a change for bigger blocks,and every time he did so, GIT HEAD would be tweaked just enough to break his patch and he would start over again.  When he tried to check in his new commit, it would once again break because someone had once again twekaed GIT HEAD to break his patch.  He eventually gave up and withdrew his patch.


This is a good thing.  Either join the herd or get left behind.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:34:33
I have.  I don't see where the 2 MB upgrade is in Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:13:29
So, scanning a QR code will open a side channel, fund it, and the settle it on the Blockchain without me needing to do anything at all, expect pay the way I have always been paying using Bitcoin?
Cause it not how it's described at all.  According to every ELI5 video on YouTube, I need to open a side channel, fund the side channel, and then I can do a transaction.  That seems like more work than just scanning a QR code and someone gets paid.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:05:19
No. What’s Neutrino?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:02:10
So, you believe that this a big conspiracy against Segwit?  People are motivated by profit, plain and simple.  No exchange is in it to make the world better.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:17:55
None of this is true of the current Bitcoin, other than a store of value.
Pretty much any method of moving money is cheaper than Bitcoin.  Hell, it be cheaper to buy and sell stock than to trade in Bitcoin these days.
Until they get fees and transaction times under control, Bitcoin is doomed.
We lost Steam.  We lost Microsoft.  Tons of websites around the globe no longer take Bitcoin.  These sites are never coming back.  Once bitten twice shy.
I hope all you NO2X guys are happy now.  You've successfully ruined Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:09:03
I would not call that visualization excellent.  It did very little to actually explain anything.
The witness data is an extended block and it not included in the original 1 MB block.  The 1 MB block remains unchanged.  If it did not, this would be a hard fork.  There is no way to increase the size of the transaction block without a hard fork.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:42:53
This is artificially lowering the fee, and by not enough to make a difference.  The protocol is FORCING lower fees.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:23:29
That's a horrible idea.  Then the code never moves forward.  People will always take the path of least resistance.  You need to kick them in the ass to move or they're not going to do it.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:32:29


I believe the developers of Lightning have already said a block size increase will re required in order to achieve full implementation.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:39:30
When do I do that?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:58:49
Kind of strange that you can't just spot a Segwit transaction by using a Blockchain browser.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:25:15
It needs to be accepted SOMEWHERE to have value.  The list of places accepting is growing shorter.  This scaling problem needed to be fixed LAST YEAR.
I find it funny that a lot of the core developers, and even Adam Back were in favor of a block size increase to 4 MB, followed by a doubling to 8 MB not too long ago.  The sometime last year, it suddenly became super important to use sidechains to fix the scaling problem and leave the block size alone.  WTF can't we do both?
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:39:21
So, I set up a side channel between me and my friend.  We have no other side channels created with anyone else.  I can freely spend my BTCs with ANYONE on the Lightning network?  How does that work?
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:03:39
Doesn't matter if it is  or is not a bad name.  It's not the proper name.  You guys get all bent out of shape when "the other side" calls it SegwitCoin, or CoreCoin.  I don't do that.  I calk it Bitcoin or BCH. 
The only reason to use bcash is as an insult.  If you believe anything different, then you're lying to yourself.  Just use BCH.  It's shorter and easier to type than bcash.  But, of course, BCH doesn't piss anyone off, so you're not going to use it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:03:18
I really want to see actual transactions and not estimates.  So far, not finding lower fees with Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:09:21
The whole Lightning network is a giant federation of sidechains.
I REALLY hope Lightning succeeds, because if it doesn't it will take every crypto with it and pretty destroy what a lot of people were trying to hard to achieve, which is bankless peer to peer transactions.
Bitcoin has the opportunity to change the world.  It's slowly losing that power.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:30:54
So the answer is not yes and no. It's no.   You must establish a side chain AND fund it. If you use another merchant and there is no peer to peer route through side hai S, you'll need to open another side chain and fund it. 
Welcome to the age of Biycoin banking. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:10:07
Doesn't really matter.  The Bitcoin Cash community finds it offensive.  So, it should not be used.


They can believe what they want to believe.  This is not the first time that the Bitcoin name was used in another cryptocurrency.  This is, however, the first time a Bitcoin fork has been *successful*.
I think that's the bigger issue with Bitcoin zealots/purists.  Someone forked Bitcoin, solved an existing problem, and was successful.
You may disagree with it, but that doesn't give you the right to rename it at your whim.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:25:38

@_date: 2018-01-03 01:02:10
They seem unwilling to do that.  Which is reason enough not to use it.  No one here is using bcash because it's easier or better.  They're using it because it pisses of Bitcoin Cash people, simple and sweet.  It's petty.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:37:55

@_date: 2018-01-08 02:55:13
Correct.  I was.  It's clear to me from that article that Bitcoin is not and never has been money.  However, it used to be currency.  It's failing at the right now and since there is no money of any kind backing Bitcoin, it needs to get it's shit together as a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:02:22
Why should they?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:50:33
I find it funny that you acknowledge there is a mempool problem, with slow transactions and high fees, and then proceed to shit on Roger Ver, who decided to back the coin that actually tried to fix the congestion and high fee problems, when the solution in front of everyone's face was summarily rejected.
Roger Ver was very clear that he wanted Segwit 2X, and if it did not activate, then he was going all in on Bitcoin Cash.
Segwit 2X did not activate, and he went all in on Bitcoin Cash.
Segwit 2X would have provided significant relief to the existing problems Bitcoin is having.  Instead everyone wore their NO2X hats and screamed Segwit.  The Bitcoin reference platform doesn't support Segwit.  How do you expect others to support it, when it's own backers won't do so?
Get your own house in order before you go shitting on someone else's house.
I hope Bitcoin gets it's act together, and soon.  Because what happens here is going to drag the whole crypto market along with it.

Vendors are other users.  And as more and more vendors stop accepting Bitcoin, the number of "other users" is dying, because no one is USING Bitcoin.  In order to USE a currency, you need to SPEND IT.  If you hold it, it's an investment.  Investments are backed by something tangible.  Bitcoin is not.


It is invalidated as a currency outside of the EU.  It's only use in the US or Russian or China is a store of value in currency trading.


It does not.  But it lowers fees and transaction times.  With lower fees and times, people are more likely to stay in the ecosystem.  If you, as a retailer can accept Bitcoin and then use that Bitcoin to buy goods from a wholesaler, who in turn uses those same Bitcoins to buy product from a manufacturer, who buys his raw parts in Bitcoin, then we'll see a price stabilization.  Until then, it's always going to be a rollercoaster.  We need to get Bitcoin used up and down the supply chain.  We were on our way to doing that until it became way to expensive to move Bitcoin.


Segwit made it safe to implement Lightning.  As a side benefit, it increased the block size through some magic that doesn't increase the block size.  And adoption of it has been piss pore.  And Segwit transactions are not as low or fast as things were when we didn't have a scaling issue with full blocks, so in my opinion it was not the proper solution.  Segwit 2X probably would have helped a great deal, but everyone went apeshit over the idea, and it was left to one guy to try and figure out.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:53:11


It's not about who's using the core wallet.  It's about the fact that it's a reference implementation that others use to build their code.  If the Core developers have not implemented Segwit in the GUI, because they want to make sure they get it right, then why the **** would I trust any wallet with Segwit in it.  I would call that "not ready for prime time."


Such as?  Isn't their job to maintain the protocol and write the reference implementation.  As a non-profit, I don't believe they're supposed to make a profit.  Lead by example.  Add Segwit to the GUI.

Pretty obvious.  Otherwise we would have had Segwit 2X.  Big blocks may not be the answer.  But they're most definitely the band aid.  Better that, than the mess we're in now.  With the Segwit soft fork, everyone is free to just ignore Segwit.  With a block size hard fork, everyone HAS TO upgrade.

For all intents and purposes, LTC is a BTC testbed now.  They implemented Segwit first.  And I believe they're going to implement Lightning way ahead of BTC.  Charlie Lee has also been a very vocal supporter of Core on twitter.  I don't think you'll find Litecoin hate here.
And Roger Ver could have been a strong ally to BTC.  But he made it perfectly clear that he was a backer of Segwit 2X and he was going all BCH if Segwit 2X failed.  We were all warned.
Perhaps Core needs a PR department, so they can get on CNBC too.

Coinbase implemented Bitcoin Cash, because it was profitable to do so.  They announced their plans months ago and said that it would be implemented by 1/1/2018.  Well, they met their promise.  From discussions with developers, Segwit is not easy to implement.


Of course this is a huge problem.  I know I don't want to pay people from the command line.


How do you know that?  Have you asked them?  Perhaps toured their facility?

Well, the thing that altcoins have that Bitcoin does not is low fees and fast transaction times.  So, if your goal is to use an altcoin like fiat and be able to buys stuff with it, then you need to look around and see what altcoins are being accepted in the placed you shop at.
At the places I shop at with with crypto, they have dropped Bitcoin and have not offered another altcoin payment option.  I like the idea behind Bitcoin Cash, but I'm waiting to see if that or Etherium or one of the other coins becomes the default crypto of choice.
Right now, I can't spend the Bitcoins that I have.  So I won't be buying any more crypto till I see who actually captures the p2p payment market Bitcoin abandoned.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:39:54
I don't understand how spamming could possibly be beneficial now.  There is such a backlog of transactions that you don't need to spam in order to be able to charge high fees.

There is nothing "serious" about this.  People fork software all the time for philosophical reasons and proceed to to bash the previous software.  It's not illegal or serious.  Get over yourself.


You realize that has already been debunked.


You know what's going to lead to oversight?  The bubble crash that will happen when people realize that the only thing giving Bitcoin value is it's ability to be used as a currency.  It's not backed by a government.  It's not backed by a commodity.  It's not backed by a company that makes a profit.  The ONLY thing that made Bitcoin worth anything was that I could take a picture of a QR code and send someone 10 BTC anywhere on the planet for pennies.  Well, you can't do that any more.  The reckoning will happen when people figure that out.  Then the mass exodus will happen, BTC will crash, taking all of cryptro with it, and we'll have more government regulation than you can shake a stick at.
Fix the backlog and fee problem and fix it six months ago, or the banks win.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:44:26
It's not about coffee.  It's about every purchase they do, from food to clothing to seeds.  Bitcoin enables anyone to become a business without needing to open a bank account.  You simply have a wallet on your phone and you can accepts or make them.
In posts you see made by Satoshi and other early Bitcoin pioneers, the belief was that there would be no transaction fees until every last coin was mined.  Prior to that, the mining was all the reward miners should expect.
[Heck, even Adam Back once wanted an immediate block size increase to 2 MB, followed by 4 MB 2 years later, and then 8 MB 2 years after that.](
Bitcoin used to allow people to start a business without needing to go through government regulation and opening a bank account.  You just make some stuff and people scan your QR code and pay you.  You don't need to deal with change.  There is no physical money that someone can steal by breaking into your house.

What we're really seeing is a test now to see if bigger blocks or Lightning is the better solution.

The joys of open source crypto currency is the freedom to fork.  If you don't want that, then perhaps you need to close the source, and pick a new name you can trademark.
The best way to "solve" this problem is to rename Bitcoin to something trademarked, and do a massive marketing blitz to let people know the new name.
Hounding exchanges to list cryptocurrencies by incorrect names is not the way to do it.  That just causes more confusion.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:17:20
I agree.  I'v been a regular buyer and spender for the last 4-5 years.  You can't spend it anymore, so why have it.  I cashed out last week.  I see no point to cashing in again till the vendors I used to use once again support some kind of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:27:47
Then perhaps they should have waited to implement it in the blockchain until they were ready for it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:43:37
Yes it is very hard to understand.  There's currently a very large backlog of transactions.  You can simply jack prices up by accepting existing transactions without needing to spam.
173K unconfirmed transactions.  That a lot of money to be made.  Every time you spam a transaction, you basically pay yourself or a pool you're in collusion with the transaction fee.  That's money lost.  Why would you do such a thing when you can simply fill the whole block with giant backlog and make a hell of a lot more money.
If this is really happening, this isn't miners being greedy.  It's just them being stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:18:24
It's not HIS coin.  Roger hasn't coded a single line of code for Bitcoin Cash.


This statement is completely true.  I can't use my Bitcoin for anything.  I haven't been able to actually spend it anywhere since about June.


*Right.*  That's reason is went up to 20K AFTER Roger went all in on BCH.


Please post proof of collusion.  Stop with the conspiracy theories already.


He doesn't need to do that.  Just go try and spend it and you'll learn the coin is doing that to itself.

Bitcoin Cash increased the block size from 1 MB to 8 MB (for now) to help with congestion.  Bitcoin decided to use a different path, deploying Segwit and working towards Lightning Network.
The block size increase seems to have worked for Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin is opposed to a block size increase
The belief on the Bitcoin side is that Segwit+Lightning will offer greater benefit to transaction time and cost than a block size increase will.
The issues we face is:
1. Bitcoin Cash's transaction volume is much lower than Bitcoin, so there is no way to know if a block size increase would be as beneficial for BTC as it was for BCH.  So, the bigger block obviously worked for BCH, but it's affect on the BTC blockchain is unknown.
2. Lightning Network is probably a year away, so we don't know what it's long term affect will be on price and speed once it's deployed.  The only thing we do know is that's new tech that has never been tried before.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:45:07

Bullshit.  This is neither world changing, nor needing sides.  There are tons of cryptocurrencies out there to pick from.  If one fails, everyone will hop onto the next one.  Bitcoin COULD have been world changing, but that moment has passed.  Bitcoin has been warped into an investment instead of a currency.
I'm waiting for one to settle down as actual day to day cash that can be used as the currency of the future.  I thought Bitcoin was going to be that solution.  Then fees went up and suddenly it turned into a "store of value."  No one can use Bitcoin for day to day transactions these days.
I love how people are starting to "cash out" to pay off their houses.  More power to them.  But the sad part is, they're cashing out into fiat.  The goal should be to pay off their mortgage IN BITCOIN and not convert to USD or some other fiat currency.

@_date: 2017-12-21 20:43:55
Not OP, but most definitely denying that.
Stop blaming all of BTCs problems on Roger Ver and company.  There's plenty of baggage on this side of the fence.  You don't need to blame BCH for the current shortcomings of BTC.
Low Segwit adoption is a real issue.  Doesn't help that the reference wallet doesn't even support it.
You can HODL all you want (WTF is HODL anyway?), but the only thing that gives Bitcoin value is your ability to spend it and move it to other people anywhere on the globe in minutes.  There is no commodity or government backing bitcoin.  It's 100% faith.  As soon as all these armchair investors figure that out, expect the price to come down as everyone unloads.
The price is not going up because of you and me.  It's going up because the 2010s equivalent of the 90s day trader is sitting there and buying and dumping as fast as they can.  This is exactly like the stock market crash of the late 90s, when the dot-com bubble burst.  The fact that no one can see that kind of boggles my mind.

Again technology changes.  Function does not.
So, what you're telling me is that, if I want a day to day, decentralized electronic cash system, Bitcoin is not my answer.
The scary analogy you make here is that the incandescent light bulb and steam engine were replaced by better technologies that still serve the same function, and the incandescent bulb and steam engine died off and are not in use any more.
In that analogy, perhaps Bitcoin has become obsolete then, and it's time to look to another solution for decentralized peer to peer cash.

@_date: 2018-08-03 01:36:43
The list of what's not scary is far shorter for me.
1. Lightning is going to need a DNS like service to help find routes through the network.  Whi's going to run this service.
2. Lightning hubs are just another name for Bitcoin banks.
3. You can't just scan a QR code and pay someone on lightning.  You need to open a channel, then fund it, then find a route, then you can pay someone.  Lightning might work as a great solution for recurring payments to the same vendor.  But good luck using it to buy coffee when you're travelling on business in a foreign city at a store you've never shopped at before.
4. It is needlessly complicated.  If you want to solve the scaling problem with a second layer, then scrap this mess and come up with a real solution.
5. Every hop along the route needs to be able to fully fund your transaction.  So, if you want to pay merchant A 1 BTC, but the only way to get there without opening a channel is going to user A then B then C, and each of them only have 0.1 BTC, your payment will fail.
6. Each hop can also charge a fee for the use of their channel.  If you need to make a bunch of hops, you could potentially pay multiple fees in order to transact.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:51:46
The Bitcoin Gold webpage says right on it "Make Bitcoin decentralized again."  They're not quiet about it at all.  The only difference is timing.  Bitcoin Cash forked right when things were about to get to their worse.  Trying to buy stuff in the summer of 2017 was insane.  I had a 48 hour confirmation time.
Unlike Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Cash said they were going to fix Bitcoin right when Bitcoin needed fixing.  So they got a shitload of press attention and media attention.  The others said they were going to fix Bitcoin when there was no noticeable problem yet.
This really is all about timing.  Having Roger Ver on your side also helps.  But it would not have been even close to as helpful as the fact the Bitcoin was almost unusable as a currency in the second half of 2017.

It's kind of hard to present things "honestly" when alpha level software is being used and has low adoption and we don't know if I am right or you are right.  We'll see how things look 5 years from now.  I would love to be wrong.  But having worked in the financial sector now for 13 years, I clearly see how Lightning is the greatest thing to ever happen to Bitcoin for the world banking industry.
But that's the great thing about crypto.  There are plenty of coins to choose from.  Pick the one you like.
The big issue is that BTC is the anchor.  What happens here affects every other coin out there, not just Bitcoin Cash, but EVERY other coin.  It BTC fails, then the rest of crypto goes down with it.  It's market share is too great, and the steps it's taking are, in my opinion, the wrong direction.
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:05:31
I disagree.
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:53:56
When did I say I wasn't a Bitcoin Cash supporter?
I'm a supporter of whatever technology spurs crypto adoption.
The important thing is that crypto surpasses fiat in use.  Which crypto does it is really irrelevant.  That's up to the market to decide.  I'd be perfectly happy to use Dogecoin if the market decides that.
Right now, I think Bitcoin Cash is in a better position that Bitcoin to help achieve that goal.  But only the market will decide that.
In the meantime, I keep buying and spending.
The real question for everyone is, what's more important?  Crypto adoption or Bitcoin adoption?  If the market picked Monero tomorrow, would you cash out and go home, or would you use Monero?
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:02:18

Show me some documented cases of people buying Bitcoin Cash "by accident."


The ticker symbol for Bitcoin Cash is BCH.  Always has been.  Always will be.  No one has EVER tried to use BTC to define Bitcoin Cash.  Stop exaggerating.


You're convinced Bitcoin Cash is a scam.  I'm convinced that Lightning is a scam.  Roger Ver isn't helping matters much with his stupidity.  And Adam Back is being just as much an idiot.

So, you will them admit that it makes sense to own Bitcoin Cash, since your original comment was.


@_date: 2018-08-21 22:50:51


You obviously have amnesia about 2017.  When I wait 48 hours for ONE confirmation and pay a transaction fee equal to 1/3 of my purchase, I consider that to be unusable.  When it's cheaper to use fiat than it is Bitcoin, we had a problem.


They're not squatting.  Ver and Co. have owned that domain for quite a long time.  Everyone seems to completely forget that Ver was a huge backer of Segwit 2X and announced publicly if Segwit 2X fails, he's backing Bitcoin Cash.  But selective amnesia seems to sink in all the time.
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:08:02
Be careful what you wish for.  The Lighting roadmap at some point , requires a Bitcoin hard fork to increase the  block size beyond what Segwit can offer.
This exchange is basically showing an unwillingness to update their software because of a hard fork.  I wonder how old their BTC software is.  Do they even support Segwit?
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:21:04


Bitcoin used to have no network fees at one point.  Then 2017 happened.  Now people claim fees are reasonable.  But the original vision was that fees should show up until mining no longer has a block reward.


That is my exact point/  Lightning will become centralized because of this.

I look at Bitcoin much like Catholicism.  At some point in the distant past, there was The Church.  Then in 1054 there was the Great Schism, and we got two halves of a whole: The Roman Catholic Church, and The Eastern Orthodox Church.  Both Churches try to claim they are the true Church founded Jesus himself.
The same thing happened with Bitcoin.  We now have two halves of a whole.  We have BTC and BCH both trying to claim they're the "Real Bitcoin."  They share the same Genesis Block.  Their roots are from the same whitepaper.  And they both claim to follow Satoshi's vision.  Two halves of a whole.  Two approaches to try and solve the same problem.
Unfortunately Nakamoto is no longer here to tell us who took the right path.  So, it's up to the market to figure it out.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:18:23


You made the claim.  You should back it up.  I should not have to do your work for you.


There's a story behind that.  But I doubt you care.


And here is the root of the problem.  BITCOIN IS NOT AN INVESTMENT.  It's a currency.  Start treating it like one.  I don't invest.  I SPEND.  I buy Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash and then SPEND IT ON STUFF.  All you hodlers are worthless and doing nothing to spurn BTC or BCH adoption.

I know Kuban at one point had a Ukrainian population well over 50% under the Russian empire, but under the Soviets, and especially during the holodomor, a large part of that population died out.  The remaining Ukrainians were so few and far in-between, that after a generation or two, they just integrated into the Russian population and lost their ethnic identity.

Bitcoin Core is the software repository on Github run by the Bitcoin Core developers.

It's as silly and childish as using bcash.  I would hope people could be better than this.
Personally, I refer to them as BTC and BCH.  It's short and faster.  and faster.  And before you ask, yes, I used USD instead of US Dollar all the time when I type and have casual conversations with people.

Wholeheartedly agree.
TBH, I think Bitcoin Cash should change it's name.  But not because of any kind of issue with consumer confusion.  I want a name change to something simpler.  Bitcoin is short, sweet, and easy to say.  Bitcoin Cash is not.  One of the Original names floated for Bitcoin back in 2008-2009 before the Whitepaper was released was BitCash.  I think that would make a good short sweet name.

What people are proclaiming is that it's finally the year of the Linux Desktop.  Not Linux itself.
The big issue I see with people is no one wants two of something.  People don't use two word processors.  They usually don't keep their money in two banks.  I don't think the average person is going to want to deal in two different currencies.  If you're in the bitcoin ecosystem, things are instantaneous.  It's the conversion to and from government fiat currencies that there is often a bottleneck, especially in the US.
In the US, if I want to buy Bitcoins, I need to go through Coindesk, if I want to do a EFT.  Coinbase is by no means fast.  My first purchase took days to complete and was initially denied as high risk, and I had to send them an email.
If people can't convert bitcoins to USD and vice versa, as easily as a transfer between bank accounts, people won't be interested.

It would be nice if Paypal let you specify the terms of the sale, so you can set a refund window.  3 months is unreasonable.
I sold an iPod through a work bulletin board and the person that bought it tried to file a complaint 2 MONTHS later with me that the iPod NEVER worked.  I told her to kiss off.  She called HR.  HR told her all sales on the corporate intranet were private.  She raised a stink.  The classified section was taken down permanently over the incident.
I like the idea of escrow.  You put your bitcoins in a trusted neutral third party and YOU, as the seller, set the terms.  If the other person disputes within the agreed upon window, then you ask for the merchandise back.  If it's not returned in a reasonable amount of time, then the funds get released to you and we move on.
Paypal is way too buyer friendly.  There are plenty of ways to make it more neutral.  Problem is, it's tightly coupled with eBay.  I don't know if their TOS allows you to use another payment method.

I think one of the problems here is that you look at Bitcoin as an investment opportunity.  Do you currently invest regularly in foreign currencies?  If you don't, they why invest in Bitcoin?
To me, the whole point of Bitcoin is to eventually stay completely in the ecosystem.  I collect stamps for fun.  I do a lot of purchases on eBay. If eBay took bitcoins, I would do all my buying and selling using Bitcoins and never even think about "cashing out."
When I buy goods on Amazon or any other site, I don't compare the sale price of the items against their value in other currencies.  I compare it in the same currency on other sites.
To me, Bitcoin is not an investment opportunity.  It's an economic ecosystem that hopefully will continue to grow and I can live in permanently.

From what I read, Ukraine seems to be a little more "free" than Russia.  At least it did prior to the war.  it's my understanding that Russia still filters Internet access, and almost all media (press, TV, etc) are all state controlled.  Up until this mess, I was under the impression that Ukraine did not do that, or did it far less than it's neighbor did.

They can dismantle tomorrow.  But their authority ends there.  They have no authrity to tell it what to do.  Why do you think Ron Paul was fighting so hard to audit the fed?  Cause Congress has no control of it.

They were created by Congress as a private bank outside of Congressional jurisdiction.

You were cut off because a bank did a risk benefit analysis and determined that the risk to buying Bitcoin is too high, since people are buying Bitcoin on credit in order to flip it when the price goes up.  It's really no different than a bank denying your use of a credit card to do an overseas transaction because of risk.
I collect stamps.  My TD card will NOT allow me buy stamps from the post office in Ukraine.  My Capital One card will.
This has zero to do with  whether you use the credit card as a passthrough and what the bank considers to be high risk and what their fraud insurance requires of them.
Luckily, we have multiple banks to pick from, so get another card and move on with your life.
This has nothing to do with Wells Fargo hating Bitcoin and everything to do with Bitcoin day traders and hodlers.
Everyone was talking about Bitcoin being an "investment" and "store of value."  This is the end result.  You can't buy stocks or bonds with a credit card.  You usually can't buy foreign currency with a credit card either.
They're certainly not going to let you buy BTC with a credit card, not when a bunch of people probably maxed their credit cards out when the price was $19K and had the value tumble to half of that in under 2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:12:11


Those businesses disguise themselves as legitimate businesses for credit card purchases.


Then don't use them.  That's what localbitcoins.com is for.
Whining that you hate banks so much and then trying to use their credit cards and bank accounts to buy Bitcoin kind of defeats your attempt at banks going bankrupt, does it not?


I have not.  That's why I switched to a credit union.  Like I said before, plenty of banks around.  Find one that will let you use their card to buy BTC.


This needs some explaining.


Not anymore.  At least not in the US.  There are various regulations in place that can get a bank shut down if they don't report any transaction that's over $10K to the federal government.
A lot of drug dealers are now using Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency, since it provide more security than carrying around briefcases full of money.
You distrust of banks stems from a distrust of CENTRAL BANKS, such as Federal Reserve, which is well warranted.  Even huge banks like Citibank and Chase you have reasons to suspect.  But there are plenty of local community banks, credit unions and savings and loans than don't engage in shady crap.
That being said, I look forward to the day when crypto is on a level footing with fiat and competing with banks.
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:10:08
When you bought at 19K, your "investment" is at a low point right.  Luckily, I never hold onto Bitcoin long enough for this to be an issue.  I usually spend it within a couple of weeks and replenish.
But even holding onto Bitcoin for 2-3 weeks can have serious negative consequences.
I look forward to the day when Bitcoin is not compared to the USD, but to gold or oil.

Probably.  But, in general, people are doing really stupid shit like maxing out credit cards, mortgaging their house and using student loan money to buy Bitcoin.
Crypto is first foremost a CURRENCY.  If you wouldn't normally invest in another currency like, say the Euro or the Yen, then you probably shouldn't "invest" in Bitcoin.  If you want to buy some Bitcoin and go spend it, go crazy.

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:23:49

@_date: 2017-11-11 02:40:30
Why not do both.  Larger blocks fix the immediate need.  Layers solve the long term need.  Seems silly to hold the block size hostage, when it is the solution that has been used every other time this issue has come up.

"Redditor for 1 week."
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:57:10
So laws of computer technology allows Segwit to increase the block size without needing to hard fork?  It does not.  The block is still 1 MB.  That was not changed.  Segwit simply removed the signature from the block, allowing it to carry more transactions.
Show me the Github commit that actually increases the block size?
I am not a "big blocker."  I'm just pointing out that the block size is still 1 MB.  If you activate Segwit on your node, then you can take advantage of it.
From Wikipedia:


Nowhere in that description does it say that the actual transaction block was increased.
Segwit is no better a solution than an hard for block size increase (unless you think a soft-fork is better).  However, Segwit is needed for Lightning Network, since Lightning Network is unsafe without it.
So, if your end result is to make sure you can enable Lightning network, then you have no choice but to go with Segwit.
The real debate here is on-chain scaling vs off-chain scaling.  There's room for both.  Hence why BTC and BCH exist.  Now that both solutions are out there, we'll let the free market decide which solution works best.
I wish the BTC guys all the success in the world.  Both sides need to realize got what they wanted and move on with their lives.
I'm curious to see where this all stands 1 year from now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:53:47
The original block size was 250K.  It was later raised to 750K and then to 1 MB.  The only difference now is that a block size increase requires a hard fork, due to limits in the software. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:42:45
The debate here is always going to be big blockers vs Bitcoin segwit.  Any link provided by the Segwit folks will always be from segwit supporting sources and vice versa.
We know exactly what Segwit will do, since we have deployed it.  And the only thing I have seen are merchants I used to use Bitcoin with temporarily suspending Bitcoin use.  And the ones that don't, I have not seen any decrease in fees.
So, for me at least, Segwit has not helped the situation.
Historically, when the soft limit has been raised, it has helped congestion.  The issue now is that we've maxed out the soft limit and if we want to go higher, we need to hard fork now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:24:51
So, the my statement stands correct.  There is still a 1 MB block size limit.  Segwit did not increase the block size.  It worked around the block size.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:31:54
Do you seriously have any proof for any of this?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:34:16
So, right now, I can make a 1.5 MB block without Segwit and it will happilyu get processed by miners?
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:28:39

The bch guys will come out of the woodwork calling you a "core shill."
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:56:05


We need a short term fix.  And a block size increase is a tried and tested solution that has worked before.  Alleviate the immediate congestion with the solution that has always worked in the past and then finish and deploy your long term solution.


Do you have idea how fast you can move a 2 MB or even a 10 MB block?  Internet speeds are much faster than they were years ago.  The difference between moving a 1 MB block and a say, 5 MB block is so small to be nonexistent.
Increase the block size to address the immediate need and work on long term solutions when you have some breathing space.
And micro-transactions are never going to happen as long as the price bounces around the way it has.  Bitcoin needs to become the cash of the world, not the gold of the world.  It needs to be the currency of choice, and not the investment of choice.


Why not?  Full nodes are a thing of the past with sidechains anyway.  Just because the block size is bigger, that does not mean that all of the sudden transaction volume will increase.  There is no good reason not to do a block size increase now, followed by a long term solution that isn't even ready.


I guess that's my problem.  Bitcoin was never envisioned as a settlement layer.  It was envisioned as a transaction layer.  Does that mean that it can't evolve?  No, it does not.  But that doesn't mean you hold the blocksize hostage while you're working on your new solution.
I know the BCH guys have a pretty large block size now, and they obviously envision Bitcoin as forever being a transaction layer.  Meanwhile, the BTC guys envision things as a settlement layer.  There is room for both solutions.  Hence why both solutions exist.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:47:50
The problem with Bitcoin right now is the lack of good retail ecosystem.  The price of goods is still translated in BTC -&gt; USD -&gt; Price of good.
So every time we see a price adjustment in Bitcoin in relation to the US Dollar, the amount BTC needed to buy something changes.  This makes the sale of goods in BTC a risky proposition, when there is not value stability.
People need to get in the ecosystem and STAY in the ecosystem.  Instead of thinking how much value your Bitcoin has in relation to the local fiat currency, you need to look at how much value Bitcoin has in relation to good and services.  That's will happen when the price stabilizes, and that's when Bitcoin wins.
The enemy of Bitcoin is not BCH, or any other hard fork.  The enemy is fiat.

That means that transactions would happen outside the blockchain and be fed back in as one big transaction.  I don't know if I like that.  One of the nice things about the BlockChain is that all transactions are publicly accessible.  It's like a giant public audit trail.

And therein lies the problem.  If Bitcoin was a currency before it was a store of value, then this problem would seriously be mitigated.  By turning it into an investment, this is now the new reality.
I think fees of cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are significantly lower than Visa/Mastercard fees are.  If consumers knew that, they'd probably be more interested in spending crypto instead of fiat.  But credit card fees are hidden from the consumer and only exposed to the merchant.  Same with Paypal fees.  So people don't have a clue.

I agree that a second layer solution, as opposed to a block size increase is a bad idea.
I don't agree with referring to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin.
I think that's the only thing he's getting wrong.

I like the IDEA.  And that's the whole point here.  Bitcoin is an IDEA.  if you want to achieve this end goal, you need to look beyond Bitcoin and look at crypto in general.  If Lightning doesn't achieve what is expected, then the IDEA of Bitcoin is far more important that BTC itself.
If the goals you listed are better achieved with LTC, Ethereum, BCH, or even Dogecoin, the community needs to realize the support of the idea is more important than the support of the ticker symbol.
Support BTC all you want.  But keep up on what all the cryptos are doing as objectively as possible.  Keep the idea alive, no matter which coin the end users pick.

Everyone seems to forget that before Blockstream came along, Rover Ver was a Bitcoin hero.  He made a lot of money off BTC and evangelized it every chance he got.  There's a reason he got the nickname "Bitcoin Jesus."
But Bitcoin went in a direction that Ver did not like.  He went his own separate way.  That happens.  We live in a capitalist free market, not a dictatorship.

You know, without Lightning, there is no need for Square.  You can already store a wallet on your phone and just put up a QR code for someone to scan.

You know, I like Roger Ver.  And I have no issue with Bitcoin Cash.  But if they're going to call Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, they need to call Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin in idea, but not Bitcoin in name.  That name is already taken.  I get that they believe that the Bitcoin name was "hijacked" and morphed into something they don't think fits with the "Bitcoin vision."  But saying stuff like "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin" is just silly.

I think they take things a bit too far when it comes to propaganda sometimes.  Do I think Bitcoin Cash is closer to the Whitepaper?  Yes.  Do I think Lightning is a complicated disaster?  Yes.  But I think the BCH side of things needs to focus on improving the product and not hijacking the brand.  Instead of constantly saying "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin" it would be much better if they said something like "Bitcoin Cash - Taking Bitcoin Back To It's Roots" or "Bitcoin Cash - On Chain Scaling and Retail Adoption."
Bitcoin's recognition as a brand name is huge.  Hijacking that will just never work.  Focus on technical superiority.  Admit you're a fork of the original product with a different mission from Bitcoin and move on with your day.
I get where Ver is coming from.  He spent a LOT of time evangelizing the Bitcoin brand.  And he wanted it to take over the world.  He wanted adoption in third world countries, and small mom and pop businesses to be able to do transactions off their phone without a bank.
At some point that vision was lost by the core developers.  The fee problem was outsourced to Lightning, rather than fixed by Core and rhetoric started about Bitcoin being a "store of value" and not a day to day currency.
His dreams were crushed when Segwit 2X failed and he moved to the on chain scaling solution that he wanted.
Which he's allowed to do.  But coincidentally, he happened to own bitcoin.com and the  twitter account.  Roger Ver was Bitcoin's biggest fan at one time.
I think, to the people that scream "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin," Bitcoin is more an idea than a product.  And I get that argument, but I disagree with it.
I fully expect Lightning to be a huge hot mess.  But at the same time I really hope it isn't.  I wish them all the luck in the world and I hope Lightning works out.

If Lightning fails, Bitcoin fails as a currency.  That is blatantly obvious.  The ONLY thing keeping fees in check right now is low usage.  If people start USING Bitcoin again, fees will go up.
Your whole post is a huge wall of crap by the way.   You're basically saying that it's OK for crypto to take over the world, as long as that crypto is Bitcoin as defined by the Bitcoin reference client developed by Bitcoin Core.  If any other crypto wins, then we've lost.  Which is complete BS.
And what exactly is your beef with Dogecoin?  It exists.  It has value.  It may not be the crypto for you, but it's obviously the crypto for someone.  If, by some miracle it becomes the dominant coin, you'd better be ready to support it.

The sad part is this has been a problem for quite a while now.  And no one seems to want to fix it.  People have been proposing solutions for YEARS and they've been ignored.  And the ones that are implemented are so ridiculously complicated to code for, that it takes forever to roll them out.
The best way to controls fees is through user adoption and spending.  The US dollar fluctuates on a daily basis.  But the 20 oz coke at my 7-11 is always $1.79.  That's because 7-11 get dollars from you to buy the coke.  They use your dollars to buy the coke from the company.  And the company uses dollars to buy their ingredients.  That's where we need to get to.  We need crypto inserted throughout the whole supply chain as payment options.
Once crypto becomes a true competing currency to fiat, then the price will stabilize.  How do you get there?  You make it easy to spend.  Something should have been done YEARS ago about the current fee and backlog issue.  People were talking about this being a problem as far back as 2015, and the only one that did anything about it was Gavin Andersen, and they basically outcoded him and forced his commit out.

But the business doesn't need to dedicate the processing power to confirm a transaction internally.  They can just record it in a database.

I am not confused.  I have owned Bitcoin since probably as far back as 2010.  As much as you may believe in your own bitcoin philosophy that there is only one "Bitcoin," there is not.
And you just proved my point with your post.  This all has nothing to do with block size, or segwit, or anything else.
This is all about control.  All about who gets to call themselves "Bitcoin."  Because than name has more value than anything right now.
Ask anyone on the street right now what Bitcoin is, and they'll tell you they've heard of it.  Ask them what Litecoin is and they'll ask you "Is that like Bitcoin?" and ask them what Etherium is and you'll get a "Never heard of it."
You can preach all you want about one side being an "altcoin" and the other side preaching that you're the "altcoin."  None of it matters.  We're looking at 2 solutions to the same problem:  transactions taking forever to complete and costing a fortune.
Both solutions have proven that fees can be lowered and transactions can be sped up using their solution.  Now it's just the fight for the name.
Side 1:  Miners are evil and trying to steal the name Bitcoin

I don't really care about exchanges.  I care about bitcoin to bitcoin transfers.  Sounds to me from what I am reading that Lightning will allow transactions to occur on sidechains, and only the end results of those transactions will be merged into the main blockchain.  So, I could be in a siechain with someone and swap BTC back and forth for a week, and only the end results of that sidechain will be added to the blockchain.  Correct me if I am wrong.


Can't even make a civil post, can you?  Every time bitcoin has reached a capacity limit in the past, the block size has been increased.  For some reason, this time it's a bad idea.  I don't follow the logic behind why in 2017 it's a bad idea, but in past it was fine.  I don't have any stake in either BTC or BCH.  I just don't understand the need for Segwit+ Lightning as opposed to a size increase.  I've done my research and I don't get it.
And, I'm not buying any Bitcoin until after Segwit 2X plays out.  I own no BCASH.  I just don't see Segwit and Lightning as a good idea.  The last time I use Bitcoin to pay for something, the fees were so high, I cancelled the transaction.
So, I'm just sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see what happens.

I understand all this.  None of the money you spend of receive on Lightning "exists" till you settle on the Blockchain.  This is how Lightning is designed.  It a payment layer designed to minimize the number of on chain transactions someone has to do to help minimize fees by allowing you to do as many transactions as you want and then settle them on the Blockchain with one transaction.  No Bitcoin actually changes hands till the settlement happens.
I know you will argue that this is not true, but for all intents and purposes it is true.  That's why it's a layer two network.  The real money is at the first layer.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:18:15

The idea that stuff can happen in a sidechain and those transactions will not be added to the main blockchain (other than the final outcome of those transactions) kinda bothers me.
I know that there have cases in the past where the entire blockchain was rolled back because of people exploiting bugs.  How would a rollback like that work in a world with transaction taking place in sidechains that are not part of the public ledger.
Purely from a consumer standpoint, I used to use Bitcoin and see transactions clear in minutes.  When I tried to use it earlier this year, prior to Segwit, my transactions would take overnight to clear.
If, as LukeJr claims, blocks are too large now, then there was no need for Segregated Witness.  Yet, here we are with 2 Bitcoins offering two different "solutions" to the block size problem.
Both sides of this argument are stretching the truth a lot.  I don't think the "Let the best Bitcoin win" argument is valid either.  Because the best Bitcoin won't win.  They'll both survive.  The real fight here is over who gets to use the name "Bitcoin."   That name alone has a LOT of value to whoever controls it.  And that is the real fight here.  Who gets to use the name Bitcoin going forward.  This is all really about marketing more than anything else.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:18:16


This remains to be seen.  We have NO idea how the Lightning network fee structure is going to shake out..  Obviously more hope will cost more, so minimizing hops by using a Lightning hub should be a cost saving, unless the hub is the only route with sufficient capital to complete your transaction.


So you think Bitpay is doing this on purpose to get people to use BCH instead?  That's kind of a stretch.  Do you have any proof Bitpay is inflating the transaction price?

This is both merchant and consumer friendly.  I think it's a bigger crime that most wallets don't support it, than the fact that Bitpay is forcing it.
If you don't like it, vote with your wallet and go to merchants that don't use Bitpay.  It's a free market.

Fees are charged when you attempt to USE bitcoin.  There is no fee to HAVE bitcoin.  Investment houses require you make so many trades a month or they charge you a fee just to hold your stocks and/or bonds.  And of course with each trade, you get charged a fee also.
Even credit card transactions charge a fee.  The only difference there is that the merchant usually pays the cost, and that cost is factored into the price of the goods you are buying.  That's why some places offer a "cash discount."
Bitcoin fees can be significantly lower than bank fees.  Especially if you need to send money overseas.  And Bitcoin fees are a hell of lot cheaper than money orders, bank checks or other forms of guaranteed funds.  And for all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is guaranteed funds.  When you send bitcoin, you're not sending a check, which is just a promise, you're sending actual bitcoins.  It's like walking up to someone and handing them cash.

There are alternatives to Bitpay and there are businesses that use them.  No one is forcing you to use Bitpay.
BIP-70 is a Really Good Idea™ that was proposed WAY BACK in 2013.  You'd think developers would have said, WAY BACK IN  2013 "Hey, this is a really good idea.  Let me implement this,"

Bitpay is a private company and they can do whatever they want.  You can choose to shop at a store that doesn't use Bitpay.  Then, when they see a loss revenue, perhaps they'll change their software.

As a PSA, it's a fair point.  But this thread devoled pretty quickly into "Bitpay sucks" and the "taint of Roger Ver" and other nonsense.  Bitpay is a business that sees a solution to cutting down on the number of times it needs to do refund and chose to implement it.  This will save them money.
But businesses need to decided how many times they've had to deal with a refund because someone fat fingered something, unless Bitpay abstracts that from the merchant.  If that's the case, then it would be in Bitpay's best interest to make that information known.
But I think just bitching that Bitpay is forcing BIP-70 is only part of the solution.  BIP-70 is wonderful idea.  We should also be encouraging wallet makers to implement BIP-70 ASAP.
In a perfect world. the merchant would put up 2 QR codes.  Your phone scans them both.  If it sees the BIP-70 address, it ignores the other one and uses that.  The problem there, I don't know if non BIP-70 wallets will ignore the BIP-70 address and use the other one.  That might be worth testing.

How are most transaction already not on this chain?


This is where I have a problem.  Bitcoin never promised privacy.  It promised anonymity.  If you want true transactional privacy then you need to design something new from the ground up with privacy in mind and not hijack Bitcoin by adding Segwit and sidechains.
It's 2017.  With the cost of storage, current Internet speeds, and CPU power available to the average consumer, I don't see the point to throwing all this extra crap on top of the blockchain.
But then again that's why Bitcoin Cash exists.  If you want to use a traditional blockchain without sidechains and Segwit, there's a cryptocurrency you can hop right onto.
That's the beauty of the situation.  If you don't like Segwit and Lightning, then go get yourself some BCH.  If you think the current incarnation of Core is doing a bang-up job, then hang around.
I fail to see the point of one side constantly bashing the other side.  Pick the coin with the philosophy you like and move on with your life.

If Lightning takes off and actually does what it claims it does,  I don't see why Bitcoin Cash would not consider adopting it.
Funny part is Lightning, at some point, is going to require a larger block size hard fork.  I've seen that mentioned quite a number of times on Lightning discussions.  But the roadmap seems to be to get Lightning to a point where it's widely adopted before they choose to go that route.


Maleability was fixed in BIP-63 and then again in BIP-66, and BIP-141 claims that that their maleability fix fixes a problem with the one in BIP-63.  But there is no technical detail around whether the fix in BIP-141 is only needed by Segwit, or if non-Segwit blockchains will also experience the issue.
I guess I just want to know more than what the documentation has in it.

Have I unloaded any FUD?  I have not.  I've just watched 3 different YouTube videos abut Lightning and they all said that Lightning without Segwit is "unsafe" or "dangerous" and they never bothered to explain why.
So, I want to know.  If you don't want to help explain, the move along.  Obviously you don't understand the technical details behind how Bitcoin operates other than parroting "Segwit good.  Big block bad."  Well, I actually want to LEARN SOMETHING.  Heaven forbid people have an open mind and try to educate themselves.
Of course the next question is, is the maleability fix introduced in BIP -141 something other cryptos that DO NOT use Segwit such as Bitcoin Cash (or any of the others out there) need to worry about, or is the specific maleability fix in BIP-141 something that is only required because of Lightning.  Other than Segwit, BIP-141 obviously fixes a problem.  But does it fix a problem created by Segwit (which is fine.  Better to fix it at implementation, rather than find out later down the road), or does it fix a problem that currently exists in other blockchains.  If that issue exists in other blockchain, can it be fixed without Segwit?  Meaning is the maleability issue present in other blockchains correctable without implementing Segwit?

You are seriously dense.
So anyone that even slightly questions the narrative is an automatic Bitcoin Cash shill?!
Seriosuly.  Calm the f*ck down.
Now seriously.  Lightning IS going to require a hard fork block size increase.  That's in the road map.  How is a block size increase done 1 or 2 years from now not going to centralize nodes the way everyone fears Bitcoin Cash will?


This is genuine question and NOT at attempt to shill.  Are things being put in place to make large block mining "safer" in the future than it is now with how Bitcoin Cash went about it?  If they are, what are those things and where can I read about them?


Isn't that kind of what Segwit 2X was trying to do?  Gradually increase the block size when congestion was at it's worst?  Yeah, I know that Segwit 2X was a big cluster**** when it activated.  But that was really because no one was working on it but one guy.  Had some core developers helped the guy out, I think it could have been a success.


They really are not.  None of the core developers are in any way involved in Lightning.  There are three independent groups involved in Lightning development right now, and they're basically all just coding the white paper in different languages.  Core didn't even come up with Segwit.  That was a third party in Asia.


This could very well be the case.  But isn't it great that we have two different coins right now that have taken different approaches to the same problem?  3-5 years from now, we'll see which approach was the better one, based on which coin the market has chosen to abandon.  Bitcoin has always had Litecoin to test future technologies, such as Segwit and Lightning.  But no one has tried a larger block before.  I'm curious to see how it will play out.  Big Blocks could be the answer.  Or they could be a disaster.  That's for the market to decide.
To be honest, there isn't a single thing in your comments that hasn't been parroted by dozens of other people in this subreddit.  Do you truly understand how this technology works at a technical level, enough to make informed decisions, or do you just follow the crowd and say "Big blocks bad, Segwit good."
I COMPLETELY admit that I am in favor of a block size increase over an off chain solution such as Lightning.  I think it's needlessly complicated.  But that doesn't automagically make me a bcash shill.  There are lots of other cryptos out there that don't plan to deploy Segwit or Lightning.  None of the other coins out there have a transaction volume that would justify deploying either Segwit or Lightning.  TBH, I'm not really sure why Litecoin even did it.

Have a nice day.
Your anger over Bitcoin Cash reveals where the real problem lies.
I've been actively using Bitcoin since 2010.  I don't have an agenda.  And you're totally clueless.


There is ZERO proof of this, because big blocks have NEVER been tried before, except in the early days of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Cash it the first attempt to expand the block beyond 1 MB.  Whether it works or not **IS YET TO BE PROVEN!**  Don't go preaching the big block gospel like it's some kind of scientifically proven absolute.
You're obviously young and naive, so I won't bother refuting anything you have said.
Get the last word in, and then block me please.

There is no grounds for a lawsuit anyway.  No one owns the trademark or copyright on Bitcoin.  Only the trademark/copyright owner can file a suit like this.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:30:22
Whether it was a setback or not, I'm curious how not activating Segwit would have affected lightning.  Lightning has been in development for how long now?  Was there a plan B in case Segwit did not activate?
And Segwit is really a soft-fork in name only.  Any non-Segwit client cannot see any signature data in a Segwit block.  Signature data is kinda of important.
It's impossible for a non-Segwit client to do anything with a Segwit block really.  Soft-forks typically add new features while remaining backwards compatible.  This one actually took away features.  The only reason it's soft fork is because you're still allowing non-Segwit blocks.  It's not because the old clients can do anything with Segwit blocks.

This is complete bullshit.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:14:54
My point is that:
1. Big blocks are required for Lightning
2. Big blocks are bad because they cause centralization of mining.
Pick a narrative and go with it already.  If big blocks are bad, why would you create and roll out a solution that requires big blocks?
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:21:11
The fact that everyone is not using it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:36:02
This looks like it was fixed in BIP 66, and not in Segwit, which is BIP 141.

Their blog pretty clearly states why.  They're sick and tired of having to issue refunds all the time for people miskeying information.  This way the QR code has the wallet address and amount and all you is scan and pay.
Sounds to me like it makes the whole shopping experience even easier.
I get that BIP-70 isn't supported by everyone.  But it really sounds like it should be.  Has it been up for a consensus vote?  What happened with that vote?
Doesn't sound like it's a change to the Blockchain in any way.  Still uses a Bitcoin address.  Just automates how the wallet works and interprets an address.
TBH, this seems like a win-win for everyone.  Making Bitcoin easier to spend should be everyone's goal.  BIP-70 was proposed back in 2013.  There should have been a consensus vote and full adoption years ago.

They make 2 small deposits into your account.  After the transactions are done, you need to log in and verify the amount of those transactions and the date.  Proves you own the account you set up for ACH.

Why do ACH transfers still take "a few days" in 2015?  This stuff should be instant.
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:44:07
So, ACHs still take 3-4 business days, but with CHECK21 laws, you can cash a check within hours.
Seems like I should be able to write a check to someone these days and take a picture of it and email or upload.  They can use that image to make a deposit.
Wait, this sounds like an interesting test.  I should try this and see how fast someone gets their money.
I've noticed that when I pay my Visa bill online now, my statement comes with a check image that was generated by my credit card.  I wonder if this is already being done on the backend instead of ACH because it's faster.

The problem is, Coinbase is the only service I know of that will let you buy bitcoins, doing an ACH transfer from a US bank.
Most other services require you wire money to a foreign bank, with has significant fees associated with it.  Right now, I am buying bitcoins from coinbase in small quantities, and transferring them to my blockchain wallet as soon as they clear.

At this point, I'm just throwing in a little bit of cash, so I can make Bitcoin payments if I need to.  I won't be willing to dump a lot of money in there, unless a big player like Amazon lets me use Bitcoins.
If Amazon accepted Bitcoins, that would be a MAJOR game changer.

My bigger concern is, what happens when the US Government or some other authority seizes the domain.  How do I get to my bitcoins?

@_date: 2013-08-23 02:15:36
My concern was I placed the order to buy when they were $98 for one Bitcoin.  When I checked today, they were are $110, so I thought they cancelled it because they were afraid they'd lose money on the transaction.
@_date: 2013-09-05 16:24:14
So, just for speed of transactions, you can create a Coinbase wallet and blockchain wallet and just transfer from one to the other?
