But if there are no databases already, how can a palm vein scan be used to identify that the user is the registered owner? Am I missing a key point here?
Also, I've never been to an ATM that required anything more than a card and a PIN. But then, I'm based in Norway, so things could be different. Do ATMs in USA usually require this kind of security?

No, the private key is generated in the Trezor device, and can never leave it (you do get a seed for later restoration if necessary). That's the beauty of it. To sign something (most commonly a transaction), you send the unsigned data to the device, the device asks for a pin and confirmation, and the device sends the signed data back to the computer, which can then publish it.
The only potential problem I see with this is if your device breaks and you can't get a new one (sold out, out of business, etc), you may have trouble restoring your private key from the backed up seed. However, from what I understand most (all?) of the source code is freely available, so it should be possible to create a program to do just this.
Disclaimer: I have no hands-on experience with Trezor, and my understanding of it may or may not be correct.

If you're comfortable with IRC, then  might be a good option for finding someone to trade with. There's a signup process to complete if you want to participate in their trust system, but as I recall it doesn't require anything other than a nickname and either an OpenPGP key or a bitcoin address.

Dissolving it first is also good security practice, in case anyone is evesdropping on the pipes. It makes unauthorized reassembly so much more difficult.

Surely he would have noticed their fingerprints being way off if they were signed by somebody else.

At least it will give them realistic expectations.

What's to prevent the Tails developers from modifying Electrum to create predictable wallets, that they can then wipe at will? As long as they only put the change in the published binary blob and keep the source code private, I think it's unlikely that anybody would figure it out any time soon. Even when such changes are published in source code, it can still take a very long time for people to notice, as we saw with the Debian SSH incident.

As others have said, this is obviously a phishing attempt. It appears to be hosted by web-hosting.com (which appears to be connected to namecheap.com). I've sent an email to web-hosting.com to let them know. Hopefully they'll shut it down soon.

Shouldn't the address be prefixed with "bitcoin:"?
Tested an [online decoder]( where it comes out as 1K3NUCmoBPGhrdFzwYAiKLHCAbKr5sEXRe. But QR codes made with  include "the bitcoin:" prefix, like [this one]( [(decoded)](
