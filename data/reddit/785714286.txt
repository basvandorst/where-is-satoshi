a salary is not a pension.

Snowden lost a lot of credibility when he started becoming a zcash shill. If he really wanted to promote a crypto  except for bitcoin should would be monero, not some pre-mined bullshit.

That's a lot of mental gymnastics to try to disprove the analogy and it still doesn't really address my point.

So are governments that finance themselves and their weapon making buddies to wage war to kill *millions* of people for no reason. 
But you just keep on "recycling" your single use Starbucks coffee cup there amigo, you're making a real difference.

Well done reddit, we've established both causes contributed to his death. Lets chalk this one down as case closed and hit the showers.

People on 2 dollars a day can keep using dogecoin or whatever you crypto you prefer. There's far more people in the world whose entire pension is around 10k mark. With Bitcoin they  can now save that instead of it being diluted by governments. Bitcoin can't be all things to all people. Theres no reason to put something worth the price of a starbucks coffee on a globalised ledger. Being the gold standard store of value when it stabalises (which it will when its big enough) is fine by me.

People didn't start using craiglist to drive the newspaper industry out of business. They started using craigslist because it was a more efficient way of doing what they needed to do.

Anything premined or unminable. Then only those with specific utility.

Starbucks coffee tastes like shit. It's FAR worse than McDonalds. How anyone drinks that fucking muck is beyond me.

In my opinion that's good enough. If the pension that you've worked your entire life to save for is being melted away to nothing by a corrupt government, the transaction fees are worth it.

I wouldn't say that at all.

Thanks for this, it reminds me to check the price.

The good thing about life is that you don't need to know about how injectors and differential work to use a car on a daily basis. The same for crypto, once the experts are giving you good information you can typically rely on that.

You guys are fucking losers, this same shit has been asked since bitcoin was 6$

Duh. If the world wakes up with a 30% slide on the petro dollar you can be sure BTC springs to 100k easily.

You're missing the forest for the trees. Clothes are so cheap they are disposable and not worth talking about.

This is mistitled. Its the printer that is the weak link in the chain here, not the paper wallet software.
