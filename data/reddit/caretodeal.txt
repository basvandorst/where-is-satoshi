and look at the "Final" section in that post. he has nofollowed link to r/bitcoin while link to R/btc is normal. small detail but still.
(those red dots are because of a plugin that highlights nofollow link)

Yeah, this is the actual tax exemption limit for a male in India. If you earn below this limit in a financial year, then there is no need to file income tax.

No, police officers there are very nice. Atmost, they will shot you.

If one exchanges/deposits more than 250000 rupees into his bank account, then he will receive a tax notice to show the source of his income.

First, you should improve the UI of your retarded Android app. It looks like the HTML websites of 90s. Even a 5 year old can design a better UI. Second, I registered on the app a week ago and completed the verification process. But I haven't received my wallet address. How am I supposed to receive the Bitcoins. Whenever I click on the Address button, it gives me an error. Third, make a website please. It is so obvious.

That was a BS survey. The survey was conducted on Modi App. How many poor Indians use smartphones and those who own smartphones, how many of them use Modi app. Less than a million people participated in the survey compared to the population of 1.25 billion. You can do the math.

Usually, I lose about 16% or less (average is 14% approx). I don't pick-up any order that cost me more than 16%. I check the site 3-5 times a day. Luckily, sometimes I find an order with just 12% off.
Recently, I found that I am getting more money upon exchanging my BTCs for INR on Unocoin. Like, I accepted a purse.io order of $70 and earned $60 worth of Bitcoins. Now, upon selling these $60 worth of Bits on Unocoin, I get $68-72 in Indian Rupees. This has happened since last 1 month. I sold Bitcoins 2 times in last 30 days, at one time I got $8 extra and at another time I got $10 extra in INR. I have sold Bits before too, but it never happened to me before. Earlier, I used to get same amount of INRs upon selling my Bits.

You are not dumb. These idiots never purchased anything on steam thru Bitcoin. Hence, ignorance.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:17:31
Yeah. There are like 1.3 billion.

He is not wrong actually. Steam uses Bitpay as middleman. and it adds its own (apart from the normal bitcoin network fee) ridiculously high fee on each purchase. If you don't believe, just go and check it.
