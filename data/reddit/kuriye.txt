I've used Overstock twice now with bitcoins. First was a sweet hot pink spinner luggage and the second was Raybans for my SO as a gift. Shipping was faster than expected in both cases. I normally never shop there, but it the price is competitive and they accept btc, I'll choose Overstock every time.

I don't think you can "quantify" a characteristic like trustworthiness, which is in itself a "qualitative" attribute. But if you're new to the game and not sure who to trust, start by searching this sub and also r/bitcoinmarkets for terms like "CampBX" and "Coinsetter" and "Insert Exchange Here" to see how people have discussed them and relatively how long they've been around and part of this subreddit's attention. Look for trends and don't trust the word of any one individual regarding where to deposit your money.

It took them one extra day to deposit mine as well. Mine was also a $4000 transaction. When I've sold during quiet times with them, it's also taken an extra day. I'm beginning to think it's a lag on the banking end of things and not Coinbase. At least for this specific issue.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:52:02
Not really. With Coinbase instant purchase you can click "Buy" and have BTC in your wallet within 2 seconds. That's a lot more powerful than LBC.com.

Coinbase is a private company. Only angels and venture capitalists can invest at this point. Individuals can't buy in. Unless you're a high net worth individual angel investor. 
If/When Coinbase goes public, you could buy stock shares on an established exchange. But sure as hell not with bitcoins. They're still a regular old United States corporation, so they have to play by the same rules as any other business, bitcoins or no.

If the "97" in your username is an indication of your age (15), be careful, young one. Watch the trends, read articles and projections from independent sources, and learn about risks. $200 is an awful lot for a teen to lose by buying BTC without the proper research. Be smart and good luck!

I guess I just wanted to summarize a lot of the issues we've been seeing over the last 72 hours and inspire some conversation here :/
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:54:15
I agree. Once they get through the "growing pains" that increased attention and interest brings, I think they'll be a leading source of BTC buy/sell (broker, not exchange). I've been using them since July of this year and they've been really reliable for me and they have a presence here on this subreddit. Simple interface, secure 2FA, and timely/reliable deposits to my bank account.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:13:50
Lol. Totally. Not everyone is the same. And I'm sure there's a huge demographic spread over all bitcoin users. But I have a feeling the spread is similar to the Reddit user base. Lots of young-ish, male-dominated, college educated folks. Except Reddit doesn't have an economic component, so I'm sure that doesn't compare at all.
General bitcoin knowledge and ability to navigate and utilize the technology at this stage in the game hasn't reached Grandma levels of saturation.

People gravitate to the larger exchanges because there's a semblance of safety in numbers. If everyone is using Bitstamp, they're less likely to take your money and run. It sucks, but I would want to see wider adoption of these fringe exchanges before I transferred serious dollars into them. So much chatter of fly-by-night services just turning off the lights and peacing out with everyone's coins. It's the Wild Wild West of investing and finance.

Yeesh. They said you can use other docs for proof, like insurance bills or tax-related docs. Do you have any official shit like that coming to your residence? I'm sure you've looked into all of this if you have $5k locked up with them.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:30:29
I think all investing is a gamble really. No one knows how the market will behave. I'm not a professional Wall Street suit, but I'm an educated adult taking a calculated risk on a concept/product I believe has merit. And I made $764 last week doing so :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:44:14
I'm definitely not a "pro", lol. My bitcoins are mostly stashed away in cold storage for the long-term, but I'm enjoying "playing" the markets with all this recent volatility and making a buck here and there with a few coins for fun.
Back in April I was just holding. Didn't really get caught up in the madness.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:24:28
I'm not familiar with BitQuick.co, but I'll check it out. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:18
Just FYI: People can and do *invest in currency*. They're not mutually exclusive. It's not something new that bitcoin introduced. It happens everyday with fiat and existing currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:25:29
Yeah, it takes a little while to get established with Coinbase to get full privileges. It's just their policies. Can't really say more than that.

Fellow lady bitcoiner checking in. We do exist :) I think we just fly under the radar because gender discussions don't really come up often. Everyone just *assumes* that they're talking to another male.

I'm not a n00b jumping in for the first time as soon as BTC gets hot from media attention. I've been around for a while and am just commenting on the recent activity. I'm happy to hold my coins, but I'd also like the exchanges to be working properly during times of flurry so that I can act if I want to.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:54:31
Ehh, one man's opinion. 
I kind of like the theoretical ideal of the Silk Road. I'm a totally normal, professionally successful 20-something, and on the rare occasion, like to do drugs in the privacy of my home with my SO. Silk Road was a safe and reliable process for this. And the decisions and consequences of engaging in this behavior were my own. 
But I could do without all the "murder for hire" nonsense. 
Anyway, I won't get too philosophical. And I agree that Silk Road should probably stay in the shadows if we want a cooperative government and widespread gen pop adoption of btc.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:32:04
It's an exchange of ideas, not coins :)
The organizer, Paul, also sets up speaker events and occasionally brings in fairly well known btc industry people. He gets downvoted to shit in r/austin. But then again, who doesn't? That place is so trollish and cynical. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:04:29
Coinbase is still honoring sales. You can establish account and push the BTC over there. It's a great site to be on anyways!

"Bad Actors"
You sound like the Senate hearing earlier this week.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:16:54
I think the community as a whole believes that over the long-term, BTC will rise *quite a bit* - exact value this time next year unknown, but likely higher than today. No, you're not going to be able to buy in at $10 like  the early adopters did. But that's just how it is. Those people took a big risk investing in something that nobody was sure of at that time. And now they reap the rewards. Will you be an overnight millionaire? No. Can you still make some serious cash by holding for the long-term? TOTALLY.
Evalulate the risk, watch the charts, and determine your financial stablility/position and *buy some BTC*. But don't wait forever for a significant price drop that may never come. You'll be kicking yourself the next time around. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:01:46
Buy cheap BTC now.
Hold it for 1 month.
Exchange goes back up.
Buy on SR.
Discount drugz?? Hooray!!

I appreciate your anecdote. When you look at the entire community, it seems that Bitstamp hasn't been as reliable as your experience proves. As I'm writing this, I got stuck on a Captcha screen when I navigated to Bitstamp.net. So its performance is still very iffy. When I'm dealing with $5k, $10k, $15k, I'm hoping for a little more confidence in their performance. 
Like another user offered: Growing Pains.

I'm in Austin, Texas - a *very* bitcoin friendly area. There's actually a bitcoin meetup tonight!
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:30:30
**What my logical brain understands:**
 There's no way to know what will happen in the next few hours/days/weeks/etc. Play it smart. Play it conservative.
**What I just did over the last 5 minutes as BTC jumped $20:**
Ran around the couch, told my SO to prepare the caffeinated beverages, and held in my pee because I'm glued to my laptop and can't be troubled with going to the bathroom at the moment.
This is a lot of fun to watch :D

I specified US traders because those are the exchanges I've been interacting with and can speak to the positives/negatives. Apparently btc-e and other EU exchanges are doing well, but Americans have a harder time gaining access to those. I guess I could have opened it up to a global audience, but it seems that EU still has options, where US is floundering a little right now with increased traffic.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:51:48
I'm not on the inside at Coinbase, so I don't know the true answer. But yesterday the "max daily limit" message would pop up occasionally and then disappear occasionally. Today it's been pretty solidly up since 9AM CST. I think as coins flow in, their stocks are replenished? Just sharing some speculation. I would continue to check because you could grab some coins if the message comes down. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:42:43
I don't know if I would say regulation of the exchanges has been "excessive" at this point in the game. It does hamper anonymity, but the government hasn't really stepped in with any oppressive regulation that would change the way bitcoin inherently operates. And I think financial institutions are wary to fully support bitcoin at this early stage, so we're seeing some friction from some of the bigger players like Chase and BofA. Bitcoin really rattles the system, so it's expected that these early days of integration won't be smooth sailing.
I think most of the troubles as of late, the ones I described, are problems that the exchanges themselves need to remedy (mostly related to high traffic and buying interest). Like another user offered: Growing Pains.
I think the testimony from the Senate committee hearing yesterday shows that the government folks recognize bitcoin is going to be a major player and popular consumer/merchant choice. They're just trying to proceed with caution to cover their asses.

You should probably post this in [r/austinjobs]( It's just going to get lost here in the deluge of noob posts. Also, no names or resumes? Only contact you through yopmail? Wtf. Sounds ultra sketch.

Based on my assumption regarding the majority Bitcoin demographic:
Late 20s / Early 30s
Tech savvy, intelligent, college educated Millennials
Few or no children
TONS of disposable, discretionary income
Pretty sure there are a lot of folks who fit this profile and are putting their cash into btc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:34:42
Stop what? **Coinbase has been out of BTC all day**. Not sure what fantasy land you're living in. 
I've been logging on regularly to check the status of the buy option: [Screenshot from 1 min ago]( They've been maxed out all morning.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:47:32
I agree. I do have a cache of coins in a "savings wallet" of sorts. But I'm also quite interested in dabbling in a little trading. I feel disconnected/disenfranchised from the stock market and BTC trading is kind of fun to play around with and discuss with my IRL and online communities :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:19:12
I think I remember seeing you over in [r/austin]( If you're a local, you should check out the Bitcoin meetups that happen weekly on Tuesdays. They're usually at Central Market on N. Lamar, but tonight it's at Scholz Garten near the Capitol at 7PM. It's a mix of business-minded, technology savvy btc enthusiasts that chat about projects, startups, and btc commerce. I wanted to attend tonight, but had a schedule conflict.
