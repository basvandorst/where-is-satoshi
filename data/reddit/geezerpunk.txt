Any luck getting my ID verified?

I am still relatively new to crypto currencies. I purchase everything I buy thru Coinbase (their 7 day delay for bank purchases and a $300 weekly limit on credit card is pretty frustrating) is there a better alternative for buying BTC?

Can anyone help me with a new wallet? I do a lot of BTC buying and selling so I need a wallet that will allow US residents to purchase BTC. Currently using Coinbase but they continue to delay transactions and increase their rates and unfortunately blockchain doesn't allow US residents to purchase BTC

Are there any sites besides Coinbase and Gemini that allow Us Citizens to buy BTC? Not a fan of Coinbase anymore and Gemini is taking forever to validate my identity.

Has anyone had any success getting their identification verified on Gemini?  It's been 5 days now since I registered and submitted my ID. I've opened up a few tickets as well and no responses.. is it just me?

Does anyone have a wallet I can use to actually purchase Bitcoin on thru my bank that doesn't have a 7 day waiting period? Coinbase takes 7 days for a wire transfer and that doesn't seem right... I am a US Citizen so that eliminates BlockChain

I've been trying to get on Gemini, they've been verifying my identity for a week now. I'm guessing they're swamped with requests... I tried opening a ticket as well but never heard back. Do they have a phone number?
