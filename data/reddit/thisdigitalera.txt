Hehe...... still waiting for my Honda to trade in for that lambo y’all promised me...

Why thank you kindly!

Store them. In a safe place where absolutely no person, or thing now that we have A.I. can take that away from you.  It is called a safe. I don’t store my guns at the bank because that would be pointless!  Have I proved my point yet.  Let the crypto community decide. I tried to answer your question in your post.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:11:10
No, trying to figure that out now.

I would do every other letter two off from where it started and start your own Harry Potter trip down a puzzle of the unfortunate events of limity smicketts. Or how ever that mess is spelled.

Well, I just did!!! If you are involved in crypto with any sort of history you would know that it was developed for the obfuscation of funds and to tell the banks (like J.P. Mutha fucking Morgan and his seized boat with drugs to fuck off! ) Why are we paying to smuggle drugs in a centralized system when we can spend our “funds” where ever we want and our fees for said transactions won’t go to centralized illegal processes and if they do we hope they are paying their “due taxes” on money spent and earned  instead of the biggest drug bust, (which would also follow in suit for biggest drug traffickers)in American history regarding one of the biggest banks in this country.  
For those of us that don’t pay our taxes and want to refute and disregard any govt control over money, well then you behind the times my friend because they exist and have existed for a long time. They are called corporations! The govts around the world are scared, even better the globalist (often sad lonely mutha fuckers who also own banks and transport drugs as far as we know but also allegedly rape and abuse children) (depending on which article you are reading and who’s kool aid you drank) get away with child rape and murder. Are opiates a problem, cocaine that was or was not imported by the CIA your problem, is weed a problem? The answer is yes no matter where it comes from and why would you trust your bank to hold your funds, your social security card, and especially your keys??? CSW just proved my case to you in court as he “cannot access funds” until said date due to the nature of investment you are inquiring about, so if you do not have proper justification for your nonsense besides saying that you are quite possibly a bumbling idiot banking on a bank or a dumb fuck with his beer in his hand than I politely ask you to ask better questions or stop where you are and look in the mirror and if you don’t understand what I just stated then politely, and preferably quietly, shove your thumb up your ass and take a spin instead of sticking it up someone else’s looking for answers to solve the worlds problems from someone hitchhiking through the galaxy without a big screen and surround sound.  Does that answer your nonsensical question of existenialism. Have a good day sir! May the crypto get with you and hopefully run stronger on day then the thumb up your ass.

They make fire safes for your closet. That’s my suggestion for all of this as a third party service. Buy a safe from third party company and store that stuff inside with a back up at your disinters hoise so she has the keys with very little know how and a note in technicolor explaining how to turn on your tv....

That’s the best comment I have seen in a long time.... laughing my ass off on the crapper with reddit material. Thanks!

I also mean this in no way to be mean or malicious but possibly an eye opening. The banks are the biggest problem in this world besides the people that control them.  If you can’t see this then I ask why are you here in this community in the first place besides enlightenment? If that didn’t enlighten and possibly offend you slightly, (which was my goal so you might see the light at the end of the tunnel), then what is? What are you asking for? Why put your money and or keys into an institutionalized “company” that is 99 percent against what you are doing. That’s not safe!!!! Hard coins with a binary code or something that only you hold is one thing. Safety deposit box is a whole different monster to deal with. The irs and govt running scared atm.

You’re joking right???? Not really??? Fml URDumb!
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:42:50
Not always true. That’s an ignorant statement as the masse haven’t adopted and many don’t even know how to use a computer. I tried to get my tips from someone with no avail. We need to dumb it down to the masses. (I also mined crypto and many others things and that tip thing on reddit was a nightmare)
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:23:27
You hit the button on the keyboard with that one...lmao.  I can see it now. “Mom, make me a sandwich...  Bitcoin just tanked again so I will be late on rent... again”   “Mom, do you accept crypto for rent. I have some shit coins I was thinking about selling off..”

Same thing happened to me from a famous person I. Crypto community a year or so ago. Identical rhetoric and they kept in contact with me for weeks from famous persons account. Couldn’t believe it. Left a reddit post to warn people of such nonsense. Glad you got through to the “idiot” and fucked him with a charitable cause

How do I like your post twice?? So stupid it’s good, and also amazing at the same time. Must be quantum computing happening here. Time travel could be real if only...

Fuck that dumb shit blow hard politically biased fuck bag of sheep shit!

I run my rig that I purchased for 1700 bucks a couple years ago in a house with horrible insulation. If my mining rig goes down I wake up extra cold and know I need to go fire her back up. Guessing it raises the temp of my house about 8-10 degrees. Power cost is less than what it would cost for propane stove running in living room which is over $300/month.  Just saving it like I would in my savings account and holding on for dear life to also support tech I believe in. That one on top of post is much more sexy though. Every home should have one. Fuck giant mining farms that ruined it for all of us and scams like BCN.  Cheers
