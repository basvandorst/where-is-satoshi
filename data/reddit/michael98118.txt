AML = Anti Money Laundering.
The government lets you place the ATM on their land, they sure as hell aren't going to let "terrorists" use it to finance their operations. 
The way that governments control/affect each other in the 21st century is control the flow of money/aid/etc. 
"Economic sanctions" is the formal word for this

Filing in Washington as a Money Transmitter isn't a lot of money. I had 2 different law firms weigh in.
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:21:11
It jump started my dreams of investing. It gave me the money to fund some things I wanted to do. (ATM + Rental Properties). 
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:17:42
Oh shit
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:36:52
A reasonable request. I don't have it. My lawyer did all that work and told me about it after the fact

It became stagnant after 1200 and I got bored. I also wanted to invest in other things to diversify.

It's free. Just a lot of paperwork and talking with state regulators. The US Govt has an online form you submit, each state manually processes them (takes 2+ weeks to process your application).
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:56:41
True, hence why I'm trying to find places online that Seattle residents can use it

Thanks for the reply.
There are 3 types of users.
* Religious: More power to the people! More secure! 
* Investors: I buy low/sell high!
* Regulars: I want to buy more time on Xbox.
I want to specifically target the Regulars.

Unfortunately I'm using a 3rd party service and do not have control over the UI.
Account creation/management is a large problem area for us and we lose many users over this.

Users who have never heard of Bitcoin aren't really concerned about the price. I think it's more about curiosity. Once they move larger volumes then the percentage matters.
Think about it. A person will "dabble" with Bitcoin by putting in $50. They aren't going to bat an eye about a $5 charge.
I'm more concerned about answering: Why should they care about Bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:57:23
The ATM is a lower barrier of entry than connecting your bank account. Cash in and done. It's easier to dabble.

I replied but haven't heard from you. Just double checking that we're in the clear.

The pipe is too small. It does not support a high enough transaction/second rate.
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:06:34
Or another reason: some software doesn't apply the "appropriate" fee.
@_date: 2016-11-22 22:16:44
That looks pretty backlogged: 
I understand the "nothing to see here, move along" concept that you're conveying. I disagree with your conclusion.
It shouldn't be "so hard" / "so expensive" to get transactions confirmed. The pipes seem a bit too small. Raising tx fee's is only a solution for some of us and it's only temporary. As more and more tx get backlogged, fee's could skyrocket. 
At the end of the day, you could be "right" but Bitcoin will still "lose" as people transition to a better tuned coin. It's Bitcoin's game to lose.

Yea, I believe there is some ruleset for dropping. I don't know it, though I'm sure it can be found online. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:10:33
I hate to say this... seriously I'm a true believer since 2011...
Bitcoin Cash (while morally corrupt and an obvious scam) seems to have what Bitcoin is currently lacking: reasonable scalability and performance.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:11:56
Awesome, that's exactly the search term I needed. Thanks!

Bitpay didn’t do anything wrong. Their UI doesn’t show a REAL TIME warning. It is a UI choice to preempt the inevitable issues drawn from a random/inefficient/ineffective blockchain. 
Bitcoin suffers from random and explosive fees due to random transaction load, all trying to fit into a small fixed size block.
It’s not Bitpay. You’re blaming the messenger.
@_date: 2016-02-21 10:17:31
It's for a customer of mine. I'm using Bitcore Wallet Client
I don't see a way to set the fee
@_date: 2016-02-22 01:06:38
I'm glad that your business is succeeding!
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:08:03
You should be able to buy Bitcoin. If it doesn't work for you, give our 1800 number a call (1 (800) 944-3405) . Or call me directly. I'll PM you my phone number per request.
You can't sell Bitcoin yet, we're working on that. Need to make the current service 100% stable first.

Hey guys, I'm Michael. I work on those machines. 
We have been working day/night for the past 30 days to write new ATM software. I made the decision to build off of the Lamassu solution instead of going with an off-the-shelf solution. That decision has caused us a few days of downtime last week. 
On one hand, I'm super sorry for the fallout of that decision. I'm sorry that the supply of coins in Seattle has been impacted. We've been talking with a lot of customers over the past week and getting a feel for how critical Bitcoin has become in their life.
On the other hand, I'm excited about where we're at. We threw out the Robocoin software, which provided zero visibility (is our ATM up? I don't know...), and replaced it with solutions that we can build a company on. For the network guys, we have things such as VNC, Nagios, and pm2 setup. I have a large TV with the real-time stats and actual visibility into what's happening. We get slack events for server/machine state. It's coming together.
To give you some insight on what we've had to deal with, we've custom rolled our own ID scanning solution, custom wrote our own linux drivers to deal with the hardware (giving out cash, taking in cash), had to peel back the many layers of Lamassu technical debt, and designed/built a bitcoin wallet ( from scratch. (Yes, I had to learn EmberJS and Bitcore in 20 days). No one here is full-time. So we've been doing 6pm - 3am for the past 30 days. We're working super hard, because we believe in it.
Things are changing for the better. 
We've been refunding customers during this transition time. I know it doesn't sound like much, but at every step we've chosen to err on the side of the customer.
I don't know who made this post, but I hope your experience with our support has been A+. 
Because the thing I tell my team over and over again is: We're not trying to make money. We're trying to change the world.
