Bra da, fortell meg når det skjer.

Anenome5 put it quite succinctly:
"Well, I think you've miscalculated. I didn't just come here to piss on your parade but to say you're simply not offering enough to generate excitement.
You toss out things like people getting 100% of the mining profits and 0% pool fee--naturally since you've already cut to the bone on price per gigahash.
What you probably should've done is be less slippery and done a regular group-buy and group-share with realistic pricing and brought people along for the ride. But you couldn't have obtained 1,000 btc that way.
But that doesn't mean you aren't still competing with those kinds of deals. 1,000 btc can buy a lot of shares in an actual group-buy, where people will be paying very close to $19 / gh, so you're simply pricing yourself out of the market by asking people to pay your costs up-front.
If you were offering shares in future revenue from the miners bought with 1,000 btc explicitly, that would be something else, but you're not. Miners get to give you 1k btc and then only receive another terahash of mining.
That's not how investment works. If we buy your 1kbtc machines, we should be profit-sharing in them. So the fact that you're not doing that makes it seem very suspect, like a regular stock-scam. And you don't even mention trust issues. Are you even offering escrow. Nope.
I just think it's an ill-conceived plan designed such that you, the operator, benefit disproportionately to everyone else involved, and that's not going to fly. "

Oops, sorry man, not my intention!

Admittedly, the username's a warning sign.

Very informative, thanks :)

So if they won't ship devices in December....does this mean if you pre-ordered at a time landing you at a place in the queue where your delivery would have been in December, you just don't get anything? What? If so, they just wiped themselves off the map, seriously.

It's good to hear not everyone got screwed over by them. I must admit, the level of suck described in the review is outlandish and couldn't possibly be an everyday scenario or they would be long gone. (I hope)

It would take me a day or two to build a website identical to yours and register my name on Reddit advertising the exact same product and make a killing (particularly considering how your product looks identical to BFL, though using the same manufacturer you can offer them at much cheaper prices?). There has to be more proof before anyone jumps on this, please tell me people aren't buying this without asking for more proof.
If you offer escrow, then I'm buying all your stock :p

Cool, thanks!
