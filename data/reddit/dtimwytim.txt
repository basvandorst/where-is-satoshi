This is ridiculous.  It's bad when they're down, and good when they're up, as if the music will ever end, and we'll know if they won or not.  They can either assume they don't know Overstock's motivations entirely, or they can just point out when they're low, or high, when those reports suit their agenda.

Congrats to ShapeShift!
Is there any concern that bringing a ShapeShift app to iOS/Android will make for perhaps a greater potential for coin coloring than there is w/o it?

This is an example of why I think it's too early for the promise of decentralized crypto to be recognized.
Ask yourself truly how many people it would take to corrupt bitcoin.  Maybe 5?  Let's pretend it's 50.  Anyone think that's safe?
As long as this subreddit is relevant, and influential, CC is in trouble.  We're trying to achieve something with one hand tied behind our backs.  At the very least, we need a decentralized, p2p, forum, &amp; github, immediately.  Without it, we're kidding ourselves.

I don't see why they'd ever want to.  It's much more valuable as an intel gathering tool.  Since the exchanges do what they want them to anyway, neither the value, or the users, will likely be much of a problem.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:34:51
Unless, of course, that is where we are being lead.  That is my point.  Perhaps it is, and perhaps it isn't.  Whatever can be corrupted, will be corrupted.  We need to secure these needless points of vulnerability.

I listed a car on CL for trade for 6 BTC, or a few other things. Every call I received were from people who were confused, and kept asking for a dollar amount.  After a half dozen or so calls, I finally changed it to say 6 BTC, or 6.5 BTC worth of $$.
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:35:15
I wanted 6 BTC.. Was more of a penalty for annoying me.

People need to understand the different business practices necessary when dealing in open source products.
Open source is requisite.  So, ruining your product isn't a solution.  You need to consider how you can do business in a way that pays your costs, and gets you the profits you want.
Obviously Trezor could only sell for $120 for a limited amount of time.  You may not have planned it out well, and so perhaps not prepared to compete at a price the market demands, but changing license like this is a good way to eject yourself from the market altogether, and get no further revenue.
By responding irrationally to this setback, you've opened the window for competition to go open source, and replace you.  You're not even competing with them now with this license change, and more importantly, the hit to your rep for actually being willing to do it.
Go back. Beg for understanding. Guarantee you won't abandon licensing again. Pick a model that works for you. Innovate, and salvage what was once a remarkably advantageous position in the community.

I don't understand how so many are sitting back wondering if bitcoin will succeed.  It has succeeded.  If an alt coin is gone in 10 years it doesn't mean that it failed, necessarily.  It could have been perfectly appropriate for the time it was made, and used.  One of the reasons why CCs are volatile, and can have shorter life spans than legal tender is because they're not artificially held in place.  Before I click the save button in writing this message a new CC could come into existence, and be more appropriate than any other money ever has before it..  it doesn't make all the former it replaced a failure.  It just means that technology continues to evolve.  Bitcoin isn't the future of money.  It's the present of money.  So are all the guns behind what is required to keep the official, legal tender in use.  If there wasn't a brighter future to look forward to, that would be depressing.  That doesn't mean gold failed as a medium of exchange, or gold notes, or Bitcoin..  it means they had their run, and something better came along.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:05:21
I both agree, and disagree, with what you're saying..  I agree that all currencies are manipulated, and virtually all are manipulated artificially.  I don't agree that we should accept that it could be that someone somewhere is setting the exchange rates for BTC. This nullifies what BTC is.
Again, if it could be corrupted, it will be.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:14:41
That depends on whether both are a reflection of true market forces or not.
Is it more important that people be able to use BTC if they want/need to, or that the exchange rate reflect actual market?
I don't know, but I think it's a given that some people will run into obstacles attempting to use BTC, and we expect &amp; accept that (by this I mean, this obstacle is a given, and we face it, and try to circumvent it). Unfortunately I don't know that people expect that the exchange rate could be false, and so are assuming that it is based on market forces.
If there was some way to know that the exchange rate reflected actual supply &amp; demand, then yes, I would agree that the adoption of BTC would be of much greater importance. While relying on centralized, and corruptible, sources for our exchange rates, I see greater adoption as a greater threat, as more people could be hurt by it.
Edit.. As it is, I suspect that exchange rate manipulation is hindering adoption.

Christ.  I just purchased, and received mine.  I was about to set the damn thing up.  Anyone know if they have a return policy?
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:33:08
I'm not just pointing out that we need to change that, I'm also pointing out that people need to consider that these exchange rates should be taken with a grain of salt.
Thanks for the suggestions. I do donate where I see it beneficial. Naturally decentralized solutions have come up before, as it's generally known that everything that can be decentralized should, and will, be..  However, I'm speaking as to how it directly applies to this dip today. Can you point me toward the current discussion?
"This is the best we have atm", &amp; suggesting contributing to "projects that solve the issue", isn't discussion on how to solve the issue. I'd love to read about proposals, warnings, theories, etc.. If they're out there, please point us to them. If they're not, lets talk about it!
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:01:54
Not at all. I'm suggesting that it should be, and that we should have some other mechanism for both exchanging, and for exchange rates, than centralized services. Specifically, my point here is about the exchange rates.

Damn.. I thought I had the perfect solution for Ross. I was going to suggest that he just get a job as a cop, and then even if he had done anything criminal, he'd get off easily. I forgot about the whole intelligence max, though.

I am so glad that I can now open my unopened Trezor, and trust that I really do have the optimal hardware wallet available.  Glad to hear it!

Agreed.  There's no fast way to fix that issue they've created for themselves.  Hopefully they prove to have integrity going forward.

I feel like "Encryption a growing chance for security." would be more accurate.

I think my family had one of those.  I feel like I remember one that actually said "TIMEX".  Also a TI, a couple Ataris.  Some sort of really ugly Epson unix machine.  Perhaps a few others.  Never really caught my attention, sadly, until they got the SE/30.

I remember buying my first computer..  a Mac Plus.  I think I spent my final $400 getting it to 4mb ram, and my parents gifted me a 40mb hard drive, that was the size of a lunch box, which also cost $400.
I always think of that when I look at my 64/128/256gb flash drives.
@_date: 2015-08-02 05:20:08
I think the Plus came with 512kb, and no hard drive.  I maxed out the ram in anticipation of fancy new "System 7".  I remember feeling like I should have stuck with 6.07 as it was flying with 4mb.
The good ol days.  :D

Wouldn't that depend on where the addition come from?  If miners are the only ones who get to vote on whether or not there are more bitcoins to be mined, I could see them voting for more despite the hit to the value.

Bitcoin is so precious.  It has its foot in the door, and may be the only reason we have an opportunity to create new, better, alternatives.
I get that everyone wants Bitcoin to be everything, but it isn't.  It may be one day, but right now what it really is, is our only hope at having CCs.  It seems insane to me to risk what we have.  Never before has it been so easy for someone to cross borders with their wealth as securely.
Until we have reason to believe that the entire possibility of non-official digital currency is moments from elimination, we should never risk the top, "keystone", CC.  I'm all for replacing Bitcoin with an alternative.  Messing around with what we have when we have nothing else is terrifying.  I'm not suggesting at all that people who wish to risk altering bitcoin are enemies of bitcoin..  but I can't see any other way for enemies of bitcoin to ruin it than but to hope we risk changing it ourselves, and open the window for them.
Well, or quantum decryption, or something (We'll need quantum encryption CCs sooner or later.... right?).
It seems absurd to me that we're worried about handling all transactions, when gift cards largely solve a lot of the concerns I've heard, rather than protecting Bitcoin like the sole lifeline it is, and trying to make something better to eventually replace it as humanity's reserve CC.  People cry about something taking months, or years..  I just don't understand how we can lack perspective to think like that.  Who gives a damn?!  We have something now we could only dream about before 2009, and we're discussing the urgency of years, or some cost to use the network???  I don't care if bitcoin improves one iota for a decade *if I could just be assured that it, or some other CC would still be viable in a decade!*
I say protect &amp; cultivate the top 5 CCs like they're the most important technology in existence, respectively.  Question any attempt at altering something that solves a problem with as much scrutiny as possible, and always look to best the best.  This is the only way I can see staying ahead of the dominion, and not having it all be but a sad memory of a lost hope.
I promise you that when bitcoin is more advantageous destroyed than functional, enemies with all the resources they can steal will come down on it like nothing we've seen yet.  We need to constantly be building something more resilient until this cat is permanently out of the bag, and we have no reason to think that it's in as much risk as it clearly is today, and probably will be for at least another 20 years.
We're at war for our freedom right now, whether you realize it or not.  We have a real opportunity to evolve into something great, and pull ourselves out of the mire the dominion will always hold us in if it can.  Once establishment isn't the enemy of humanity &amp; progress, we can reasonably roll the dice.  Right now it's completely naive to jeopardize it like we're all just in it together, hoping to make improvements.
