Well, what else can you do? It's not like we can fly to Japan.

850,000 coins worth over half a billion dollars? How's it going to do that?

The problem is law enforcement wouldn't/doesn't care. It actually looks GOOD that bitcoin has these problems because it reinforces government denominated fiat. They let bitcoins flourish because they wanted to say, "see, this is what happens when you don't use us."
I hardly doubt we'll recover those coins. What I would wish for now is that Mark goes to prison for a long time, but there too, law enforcement/courts don't seem that interested.

I haven't been keeping tabs of things over the last few months, but can you tell us if there's a realistic chance of us ever getting back the remaining bitcoins or are they likely all gone?

It's an appeal to authority when you also go to a doctor, or a lawyer, dumb ass. And yes, someone who went to MIT/Yale is probably more experienced, and intelligent than someone who went to Bumblefuck Community College in Kansas.

It's good to know that [Bobby Lee]( has embraced bitcoins.
