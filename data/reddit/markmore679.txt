I almost fell for using their services, because it seemed like the only easy way to buy cryptos in my country. Thank fuck I found an alternative, where you can buy &amp; sell really easily, except for the large 1-2% buy fee (which is bad for day trading, but negligible for long term)

It's not always that simple. Sometimes if you buy at a trough, or when it's slightly increasing after one, it'll unexpectedly crash
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:29:45
I know right. Don't let me buy crypto if I can't sell it (which is the case in australia, even countries I've never heard of let you sell)

To the rest of the US only, or the rest of the world :/

Even so, everybody would benefit...

Well how much is it around then, it looks high end

You can see it in his eyes. He's not really surprised, it's inevitable anyways

Although I'd certainly keep at least 40 million to myself, I agree. I've never understood why people's first instinct once they reach a milestone, is to buy an expensive car (even if they're not a car person). It shows that just because you have a lot of money, doesn't mean you're good with money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:30:23
That seems pretty reasonable then, especially considering a lot of average 4WDs and advertised cars are closer to 50k
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:15:57
Your statement "if I missed out on 50M I would have killed myself too" is greatly exaggerated. Anybody/everybody who had a spare couple ten grand, and knew about bitcoin in its infancy, missed out on a lot of money. Regular stock traders who missed out on buying large company's stock early missed out on a lot of money.

Not criticizing OP, but why is a lot of people's first instinct once they reach a cryptocurrency milestone, to buy something expensive? I wouldn't buy a $50,000+ car unless I had well over $200,000. That kind of money can be expanded into something much larger, and spent on something better. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:10:18
True, but it's still a common occurence

I thought the one on the bottom left was... Something else. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:30:46
Insert reason that it's just a dumb speculation by an investor who wants to make a return on their untimely purchase?

This is in Australian dollars by the way (which doesn't change the story too much but still). The salary is between 30-40k, and I spend literally nothing, since there's no need to (I'm surprised at how many people spend on things like coffee, food and transport every single day). I've been brought up to be moderately frugal and modest with money, so it's just the way it is.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:16:25
It recently dropped to about $3000. Some people would have profited HEAPS, nearly 200%
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:22:16
It has little to nothing to do with social interaction imo. I'm a bit antisocial, and (in my opinion) am the exact opposite of a douchebag / stuck up nerd / pretentious idiot.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:47:25
I meant in terms of multiples, I.e. nearly 2x. You're right its about 80% increase
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:02:34
How did you get a good job? Like most people in their early 20s, I only earn minimum wage, work 40 hours a week (would prefer 50-60, but university is important to me), and barely broke 150k in savings (sounds like a lot, but it's not when you spend literally nothing). Still living with parents.
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:38:07
I'm in Australia, things aren't much better here too. Seing single story small family homes in average suburbs being sold for nearly a million, isn't very promising. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:35:40
You're correct, 30k a year for a few years (worked since I was 18). Minimum wage is moderately high here in Australia, at between $15-$20; but I still worked by ass off for the sole purpose of achieving an income sufficient to move out, but to no avail. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:38:22
Like I said I live with parents. Basic stuff are paid for (the house itself, water, food). Still kinda sucks though, when they were my age they were beginning to thrive in their careers and had a high level of independence (heck, they gave birth to me at my age; I couldn't see myself having a child until my 30s despite how badly I want one)

It doesn't take dicipline, it takes common sense. There is pretty much nothing an early to mid 20s guy could waste money on; I have a hand-me-down 2002 honda civic from my grandparents (I know it sounds spoilt, but it isn't as bad as getting a brand new car at age 16 like some people). I live with my parents. I could ask for an ~$100-$300 object for my birthday and christmas. I don't go out that much, and I don't have subscriptions. My spending money comes from $20 a week of chores, which sounds pathetic, but it was enough to strike a 50/50 deal with my parents to buy myself a PC.
Also I don't invest in bitcoin yet, it seemed too risky. But I might practice with small amounts, like $50, then only invest the profit I made from that from then on so I don't risk thousands.

I never said I have a high opinion of myself. Its pretty easy to tell whether you're personally an egotistical douchebag, or you're not; not being that is the bare minimum of being a decent human being, nothing of high value.

We're all going to become billionaires, cash in before the economy collapses
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:48:12
Before I wondered if I should sell for a 15% reduction of my original purchase, now I'm stressing over which paint and decals to put on my lambo :(
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:38:32
The entire sequence of 1s and 0s that create the backbone of bitcoin always existed, it just took some idiot to discover it

Such a dad joke, to give your daughter $20 on her 18th birthday
