I'm curious.  Do you have 2 million dollars in funds that provide you with a yearly income?  I think its fair to say with that kind of money its a lot different than playing with 200k.
Of course i know there are taxes that need to be paid on that.  And if that in excess of 50% happens and it still draws an income for that year?  Still not too shabby.

How so?  If we look at VFINX over the last 5 years.  How is the income not extremely different?  Being extremely liberal and saying over the last 5 years VFINX did 7% return and had barely none in one year.
I'm confused how they are basically identical.  If we started in 2013 and considering capital gains taxes and income tax for the year when one is yielding over 100k per year, for 4 years and the other 14k per year, over 4 years.  This yields the 2m account 2 years of a nice income and with year 3 being a 0% return.  There is still a nice buffer from the previous 2 years.
I realize there are many variables but for argument sake lets keep it to this scenario.

My mothers fund did 11% last year. 8-13 has been the avg for awhile. Hey. Free money doing nothing that gives you a yearly income? No brainer. Even at 7 percent thats nearly 140k a year.

Endless options but with 1.8 million plus a salary that could go up ever year?  i'll take the first option, please.

And then throw it into a high yielding fund.  Salary for life.
