What would prevent the borrower to default on their loan? How would you be able to track the person? Not too sure if loaning can be done well using the blockchain. Perhaps loaning should be the way it is done today.

This is unprecedented price movement right now. Seeing something as large as bitcoin move this much is crazy. I'm expecting a LARGE correction very soon. All of the FOMO buyers (essentially all the money going in right now) will get scared eventually causing the price to go way down. I've changed my position on bitcoin pulling 60% of it out.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:59:56
It depends on how much risk you want to take. Pulling out your principle sounds like a good idea since it will be like you got in for free and you have whatever's left making more money for you. On the other hand, if you keep it all in you will get more returns. If you want to decide, you better damn well hodl.

yeah, prolly new ath by the end of today for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:30:00
Its guaranteed, believe me ��
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:53:47
adoption is not growing dawg. I dont know what you mean by adoption but the number of people using bitcoin as a transaction medium is not increasing.

Are you trying to crack passwords or something? Depending on the application there are certain programs for brute force cracking. It would be impossible to retrieve the plaintext from a sha256 hash.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:48:57
In today's era you **need** internet to do many necessary day-to-day things. Since this is you would need internet. Try using bitcoin without internet and message me back when you can.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:05:55
you get a hw Wallet to HODL boi.

This belongs on at this point.

localbitcoins.com has some vendors accepting paypal. Beware, this site is high risk! Make sure to only make offers to vendors with good feedback.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:38:49
always HODL
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:48:52
That would be a difficult task to reverse the hash. There inst a single solution when you try to reverse the hash. There are infinite. That's why hashs are considered one-way encryption.

Without Government regulation the ISPs would have more control over the internet. Repealing net neutrality would take away regulation. I hope you mean the opposite.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:30:18
Is there a chance it might be a duped wallet with the same keys? maybe you should transfer that to a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:53:41
you think bitcoin is worth only 11k? I think it's worth 1 million$$$ so its at a 99.1% discount.
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:05:36
I keep hearing more and more reasons to buy right now, it's crazy.

Who currently owns the majority of the infrastructure today? The ISPs. Even if government regulation allowed for people to set up their own data lines doing the task you mentioned would be extraordinarily expensive. I believe Government intervention with the internet is necessary like how it does with water, electricity and other utilities. Prices should be controlled and the amount of other ISPs should be limited (to prevent wires from cluttering up neighborhoods and wasting resources). 
Net Neutrality is different where ISPs internet policy (the way they provide their services) is controlled by the government by treating all data equally. Whereas with your argument, the regulation you mention regards to local policies which prevent many ISPs from forming in a town.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:32:10
Then what's your point? Im pretty sure that what they want to do.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:33:58
It would be really expensive for banks to buy up a significant portion of the bitcoin. Just take a look at a depth chart. Not many people are trying to sell bitcoin. For what it's worth, it would be a waste for banks to even try.

can someone from Japan confirm?

For smaller transactions using 0-conf payments would be acceptable. Soon the LN would facilitate small payments like this with low fees and fast transactions!

Also I forgot to mention the BX2 fork. Not sure how thats going to look. From what it looks like its gonna be bigger than the BTG fork so it may have a larger impact on the market. Whatever happens, Im going to hop into my hodl shelter to protect myself from the FUD you should as well.

Are you just expecting an API to have an ATH method? Try looking for one or make you're own. put out what needs to be done in his comment to make you're own.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:28:14
It could potentially hit 10k this month with the growth it's having right now. If it does, I think it will correct pretty hard dropping 1k in market value. But I definitely believe 10k will be hit just in time for the hodler's celebration, or new years as the normie investors say.

Im not too sure about SSD's, but anything mechanical like an HDD will break down overtime and become less reliable. It's like a car that sits for a while. You need to replace the oil because of degradation. If you plan on storing keys long term you should have a plan for fault tolerance by having at least 2 storage locations (offline) and migrate the keys to new drives after every so years then destroy those HDD not in use.

ey tony, i like the way you think. lets smoke some cigars.

sounds even worse than an actual ban. lol
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:04:59
So for the coming future you think a redefinition of the satoshi should be smaller to what it is now?
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:22:23
do it now so theres no 100% ragrets

good stuff.

6k will be reached by the end of october. mid-2018 muh ass
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:44:55
you think worse is a possibility? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:53:32
you should probably buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:42:30
That's not the point. Eventually bitcoin's transactions will overwhelm the amount of transactions the network can handle. Once that day come then an altcoin will be on top. Then you'll be refering to bitcoin as an alt by that time.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:49:11
Wheres your explanation on your points? Few of these statements may hold true. Just pointing fingers at some other thing isn't good justification.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:19:43
You cant pretend like there's enough to do out there lol. If i didn't have to work i would be learning to master the piano and play that shit all the time. That would be one thing out of a million other things to do. 2 chicks at the same time and 3 chicks would also be on that list haha.

i thought segwit was bad for bitcoin, whats going on here?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:08:00
its kinda like being ignore by everyone. If it wasn't for you answering my question, i would just think everyone here is arrogant af.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:22:45
what does that mean?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:58:41
Would there be a way to divide up satoshi?

do you have a link?

omg da buble popt

sure, when work is incentivised you'll like it. But just work on its own is not appealing. It is something everyone must learn to tolerate to make a living. But if i didnt have to work i wouldnt.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:16:22
If more vendors accepted bitcoin then that would be good for it. But would you be comfortable purchasing a meal for $10 equivalent when  it could potentially grow 10%? You would possibly get 2 meals within the next few days with the same amount of BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:19:41
i believe bitcoin will become a powerful alternative form of universal payment arround the world due once its reaches the mainstream. I also believe bitcoin will be with us for a while. As long as people have their bitcoin nodes up, it will still exist no mater what. Thus it is a safe investment which nothing can happen to giving it's value.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:52:20
Why wouldn't you want bitcoin to succeed? It has the largest network, it has the most publicity, and it has more than 50% of the crypto marketshare. Wouldn't it be wise keep this coin going strong since most people use this coin which gives it it's value?
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:24:04
also tell your friends to buy then tell them to tell their friends to by and so on.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:51:32
bitcoin is a deflationary asset. This is an incentive to hodl it since it will gain in value. Hodling doesn't fuel an economy, so it will be unlikely that day-to-day things will be purchased with bitcoin. I think it will be as it is used now as a financial security like how gold which is also a deflationary asset.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:25:05
unbelievable, believe me.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:07:46
you like to work?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:35:07
the nodes are what make up the network. When you want to take down bitcoin u must take down all the nodes connected to the internet which is impossible. More nodes on the network the more robust the coin's value will be. Sad to see forks are happening trying to weaken the network. If it went down 60% to where another crypto grabs more than 50% of the crypto marketshare, i would sell and trade for that coin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:19:28
If you believe it will re-correct, what would the value be? One bitcoin does seem a lot. However, when you look at the market capitalization it is not close to the scale of a nation's currency in circulation. I expect bitcoin to be bigger than the  USD since bitcoin is more universal. With that said, I believe bitcoin can potentially grow at least 10 fold still and then stabilize after the immense growth.
