Would also like to request photos and Geo. And any more info you can provide. If I were to be on the island around February, and the lot hasnt sold, do you think it would be possible for me to go walk it?

Hey there, why are the 'Sign Up' and 'Sign In' buttons on the site unavailable? Also just placed my first bet, I had assumed I'd get a withdraw function, but am not seeing it.

So you're hypothesizing that it could be a ponzy scheme?

how big of a concern is this? i know i was uncomfortable with it, but it didnt ask for any alarming permissions... anonymity would be nice however.

I've been playing around with algo-trading. so I leave a decent amount of coin on various exchanges that I play with. Mainly I was trying to decide if I should move them from US based exchanges, to foreign based exchanges. Clearly putting the coins in cold storage is the safest route, but I'm trying to weigh risk/reward here.

I'm very much aware of security measures. I have a cold storage wallet for a rainy day.

I invest a good portion of my coin on BTCjam.com . I try to invest in legitimate business plans only (aka, not trading schemes), in order to help support the bitcoin economy through business development. And I get warm fuzzies to think that i helped some industrious bitcoin entrepreneur start a business.
