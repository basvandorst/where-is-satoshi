The additional address is a new address in your wallet to hold the change from your transaction.  You spent 3,138.62 from your wallet, sent 2,210.11 and the difference (less fees) is sent back to your wallet (at a new address).

Every time someone sends you some bitcoin you end up with an unspent transaction output (a UTXO).  When you go to spend from the wallet, it collects up enough of your UTXOs to cover the amount you want to send.
A merchant, for example, might be selling trinkets for $1.  After 100 sales the merchant has about $100 in their wallet, but it is still a collection of $1 bits of bitcoin.  When they go to spend that $100, each $1 bit of bitcoin (UTXO) along with the digital signatures to prove ownership take up a substantial amount of space in the transaction which can cost a lot if the current fee rates are high.  So the merchant might create a transaction to collect all those $1 UTXOs into one UTXO at a low fee rate and wait for the fee rates to drop.

I had a tx at a little under 100 sat/b that I sent out on Dec 20th.  It took nine days to confirm, even with the holidays.  Past performance is not a predictor of the future; there's no telling when yours will get confirmed.

There are two parts to your wait.  First the transfer must make it into a block (AKA be confirmed) on the network.  Breadwallet likely displays this information for you.  The second part is that Coinbase will wait for the network to find additional blocks (AKA additional confirmations) before crediting your account with the bitcoin.

You should really talk to a tax advisor (I am not one).  Having said that, I think much of the advice you are getting here is incorrect.
You do not owe tax until you have a "taxable event."  Selling on an exchange is just one example of a taxable event.  Any good or service that you may purchase with bitcoin will also be a taxable event.  For any taxable event, you need to calculate any gain or loss based on the value of the bitcoin at the time you purchased it to the time you sold or used it for a purchase.
If you had the bitcoin for less than a year it will be taxed as normal income.  If you've had it for more than a year it will be considered long term capital gains which is taxed at a lower rate.
Again, you only have to report if you have taxable events.  If you've never sold or purchased anything with your bitcoin you don't need to report anything (yet).
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:43:55
You really need to talk to a tax advisor (and I am not).  The only provision that might make a BTC to LTC trade a non-taxable event is if it is considered a "like kind" exchange.  There is currently, to my knowledge, no ruling or precedent set for this in crypto.  
The closest comparison is precious metals.  If you trade gold for silver it will be considered a taxable event and not fall under the "like kind" exception.  Trading gold coins for gold bullion would fall under the exception.

Hmmmm, I would have expected a new address for the change as well.  I, honestly, didn't notice and just assumed.  As I mentioned elsewhere, I don't have any experience with the blockchain.info wallet, so don't know if this is unusual for them.  The only other modern wallet I know that will return change to the original address is Mycelium when using their cold storage spending option, or their single address accounts.  Maybe blockchain.info has support for something similar.

You have change in the tx that was presumably sent back to your wallet (about .6 BTC).  You can send a second tx using this output to yourself, but set a higher fee (enough so that the average fee rate between the two tx matches your fee target).  The miners will consider the total fees for the two transactions together.

If you place a market order, you will pay a 0.25% fee.  If you place a limit order and wait for the market to move to your order price, you will pay no fee.  The 0.25% is the max fee which goes down if you are a high volume trader.

I'm not familiar with the blockchain.info wallet.  So I can't be very specific.
You want to send the bitcoin remaining in your blockchain.info wallet TO YOURSELF, NOT to the same destination as before.  Because part or all of the bitcoin remaining in your wallet is tied into the stuck transaction, it will link the two transactions together.
This is called Child Pays For Parent (CPFP).  Some wallets have a menu option to do CPFP for a stuck transaction.  If blockchain.info has this feature, you should use that.
If not, you would have to do it manually.  Get a receive address from your bitcoin wallet and send the balance remaining in your wallet to that address, selecting an appropriate fee.
Given that we are taking about a significant amount here, be sure you understand the steps.  If you're unsure you should not proceed.  If blockchain.info has a help line or chat support, you should get their recommendation and exact procedure from them.

When you purchased the wallet card, you provided an *encrypted private key* and the associated Bitcoin address.  You would have generated these using a program which required you to enter a *pass phrase* used to encrypt the private key.
So, you need to follow NimbleBodhi's advice (easiest so far).  You will scan the *encrypted private key* on the back of the card and you will be required to enter your *pass phrase* to access the funds.  The wallet will either move the funds into your hot wallet, or allow you to spend directly from the wallet card address.  In the the latter case, remaining funds (change) will be returned to your wallet card; be aware that the remaining funds are less secure.
@_date: 2015-12-15 02:16:30
Do you recall how you obtained the encrypted private key you entered when you purchased the card?  Somewhere during the process it should have had you select a pass phrase or generated one for you (which you should have copied down).  You need the pass phrase to decrypt the private key.
*Edit*: Ok, I didn't look far enough on the wallet card site.  There is also a card product with a private key on the back (unencrypted and generated by the card provider).  If this is what you bought, you will not be required to enter a pass phrase.  All the rest of the info applies with the additional info that anyone with access to the card can take your funds, so keep the card secure.
**Note to all**: Ugh, I just entered random info into the forms on cryptocoinwalletcards.com and it accepted them and put it in my shopping cart.  It really should be checking for valid address and encrypted key formats.

on coinbase, transfer usd to their usd wallet for free and deposit that on the coinbase exchange. place an order on the exchange. you get to choose the usd price of your order. if you buy at or above the lowest asking price you pay a 1/4 percent fee. if your price is below the lowest asking price you will pay no fee, but will have to wait for another trader to sell to you at your requested price.

When you install Mycelium, it should ask if this is a new wallet or if you'd like to restore from your backup phrase.  You should do the latter using the backup words from the wallet on the old phone.  This should restore your original account (but will call it Account 1).
If you had additional accounts on the old phone, you will need to create them again, one by one.  Each should be recovered as you create them.

Public and private keys are numbers which are mathematically linked in a way which allows us to do useful stuff like encryption/decryption and signing/verification of digital signatures.  As stated in your linked post, an address is a hash of a public key.
A cryptographic hash is a one way function that takes some input data of arbitrary size and produces a number that is fixed in size.  Any change to the input data, even a very small change, changes the resulting number in a seemingly random manner.  Being that the hash is a one way function, there is no way to calculate the input data from the number.
In Bitcoin, this means that you can't calculate the public key if all you know is the address.  The best you can do is just guess.  And the public key is only disclosed when you spend some bitcoin, which is one reason why address reuse is discouraged.

The second output of the transaction is change back to your mycelium wallet.  Your bitcoin wallet balance is made up of multiple transaction outputs (chunks of bitcoin value).  When one of these is spent, the whole amount of the output has to be spent.  That 76 cents worth of bitcoin is what is left over after spending the .03305592 bitcoin.  Mycelium creates a change address in your wallet to receive the 76 cents in change.

This all happened within a few minutes, so there isn't much of a price impact.  It also happens with restaurant purchases that precharge a percentage (15-20%) to cover tips, then settles the difference later.  In this case, it might be next day for the settlement to occur.

There's no way to know the why of any given transaction.  We can assume the user for this address was using a wallet that allows spending of unconfirmed bitcoin.
As to spent on the blockchain vs spend in the mem pool, blockchain.info shows a given output as "spent" if it appears as input to another tx whether its in a block or only in the mem pool.  If the tx never gets into a block and is dropped from the mem pool on blockchain, then that output will be shown as "unspent" again.

CAmount is a data type that holds a coin amount.  All coin amounts are stored as an integer number of satoshis.  COIN is defined in a header file somewhere is 100000000, which is the number of satoshis in one bitcoin.  So, nSubsidy is 50 bitcoins which is the number of bitcoins rewarded per block when Bitcoin started.
In C++, the &gt;&gt; operator shifts the bits in an integer down the number of bits specified.  Each bit shift is equivalent to dividing the integer by two.  We have had two halvings so far and shifting by two bits is like dividing by two twice (the same as dividing by four), so the 50 bitcoin subsidy is divided by four (12.5).
    nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings
is the same as

You don't have any gains or losses to calculate until you sell some of what you have bought.   When you do sell, you will calculate the value of the portion of bitcoin you first purchased (at 5,700) using the value of bitcoin at the time you sold, and subtract from that the value of that amount of bitcoin at the time you bought it.  That is the gain (or loss).
For example, say you purchased 0.5 bitcoin at 5,700, and sold 0.5 bitcoin today at 9,700.  The value when you bought is 0.5 x 5,700 = 2,850, and the value today is 0.5 x 9,700 = 4,850.  The difference is 2,000 which is your gain.  You will owe taxes on that 2,000.  You can also do this calcualtion as 0.5 x (9,700 - 5,700) = 2,000.
A second example: after you bought the 0.5 at 5,700, you later bought another 0.5 at 9,300.  Today you sold all of it at 9,700.  You will do the same calculation as above for the 0.5 you bought at 5,700 to calculate the gain on that portion of the sell, then do a second calculation for the other 0.5 as 0.5 x (9,700 - 9,300) = $200.  Add the two to get 2,200 gain for 1.0 bitcoin sell.
Its easier if you have a tax guy or a program.  Just record the buys and sells and give that to tax guy or enter into the program.  Be sure to record the dates as the tax code treats long term and short term gains differently.
P.S. I don't think the Coinbase report u/TwoTenths mentions will track trades on GDAX.  Go to your Accounts page and look for button to download a statement of your trades which should have all the info you need.

It really doesn't matter how many confirmations Circle considers necessary to consider a sending transaction no longer pending.  They should just put the transaction on the Bitcoin network.  Purse should see the transaction on the network and its up to them how many confirmations they require.  Its possible that Circle could delay sending the transaction out, but I've never had that problem.
BTW, I second the advice to move your coins as a matter of course to your mycelium (or other suitable wallet) where you control the keys.  That's what I do.

TLDR: You are for the most part correct.  
Before we were talking in the context of a single address paper wallet.  A blockchain.info wallet generates a new bitcoin address each time you want someone to send bitcoin to the wallet.  When you spend from the online wallet, it will spend all of the bitcoin held in one or more of these addresses.  Any leftover amount in excess of what you want to send is sent to a new change address generated by the wallet.  So in the normal case, each address only ever receives bitcoin from one transaction and then only ever used once to send bitcoin to another address.
If you have someone send multiple transactions to the same address in the online wallet, it is still possible that the public key for that address is published on the blockchain and still have bitcoin associated with the address.  But this is not the usual case.

Yes, the address (the double SHA256 hash of the public key) goes on the blockchain when bitcoin is sent to the address. My understanding is that quantum computing is a potential threat to the public key/private key math, and using addresses helps protect the public key as well as saves some space on the blockchain.

You are either not entering the words in the correct order or you miscopied them.  Open up Mycelium on your old phone and run through the backup again.  It will show you a security warning and make you stare at it for a minute.  Then check your word list against your copy.  When entering each word during restore, enter just the first few letters and then carefully select the correct word when it appears as a button at the bottom of the screen.
P.S. Mycelium does not create seeds using passphrases.  Leave the passphrase option unchecked when restoring a Mycelium backup.

It is best practice to move all the bitcoin from a paper wallet.  There are several reasons.  
First, there may be some confusion about where the change from a transaction will end up.  It may end up in an address controlled by the wallet software you are using, or it may be sent back to the paper wallet address.  You need to be aware of how your wallet software works.
Second, in order for you to send bitcoin from a paper wallet, you need to provide the private key to the wallet software.  So your paper wallet is no longer cold storage as the private key has now been exposed to a system which is on line.
And lastly, when you send from the paper wallet address, you publish the public key on the blockchain.  While it is currently not feasible to use that public key to derive the private key, with developments in quantum computing it may become possible, and the remaining balance on the paper wallet would be at risk.

Your node mined a block (50 bitcoin), but the block was orphaned due to another miner mining a block at about the same time.  The network ended up building on the other miners block; your block was "not accepted" (so you don't get the 50 bitcoin).

I've been paying my Dish bill with bitcoin since they rolled it out as a payment method, and for the same reason as you.

@_date: 2015-07-08 23:33:02
From a technical perspective, it is better to request a refund address from the customer rather than refunding to an address in the payment transaction.  The customer may no longer control the original address(es).  Also, it is less secure to reuse addresses.
Be aware that refunding in bitcoin unavoidably exposes you to bitcoin price volatility.   If your policy is to refund the original amount of bitcoin, then you must either hold that bitcoin for a period during which the value will change, or be prepared to purchase that amount at time of refund which may cost you more (or less) than the original invoice amount.   If the policy is to refund a bitcoin amount at the current exchange price, then the customer has an incentive to cancel an order if the exchange price decreases.

The technical term for what BobAlison is referring to is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO).  The entire UTXO must be used up in a Bitcoin transaction as either one or more outputs to other addresses or as a miner fee.
Edit (more): So a given Bitcoin address can have multiple UTXO associated with it and some older wallets will return the leftover from a transaction (change) back to the same address (a new UTXO for that address).

If this is an on chain transaction, then there will be no association between the two addresses from webhost.com perspective.  They would not even necessarily know that the payment is from a coinbase user.

A STOP order tells the exchange to enter a MARKET order if the market price falls to the specified level.  So you will be charged a trading fee for matching orders in the order book as a taker.
To avoid fees you need to enter a LIMIT order at a price above the current market price (you are a market maker).  Your order will be placed in the order book and wait until another trader places a MARKET order that is matched to your order.

Coinbase, Circle and other hosted wallets leave your bitcoin under the control of the wallet provider.  They hold the keys, so they control the bitcoin.  This is similar to a bank or paypal.

I think you are trying to cover too much with the single analogy, so doesn't work too well.  That also makes it harder for us to determine how accurately you understand Bitcoin.  
You would do better to have different analogies for different aspects of the system (addresses, transactions, mining, etc).  For each analogy say "its like this in a way, but it is different in that..."
Bitcoin addresses are created by first generating the private key and then calculating the public key from the private key, and the address from the public key.  There is no checking the blockchain for collisions.
Yes it is possible that some transactions will never be added to a block.  Miners are free to choose which transactions to include or exclude.

I'm in the greater LA area, but a bit distant to participate in your area.  But, I've had thought along the same line as yours to encourage local adoption.  I thought I'd share my take on it.
1. Form a group of users that are willing to participate in the local adoption effort.
1. Any group member may identify a local business where they want to spend bitcoin, and make this known to the rest of the group.
1. Group members commit to participating in a campaign for one or more identified businesses to adopt.
1. A campaign is just group members visiting the business during a set time frame to make a purchase there.  When checking out they inquire "do you accept bitcoin?"
1. If a business ends up accepting bitcoin, the group members make a followup visit to make a purchase using bitcoin.
Any group member should be ready to provide information the business might need when they are ready to implement Bitcoin.  I actually like your idea of a volunteer team which group members would then refer the business to.
I would be interested in following your progress.  Followup posts here or on your meetup page would be great.

Actually, Bitcoin is quite a bit faster in verifying transfers than the credit card system.  When paying with a CC, the transaction is not really completed for days and can even be reversed some months later.

I suppose it depends on who is doing the spending.  If its large holders who have all the bitcoin they want and are just spending what they have, then yes, there's more supply on the market.
If its mostly new people, then they have to obtain the bitcoin before they spend it, so at worst its a wash (though maybe a bit of additional demand as they probably won't spend every last satoshi).
Then there are people like me that rebuy after they spend.  Most of what I buy with bitcoin has a small  discount, and I buy back at the full USD value.  So, more demand than supply and the price would go up.

As stated in other replies, the miner that mines the block that includes your tx gets the fees.  The tx is considered to have one confirmation when it appears in a block in the blockchain, and one additional confirmation for each additional block that follows that block on the chain.  So, only mining nodes contribute to confirming transactions.  Any node can validate transactions and blocks and generally full nodes are thought of as doing so.

In an HD wallet like Mycelium, the wallet addresses are generated in a fixed sequence.  It won't move on to the next address until it receives a transaction to the current address.  If you have not received any transactions since the kiosk, the address Mycelium currently shows is the address it would have displayed to the kiosk.
If the address changed after the kiosk scanned it, but no transaction appears in the wallet, then something is wrong with your wallet.  Malware on the phone maybe?

In installing Mycelium, you should have gone through a back up process where you copied down twelve words.  These words can be used to restore your wallet should your phone stop working.
If your phone breaks, you would get a new phone, install Mycelium, and in the setup process do a recovery rather than install a new wallet.  You will be asked to enter the twelve words (in order) to recover your wallet.

@_date: 2015-11-10 03:09:43
It really depends on what wallet you are using.  I'm an Android user and have familiarity with a couple of wallets, Mycelium and Airbits.  Mycelium allows copying "accounts" from other wallets by scanning a wallet seed, private key or address QR code, or by taking the same data from the clipboard.  If you scan an address then it allows you to watch activity on that address.  If you scan a private key you'll also be able to spend funds at that address. Scanning a seed will enable the same for an HD "account" (there are public and private seeds that will result in watch only and full control).
Note that the Apple app version of Mycelium is a separate development from the Android app, so features may vary.  Also note that the HD backup 12 word pass phrase would not cover any single address "accounts" you might put in there.
The Airbits wallet is available for Apple and is encrypted with a local password and backed up on their servers.  So no need to worry about the backup (but don't forget that password!).  It doesn't have any ability to import addresses or accounts from other wallets, so that might be a sticking point for you.  I don't know if there is an Airbitz wallet for desktop Macs.  If so, it would work well for you as the wallet would be shared using the same Airbits account from the Desktop or the tablet.

The wallet on your Mac will (under normal circumstances) be separate from the wallet on your tablet.  Its possible to copy wallet seed, keys, and addresses between wallets.

Bitpay doesn't determine the fee amount, your wallet does that.  Also, it is the size of the transaction in bytes not the size in bitcoin that is relevant in calculating an appropriate fee.
The fee you've indicated is quite low given current conditions even assuming a small sized (in bytes) transaction.  It could be days before the transaction confirms.

Wallets vary with respect to how many confirmations are necessary to spend funds.  Some will even  let you re-spend unconfirmed funds.
Circle has no control over this treatment by other wallets.  Their practice of requiring four confirmations to update their wallets is simply an accounting practice on their systems.
Once the transaction to wallet A gets in a block, the one to wallet B may also confirm and may even do so in the same block.  Your coins should show up in wallet B just fine (assuming adequate fees).

You can send commands to bitcoind using the bitcoin-cli command.  "bitcoin-cli getinfo" will tell you how many blocks your bitcoind has received and how many connections your bitcoind has to other nodes.
Check to see that the number of blocks is increasing.  This means your node is syncing.  Once it gets to the current block height, your node is synced.
Check the number of connections.  If it stays at eight connections after being synced for a few hours, its likely your server is not configured to allow connections to your bitcoind.  getaddr.bitnodes.io, as has already been mentioned, will also tell you if your node is open to inbound connections.
If your bitcoind keeps dying, its possible your server doesn't have enough memory.  You can confirm this by checking /var/log/messages (or similar) for out of memory type messages.  If this is the case, you can configure a swap file of at least a couple gigs.

One of the inputs to your transaction is unconfirmed.  The transaction for that input has a smaller fee, so it may take a while before the input is confirmed.

First, I should point out that Coinbase Exchange is not available to all Coinbase users.  I guess they have to jump through state by state regulatory hurdles.  So first step is to find out if its available to you.  If not, then you will want to look into other exchanges.  I've only used Coinbase, so I can't recommend others.
As to Coinbase Exchange guides, there are help articles at
Somewhere in there are video tutorials which should get you started with the basics.

Hmmm, daily transaction counts have been increasing fairly steadily since mid 2014 all the way through the first quarter of this year.  I'm more concerned about the fall off.  Are users moving to other solutions?

I've submitted your transaction to the
[ViaBTC tx accelerator]( page.  Hopefully it will get into a block soon.

Perhaps the biggest security risk in Bitcoin is securing your wallet and its data.  If your computer or smart phone gets a virus, it may compromise your wallet and you could loose your bitcoin.
A hardware wallet is dedicated to doing only one thing, which is to function as a Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) wallet.  So there is very little chance that any malicious software can be loaded onto the device.  All the data and functions of the wallet run on the hardware wallet, so even if your computer gets a virus, it does not have access to the wallet, and your bitcoin stay protected.

OK, I've just gotten the other tx submitted on ViaBTC accelerator.  I noticed your other thread with the $150 bounty.  May I suggest that if your tx's confirm in a ViaBTC block, you send the bounty to the donation address on the ViaBTC accelerator page.  Its at the bottom of the "About TA" section on that page.

Yes, it should deliver the bitcoin directly to your wallet.  It wont arrive until the funds get to Glidera from your bank.

It looks to me that Gemini is using Authy tokens.  I've recently disabled multi-device (android app) and it seems to maintain the disabled setting just fine.

You're off by a decimal place.  Your wallet either has about $5 or you have an extra 0 in the bitcoin amount.  I'm guessing that its $5 and that the fee to transfer out the coin is greater than that $5 :^(.
