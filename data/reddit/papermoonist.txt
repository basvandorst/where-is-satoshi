We should ALWAYS be focused on the VALUE of crypto. If it's not valuable, than why would it be worth our time? You probably meant that we shouldn't be focusing on the 'price'...

Right... Because the FED runs the printing press 24/7, people feel the opposite - they realize that if they don't consume them today or find some exotic way to get high return, they will lose their money... The concept of living in an economy based on sound money is so foreign to us...  But we'll adjust and be better off...

I say this all the time! If the price had taken a linear path from the 3k's to the 6k-7k range, people would be euphoric and scared to invest at 'the top of the market'... But this is precisely why a rise to 20k and subsequent crash to 6k makes for a more sustainable foundation for growth...

Consider using Shamir Secret Sharing to create 5 keys, 3 of which can be used to reassemble the seed. Do this on an air gapped machine using a tool like Ian Coleman's. You can even use his n-of-m SSS mnemonic generating tool for ease of use. It's specifically designed for this use case.

Chain rewritten; transactions *reordered*
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:54:54
Just a small correction: transactions cannot be "rewritten" by anyone (except maybe, under certain circumstances, by the owner of the UTXOs used). The perpetrator of a 51% attack can only hope to *reorder* transactions...

Yes, yes and yes! It's a shame that most people don't have enough of an understanding of economics to realize that the fact that the transaction fees got so high a few weeks back is a reflection of the tremendous value people place on transacting on the scarce resource that is the Bitcoin blockchain - not the opposite! Let Bitcoin wind up being the ultra-secure, time-tested mechanism through which large, international bank settlements are done (or WHATEVER the market decides it should be) and leave buying coffee and the unbanked to other chains or layer-2 mechanisms... 
Look at it this way (illustrative but admittedly NOT the same case): Ultimately, both the limited amount of bitcoins and the "transaction bandwidth" of the blockchain are scarce resources provided by Bitcoin... Just as you wouldn't propose minting new bitcoins in response to tremendous demand and high prices... and you certainly wouldn't expect minting new bitcoins to result in a RISE in the price of Bitcoin (but rather the opposite), you shouldn't expect that creating LESS scarcity (GREATER abundance) of "transaction bandwidth" (thereby improving only  CERTAIN use-cases) will NECESSARILY result in an increase in the price of Bitcoin... In fact there is good reason to think that keeping the resources more scarce will result in higher prices...  
I guess my point is that I wish that those who are otherwise embracing all of the right principles would also entertain the possibility that maybe we don't need a "scaling solution" at all... Or at least not at any cost

I memorized mine. I promise you that it's MUCH easier than it sounds... I have a daily reminder to take 60 seconds and practice... At the beginning I focused on learning successive groups of 4 words at a time, by tying each group into some kind of bizarre mental image... It worked so well that I learned all 24 words by heart after 3 days... Now I just recite it to myself daily.

It may sound like splitting hairs, semantics, etc. but the fact that transactions cannot be rewritten has *enormous* security implications... Yes, miners have some control over transaction inclusion, ordering, validation - in other words control over the composition of the chain of transactions. But, when the owner(s) of unspent transaction inputs create a transaction, that transaction (amount, recepient, etc.) - come hell, high water or 51% attack - *cannot* be altered... Yes, it can be replaced, excluded from the chain or invalidated through excluding parent transactions. But the immutability of transactions dramatically limits the damage that can be done by a 51% attack (and in general) - to the likes of a double spend (which would not necessarily be the end of the world) rather than a drain of user accounts (which would be the end of the world).

He's making a distinction between buyers who are motivated solely by the underlying value of the technology vs. buyers who are motivated to create large price swings in an effort to market the currency to the masses... One represents a fundamental shift of the value of BCH in the eyes of the market and the other only gives the appearance that this is the case...

This round was an excellent illustration of the fact that, while people can easily manipulate price on an exchange (in the short term), they can't manipulate "the market"...  Many think that those are one and the same because most of the markets we're used to dealing with are so liquid and well understood... But they're not...

That's not my argument...  Let's assume for the moment that BTC is a commodity and it does produce dividends. I imagine that you would agree that the "dividends" produced by a given lot of BTC belong to the owner of the given lot of BTC at the time those "dividends" are produced, right? I am arguing (above - no need to reiterate) that the BTC is Coinbase's property at the time that the "dividends" are produced.

The way that Bitfinex handled the Bitfinex hack is a shining example of how the "Unregulated, Wild West" market handles a disaster. The solution of issuing Bitfinex tokens was free market brilliance at its best. And it certainly put various, tired government "solutions" to shame: forcibly take money from Group A and make Group B investors whole... Mire exchanges in so much red tape so as to make it impossibly expensive to trade or enter,... Etc, etc... 
GDAX, after the flash crash, DESPITE investigating and determining that the flash crash was not a technical fault but a whale biting deep into the order book, made whole margin investors who lost funds from their own pocket! In the "unregulated market"... 
As a victim of the Bitfinex hack... Who learned from previous failures (i.e. MtGox) and did not keep substantial funds in the custody of an exchange... Who, in the end, recovered 90% of what he lost in the hack... I thank God every day that the Bitcoin market is unregulated and able to bring me solutions from entrepreneurs instead of government beurocrats!

Perhaps one way that Bitcoin is inferior to gold is that the properties of gold are immutable... This precludes debates on, for example, whether or not increasing the density of the metal might make it easier to transport greater value thereby raising adoption rates... Instead, gold is what it is and the market decides its place in the economy... Which ends up being part of a larger ecosystem of precious metals... I wish that more people would consider that maybe it's best to leave Bitcoin as the beautifully simple and secure coin that has withstood the test of just under a decade's worth of time in the wild and leave other features and applications (like buying ice cream and the 'unbanked') to other digital currencies and layer-2 technologies (like LN)...

In keeping your coins on an exchange such as Coinbase, you give up custody of your coins to them and you have an IOU for the coins ONLY in the amount and cointype that you have on deposit. They have a pool of funds that now contains your coins, but those funds are owned by them - not you. They can do as they please with the funds, as long as they can honor the IOU and give you back your Bitcoin on demand. You didn't deposit BCC with Coinbase - only BTC. They do not owe you BCC - only BTC. You do not own the private keys to their pool of funds (which may be able to use to access a new pool of BCC) - they do. This all seems quite legitimate. 
If you are uncomfortable with any of the above, you can (and should) remove your coins!

I love how people go around parroting what they've heard about how a fiat currency derives its value from the "full faith and credit" or "economic capacity" of the government "backing" it, without even thinking about what that means. I mean seriously, what the fuck does that even mean? The last time you spent your fiat money and you were confident that the other party would accept it, was it seriously because of the "faith and credit of the government" (I'm not even sure what that means), or was it because you used it the day before and the day before that and things worked out just fine?  And if the government stops paying its debts, how does that DIRECTLY impact the value of the little green peices of paper? Sure, governments have the power to (and have repeatedly) destroyed the value of their fiat currencies by printing more to no end.  To the extent that "faith" plays a role, it is "faith" in a currency's *future* value to a counter-party that counts, not "faith" in a government. I'm not sure what *DIRECT* role credit plays (yes, I understand there can be indirect roles insofar as it can cause the government to change the size of the money supply). And I don't have the foggiest idea what "economic capacity" means... But maybe I'm just ignorant... End rambling rant here. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:09:01
The difference is that a crypto currency IS ITSELF a commodity and a stock REPRESENTS a share in a company that comes with rights and obligations to assets and liabilities owned and controlled by the company. There is a big difference between the two and I see this confusion a lot here - typically around the concept of market caps. It probably stems from the fact that both commodities and equities are popular forms of investments. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:44:16
I hate that I don't hear this opinion more often...  It's really a shame that so many people who are otherwise embracing all of the right principles don't consider that maybe Bitcoin doesn't need a "scaling solution" at all... Let the market decide its place in a larger ecosystem of crypto currencies and off-chain networks... 
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:23:46
But commodities don't produce dividends... They *are* goods. Equities do produce divideds... They are shares in companies that *make, own and sell* goods... 
In your analogy, your broker is in essence only holding a contract. The contract he is holding entitles you to certain rights with respect to the company. You can choose to excersie these rights regardless of who is holding the peice of paper upon which these rights are codified. If the share certificate is lost, you can offen replace it by working with the company's transfer agent. Contrast this with a commodity, such as gold, silver, crypto currency, apples, etc. that cannot be simply "drawn up again" if it's lost. 
You give Coinbase a commodity to hold on account for you with an understanding that you will get different ones (in equal amount) back. (Indeed, Bitcoin is not fungible. So there isn't even a pretense of them holding "your Bitcoin").
By the way, Coinbase sucks and I hate defending their position.

If they weren't lazy... they would spend more resources on DIRECTLY preventing the actual "crimes" they're interested in preventing than on gumming up the works of our global economy by making it costly to transact... Clearly everyone would recognize that cost of regulating kitchen knives isn't worth the benefit of not having them available as an option for a murderer...  At what point are the regulations on our money and transactions so onerous that it's clear to everyone that the cost is not worth preventing some drugs and money laundering transactions...  (Just because the cost isn't readily apparent to most people, it doesn't mean it's not there in the form of a substantial increase in cost of living!) And that perhaps (if we're so interested in stopping those "crimes" at all) they should stop taking the lazy route and leave our money alone!
