Its essentially trivial to track BTC to their users at this point. Very smart people are working on tracking cryptos and very smart people are working on keeping crypto anonymous but very smart people have yet to implement any good solutions to BTC specifically.

Guys, why is BTC useful as a currency to fight back against tyrannical banks and governments when every BTC can be linked back to you and every transaction basically has your name on it? (Govts are putting a lot of money into improving their tracking abilities so the problem will keep getting worse)

Anyone else think that the utility of blockchain technology is overrated from an economic value standpoint (decentralized pet game platforms being worth hundreds of billions) and that even viable crypto projects seem to only be using their own tokens out of obligation or greed but could do just fine without these tokens? 
I'm long term bullish on decentralized crypto currencies like BTC but extremely bearish about most of the rest that aren't built to act as a currency in mind and with tokens whose utility or advantage over fiat is not clear at all.

Remind me when nvm you're an idiot and we've heard this before from your kind

Governments cant make you do stuff? Crypto-currency doesnt have to be cryptic so just use something else if you want privacy? huh?????

It hasn't been moved from his wallet you inbred degenerate fuck. 
Do you even blockchain info?

I understand the value of BTC being a deflationary, decentralized store of wealth but this question pertains to its use as a currency

Do not post your wallets total balance ffs

There's no guarantee of 2 marshmallows tomorrow when it comes to crypto/stocks/real estate/any invesment. This is not a good example.

If the Zionist state and their international Jewish banking cartels ever push Bitcoin seriously then it's time to jump ship because the conspiracy theories about nakamotos origins will have been validated. Putting all my BTC into monero if this happens. 
Dead fucking serious.  
However, considering the absolute loathing of the squatter state by most of the world I would classify anything positive said by the squatter leader as pure FUD meant to dissuade investment. 
HODL and crush their domination of the financial system.

I'm a Canadian and I was verified on gemini within a couple of days. 
Now if only i could transfer CAD into my account...

Hodl till you're dead or the banking cartel of international Jewry is dead. Whichever comes first. 
Hodl. Hodl. Hodl

First crypto to market, brand recognition for anyone interested in crypto, similar characteristics to gold  but with genuine scarcity. 
Essentially, when compared to fiat there is no shot that Bitcoin is going to lose out in the long run. All fiat is worthless and backed only by banksters. Bitcoin and crypto are backed by mathematics. Which do you trust more?

I don't see any use for coins like LTC or XMR in the long run. BTC can just implement their useful features since they're open source and leave them in the dust. 
And if you want a quick moon you shouldn't be investing in altcoins that have seen more than a 1000% rise in the past year anyway.

Don't bother, there's bots that do it infinitely faster than you can hope.

Bitcoin ain't dead but its reputation is in the fucking toilet and will stay there for many years. It finally had the world's attention and it performed like a limp dick on prom night. Pathetic.

I feel bad for them. My palms were sweating at 6.5k so i can empathize with those who are worse off financially and had to cut their losses to pay bills and such.

Lower fees, better reputation. Try to get verified on at least 2 major exchanges though. Try Gdax and Kraken if in the US.
