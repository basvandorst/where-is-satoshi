Dude, facebook video views are a ridiculous metric. If you are scrolling through your feed and a video autoplays somewhere on your screen for 3 seconds, it counts as a view. Even if you don't turn the sound on. Even if you're just reading some other comment on the page and it's in the viewport.
104,000 people didn't "watch" your video.

Valve isn't saying anything about chains at all. They're saying that the transaction fees are way too high, the price is too volatile, and it's creating a bad customer experience, so they're disabling it.
I don't think they care what the solution is, nor should they really.

Has it been an activist body since the department was formed 37 years ago? What changed to make it so? If the court has a specific agenda, what is it?

If that's what it takes, why hasn't the supreme court ruled the Department of Education unconstitutional? Why has no one even made it to the court with that argument? Why hasn't the GI bill been overturned? Or the Morrill acts?

So we thought, but recent research shows clear evidence that there's a physical component to the disorder.

It's considered a disorder in part because its social effects are vastly more destructive than constructive. Narcissists and sociopaths tend to be great social climbers, as they have no capacity for empathy for the people they destroy along the way to their goal. That doesn't mean it should be an accepted part of society or what we consider a "normal" brain. It also doesn't mean that narcissists tend to be happy or comfortable with their condition either, a large component of the disorder is an overactive amygdala-driven fear response.
If narcissists could selectively employ empathy, I think you'd have a bit more standing with your argument, but the definition of the disorder is an incapacity for empathy. Losing your hearing makes you more attuned to your other senses, but it's still fairly considered a disorder that people manage rather than a natural architecture.

The constitution doesn't allow for the consumption of Cool Ranch Doritos on federal property either.

That's a side effect of narcissism, not the cause of it. Narcissistic personality disorder is a physical brain condition, not a choice or an adaptation. There have been conclusive studies that show that those with NPD have less brain matter than control groups in the left anterior insula, rostral and median cingulate cortex as well as dorsolateral and medial parts of the prefrontal cortex. All of which are associated with empathy.
We still don't know a lot about how the brain functions, but NPD is one of a few mental disorders you can actually visibly detect with an MRI.

I don't disagree, but it's important to remember that he published them nearly 150 years ago. In any case, before you start defining Marxism with long paragraphs about... whatever you're talking about, you might want to actually read some Marx. His argument was pretty unambiguous and you might better understand what people mean by the word "Marxism".

Or it could mean someone who supports the worldview that Karl Marx described in his books in the late 19th century.
Have you read any Marx?

When has CNN endorsed a Marxist worldview? Do you have a clip?

I think there are probably more difficult obstacles to carrying out a physical attack on a bitmain facility in inner mongolia than the keys to the transformer rooms.

More Mexicans have been leaving the US than coming in since 2008. I can't find any evidence to support the idea that their population is fleeing.

That's an interesting story, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the Federal Reserve.
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:04:58
I get what the narrative is, what I'm asking for is evidence to support it, because I can't find any. According to everything I've ever read about it, eGold was prosecuted because the secret service had already found credit card fraudsters using the service, which caused federal prosecutors to build a case against them since A: they didn't register with FinCEN and B: they had a centralized trust model and could therefore be shut down.
The secret service was concerned about financial fraud coming from the service. They built a case for the DoJ to prosecute. The mistake that guy made was trying to run a centralized currency, which made him plausibly legally responsible for what people do with it. 
So where does the Federal Reserve come in? What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:20:58
That argument went from potentially interesting to bickering about semantics in only two posts!
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:45:41
All the information I can find shows that eGold was investigated by the Secret Service and the FBI, and prosecuted by the Department of Justice. Can you show me where the Federal Reserve was involved in the investigation or prosecution of this case? Because I'm really not finding anything.
