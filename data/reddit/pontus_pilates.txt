That's not really relevant though. Nobody would be mining if people didn't agree that cryptocurrencies have some value.
If the bottom falls under some cryptocurrency, the mining operation that went to it doesn't lend it any value.
If a pharmaceutical company spends two billion dollars on a new drug and the drug turns out to be a ineffective or dangerous, the effort put into its development doesn't make the existing pills any more valuable.

People run all sorts of stuff, like protein folding, even if they get nothing from it. Bitcoin et al. at least promise the possibility of profit, so why not.
And if you talk about the first few years, it really wasn't that expensive.
And no matter how great the process is, people could lose faith in any single coin. If enough exchanges get hacked and people habitually lose their investment. If the US or the EU step in and introduce heavy regulations or transaction taxes. 
I'm sure the technology itself is not going anywhere, but I don't think the mining process itself provides some inherent baseline value if people don't have faith in the currency.
