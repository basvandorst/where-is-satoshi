You sent your btc to an addy that everyone else sends to they mix your coins up and send it from a different address leaving no trail to track you, only the people who do the tumbling could possibly track you it’s well known FBI have created tumbling sites

Yeah it’s ridiculous we need to start a petition and march to the beehive! Their pretty quick to tax miners to based on the reward they gained from mining blocks but I wonder if they tax you based on the value of bitcoin at the time you received it, not factoring in power costs to run all the miners, equipment set up/maintenance etc... taxing on exchanging crypto too wtf is this!
