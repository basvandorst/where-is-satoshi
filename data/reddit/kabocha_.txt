Damn, it was fetching like $0.30 at that time. Do people really not try to price out things they sell beforehand?

Why would you buy them at half a cent? People usually just mined them back then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:43:54
True. It seems like they're still in small-time open source project mode with no major management/PR/public-facing team, which is weird for something with such a huge "market cap".

How did you come to that conclusion?

Aaand 9 hours later we're almost at 13k

Okay kramer.

Good luck trying to civil asset forfeiture an encrypted private key that people can just back up elsewhere.
what even

There's a lot of commenters here that said "idk what that means but congrats!" or something similar.
It's always scary to me how many people invest in cryptocurrencies at this stage in the game and don't understand how they work on even a basic level. You're just investing on hype, without understanding any of the tech. That's a good recipe for weak hands.
If you don't know what "block  means, maybe you should research a little more before investing in Bitcoin. Blockchain technology is a fundamental part of Bitcoin and is probably THE main reason it's so revolutionary.

This is starting to approach bubble territory, if you take a look at a log(y) chart. $15k is great, let's chill here for a while.

Welcome to the wonderful world of software development.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:03:46
21 million BTC / 8 billion people = 0.002625 BTC per person for the entire world. That's 2.625 mBTC, or 2,625 μBTC, or 262,500 satoshi.
Right now, the amount of significant figures we have in Bitcoin is not enough to represent everyone's amount of wealth reliably.
If we double the amount of sigfigs (14 or so more decimal points) in the future to bring bitcoin's sigfigs up to ~28, that should be enough to represent anywhere from the smallest meaningful amount of wealth to an unthinkably large amount of wealth.
The estimated amount of money in the entire world is estimated at $80 trillion USD from what I could find in a quick google search, and that is 16 sigfigs with cents included. That leaves 12 *more* decimal places to measure fractions of a cent, if we double Bitcoin's current amount of sigfigs.
Now, as for the fact that there will be no inflation: that might actually pose a [very large problem]( in the future. I'm not quite sure how we'd handle that, to be honest.

Not yet, but theoretically.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:53:51
I'm still not sure I understand the actual details of buying/selling futures. Would you actually get the BTC at the end? Couldn't you just arbitrage against the future?
Example: if the future price goes to 4,000 and I hold 1 BTC 
( today, couldn't I just sell my BTC now and also buy the future, and magically gain 0.65 BTC in the end?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:49:41


A "milliBit" would be 0.1 satoshi, if you agree that we should call 100 satoshi (one μBTC) a "Bit".
Which is why I think "Bit" is a confusing term.

I assume the contract price is higher than 4000, at least? It's not like "loljk here's your $4000 back"? If that was another comodity like cotton and I actually needed it, I'd be pissed.

I was trying to but Coinbase/GDAX **still** haven't gotten my money yet. I started the deposit on like nov 3 or something.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:30:08
Just anecdotally, I agree with Seems like every time I look at Blockfolio, the three are going the same direction (red or green).
