When bitcoin becomes a legitimate player in the currenty market.

I see where you are coming from. So if it costs 1 million dollars to get a license to operate an exchange in US then the exchange will take a larger cut in the form of a fee to make that 1 million back, also the 1 million creates a barrier to entry thus less competition thus companies can get away with charging more.  
Personally I believe/hope that this regulation will not be that intrusive, hopefully it would just serve to further legitimize bitcoin in the eyes of the public.  
As to the transaction fee(miner's fee?), I do not believe that regulation would affect it directly, unless I am misinterpreting something.

Meh, I can't read today.  
It would make sense if they would delay these types of transactions for a day or so to enhance anonymity, alas I've never heard of bitlaunder only bitlaundly so can only speculate.

Lots of stuff relies on the internet to work, limiting or shutting down the internet would be super unpopular, there are also alternatives such as mesh networks... So in a scenario where someone wanted to hinder bitcoin killing off the internet would not be their first choice, imo. But I agree with you, turning off the internet would be detrimental to bitcoin.

All paper wallets are cold storage but not all cold storage are paper wallets. Both are equally secure in a sense that the private keys are stored offline. Ex of cold storage that is not a paper wallet is a laptop that is never connected to the internet used for storing keys, and maybe signing transactions.

Funny joke is funny.  
Mostly because there is truth in it, but unless you are using IE you are pretty safe with just clicking on links. Downloading and running executable and/or java appletts, not so much.

Are the coins at an address that you have specified? If so then this is potentially a coinbase issue.  
How did you originally come by this address that you gave to bitlaundry?

Supply and demand?

Would probably fix the bug, and the everyone would have to agree to reset the blockchain to a point in time that is prior to when the coins were stolen...

So, "disclamer: requires some centralization and trust in third parties, use at your own risk" type of deal. Personally I think this would benefit users, and could always fall back on convertional addresses in case of 'attack' on this sort of setup.

Ok, sorry I misinterpreted you original statement.  
So it states on  that sending to the destination address might take up to 1 day... maybe wait 1 day.

Buy from online retailers that accept bitcoin and local brick and mortar stores, also donations, couple of times a week or so.

No one can tell you specifically why you would want to use bitcoin, you have to decide that for yourself if you want to use it or not. Any argument one can come up with you can reply to with "But this advantage over fiat or aspect or feature of bitcoin is not important to me, I don't care about that".  
So take a look at the long list of advantages that bitcoin offers over fiat and decide for yourself if you want to use it or not.

As far as I understand you cannot 'force through an new transaction'. If you send transaction A with a fee of .001 btc and later send transaction B with the same inputs, even if you include a fee of 1.0 bitcoin with it this transaction, it will be dropped by the first node which already saw transaction A. Higher fee does not mean that an already existing transaction will be overridden.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:18:53
Thanks for the detailed explanation.  
So to confirm, sending a higher fee transaction with same inputs once the original transaction propagates to &gt; 90% of the network (which takes about 10 seconds I think) will not override the original transaction but will be detected as an attempted double spend? But accepting unconfirmed transactions still carries a risk of falling victim to a 51% attack which would be quite expensive to execute and not worth it for everyday type of purchases?

You asked why bitcoin is better than fiat, this is why it is better, just because you do not find this particular use case personally relevant does invalidate this fact...
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:00:55
Sure, money comes in and goes out. But while this is happening the price of goods increases and salaries stay the same. You see where I am going with this?
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:59:19
Lately beet hearing how bitcoin is only used to launder money... Hopefully more articles like this come out to clear that up.
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:03:19
Hmm, they can regulate businesses that deal with bitcoin, not bitcoin itself... nothing to worry about yet
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:24:01
The short answer is Yes. 
The long answer is:  
But you have to make sure to generate the private key for cold storage in such a way that you can be sure that no one could have made a copy of it.  
Also, to cover all the bases, and as a disclaimer, when using an absolute like 'always' the answer will 'always' be 'no' in this context, ex. if a meteor destroys the earth, your coins will not be save in cold storage... etc.
