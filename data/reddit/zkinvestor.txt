You’re 100% right
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:55:49
Bitcoin doesn’t have smart contracts
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:57:22
I downvoted you cuz ur close to -100 and I think that would be a cool milestone 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:42:36
I enjoyed it
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:06:40
It was just released today
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:00:44
Right but any exchange can support it if they want
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:17:17
Good talk 
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:07:00
Currencies are supposed to lose value.
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:37:53
Can move it to any eth address 
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:19:05
Bitcoin is the protocol and bitcoin core is an implementation. He’s not trying to rip on btc rofl.
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:41:10
Are you calling bottom?
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:01:22
The blunt truth
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:11:11
I want 2x too
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:07:21
It buys us more time to develop off chain solutions you cock breathing retard.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:40:59
Core has got to go. They are toxic to the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:53:22
My money is in altcoins LMFAO
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:58:21
Don't bet against the miners
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:56:36
^ blue pilled
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:56:07
I'm here to make $$
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:44:10
Where we're going we won't need banks, comrade.
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:35:00
You’re in the wrong subreddit to be bitching about that mate. Fuck the banks.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:42:07
Do you know what bitcoin is and why it was created?
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:46:18
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:15:42
Such as..?
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:07:54
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:06:54
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:00:42
What's wrong with being known? Arbitrage is legal isn't it?
@_date: 2017-04-26 03:11:45
@_date: 2017-04-26 02:55:01
People have been raided from Purse.io purchases... lol
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:27:19
But they also list unregistered securities. Both Poloniex and Bittrex do for sure.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:17:43
All core has to do is implement 2mb blocks and they maintain "control"
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:35:05
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:34:46
Vechain passes the test ��
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:38:38
I'm not Chinese and I want 2x :(
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:12:42
The only way bitcoin doesn’t exist in 100 years is if every record of the ledger gets deleted... you could say the same about gold.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:46:20
bcash no have segwit
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:41:35
Can you back up these bold claims? 
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:03:48
He's clearly asking how 2mb blocks negatively impact the network... Asks for explanations that have nothing to do with politics and every response is political LOL
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:05:14
Oh no what will bitcoin ever do without you
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:56:47
It's not just CEO's that want 2mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:33:37
Not if core changes a few constants and accepts 2mb blocks so the users and miners can move forward as one.
@_date: 2017-10-03 05:53:39
Idiots think they will get free money from the hf.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:02:34
lol it's definitely intentional. Y'all been drinking too much of that look aid. Buckle up...
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:12:22
If the miners signaling for Segwit2x mine it we will have 4 coins:
* Bitcoin Cash
* Bitcoin PoW HF
* Bitcoin2x
* Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:57:01
Bitcoin fork != bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:18:25
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:19:38
This is really disturbing
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:56:53
