RemindME! April 1st, 2018 "Did BTC hit 100k?"
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:27
Hiding any in the greater DC area? ;)

"In the best interest of the exchange" means whatever makes coinbase the most money.

I sold at 900 USD after the ETF fail :) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:28:49
So this is what statistics degrees are for 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:20
Coinbase will, although vile, always be the place I bought eth at 10 usd and btc at 900 usd.

You can't be pro-bitcoin and pro-Trump... Trump is an authoritarian who exerts more control over people's finances, and the philosophy of bitcoin is directly contradictory with that.

I too remember when this sub had intelligent commentary 
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:54:11
+1 for westworld 
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:12:55
Not really.
If we get even marginally higher voter turnout compared to 2016 he won't stand a chance. Only reason he lost is because of the sheer dislike of Hillary even among her own party. And now, with the unpopularity of Trump, a _lot_ more younger people are motivated to vote against him, even if that means voting for a Corey Booker or Joe Biden type.

So in 2020 we'll finally have a new president, and either à billionaire eating his dick on national TV or I'll be a multimillionaire.
Looking forward to it.

It's the people who are obsessed with being anti government, anti inflation etc. And, the fact that in 90% of comment sections, I see some shit about 'lambos.' 
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:40:59
The last time we had a shitty enough president that he only lasted one term. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:30:37
Definitely not, save it for the trading specific subs

This is actually a common misconception. DC current when at ultra high voltages is actually _more_ energy efficient than AC over long distance. [This link does a pretty good job of explaining it conceptually if you know some basic physics.] ( 
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:06:46
Shit I just remembered I have money on an exchange 
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:51:28
Okay, if you want to nit pick the details. DC Step up and step down circuits are relatively complex, expensive, and must be more precise than the simple two coils of wire AC transformer that you're speaking of. I wasn't implying you could just feed DC into a faraday's law sort of transformer, as for obvious reasons that only works with DC. There are methods for changing DC voltage, however. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:46:27
You must be new here
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:12:16
Neither is safer, we use AC nowadays because it is what our infrastructure was based on, and it would be expensive to make a ton of DC transformers. AC is also the natural current produced by turbines. That's all there is to it.

It took them roughly 5 MONTHS to respond to my support email... About 8 minutes for them to respond to my public tweet. I suggest you tweet coinbase support if you want to get your money back, they helped me within 24 hours of me tweeting them. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:20:12
I could see this happening too! Let's go Elon! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:31:13
Yes. You bought bitcoin in the easiest time. You've only ever experienced a bull market. You've never been in a long term bear market before. All you know is prices going up at ludicrous rates with a correction every two months. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:05:53
You may have been ridiculed, but it's not because you are invested in btc, it's because you don't bother covering the chip on your shoulder. 
Your level of maturity appears to be akin to a 14 year old who just got a 145 on an online iq test and now thinks they're the shit. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:58:20
Why would you mine bitcoin with video cards in this day and age? ASICS are the way to go... 
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:54:59
OP should go in r/iamverysmart, his post history is full of talking about bitcoin and belittling everyone who knows what they're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:51:34
Cut the BS. Nobody knows what is going to happen. If you're in bitcoin for money, do yourself a favor and sell it all right now and get yourself some nice 401k numbers. 
Making posts like this only attracts people who are obsessed about the value of a coin, and reinforces the assumption without basis that this is going to make everyone rich. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:19:51
Biggest use case of bitcoin is transfering money from impatient people to patient whales right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:50:57
Bringing down that long run average cost amIrite

Though, the infighting in the bitcoin community is a lot _tensor_ nowadays. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:53:04
A couple bitcoin is enough for me. If I pay off my college and grad school debt with bitcoin savings, that would be more than enough. And, 75k by July 4 is ridiculous. It might happen, but don't think you sound intelligent by giving an exact prediction. It's a wild guess. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:02:11
You've been in the bitcoin community since february 2017. I have been in the bitcoin community since October 2013. Before calling someone uneducated and an asshat (twice), I suggest you question whether those terms may be applied to yourself.

They're in orbit... Not quite how gravity works.
