I never said buying at 100% premium was a good idea. On the other hand if some moron is willing to pay, I'll gladly sell at 100% premium.
You're thinking of fiat... That's the big legal scam. GBTC is a tool for smart folks to take money from dumb ones.

I know you're being sarcastic, but I believe it did, this is all part of the process. When a market becomes wildly overvalued, smarter investors will profit from the price action and diversify into other assets during bear markets, it's all about preserving value. So really... he helped us get where the market needed to go. 
I'm all about the movement, and that's why I'm fine holding my BTC through multi-year bear markets. That's not the case for GBTC, it's a tool to build value. The movement can't happen in one pump, it needs to grow organically like it has over the years. Sure, some people lost money, but lots of others joined the movement and are holding strong.

I agree you shouldn't invest in something you don't understand... But they may not 'believe' in Bitcoin enough to actually hold it, but they still want to profit from the asset. I know of some institutional investors that understand the need for Bitcoin, but need to play by the existing rules (corrupt as they may be).

Well that escalated quickly... So much is wrong with your perspective, but I can see there's no changing your mind so I'm not going to waste my time. Have a nice day you smart pussy.

While I somewhat agree that regulation isn't supposed to be part of Bitcoin ownership. Tax advantages of trading GBTC in a retirement account is a great way to avoid the legal robbery you speak of and make considerable gains in terms of your fiat holdings.

Just cause it's regulated doesn't mean its stupid proof. The premium on GBTC goes up and down, and you can take advantage of it if you know what you're doing. Sure, you don't actually own any Bitcoin by buying shares, but at the time it was the only way to get exposure to BTC in a tax differed retirement account. The ones that bought at 40k are obviously kicking themselves now, but on the flip side, those that sold when the premium was that overblown made a killing.

��Yup. Everything else claiming to be Bitcoin is an attack on the network and should be treated as such.

Oh, lol then. Sounded exactly like the btrash people. You got me ��

Keep telling yourself that... Faketoshi is the biggest fraud of them all.

I respect your opinion, but I have to disagree. 
If there were 100's (or thousands) of versions of the internet we would never have the internet as we know it today. I think the same rings true with crypto currency, for it to work as intended and take over our debt and inflation based fiat systems, the world has to agree on one version. As of now the large majority agree that is BTC.
From the Bitcoin white paper...
"The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. "
