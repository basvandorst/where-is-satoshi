Gox has halted all bitcoin withdrawal.

And it's up again now.

Grr... stop contributing to my indecisiveness!

PayPal has removed the gift mode for my country so yea, it's definitely a pain in the a** for people who's doing everything legit yet get punished by such a limitation.

What? Destroy the private key? Why would they even do that?
On the other hand, what would they do with the rig itself? Is it a loaned review unit?
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:01:56
Ohh... thanks for the clarification. Will inform my friends since they're looking for those risers as well.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:45:43
Oh well, I'm still contemplating if I should seek for a refund or continue waiting. :S

Based on my experience with BFL, I'm not even sure if I can afford to trust another ASIC developer. :(
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:41:37
Ahh... now I know why your site was out of risers the last time I checked. I was under the impression that you've just simply ran out of risers or perhaps you find risers no longer profitable.
Is there any way where I can get an alert once you have risers back for sale (apart from checking your site daily of course)? Would appreciate it if you can send out an email to your past customers once you have the fiasco resolved. :)

I'm one of the lucky recipients thanks to Lentil-Soup's generosity. Just being curious here; what happened to all the BTC that was accepted &amp; subsequently ignored by those who received the tips? Keyword being accepted which means that they've sent bitcointip an "accept" PM.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:21:53
To be very blunt, I would advise you to forgo your plan to get anything from BFL. While they're affordable compared to the other ASIC developers (at least those that have proven to deliver such as Avalon &amp; ASICMiner), the queue is simply too long &amp; the hashing difficulty would have skyrocketed by the time you finally got your ASIC.
Based on the current update, they've only managed to RECENTLY ship out the ASIC miners to those who placed their orders on the first 3 days &amp; mind you, that was like almost a year ago (around June 2012). I placed my order early this year but I finally cancelled &amp; got my refund back after realizing that it's not going to work out in the long run for me.
EDIT: While the idea of mining is pretty new &amp; exciting, you'll be able to earn more by trading instead. If you insist on trying out mining, move on to the alternate cryptocurrencies such as LTC.

I think this is kinda misleading. No one could have predicted that the price will get bloated so much.
Just take litecoin for example. It's currently priced at around USD 4 (optimistically speaking). If I knew that the price will spike in the next few month, I would have put on a massive buy order by now. :D

Bob joins a very exclusive nudist colony. On his first day he takes off his clothes and starts wandering around. A gorgeous petite blonde walks by him and the man immediately gets an erection. 
The woman notices his erection, comes over to him grinning sweetly and says: "Sir, did you call for me?" 
Bob replies: "No, what do you mean?" 
She says: "You must be new here; let me explain. It's a rule here that if I give you an erection, it implies you called for me." Smiling, she then leads him to the side of a pool, lays down on a towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.
Bob continues exploring the facilities. He enters a sauna, sits down, and farts. Within a few seconds a huge, horribly corpulent, hairy man with a firm erection lumbers out of the steam towards him. The Huge Man says: "Sir, did you call for me?"
Bob replies: "No, what do you mean?" 
The Huge Man: "You must be new here; it is a rule that when you fart, it implies you called for me." The huge man then easily spins Bob around, bends him over the bench and has his way with him.
Bob rushes back to the colony office. He is greeted by the smiling naked receptionist: "May I help you?" 
Bob says: "Here is your card and key back. You can keep the $500 joining fee." 
Receptionist: "But Sir, you've only been here a couple of hours; you only saw a small fraction of our facilities....."
Bob replies: "Listen lady, I am 58 years old, I get a hard-on twice a month, but I fart 15 times a day. No thanks."

Strange that the site failed to load for me but AFAIK, the Windows version of cgminer in that URL work for both x86 &amp; x64.

ASICMiner is selling the Eruptor at 1.99 BTC so I don't see how we can expect the item to be priced at $150.
And yes, I do agree that 1.99 BTC is overpriced.

Many thanks in advance!
I really like the fact that the players are given the choice on what kind of "circle" they would like to play on &amp; switching between the circles are done instantaneously too.
Apart from the 2 yet to be made available circles, I'm hoping that you guys will come up with more entertaining modes in the near future.
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:47:18
He said 2 strangers so I'll be the other one. :D
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:45:25
Seriously, $150 is definitely underpriced.

~~Hmm... color me curious again but do allow me to describe a scenario.~~
~~If you were to tip me 100 BTC &amp; I accepted, the 100 BTC will go into my wallet. Assuming that I gave up or totally forgot about it &amp; moved on with my life, does this mean that there will be only 20,999,900 BTC remaining in circulation?~~
~~Or let's make it easier. If a person who holds 10 million BTC lost his wallet password, does this mean there are only 11 million BTC available for transaction in the market?~~
~~Thanks in advance for the enlightenment.~~
OK, upon re-reading your reply, I believe the answers to my scenarios are double "yes".
