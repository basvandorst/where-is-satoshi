Because of the sanctions there's already a well established network of shadow banks and "money movers" (or whatever they are called) in Iran. I doubt this will have any impact on bitcoin.

Just so you know, that's BOC not PBOC.

Not bad in itself, but it plays into the hands of people who say Bitcoin is used for tax evasion, and could be an argument for legislation against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:21:06
Huh? 
Two different banks. PBOC the central bank and in charge of monetary policy (including the recent development concerning Bitcoin). BOC is just some random Chinese bank that has nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever.

Hm, let me think. Is there a subreddit about currency exchange and finance where they try to brainwash users, use fake accounts to upvote themselves and delete comments they don't like? 
Nah, can't think of any.

Seychelles, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau, Barbados, Cyprus...
There's another way to interpret this data, which doesn't look so good for Bitcoin.

They were bound to do something. The alternative would have been completely banning transfers to exchanges or just making Bitcoin illegal, which they don't seem to want to do.
So this isn't a bad thing at all. I'd expect the market to cool down a bit in the future though, as they'll probably not allow unlimited transfers from CNY -&gt; BTC the way it is now. They have a 50000 USD exchange limit p/p per year in China now if you want to convert CNY, they might start enforcing this with Bitcoin as well.

There is no other way that works consistently (except satellite internet maybe). You're not the first one who's ever travelled to China, we all have to deal with this ;)

That is not the reason. The dollar is just strong atm, it started gaining significantly over other currencies way before Trump got elected! The stock market reacted positively to the election results though.

Doesn't work once you're actually in China. Best to set up your own VPS and route traffic through there, or get a paid VPN service, but there's always problems with those. Either way it's a pain.

Just read through the comments here. The average person who buys bitcoin is raving mad, lol. 
The old Keynes quote (“The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”) is very true for Bitcoin too. 
From one critical thinker to another: I've been thinking "the price is going to crash back to a sensible level any minute now" for the last half a year. It just keeps going up. Doesn't make any sense, but that's how it is. People keep buying, for some reason. There are very few trustworthy news sources reporting on the Bitcoin market, so it's hard to know what's going on. Might be developing countries getting in big now, might be corporations buying in, or just good old Bitcoin speculation. I wouldn't be too surprised if it keeps going up, but am not going to invest more at this time. Not selling either though.
Oh, and altcoins, like others said. That may be a big factor too.

Fair enough.
If you're that broke and still playing around with Bitcoin you may have a gambling problem though ;)

THAT is the rational explanation? It couldn't be the uncertainty with Bitcoins potential first fork coming up soon. Also we had an insane rally just before that and price was bound to drop a bit anyway...

You took the words out of my finger tips. Ridiculous!

Yes, if peoples goal is to withdraw Bitcoin, they can withdraw ETH and then sell them for BTC on a foreign exchange. That is until next time the Chinese government bans cryptos. 
The question is, why allow 10x the amount of ETH, which is indeed weird, don't you think? Also the yearly limit for converting Yuan to foreign currency is $50000 - so if you could really withdraw 230,000 DAILY, that would be huge for rich Chinese people with money they have to bring abroad. I'm a bit sceptical if those numbers are indeed true.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:05:25
Even if you're broke 4.8 Million is still much better. It's because of the math that $780 is way less than 4.8 Million and such.

Guys, I'm considering signing up, because owning all 21m Bitcoins sounds like a good deal to be honest. 
But I'm a bit worried about how it will affect the price if one person owns all of the coins? Could the price fall, because there is no market anymore?

There are Chinese people who can write proper articles too, you know? ;) 
Still, I agree with you, better than nothing. Very interesting to see this happen in Sichuan, I used to live there. Too bad they didn't even mention where it is exactly.

Welcome to Bitcoin :)
Your proof is right there in the blockchain. Of course not if you moved them around a lot, in that case I'm not sure. Personally I just have my coins sitting in a paper wallet. Easy to prove.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:46:24
That's not cheap though, that's a reasonable fee!

No one here in Mainland Europe is worried. Not sure where you get your information from.
Investors aren't worried either, the Euro has been gaining on the Dollar recently and European stocks have had a strong year so far.
People are more worried about the US at the moment.

Sure it has the potential. The same way every ETH speculant is practically a Lambo owner already. Bitcoin also has the potential to go really really low, or even to zero, if certain legislation is passed in enough countries. 
But I don't trade based on FUD, and I don't trade dreams. We won't see a trillion dollar market cap in the next 5 years, but I will absolutely re-evaluate my position and maybe move more money into Bitcoin should the market move in that general direction.

Yep. Not that this sub ever was a bastion of quality information, but lately it's getting ridiculous. A bit more **moderation** would be good! 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:45:47
Well, that is generally sound advice for novice investors. Maybe it should come with the disclaimer that the exception is when you're in an obvious tulip-mania-style bubble :) 
You're right about not taking investment advice from reddit, or anyone for that matter. If you want to actively invest you have to do your own research. There is something to be learned from watching how other people invest though.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:18:29
OP, sell as much bitcoin as you would like NOW and put the money in a broad, passive index fund! Something that will generate income and appreciate in value (with fluctuations) over the course of your whole life - practically guaranteed. 
I believe in Bitcoin but don't let the fanatics talk you into something stupid. Bitcoin is still a very risky asset! You're not a millionaire yet until you have sold your coins. It's OK to go all in if you only have $500 in the bank, but at this point you should cash out a bit and take the profit.
I'm pretty envious at all those millionaires coming out here these days. Good luck to you OP!
@_date: 2017-06-13 09:22:45
Reading my comment again I see the irony, haha.
Discussing possible Bitcoin forks and such should be allowed of course, and I'm absolutely against the way they tried to censor this sub before. But this trolling and shilling by altcoin users has to stop. r/CryptoCurrency is for discussing general crypto topics. Unfortunately few people are using that because they are busy spam posting here.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:54:17
Absolutely. 
Following Bitcoin over the years I still would not have invested at $3000 though ;)

Stocks aren't in a "massive bubble". You're probably one of the people who bought in at $2800. I believe in Bitcoin, but I'll buy more after everyone panic sold when they found out the price of Bitcoin doesn't only go up, it can also go down :)
