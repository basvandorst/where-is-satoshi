I'm already chill. He was the one who was all aggressive and salty for a small correction.
So why don't you just chill sis?
(See what I did there?)

I don't want special treatment.
The point you are failing to get is that dude isn't nor has ever been gender neutral. I just don't like being called a dude: Cause its wrong and based on a misogynistic assumption. 'Mkay sis?
Hey here's an idea: Why not assume we're all Americans too? After all "it's the internet"....(weak justification rolleyes)

I have no problem with that legislation. Long overdue imho. Alas, I'm not Canadian, unfortunately the US seems headed in the opposite direction as of late.
Anyway just hodl &amp; store it on your Ledger/Trezor before you go in, it will be worth a lot more once you are released :D

Which one? Vitalik? Vlad? Gavin? Joseph? Clearly you're wrong.

It's pretty clear from his chosen reddit name "Soflodude32" .......... :)

1. I'm not a dude.
2. Emojis would have helped convey sarcasm.

Sure thing, sis.

Exactly. A larger amount of people voted for the DAO fork than voted for the current Bitcoin hard fork. Ethereum is actually more decentralized than Bitcoin in that respect.

Anecdotal evidence is not definitive.
"My friend said..." does not fly in scientific, linguistic, legal or any other fact based circle.
All you have is one person's opinion. Learn the difference between fact and opinion please. There are a variety of reasons you friend may have said what she said. Among them to make you feel comfortable with her.

BUT: The definition of dude is *not* gender neutral. So "can be" does not equal correct. I can call you anything but that does not make it correct either.
Try this... google: dude definition
Or just go here...
Additionally, please find me any woman who uses dude in their username...
You're just arguing for arguments sake at this point. And you're still wrong.

lol :-)
Back on topic. I've always looked at Marketcap as an indicator of long term momentum, nothing more, nothing less.

Not on the subreddits I frequent. BTW: please consult a dictionary. You'll find that Dude isn't gender neutral.

You can call me whatever you want but it's my right not to accept it if it is in error. ie: "bro"
