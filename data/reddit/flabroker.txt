Then why are so many companies (Fidelity, Goldman, ICE, Mark Cuban, etc.etc) and countries (Malta, Brazil, Germany, etc.etc) investing so much in to Bitcoin? There is a company the even bought a coal fired power plant in Australia just to run mining rigs. People smarter than you and me know there is a future in Bitcoin and they are investing in it. It's not a fad and not a game. It has real world implications and that is why politicians are scared. Where it will go nobody knows, the only thing for sure is it is not going to zero. It is making too big of an impact on those that need it for more than a get rich quick investment. It is enabling people a lot less fortunate than us. That is where it's value is and it will carry the same value to people like us as well.

I cared for both my parents until the day they passed. I know for sure that they both lost the ability to even understand their own personal finances by the time the first one passed. I have a plan in case I pass unexpectedly, but as we both get older I think estate planning will require our children to have more control and hopefully crypto will be more understood by then.
That being said, a hardware wallet or Iron Key for storage are a good start. The question is to hide the hardware wallet or hide the password? How are the two reconnected at time of passing? I change my mind daily to this question.
I would never rely on an online service or website to be a link in the solution. It should all be kept offline or even off computer.

 new investors I like them to do this.
1) Download Electrum portable to a USB. 
2) Run it on a computer that is not connected to the internet.
3) Etch or punch your seed words on a military style blank dog tag which you can order from Amazon. Store the dog tag in a safe place. It won't burn up, it's metal and I have seen them survive aircraft fires.
4) Export the public key to the usb so you can import it to a new wallet online and monitor your addresses.
5) Now that you have your seed words and public key. Destroy everything you did on the offline computer and remove the usb. Make sure you DO NOT transfer the wallet to the online computer. Only the public keys for monitoring.
5) If you are familiar with the TAILS OS it is great for running Electrum which is built in to create new wallets offline.

I don't mind converting it when I need to. I just want to be my own bank. If the world insists on using fiat, then the best alternative for me would be a debit card that I could load from my BTC Wallet. If I need fiat, just transfer some BTC to an address that loads a Debit Card would work for me.

My question is, how will you buy the bitcoin? My house is paid for. Worth over $200k. If I leveraged $100k how would you recommend I buy the BTC. One wire transfer to the exchange? One big buy order? Or DCA with my debit card at $3k per day? I am interested what everybody thinks.

I have tried enlightening people about bitcoin often to be discouraged that I could not convince them of it's value.

You realize crypto currencies are against everything our Government believes? They can not profit and control without fiat. There are some in Congress that personally support it, but as a whole the best we can hope for is for them to drag their feet long enough that they won't be able to completely kill it. They will regulate and strangle exchanges to squeeze out tax revenue and prevent it from destroying the dollar so they can get rich. They won't be able to take bribes and donations from the lobbies because that would be recorded in the ledger. You can already hear to talking points by those that have been tasked to slow it down until they can try and figure out how to control and uncontrollable force.
Any newly elected President is going to learn that he/she can not govern without fiat. We are too far in debt. To switch to Bitcoin would start our account balance and budget at -$23,000,000,000,000.

I used to push BTC to all my friends. I finally figured out it wasn't that they doubted it, they just couldn't afford it. The average person does not invest anymore. They do not have a 401K or an IRA. They live from paycheck to paycheck and have no clue how they are going to retire. It makes no sense for them to buy BTC because they will need that money this year for one thing or another that they can not pay for with BTC or they are paying off their credit card from the last vacation they took. Most people are living in the moment afraid to lift their head high enough to see the future because to them the future is full of uncertainty.

I generated a seed with Electrum. All the words generated are included in the list linked above. However, when I go back to restore the wallet from my list of the first four letters of each seed word, Electrum gives me multiple words to select from with the same first four letters. So if I kick the bucket, and my wife goes to electrum to restore my wallet, she is not going to know which word to select from the multiple words displayed. I selected the BIP39 option on the screen where you enter your seed and the additional words are still displayed that are not contained in the BIP39 word list. I do not know where they come from.

that being said, you are looking for files called wallets, or "Seed Words" or long mixed numbers and letters without spaces. This is where the bitcoins are. 
If you find wallet.dat or wallet files, those contain bitcoin. An SD card is one of those flat memory cards like you find in a digital camera. Look for programs on his computer that could be associated with bitcoin. Find out what that program is. If you can identify what program he was using for a wallet or if he was using a website to store bitcoins then you may be able to open the wallet. 
You need to research about bitcoin wallets and how they work. You need to understand that the coins are protected by keys and that you should not expose those keys to anybody. There are public keys and private keys, you need to understand the difference.
If you find 12 or 24 random words, those will restore a wallet that you can not get in to.

You can create transactions on a live PC using your Mater Public Key and then use a usb to transfer the transaction to the Tails PC and sign it. Transfer it back to send it. Tails PC never goes online.

In this case the local hometown bank and free checking didn't even offer offer ACH transfers unless you had a business account.

If you are DCA it may make sense if you are looking for a dip. USDC is a stable coin,1:1 with USD. If you want to put your money on the exchange via debit card or small deposit, you can just buy USDC. Keep holding the USDC until the price drops and then pull the trigger on a larger buy. It is easier than trying to do a wire or ACH at the last minute to try and buy a dip at 2 am or doing multiple small wires or ACH.

Let's say I work a mindless job at Walmart and I live in my Mom's basement. I can't take off to go to a bank and do a wire or ACH and $15 in fees to send Coinbase a $100 a week. The only way I can buy is using my Debit Card to make an instant purchase after my paycheck is deposited on Friday because you can't deposit USD in to your account with a debit card. So I buy USDC every week and add to my USDC-BTC limit order because the guy in the sporting goods section told me that BTC is going to drop to $7800 again next month and he knows this because his sister dates this really cool guy that knows about Bitcoin.

Right now this is my savings account. This is where I put money for a rainy day. As long as it is worth more next year than this year, it is working for me. I have money I use to invest in other ventures hopefully to make my fortune. This is the cash I keep on the sidelines. There is no other asset I know of that was "DESIGNED" to hold value. Wall Street can create all the derivatives, ETF's, Futures they want, there will only ever be a certain number of Bitcoins. Before Bitcoin I held gold, only to learn there is paper gold.

Use offline CD ISO. Unplug network cable and do not enable wifi. It is as air gapped as you can get. My tails computer does not have a hard drive installed. always boot from cd. After doing anything with your wallet, shut down that session of Tails. Wallet encryption is as good as any. Just need to secure your password and seed and physically protect your usb stick with your wallet.

buy a $50 of BTC, set up two wallets, learn how to transfer $10 bucks back and forth then learn how to transfer it all from the two wallets to a hardware wallet. Once it is secure in a hardware wallet, transfer your 500 coins to the hardware wallet then go look for help with your questions. about cashing out and tax liability.

If you only think of it that way, yea is seems kinda flimsy. But take a step back and look at all the money flowing in to Bitcoin in all the other aspects such as hardware purchases and software development and some companies even buying power plants to power their mining operations. Millions and millions of dollars are being "invested" in the network. Huge amounts spent on mining hardware. People a lot smarter than me are writing these checks.

If I were under 30 I would be putting all my eggs in the BTC basket. No other opportunity has the same upside potential right now. I am just saying what I would do. Others may not be prepared for the alternative outcome. You have to ask yourself, if it all went to hell and I lost everything, what would I do. Well, I have been there and done that more than once and I wouldn't be were I am today without taking those risks more than once, and yes, it didn't always work out.

I guess this isn't that bad. Just glad I tested it. I love the Electrum Wallet and it is easy for newbies too. I especially like that it is built in to TAILS. So I have made it my standard. It isn't too hard to backup entire seed words. You only have to do it once.

The only reason people post these BTC videos is to get views to earn money. I doubt any of them are interested in posting to an alternative site just so you can watch them for free. If they can't get paid, they aren't going to produce videos.

When you bought you were probably thinking that the price would more than double in a couple of years. Now wait those couple of years and see how you feel then. I bet you will feel better. If you buy more now, you may feel even better in a year.

I see huge money being invested in all areas of Bitcoin by huge players. It won't happen over night, but I do believe it will happen. I read an article today about proof of custody. I think this is one of the major stumbling blocks to institutional investment, but it will be resolved and when it is, the flood gates are going to open bitcoin to being a recognized store of value. 
Anybody that is invested right now and truly believes in the technology knows there is a lot of work to be done. This is all part of the acceptance phase.

The question was, "What would you do?" I assumed most people would make some sort of financial decision and take an action based on the scenario I presented. I wondered how much, if any, people in this forum would invest in BTC, or pay toward the mortgage, or do nothing.

I am a Real Estate Broker and I manage over 300 properties in addition to the ones I own myself. It is definitely a matter of picking good tenants, and as a manager, good landlords. I rehab all my own properties and have weeded out the bad contractors and vendors. I have a good list of people to call when I need them. Our county is one of the top in the nation according to Realtytrac for price to rent ratios.  I plan to never sell my rentals, I will leave them to my wife and then kids. God knows most kids these days won't have a dime to their name to retire.
I posed this question to see how many people would suggest something other than throwing it all at Bitcoin. Their are a lot of smart people here. I was surprised.
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:32:31
This is what I would do and have done already.
Buy a rental property with the $100k. The rent will pay the off the mortgage in less than 12 years. The property purchased will have no mortgage. Do it again. This is called BRRRR (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat). Cost is less than $100k, rent is $1000+, and appraisal is over $130k. 
Do this 10 times and you have assets over $1m and monthly income over $10,000
You only need one paid off home or cash for one to start. Tenants pay for the mortgages and will be retirement income. Leave the properties to your kids. Teach them how to multiply their portfolio.
Remember this when you have enough BTC to pay off a house.

If the price was going up $20 per day every day you would not sell because you want that extra $20 tomorrow. It is frustrating to watch it go down but just keep the attitude that in 2+ years you will recover that $20 per day you are missing right now.
My attitude is every day I HODL is $20 in my pocket (regardless what the market is doing today) between now and my end game plan.
