Thanks for your kind words! The cottage will be for rent from march 2014 onward (for £'s, anyway). The website itself is having issues at the moment and they can't show the prices for all the houses on there, I've emailed them about it and they said they have their IT team on it so hopefully it should be sorted soon. As a rough guide though, they decided on the price and have about 10 different pricing points depending on the time of year - they vary from £320 to just under £800 I think (but that's only at the best times like xmas + new year).

They already know. They're coming. This is it. The end.

I'm hoping things pick up here in the UK, it feels like we're lagging behind in btc acceptance compared to a lot of places. We'll get there, hopefully soon.

The options I've came up with so far are 1) fly to Aberdeen or Inverness 2) train to Aviemore 3) drive. Getting a taxi from Aviemore would be ~£30 I think. Getting to Tomintoul from Aberdeen or Inverness airport, well that I'm not too sure about. I'd guess a taxi split between people would be cheaper than hiring a car? I've yet to look at bus options. This is new to me too, only bought it in Sept this year.

Yes, sorry I should have pointed that out
