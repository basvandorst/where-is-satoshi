While I agree morally that lost money should be returned, the engineer in me morbidly wants to see them keep it as punishment for poor system design.  He (the GP) didn't spend the man hours testing and securing his system.  He didn't pay the proper price up front and now he's going to pay over a protracted amount of time as bugs and exploits start cropping up.  He's running a business if I understand it correctly; hemorrhaging money that isn't yours to random accounts is more morally wrong in my book.

With the inefficient code of minecraft, up until recently you'd need a dedicated rig for that :P

The network is operating at something like 70 terrahashes/sec tops.  If the government wanted to end this they easily have access to enough computing power to take ownership of the network and do whatever they want

I agree with you in that it would be ideal, but I feel that we first need more merchants to accept bitcoins as payment before it would be possible.  In the meanwhile accepting bitcoins as a payment but immediately converting them to USD feels to me like a good enough solution to move ourselves closer to that end goal.

With the volatility of bitcoin it really doesn't make sense to hold them for use as currency at the moment.  What does it matter to bitcoin if they hold onto them or sell them to bitpay?  Who is going to accept bitcoin purchases for a merchants materials, supplies and bills?  Won't those coins just go back into circulation as bitpay cashes out, allowing the consumer to buy those coins back?

Well I can think of one reason, they're not done yet.  With this much downward momentum in the market it's a lot easier to keep pushing now than later.  I expect that if there was malicious interference either from greedy script kiddies or from governments we'll see more of it today and later this week.

Engineering vs soft science!  Glad you were here to stem some of the hate on log charts.

It's only creepy if you let it.
