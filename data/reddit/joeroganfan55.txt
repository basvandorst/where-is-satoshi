I really appreciate your response. This was a very thorough response and it makes complete sense. Just wanted to see the big picture so this helps immensely. Thank you!

Yes, but in this instance they’re simply using a third party as a converter for their Bitcoin and no company is actually using the Bitcoin. It’s still all cash that they’re holding right?

That’s fair I guess. I’m just trying to see the big picture here so I appreciate your input!

The currency risk comes from the translation from Euro to USD. So business in Europe is obviously conducted in Euros. Once they translate the currency to USD from overseas to their headquarters in the US, is where the fluctuations come in. It’s not done instantly. Could you imagine the fluctuations (up or down) if a company waited even a day to convert Bitcoin to USD?

That’s the sense I’m getting as well. However, is this counterintuitive to the idea? I feel that there’s two schools of thought:
1) Bitcoin is a store of value so let’s hold on to it.
2) Bitcoin is the future currency so let’s spend it to get volume up.

But are they? Do people really only have their money in Bitcoin? 
I don’t think people will suddenly switch to AT&amp;T because they accept Bitcoin? 
That’s assuming that the customer has all of their cash in Bitcoin. It’s not binary. Most people I would like to think, still have some sort of cash on hand.

This. This is very important. That’s another point in my original post I was trying to make. That (besides what you mentioned) the currency risk is something that the companies would never take on.

So that the money (specifically USD) is easily transferable right? 
My point is that if I have a Bitcoin, I can now use that to pay my AT&amp;T bill. Great! But the headlines read that AT&amp;T is now accepting Bitcoin. That’s not true. It’s the third party taking Bitcoin and giving AT&amp;T the cash.
I now understand that it can be used as a medium of exchange to pay bills but to me, this shows that since the companies aren’t holding the Bitcoin, they’re too risky and volatile to hold and they still prefer cash&gt;Bitcoin.

Yeah as much as I understand the arguments made in this post, I’m a skeptic as well. This is essentially the argument I was trying to make.
