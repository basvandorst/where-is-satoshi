As much as people dont like to listen to this it is fact. Bitcoin is no good for micro transactions so no good to buy daily coffees and teas
But it is a currency and has been used for years on the dark web. 
Its a currency for free trade, real free trade l, real capitalism not selective like the current banking system. 
If you wanted to buy 100 iranian horses right now you couldnt because as soon as you send any money to an iranian bank your funds will be frozen.
If you wanted to buy 1000 microchips from russia you would have to jump through hoops to make a transaction purely due to crappy banking rules, sanctions.
Bitcoin enables free trade that anyone can send any amount to anyone in the world. It is impossible to shut it down as it is not run on any server it is decentralised and everyone who is running a node has a copy of the ledger. 
It cannot be hacked impossible to hack - i repeat it cannot be hacked all the news you read about bitcoin hacks is because people store it on a central server like an exchange. The whole point of bitcoin is that it is decentralised which means you do not have to trust a single party. 
It has a fixed supply of 21million coins and a new block is found every 10mins. We currently up to just over 16 million
The current banking system is on overdose each major central bank is just printing money and passing on to retail banks who are passing on to high street lenders who are selling on to more shady lenders. In the uk people are being offered credit cards, unsecured loans and car loans and these people clearly do not have the means to pay this money back- oh wait isnt that a bubble or tulip mania - of course it is but its ok because the governments are ok with it and they will bail the banks out when shit hits the fan and the ordinary hard working people will pay for it
Satoshi nakamoto stuck his middle finger up at this policy in 2009 and now the nakamoto dream has come true 
Everyone who doesnt trust the bank, or cant bank due to sanctions or due to law restrictions is now using bitcoin, or other cryptocurrency and there is nothing anyone can do about it 
This is the cypherpunks revolution and its here and everyone is trying to stop it but its going no where. Bitcoin is here to stay be part of the 21 million club buy one today for your kids for your grand kids they will thank you one day

This is a bit like the well known story of the internet
“ in 2001 george smith in the uk dug 100 feet undrground and found an old cable network and claimed that the brits had the internet since 1980’s
In the sam year sam saylor from bay area usa dug 200 ft and found the same network and claimed that usa had internet since 1970s
In the same year jaswanti nagraj chaturvedi from gujarat india dug 500ft into the ground and didnt find anything however claimed that india was more advanced than the brits and usa as india had gone wireless way back in 1970 thats why he didnt find anything
