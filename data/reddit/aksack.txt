Bitcoins are fiat, they are backed by nothing. You mean you don't want government-used fiat.

If the dollar was being crushed in terms of value due to printing money it would increase the price of bitcoins as more and more dollars were created. This is opposite what happened, so apparently bitcoin is more worthless than you thought, and/or the dollar is even more valuable.

That assumes that the "sane" assumption is that it is very, very likely that prices will rise significantly in the future. I don't see this being a likely outcome at all. 
A more "sane" argument would be that bitcoin was driven largely by speculators, people who believed it was a hedge against the upcoming runaway inflation, and that the same people who bought into gold were buying it, but in reality people are abandoning those positions because they were wrong. A "sane" position would be to dump all, or most of your bitcoins as soon as possible, because the economics models calling for all of the above outcomes were wrong, and will continue to be wrong in the future. 
Even if you think bitcoin will increase in the future, almost all near-term forecasts show a significant increase in the dollar, and it would be more "sane" to invest in dollars than bitcoin if that is expected to happen.

One guy makes a statement saying he is getting out and this joke crashes by this much. All on a day when markets, which bitcoin is usually seen as an alternative to, decline by a lot too. Big shock a new monetary system/currency created and run by people who don't know about monetary policy is a failure.
