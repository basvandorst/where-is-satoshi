@_date: 2017-08-30 15:38:24
Yea but the word tumbler was used often 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:56:12
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:49:52
Probably because these guys havnt figured out how to mix yet 
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:20:46
Got some bitcoin the other idea and heard about the fees. It was a turn off any idea why so high and when it will go down ? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:05:20
DIDNT buy had no funds also I’m still searching for a cheap alternative to purchase without ID
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:08:13
I considered doing this. Do you know if coinbase accepts Passports as ID ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:43:27
Agreed F- CB but it’s the easiest method to buy for noobs and most don’t even care what’s going on in this space they’re just trying to get in on all this money 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:05:38
Guys let’s do this already, 2018 bowl 
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:35:11
By trades do you mean selling to individuals or just selling your coins on a platform before a dip then buy back and repeat ?
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:47:49
So I'm guessing when it gets pass 1 million a lot of ppl won't cash out to fiat and begin to spend there investment 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:47:44
spread it around the community or do a give away on social media have 800 ppl set up wallets 
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:32:12
Anything I should know before I get started trading BTC ? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:54:48
i understand the risk i'm not new or looking for someone whose new to this i'm just putting it out there i want to do a deal via paypal and be willing to exchange facebook etc i'd also pay first if the person looks trustworthy enough
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:31:27
if you want the community to be stronger your going to have to share 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:26:41
Havnt seen any wonders yet maybe you can help me find them 
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:04:19
Anyone know when the public will be able to do this ?
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:20:54
Honestly don't think so and if it will happen it would be years into future from now well after Blockchain Project start showing some type of success 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:52:29
We need an official charity coin or something 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:45:22

@_date: 2017-09-04 16:56:48
lol these guys being anal I'll just go to an ATM
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:05:10
Now what ? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:14:23
Bought an X amount was charged 14% didn't have change and inserted $2 extra so I kind of wanted to know did the ATM give me X amount or X amount plus $2 but I think the last part you said cleared that up 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:32:55
So the ATM doesn't charge a fee ? Ok 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:02:25
I want to bank but that 4-6 kind of irritating. I just spent 15% of fees at an ATM so yea not trying to do that again either. Thanks for the tip tho I checked but they don't support my bank 
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:36:31
Why couldn't he just do it online ? Lol 
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:27:33
lol I'm curious why did you sell with the price rising back to 5k ?
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:33:55
Thanks. Where would I go to do this ? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:40:11
Did u try it before putting it away ? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:22:28
The smart ones bought up Alts for cheap while the herd bought more bitcoin to “ double “ there profits.. now if you been buying up alt for a few satoshi they will be pumping very soon 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:26:05
Possible I’m praying for a fall to 3k while Alts go green 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:48:55
Update: after about 5 tries the I got my password correct and my money is now x18 what it was worth in 2015 
I'd never thought I would see this wallet again and didn't care much for it I figured so many other ppl lost there's to similar ignorance so oh well. 10 mins ago I decided to type the word bitcoin into my iPhone mail search bar and went to the oldest email right away and here we are 
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:13:46
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:25:28
It’s cool. Can I ask some trading questions like what % do you charge on trades and what pen you use to identify counterfeit. I was going thru your history because of your s/n and I’ve berb contemplating doing the same on LocalBTC
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:39:24
why did you stop trading 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:48:21
From what I gather it's ppl selling for BTC because of a potential bull run in October/ November plus bonus coins after the split 
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:24:56
Should of called the dude out after the presentation make a fool out of them 
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:55:29
whats the trend
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:06:35
first 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:28:08
Using it right now. How does it remember me if I don't register? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:55:21
Let's just treat it like gold the blueprint has been Laid out for us already 
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:24:47
You're looking for someone with funds and knowledge to do this ? Also what % will the ATM be taking ? How much does the " bitcoin guy " take 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:27:17
This problem was solved already hope bout you stop dick eating ?
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:45:08
you can own a whole coin you dont have to buy it all at once
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:02:36
What's so good about bread wallet ?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:41:37
When we first started creating a currency out of gold real gold coins etc I'm sure the market price continued to fluctuate let's study how the Greek did it 
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:49:31
Havnt gotten around to that yet if I'm not mistaken they offer a 100% anonymous coin ? That has value to darkweb and anyone who wants to make a private purchase of 100 dildos or coke so when looking for a altcoin that's what ppl need to be looking at. What does this coin offer or do that bitcoin doesn't and on a realistic level how can it be implemented into the real world. Follow the coin on social media read up on news just like any start up be invested into that coin other than just owning some and right now altcoins are giving bitcoin a second life because in order to cash out into fiat almost all of those altcoins will have to be swapped into bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:36:20
Yea but back then I'm  sure every city had a market place where ppl would go and trade goods buy food etc so I would consider that the market place. the Economy has a major role to play also determining how much something is worth bitcoin is still at the early stages in the experiment we need to adopt it into real life. I saw a YouTube video today of a guy who bought a Lamborghini with bitcoin that's the first Lamborghini purchase ever with bitcoin idk how much he paid in bitcoin but personally I wouldn't pay more than him in bitcoin. Let's say he paid 200BTC idc if the price went up 5% in a week or below 5% I wouldn't pay more than 200BTC for that same model, color etc Lamborghini 
But idk man I'm just brainstorming I feel like we have had a fluctuating currency in the past and we found a way to handle it and we will adapt again and figure out a system that works. I also believe in the future we won't be seeing gains like we did today with in a 24 hour period that should get the price more stable thru out a year 
But yeah I'm just Brain storming thing we need to figure out in the long run 
Do we back Bitcoin by gold or USD 
How to handle the fluctuating price in the short and long run
How much bitcoin should a slice of pizza be worth ? 
How do we determine a slice of pizza should cost that amount of bitcoin 
We can look back at the past and find answers to a lot of questions and mistakes we made. I am going to do more research until I answer my own questions 
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:09:29
the same way we can live in a world with multiple currencies we will be able to survive with multiple coins. All this is new territory we will find a way to crack down on scam ICO's hopefully. And the best way to test the technology of a coin is buying a fraction which shouldn't cost you no more than a $1 on average 
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:14:11
I've seen 0.5 fee can't remember where. But I signed up a few days ago didn't understand it much 
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:33:27
Seem legit 
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:17:53
Yep but not double the value 
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:45:34
Not exactly true. Most ppl are thinking to small and not seeing the potential block chain technology has for the future some of these coins are start ups with a real goal and backing iOTA for example imagine pulling up to a parking meter and having your car pay your meter without getting out or crossing a toll bridge. This thing is bigger than just bitcoin now. And yes I know they're overwhelming coins but the one I mentioned is what I'm looking for projects that will be up and running in 2018 and show real world value
And why do we need a whole new coin to do this ? Because the devs of that coin made it do things that bitcoin can't like make instant micro payments and zero fees 
And I understand why you're optimistic. We have yet to get a successful block chain project I believe we will sooner or later and I'm looking for that gem 
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:10:40
Where would be the best place to sell them
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:41:01
How do we value our country currency ? Against gold I think. I'm all in favor of losing the comparison to USD but how would we know how much to give for a slice of pizza
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:08:47
via family/friends ? or it being sent as a gift ? i mean i seen deals done in the market place that went well so its possible to make an honest deal but i also get it there are scammers running around 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:07:42
they need to hire more or better support 
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:20:52
Getting cash out. Hopefully fees get lower in the future and ppl can buy for under 2%
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:34:40
Is that all it takes for ppl to gamble there money ? The coin is offering nothing if you want to get in before a dump and make some money by all means but let's not act like this coin is going somewhere and will do anything special in the future 
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:48:26
I think a lot of ppl think in a situation like a global crisis or recession BTC would sky rocket but it would be the opposite like blevok said ppl will want to cash out and it would be less ppl investing on something risky. We have yet to see a successful block chain project 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:37:04
Got a few picks in there but I'm terrible at buying a ALTs I don't have a windows laptop so I can't download a wallet for most and majority never seem to have a paper wallet generator 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:02:22
that would be fucking awesome
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:24:54
if i wanted to sell that bitcoin to you am i responsible for what you do with it ?
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:26:22
At first I thought the same then I started looking at ALTcoins and what they offered to the real world. Things like faster transactions for like buying goods or paying a parking meter etc I see a use for ALTcoins now. I'm hoping we get a REDcross coin or something so we can donate when natural disasters Happen and better yet track where the money is going 
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:32:43
I second this 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:53:09
Interesting read
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:35:25
What I learned early on is now is always a best time to get in and if it drops after oh well most of us are playing the long game 
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:28:33
Yea I was just wondering how it worked incase my IP changes or i clear cookies �� 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:38:37
Studying the charts I guess. Same way ppl try to get out before a dip studying the charts 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:06:59
lets go post this in personalfinance and troll
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:20:06
Is this a new bot ? Since when did we get this !
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:11:41
does somebody need to be buying the exact amount for my limit price for an order to work ?
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:48:52
IOTA does instant micropayments without fees bitcoin does not. You would have to wait hours to a day sometimes for confirmation. With this coin it will be instant. Now let's say we don't use a cryptocurrency and we use something like Apple Pay at a toll someone can easily charge back later this way the city gets there coins no hassle But what if we somehow implemented a device into our cars that allows us to make payments without pulling out a card or getting out for cash at ATM etc  the payment industry is now trying to make contactless payments a thing so why not use this new technology to stop fraud and the best thing about this is everything is already set up straight out the box and no one has ownership over the Blockchain. Blockchain technology will be able to do things we couldn't imagine and it will reshape the payment industry right now a lot of ppl are crowded up in a circle thinking about how bitcoin will make them a millionaire and if it don't it failed but it's bigger than that. Trust me when I say there are billion dollar companies with think tanks seeing how they can use this technology for there business and if there's an ALTCOIN that's beneficial to them they are going to throw millions at it. I believe within the next 3-5 years we will walk into a business and Blockchain technology will be at the tip of everyone tongues. And if we support these projects we are supporting bitcoin we are showing the world this thing can be successfully 
All Cryptocurrencies need to be regulated and we need to legitimize this whole thing we are at ground zero of this thing and have the power to change the world right now 
There's a reason the cryptocurrency market follows bitcoin so closely ALTCOINS are currently  relying on the success of bitcoin to legitimize there projects and the fact some require bitcoin to purchase there altcoin only fuels the success of our bitcoin 
We need to treat altcoins like we would treat uber or airBnB expose the fakes support the real coinmarketcap.com needs better regulating so we can get rid of the shit coins and only coins who meet a certain requirement can be listed 
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:32:53
Sounds like a plan. Will you put all in if there's another dip ? Or take a little off the top 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:11:20
How much did the massage parlor guy get you for 
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:23:15
Your in the dip buy now
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:09:45
checked it out yesterday im still not sure what it offers like a lot of shitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:09:40
Thanks for the advice I'm starting to be aware of that 
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:15:43
That's understandable I look at the coins like a share in a company now. But remember I said certain coins do things that bitcoin cannot and in the future I'm thinking we will have more mobile wallets that can hold all atl coins and do a atomic swap within the app 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:14:21
We may not live to see this experiment to the end 
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:29:09
If I didn't use there website how else would I find out about other altcoins ?
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:39:27
You can suggest a bitcoin ATM , Poloniex , Changelly take a look at those platforms they would be paying a higher fee than coinbase 
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:25:23
looks great. i'll enjoy it alot if it tracks alot of alts
