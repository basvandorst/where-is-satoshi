Hey man, this is amazing. Great work. I'm a design director working on a similar project. I'd love to connect and chat more. Is it cool if I reach out through a PM?

damn this is such a great quote. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:31:18
I can imagine! 
@_date: 2014-05-28 14:03:43
Do you need designers?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:50:39
can't wait, thanks for doing this OP!
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:45:35
yea, we're talking potential lifetime regret for 80k.
If it was millions, the argument changes but 80k will last you a few years at most. Then what do you do?

you're lucky this was so good, I was initially disappointed it wasn't a star wars meme.

Dank AF. Someone call r/dankmemes.

ya, did someone manage to take it? How could the username become available so quickly?
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:38:48
looks like some random has it right now?
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:50:48
but that sounds like great advice? Please advise in regards to point 4!

See, I heard something about Tether, and wasn't sure if they had their own token, or what USDT actually was.
Thanks for clarifying a bit.

I mean I've sat through the volatility for three years now, and I am a long-term holder.
I'm just looking for a way to invest more heavily on these downturns by using what I have in a smart way as opposed to investing more outside funds.

Thanks for the warning :)
Any other cyrpto's look relatively stable to you? Litecoin used to be a go-to for some I heard, until recently lol.
I wonder if these anchor type crypto's keep failing due to the idea that peg their coin to a fiat currency.
Starting to wonder if we create a crypto and pin it to a stable commodities or metal, bond or ETF (aside from gold, which someone has done) but something a lot more stable in price?

waaaat just happened to the market? Did some big news drop?

YOU CALL THAT A KNIFE?
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:08:31
Will you need any web/ui/graphic designers as well?
