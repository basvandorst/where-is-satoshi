This site is soothingly sane since it shows how trust in fiat trickles into BTC on a steady basis:-)

Wow, this is the more in-depth announcement. If they do something like this they have to be either seriously worried about the personal safety of their team …
…or they have left for the Bahamas, not only with the BTC / fiats, but also their computers - which would be clever to not leave traces for law enforcement.
Oh my Gox!

No, London (city) is the capital of Merica. You never seceeded. While Rome is still the capital of England, while Jerusalem is still the capital of Italy, while Cairo is still the capital of Israel and Alpha draconis the capital of Egypt.
We are only here for harvesting the spice.
Btw, is there a spice-coin already?

Rough translation of key points:
"Main Problem of bitcoin (Transaction Malleability) fundamentally solved:
- Bitcoin QT now replaced by new client 'Bitcoin Core' (Beta). More updates necessary to entirely solve the issue.
- MtGox source code had been put online (hacked). Programmers analyzed it for security issues.
- MtGox accidentally found 200k Bitcoins and ows now only 650k BTC."
The overall tone is objective and neutral. The Neue Zürcher Zeitung is maybe not the biggest (though in paper size it is) newspaper of Switz, but in the German speaking world it wields an authority comparable to the NYT and is thus read beyond Sitzerland's borders.
Generally a good sign if they treat BTC seriously and deem it 'newsworthy'.

Not exactly an answer, but I am using  since several weeks and like it a lot. They even allow exporting tax statements for your trades, which might become a useful feature in the near future.

So, I have buy orders for 334, 212 and 112. Realistically I assume it will bottom somewhere near the MA 200, which currently is around 470. Currently undershooting and I would not be surprised to see an hour or so around 200ish and maybe a single spike down to 100 or even below. 
However, I also have buy orders for 8 $ - just in case:-)

"stable" … if you mean that 'falling constantly and predictibly' is a stable downwards movement.
Definitely not for savings.
BTC has been (relatively) stable in its upwards movement.

Having a hypothesis first is the beginning of most research.
I am not "betting" money on a forum but betting for lower BTC on Bitfinex - at least till Monday, when again the Gox-oracle pours its wisdom over the world.

Gold. Since 5000+ years on this planet.

Maybe implement a system where people have to sign up with their real names - perhaps even ID scan (not too bureaucratic though) - to prevent trolling and spamming.
A bit like at Amazon and Ebay, where ratings and comments have much more value than on forums where people just use a mask to hide.
Good luck!

Your point BitcoinStolen sounds compelling. There is clearly manipulation happening. Those who deny it, are not getting that - just when things got rather worse for MtGox - bank have supposedly been allowing $ transfer again from MtGox. That sounds not like an accident ant rather counter-intuitive on the banks' side.
It also looks like other entities, government or 'war-profiteers' are now hopping onto this train. They have vested interest in a low BTC price. Like gold, it simply can not be that BTC rises while stocks are falling. Too dangerous an indicator for the sheeple otherwise.

As history (of BTC) shows, this is another bump in the road boosting BTC's antifragility.

Bitfinex not on the list again?
@_date: 2014-04-08 19:19:15
can't see them comments either. What the hack?!
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:58:21
…and we all know it is very likely that Gox will do that. They were just joking and everything will return to normal (withdrawal possible of both, fiat and BTC) as if nothing ever happened.

The US wire transfer system is beyond weird from an European (SEPA) perspective. Most likely this is caused by JPM being the transmitting bank only. In the US you often can't transfer money directly to certain - often smaller - banks and so it first goes to a bigger bank like JPM and then to the local bank, or to Bitstamp's Slovenian bank.
Again, this is very weird for Europeans, when they do this the first time. Americans, despite being the country behind a world reserve currency, is still stuck in the Middle Ages when it comes to international money transfer. They deserve to get Bitcoined. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:24:20
…like Bitstamp too, which has just halted BTC withdrawals too for apparently the same reason?

It's not just "an Austrian bank" but the Austrian NATIONAL bank, which means the Austrian version of the FED.

Not pointless at all.
Believing in BTC doesn't mean putting your head into the sand.
There is an apparently concerted action going on in the markets right now. Apart from crashing Bitfinex and BTC-e simultanously, there is now the shutdown of several major trading platforms + extensive DDOS attacks.
The FTC issue is new to me and i would be interested in hearing more about it. It might fit into this puzzle.
This all smells like a bigger effort than just a single whale. Something like government agency or investor group (WS?) wanting to take over a major portion of shares (BTC).
Somebody (MattheCat) mentioned that there are powerful people who only now see the potential and value of BTC and that they want in on it - but to a much lower price. This could be the first reason.
Secondly, taking a major portion of BTC would also be a matter of enough people selling theirs. This can not be achieved in a normal sideways or uptrending market but only with a good amount of FUD working through as many hodlers as possible. 
So, buying lots of coins does not only need a low price, but also lots of sellers. This they seem to achieve.

already proven wrong. Has tanked to 455 on Bitstamp and falling. 
Gox = dead, yes. But this still leaves many 'consumers' worrying about what will happen next; if they just lost everything, if there is a legal follow up, etc.
I think the ripples of the (formerly) biggest exchange dying, the one who's price was always the one quoted in MSM like Bloomberg, will continue - at least for some days.
High volatility ahead…as usual.
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:43:16
Yes. Only thing is that you need to choose one fiat currency ($, €…) as your reference in the beginning. 
You can even switch between BTC exchanges to show your overall portfolio value.

You know that such questions are usually asked by FBI agent provokateurs?
Whatever you answer will bring you at least on a black list or into jail if you are physically in the US, UK … any other police state nowadays.
Plus there will be a nice headline in major newspapers telling everyone how criminal BTC is.

Also there is a huge 10.000 BTC sell-wall at Bitfinex. What is going on here?

I am planning to sell a few items on Ebay and will add "payment in BTC" as an option for buyers.
They will get a 5-10% discount from their fiat bidding price. Combining my activity as a BTC-missionary with good business + adding Karma points by cutting out Paypal.
Any objections that this couldn't work??
