Yea I have been on Etsy for a while, this is a chance to change things and expand our discount abilities, sweeptstakes, contests and what not.  But yea it's a responsive site with retina display, so I guess that allows for the highest definition.
Otherwise my designs aren't usually as graphic, but we will be editing and calming things down along the way.  Thanks for the feedback!

That's legit, I think we need to do the same thing, I'm sure the more how to buy with Bitcoin videos, the more people who will wind up seeing how easy it is :-)

We would love to do have tips to give out at our glass demos and all!

If you read what the donations are, then you would know that the donations go to the Fallen Patriots Organization which is a non profit that creates scholorships for children who have lost family members in the military.
Kids should not be penalized for what happens while they're young.  And this is coming from someone who has lost both parents at a young age.  There is a sale, and as well an opportunity to do good.  It's your choice on if you don't want to buy from our store or not because of our shops acceptance of our military.

Appreciate that!  Let me know if anyone in the Noblecoin Community would like the Noblecoin Crest on something! :)
@_date: 2014-07-23 02:31:52
It wasn't supposed to disable it as hardcore as it did, we have to change it, just havn't had time.  We have had some live glass blowing demos, and even did a bitcoin sale for a hand blown vase shaped and rolled traditionally.
We did it for a charity in front of one of the local bars here....too bad it's too damn hot in Texas to be doing this shit outside!
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:03:27
Just need the Defib to start this heart back up and pumping!  Let's make it fast!  If me and the girl didn't buy our first home, we would def invest at this price....ugh.

Glad you liked them!  We will have those rocks glasses up for sale thanks to you shortly as well!  Who wouldn't love drinking from a nice rocks glass with their favorite crypto currency on it :-)
@_date: 2014-07-23 02:29:52
It's woocommerce, and just to make it easy we are using coinpayments so that way we didn't have to put a different cart per bitcoin and then the other altcoins we were willing to accept.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:54:37
[ 
We are currently working on adding products but check out our Bitcoin. Section.  Custom engraved Pint/shot/wine/rocks glasses, beer mugs, 7" Round engraved display mirrors, coasters etc.  If there is something you want to see or carry feel free to contact me.
Thanks and good luck!
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:42:21
Let me know what you think and thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:52:30
Thanks for posting this, I must say I personally think this is a great idea and makes it a little more fun and legitimate.  It would be great to have a Forbes style fortune 500 bitcoin company listing.  Did they have one for small businesses as well?
And when is the end date?

Thanks for all the replies, I'm checking into what everyone has suggested!  Coinbase and Bitpay we were using when it was a small site just for bitcoin glasses, but now as it's a larger scale we just went with coinpayments.  Do y'all not recommend that?
Also if there are other items that you suggest or would like to see, let us know!  
But as of now if y'all want, use coupon code:
BTCMOON25 for 25% OFF at [
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:26:04
Do you have one that states the benefits and amount of money saved compared to merchant services....etc?  Thanks
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:03:47
Same here!  Glad we're on the same page!
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:37:43
Check the bitcoin/crypto section.  Custom engraved pint/shot/wine/rocks glasses, beer mugs, glass coasters, Bitcoin circular engraved display mirrors etc!  
If you want something engraved that you don't see, feel free to contact me direct.  We are working on adding products.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:04:38

Who said Bitcoins don't go with Inlfation?! lol.  Yes basically so!  Limited Time offer, but I'm in the same boat so I'll spread the love!
@_date: 2014-12-29 17:11:17
That's sad to see, didn't even hear about this.  So what happened?  And to think we just offered a limited time offer for 70% OFF ALL BITCOIN PRODUCTS we have up right now.
Check out the details here
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:21:02
I'll look forward to it!  And hopefully this will be the start of a successful  BTC business relationship.  Feel free to contact me directly if you would like to discuss details.

It makes no sense to me why people would downvote this?!  If you don't like our custom glassware or mirrors, then don't buy from us.
Don't take away from the other people who could potentially save money on gifts, personal items, household goods, etc!  I feel our company is doing a justified reaction to Bitcoin dropping down 50%, by offering the **Bitcoin Community** the same discount!
**We have everything from:**
*Beer Mugs
*Pint Glasses
*Shot Glasses
*Champagne Flutes
*Wine Glasses
*Martini Glasses
*Rocks Glasses
*Picture Frames
*And have done custom Bar Mirrors/Signs, Bathroom Mirrors, Glass Table Tops, Custom Hand Blown Engraved Pipes, etc!
Don't hate on small businesses that are very active in the Bitcoin Community.  At least give the chance to help them.
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:04:38
Didn't they send to mt gox account? 
@_date: 2014-07-03 04:25:43
That's why we started accepting Bitcoin.  Thank God my girl understands my love for Bitcoin and was very accepting of accepting it for our custom engraved and hand blown glass company.   Use BTCMOON25 in the coupon code at checkout for 25% off.  I hope more companies give a discount incentive for paying in Bitcoin.
