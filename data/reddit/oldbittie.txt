You might try San Fran-based Kraken exchange.  They allow 5:1 margin trading.  Plus they trade 24/7.  These new futures contracts, even if you could afford them, only trade weekdays.  
I've got an account with Kraken.  Been in business for a few years now.  Annoying that they don't allow ACH transfers though.  For fiat only option is bankwire.  Easiest to just fund as bitcoin, and then you can convert back to USD in the account.  Use fiat or bitcoin as collateral for the BTC pair margin loan.

Sounds like you're a newbie at this.  That's ok.  My advice to you:  get a book on Technical Analysis and learn how to trade.  Consider a social trading website like TradingView, where you can review other people's charts and analysis.  Enjoy!

Unless you are predicting Bitcoin will totally self destruct here, I think you missed the big short.  But for future reference, its easy to short bitcoins.  Consider trading bitcoin derivatives.  Quite a few retail FOREX brokers now offer CFDs and binary options on bitcoin.  I personally prefer the CFDs.  Avatrade, Plus500, Markets.com, FXChoice, Forex Metal, Bit4x, and eToro offer Bitcoin CFDs.  
Or if you prefer to stay with the exchanges, BTCe teamed with Cyprus based FOREX broker FXOpen to offer CFD trading via the MT4 trading platform.  Currently they offer swap free, non-expiring CFDs on Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, and Namecoin.   .5% commission per round turn.  I've tried this platform and it seems to work fine.

Problem with Bitfinex is they charge interest to hold a short position.  BTCe doesn't charge any overnight fees to hold their CFDs (long or short).  But Bitfinex is better than BTC.sx.  I was dumb enough to open an account there.  Those guys advertise .1% to hold overnight, but it's more like .9%.  Even the Mofia doesn't charge that much!
