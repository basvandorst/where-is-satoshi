Because that is what bitcoin philosophy is all about. You don't need trust since the all knowing blockchain somehow solves how 2 people are suppose to interact with each other. People are waking up and more and realizing you can't solve moral problems with technology, infact the technology ends up making things even worse. Bitcoin ecosystem prime example of this.

First off this is total nonesense.
The capital investment that created the Internet was largely from government funds in the US with a portion from Europe.
The very encryption systems that cypherpunks use have been created by Government programs with origins in WW2.
The notion that the Internet is a product of the free market is a complete delusion. The notion that bitcoin is a product of the market is also a joke at best. Governments took the risk in the R&amp;D for both these technologies.
The 1990's saw the Internet turned over to private hands where it now sits primarily as a distribution for porn, slander and mindless consumerism(advertising powers Google). Despite the utopian promise of the Internet, the majority of society is worse off. Regular Internet users are poorer financially as well as socially.
Second off.
Bitcoin is a wet dream for the state, the evidence is the Ulbricht trials. Bitcoin provides the most transparent financial system every devised where linking a real ID to a set of transactions is extremely easy. The government is only beginning to realize the benefits of promoting cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the largest threat to both privacy and anonymity ever.

It was commercialized in the 1990's. The "free market" always waits for the public to assume any R&amp;D risks before self interests seize the finished result. The Internet as we know it now is what exactly? A distribution for porn, mass commercialism and slander. The Internet generation is worse off by every metric then the previous. Why is it that the strongest proponents of a delusion are often those most negatively affected by it? Stockholm syndrome?
Cryptography is also a result of R&amp;D spending by the government. This is why bitcoiners are so delusional, they believe all this "innovation" came from benevolent people.

Deflation is theft because it transfers value others create to holders of money. Let's use bitcoin as an example. Suppose someone works hard and develops some killer app, well the benefactors will be large holders who watch their coins swell in value. People misunderstand the source of value as money itself. It is not.
On your question of Microsoft. Microsoft was financed via equity and not loans. Debt financing is a terrible way to grow a company, equity financing is preferred as risk is more shared and ownership is more distributed amongst those taking risk. In a capitalist economy, interest on debt eventually spirals out of control requiring even more debt and eventually leading into debt deflation. Central banking has no solved this as evidenced with what is going on in the world. The usury question remains just as unsolved today as it was for millennia.
On your gold standard comments. More companies existed under the Gold standard in the US then under the government fiat system, today less people are self employed then ever. However that being said I am not advocating gold as money as it suffers from artificially induced deflation due to it's scarcity. Bitcoin does not solve anything from a monetary or philosophical perspective, infact one can argue a bitcoin standard would be far worse since it is easier to enforce certain things such as debt collection under blockchain transparency. Bitcoin solves a few technical problems at best.

Bullshit. The export industry would not have collapsed it simply would not have been as large. 
Central banking was setup to try and prevent the creditor class from having to suffer losses on their bond portfolios. Debt in capitalist economies always reaches an unrepayable point due to the nature of compound interest, throwing an economy into deflation. Central banking was setup to try and mitigate around this while never adressing the core issue(compound interest), hence why in 2015 we still have the same problems arising(debt deflation). The irony is that central banking has turned what used to be regional problems into global scale.
I never said anything about some plot. Central bankers cannot create VALUE. All they can do is transfer value from 1 party to another via mechanisms of THEFT namely both inflation and deflation. All surplus value created has come from labor. In the case of Switzerland workers were being robbed through debasement of the currency unit in which they are paid in for the BENEFIT of capital owners(exporters). The central bank realized they themselves faced possible insolvency because their balance sheet was swelling with Euros. These euros were being recycled into EU government debt namely Germany(inflating the value of bonds). So the central bank was financing wholesale capital destruction(gov spending) while at the same time debasing Swiss worker wages for short term benefits accrued to Capital owners(export industry and EU bondholders). 
That Swiss business owner himself admitted his largest expense is salaries and he needed the low currency to pay them. What he is not telling you is because of that his sales are also higher then they otherwise would be. Capitalism always puts capital against labor. This is a CLEAR CUT EXAMPLE. 
The reason the Swiss currency is strong is because of all the products and services Switzerland produces that are highly sought after. High labor productivity and high salaries go hand in hand with high quality sought after goods. The OP business owner himself admitted that Swiss manufacturing is so advanced that many things can only be produced there, except he can't see the source of this value being labor(including his own). He thinks accumulating nominal money is the source of the wealth and he want's the central bank to subsidize his operation.

Your post talks about a technology that was "unpopular with governments." This is false because the government was the KEY source of said technology. The Internet has always been popular with goverments because it keeps the population distracted. The largest growth in government has occurred under the Internet age. Any advantages of web banking and ecommerce were negated by the increased efficiency which government can now record keep(collect taxes). Notice how many small-medium sized firms have closed down despite the supposed no barrier to commerce the Internet provides? Self employment has never been this low in the United States.
Bitcoin technology the same thing. It is not an anti-government stance, it is a anti-liberty in every sense of the word stance because you give up all privacy. Government law enforcement has said analyzing the blockchain is the easiest thing ever.

Except bitcoin solves a none problem. Austrian economics claims the main monetary issue is the supply of money. That is false, the main problem with the legacy system is compound interest. The extraction of surplus value by unnatural means. Does bitcoin solve this? No. Bitcoin attempts to solve a problem which does not exist namely managing monetary supply.
@_date: 2015-01-18 14:13:58
This is false. The central bank was buying Euros by debasing existing Francs in existence through the creation of new ones. They basically stole purchasng power from Swiss workers and transferred it to Euro customers in order to subdize Swiss exporters. The unintended consequences have been an insanely expensive Swiss housing market for example(from the new francs inflating assets).
If the central bank did not give up this ridiculous notion they would have been forced to buy hundreds of billions of Euros ad infinitum, eventually leading to central bank insolvency.
The fact that they had to stop doing this suddenly without warning anyone, shows you the utter incompetence and disasterous conditions that central banks setup in an economy. Swiss exporters do not understand that their customers are too poor to afford their products. They required the central bank to finance the purchases via currency debasement(robbing labor), this also means they most likely overinvested and overexpanded their business's(from artificial demand due to increased customer purchasing power). Now with the sudden currency shock you will have huge losses across the board(reality that the customer was poor). No evidence exists that central banking stabilizes an economy and more evidence exists that it is a huge destabilizing force. Central banking exists to steal value from those who create it(labor class) and transfer it to those who live off of it(creditor class). Keynes himself said it is easier to steal from labor via currency debasement then by nominal wage cuts.
That exporter in the reddit post will have to raise his prices, and he claims his industry is something only the Swiss can do so customers will be forced to pay regardless. He is basically upset that the Swiss central bank stopped stealing from his workers and subsidized his customers(FOR HIS BENEFIT). He goes on to complain how hell have to face the wrath of unions directly now(Goes back to what Keynes said). This is because the Swiss Central Bank was lowering wages on his behalf before, without the workers even knowing it.
The Swiss export industry honestly believes that they should be entitled to export insanely expensive products ad infinitum. We are talking about for example watches that cost an average $20k+ per piece. Obviously this is unsustainable without customers also growing wealth at the same if not faster rate then Switzerland is. Considering most of the worlds economies are in stagnation, it time the Swiss face up to reality and realize nobody can afford their luxuries anymore.
Bitcoin has it's flaws but there is no single party that can suddenly come in and shock the system with piss poor planning.

People in the money reform movement refuse to acknowledge the source of monetary problems is the concept of compound interest, money breeding money. 
A successful money system would be one that is based on interest free credit. Obviously this requires trust since credit must be allocated prudently. Prudence is a virtue, and virtues are completely absent from  discussion about money nevermind in practice. This credit is backed by productive activity. Ask yourself do you want a monetary system that is built upon human productivity or artificialy scarce units that a few people possess(and everyone else must trade real wealth for)?
Unfortunately certain groups of people are aware that is is easier to steal value then to produce it, this is quite evident in the bitcoin ecosystem. Like I said bitcoin solves nothing, as mans problems are more philosophical and theological then technical. People believe money itself produces value. I found it quite amusing reading the one poster who actually believes central bankers are benevolent entities safeguarding the economy while the track record speaks complete opposite. They exist for the benefit of creditors.

Please do not quote all the "bitcoin accepting" merchants, because almost 99.9% of them settle in fiat and use third party middle men to exchange for them. Merchants in bitcoin are irrelevant, what is relevant is functioning btc-&gt;fiat markets. 
Bitcoin's value comes from it's ability to act as a conduit to obtain fiat. Everything is priced in fiat first and bitcoin second. In and of itself bitcoin is worthless. Certain economic actors have a difficult time obtaining fiat money directly so they use bitcoin since alternatives do not exist.
The price is a direct reflection of how much fiat money is floating around BTC. This is the most accurate indicator of growing or shrinking demand for BTC.

A stock is ownership in a business. If the business is producing surplus value by investing prudently, it's earnings rise. A rising income stream boosts the value of the business and the stock appreciates. Bitcoin is not a productive asset, it does not generate surplus value. Do you have a hard time understanding this? Put a USB stick full of bitcoins under your matress, and wake up everyday and see if it multiplied into stuff.

With a falling interest rate structure existing bond holders get massive capital gains from doing nothing. Economists have no idea how bond market works that's why they all missed this. Falling rates make existing debts harder to pay off, requiring larger new ones at the lower rates.

Bitcoin can never sustain high prices because the cost to run the network increases along with price. Miner profit margins explode and they rush to sell to realize them.
Look what happened 99.999% of hashrate came online during high prices because of the huge profit margin being earned. All bitcoin did was create a massive malinvestment bubble, miners built the infrastructure but no one came(stagnate users, stagnate transactions).

Yes "bubbles" are the new excuse bitcoiners use to hide all the shortcomings. Look the single biggest problem is not being discussed at all. Bitcoin is an economy where a few people own almost all the coins and wait for them to swell in value from the labor of others. Artificial scarcity that is not tied to any actual productivity and benefits only those with bitcoins.

What is new about bitcoin though? It has the same oligarchical-monopolistic tendencies of the present system, requires handing wealth over for dubious "money" to a few interests.

This thread is going to get downvoted because bitcoiners know more are now sitting on losses then any gains, since most users joined when prices were above $240, just like 99.99% of the network was built in 2014.

I think Gavin needs to recognize his own failure at development as well. 6 years into the project, bitcoin-core remains as shitty as ever, essentially a hack that can never scale to compete.
Gavin needs to outline what exactly the developers are aiming to achieve. Will we get another protocol that forks? Or more vulnerabilities introduced? No vision exists.

This post is ridiculous. People chase a rising price, sending it even higher. On the other end of the trade early adopters and miners are pressing against the bid. You are literally transferring immediate cash(fiat) for a digital token, in hopes someone will take you out of the trade at a later date.
It is a fact that *more* people are currently sitting on losses with BTC than gains. In order for an early adopter to strike it big, tens of thousands of users must hand over small balances.

The problem with "long term" is it doesn't mean anything. What is long term? Is it 5-10-15-20 years? Is it 2months? Longterm is a concept issued by bagholders to explain away their losses. The other problem with longterm is uncertainty tends to increase. Maybe a better bitcoin comes along?

You are describing the fiat money system. You buy a bond with the promise that somehow you will get more money later.

A high price for bitcoin indicates high demand so substitutes enter. Look at every major bull run and altcoins at peak had 15% of bitcoins market cap. That translates to a 15% lower bitcoin price.
What I am discussing has already been OBSERVED multiple times. Altcoins inflate the total supply of crypto because they can be exchanged for BTC. The problem is no mechanism exists to remove supply once demand wanes so you get huge crashes that follow.
My second point. Since the miner subsidy is fixed, when the price rises the real value of the subsidy rises as well giving miners huge incentive to add more hashpower and realize high profit margins. This occured in 2014 99.99% of the bitcoin network was built in 2014 as everyone rushed to mine due to the huge revenue earned.

The risk 5 years ago was none existent while the risk of losses now is exponentially higher. An early adopter had his CPU pump out a bunch of bitcoins while he risked penny's worth of electricity. Uncertainty and out of control variables *increase* with the "long term". Bitcoin becomes more risky with a rising value not less.
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:56:54
It doesn't matter.
Bitcoin will never see high transaction volume in the first place. Most transactions today are gambling or exchange related. Sarutobi was 10-15% of the blockchain when it appeared.
Nobody will voluntarily join a monetary system where the surplus value they create through labor is siphoned off by large holders via deflation. Why doesn't Gavin solve that? Because he doesn't even understand it.
Bitcoiners are pretending mass adoption is always around the corner but it isn't.
Even if somehow transactions jumped, why would you have 1 centralized ledger full of useless transactions? You talk about decentralization but want EVERYONE using 1 ledger.
The hard truth is bitcoiners want everyone apart of 1 ledger so their own coins swell in value. That's all this has ever been about.

Stripping out repetitive transactions and exchanges, we have anywhere from 3000-10000 using the blockchain everyday.
Active users remain very very low. Look at this sub, 0.3% of subscribers are here at any given time and under peak useage that spikes to about 1%. The interesting part is has 1% of active userbase online even during none-peak hours. During peak hours 3-5% of the subscribers are online, this tells you that a huge portion of subscribers are sockpuppets.
Bitcoiners tend to inflate the userbase. What we know since Mt.Gox is odds are exchanges are faking trade volumes. We now twitter followers are up to 90% fake for bitcoin related activity.
What you should take from this. Stay away from bitcoiners as they will lie about anything and everything to increase the value.
Estimates based on calculation and observation:
Total people with bitcoin 200,000-400,000
Total daily active bitcoiners 3000
People who own up to 90% of all bitcoins &lt;500
It has been confirmed under 50 users own a quarter or more. Roger Ver owns an estimated 4% of none-lost bitcoins. Satoshi 10-15%.

Except it makes no rational sense.
At $34k per BTC, miners would be earning $122.4million per day. The bitcoin network would cost close to $50 billion per year to run, that is more then Visa and Mastercard combined. The entire planet would be shutting down everything just to mine bitcoin.
Assume $1 per transaction you would need 50 billion transactions per annum. That's roughly 1400 transactions per second yet the protocol currently cannot even handle 3.
Roger Ver owns close to 4% of all active bitcoin, so he has a massive interest in pumping the price up. Remember folks at $1k per BTC, Ver alone held $400 million worth.
