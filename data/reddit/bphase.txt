That's the biggest gaming platform/store around. Now it's up to the rest to follow. Many gaming sites were before Steam, but there's still a lot, mainly the other big ones that don't accept it.
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:52:03
You need to wait? Well that's not convenient at all. Think I might have to keep purchasing from elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:38:00
There's a bug. Clicking "open in wallet" on the Steam client doesn't work and takes you to an error page that you can't back out of, meaning the transaction will fail as you lose the info.
I had to cancel the pending transaction from my account purchases and do it all over.

It is... TSMC can't produce enough for him so he went to Samsung.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:32:47
Yep. Not sure we'll recover from this, since this seems to keep happening and is extremely bad press for bitcoin. At some point people might stop believing this thing has any future. I'm certainly having doubts now after 5+ years. Perhaps people just aren't ready for this amount of freedom.
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:33:19
With many merchants it is instant or almost. At least it used to be. Maybe 0 conf is too unsafe nowadays?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:00:24
You got it. Some sort of failsafes could be good (and probably why they have been implemented in fiat), but of course there's always the huge risk of misuse.

Yes. A block of 50 coins, in fact. It was super easy.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:41:13
In BCash, scaling is not optional and it also causes centralization because of blocks getting prohibitively big eventually, so I'd say it's a worse solution. Lightning is opt-in and then the centralization tradeoffs can be managed by anyone as they wish.
Not saying I'm not worried by scaling, it's the biggest problem, but I do believe our current path seems the logical one. Mostly I'm worried about lightning being overhyped and not being able to deliver.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:20
The Lightning Network can handle smaller amounts though.

Just not a very good one.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:30:58
Eh, over two thirds of all the coins are mined already. It's not like widespread mass adoption wouldn't mean price going up massively, there's hard limits on how much you can possibly mine.
Now, another thing entirely is whether bitcoin will ever really go mainstream, or if it'll collapse under its scaling troubles or stagnate. That's pretty much the only thing I'm worried about anymore.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:01:59
Fiber is spreading quickly, and tends to have symmetrical 100/100 or even 1000/1000 bandwidth. There's no need for backwater connections being able to run full nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:37:13
I believe.
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:27:58
But it has happened before, right? There was big drama about purse.io here some 1-2 years ago, with Amazon canceling orders or even something worse (can't really remember) because of stolen credit cards being used. I definitely think 25% savings is shady and could be risky.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:18
Same problem. Perhaps it's overloaded now?
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:52:17
There's no need to store the full blockchain. Storage isn't a real issue.

Not bad, but you should spell check. Spotted at least a couple of typos / spelling errors.
@_date: 2015-06-04 10:47:51
Well, bitcoin ASICs are massively simpler than those. Intel and mobile SoCs do have 14 nm already, but those tiny nodes just have lots of problems for high-performance designs. 
Would be interesting to know the specs of this new chip though. It might not be that impressive compared to the 2x nm stuff.
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:15:05
I agree partially, especially with b/B. m isn't too bad, since there is no risk of confusion as a bit is the smallest unit of information for computers.

@_date: 2014-08-28 06:33:51
It's also a hell of a lot simpler, doing only one thing instead of everything.
But you're right, there's always room for improvement. I have no idea how much, though.
@_date: 2014-09-08 06:15:00
$500, if the exchange is working correctly. They should always match with the best possible offer. That hasn't always been the case with the amateurish exchanges in bitcoin space.
@_date: 2014-03-29 10:57:10
For now. Hopefully that maximum will be lifted in time.

These? There's no numbers for overall speed. It's just memory, and litecoin doesn't need that much memory bandwidth anyway. It's more about GPU speed, cache speed and memory latency.
So all in all, pretty irrevelant article.

You understand that this is not in their, our or anybody's best interests? Thus it's not worth being concerned about.
Fiat overlords press us down to keep their status quo, but if bitcoin overlords decided to do the same they'd go down harder than the rest. And they could only do it so many times before running out of bitcoins. With fiat it's entirely different.
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:39:00
From 
"Hello everyone, yishan here.
You are partially correct, but we are not necessarily focused on contributing directly to the core bitcoin codebase or forking it. Rather, we want to ensure that whoever we hire is able to fully understand bitcoin at its lowest technical level, i.e. be able to examine the code itself in the course of developing tools, features, infrastructure, whatever. Essentially, we want someone who could contribute to the bitcoin codebase even if we aren't intending to. It's sort of like how if you want someone to work on mysql at your company, you need someone who has the technical capability to write (and read/evaluate) patches to the mysql codebase even if they're not necessarily going to do so.
What we are interested in doing is evaluating the cryptocurrency landscape to see what high-leverage projects reddit can and should undertake that only reddit is in a position to undertake which would benefit cryptocurrency and related technologies in general. We're not interested in creating a competing "Yet Another &lt;Whatever&gt;" if someone else is already doing it. For this we need someone who can understand cryptocurrency very well and consequently, see what tools, features, and infrastructure may be missing or which the world needs next... and then to build it."
Sounds cool!

@_date: 2014-06-12 19:21:48
Yeah, it's not the practise in say Europe to my knowledge. With credit you may get a month of no-interest rate, but that's pretty much it. With the very common debit cards, nothing, same as paying cash. I'd much rather use bitcoin.

It's not easy though. Bitcoin has such a long head start that the competing product would have to be tons better, and I'm not sure it can be...

It was frustrating and annoying to me. Mostly.
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:15:42
Upvote for a thoughtful suggestion that's not been repeated a thousand times (AFAIK).
But I'm not sure that's a good idea, it'd mean pools having massive reserves locked up, which would make using them pretty much impossible. Not a problem for solomining and p2pool, but I'm not convinced those work that well in large scale. 
Also, I'm not sure that's needed. Miners should have an incentive already in keeping network healthy, as they have hardware to pay off.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:32:36
It's probably a long shot, but IMO definitely worth finding out. These guys have wildly different design than ITER, much smaller and less complicated so it doesn't need such amounts of money. They do cover this in the FAQ btw.
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:26:33
Exactly. It's the future man!
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:22:03
No, because they use a certain algorithm to generate the seed from those 12 words. Sure, you can create an infinite amount of seeds from them with different algos, but electrum does just one. It then adds a deterministical salt to that seed to generate your limitless keypool.
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:53:24
Hard fork is changing the protocol so that everybody must upgrade, as in introducing something new to blocks that's not valid currently.
Though I'm not sure where a relaying rule falls, it would be problematic if the non-standard transactions didn't get relayed due to people not upgrading.
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:09:32
Dang, at this rate we gonna need bigger blocks soon!
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:01:14

Yeah, those made a big wave when they hit but turns out it's misleading (I thought it was real teleportation at first too). I think it's just about altering the state without touching the matter or whatever, but they're still using classical means of "teleportation" and so not faster than light.
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:08:46
Sorry, I can't find much of anything on it. Besides the original articles, but those reporters are often far from experts on the matter and the articles are not very clear on the subject. 
A friend more knowledgeable on the subject said it's just entanglement and doesn't transport information, that you'd need a way to manipulate the pair.
@_date: 2014-08-26 17:11:49
So it's real! Very exciting. They probably won't earn money by doing that, so I guess they just want to promote their business and bitcoin.

Oh, I'm not underestimating bitcoin's potential. It's just that currently implementing it doesn't matter that much, probably &lt;1% want to pay in bitcoin. When that percentage starts to matter, you can just enable it and all is good. It's just a payment option really for businesses. Sure bitcoin has other implications, but those are less relevant to this case.
Unlike with the internet, which was a whole new frontier with massive growth potential for savvy companies.
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:34:48
A real advocate would be all-in already and have nothing with which to buy with.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:59:24
This is bullshit.
First of all, Hal Finney joined in the first few days, I think before block 100.
Also, the network was not constant 7MH/s. It was less than that, since difficulty of 1 is the lowest possible difficulty. In other words, block time was over 10 min on average.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:05:12
Those have been there for a while. 2011 Casascius coins though, probably with the misprint. They're pretty rare and valuable nowadays :)

@_date: 2014-08-04 21:02:25
Yeah you almost always seem to get 2-3% worse than spot using these services. Maybe even VISA now, it used to be better but I heard it's close to 2% now.
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:57:35
This is great stuff, and indeed a very compelling reason to use bitcoin. If this sort of thinking spreads, then the future is bright as the Moon indeed.
Sure, businesses benefit by just adopting it, but this way the customer is going to want it too.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:38:19
No, we don't actually know that still. See top comment.
And that makes no sense. If they REALLY wanted those coins, they could have started buying in small batches a long time ago.
Still, due to the price rise, I guess they went for $600 + 10-20%.
@_date: 2014-09-04 02:22:43
I doubt that. I'm sure almost all of us bitcoiners are happy to pay with bitcoin, even if they accept lite/doge as well.

@_date: 2014-05-15 00:54:33
It doesn't. I guess they just hate it, maybe because of pushy bitcoiners (kinda like Jehova's witnesses) or having been burnt by it and thus don't want it to spread. Or maybe they think it's unfair.
That or they could be just afraid, as it's the evil drug/terrorist money or whatever.
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:24:29
Yes, they are invested. They won't be making much if the cryptocurrency movement dies down. Getting back that $30M is probably going to take these guys quite some time.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:10:17
Paypal is much bigger, so it's to be expected they'll take longer. They have been talking about it and are interested, so it might be on the pipeline.

Why cash out? If he believes in bitcoin, surely he will keep holding. And we can't know how much he has already cashed out. Diversification is key.
One thing is for certain; fiat money will keep losing its value. So keeping it in a foreign bank account is not the best of ideas.

Well, I don't know. The end design could be a lot less complicated and more efficient. The typical design (tokamak, used in ITER) requires a massive power plant, there's just no way to scale it down.
This does require a higher temperature, but otherwise costs and complexity are way down compared to tokamak.

Not quite that much. 10 orders of magnitude means adding 10 zeroes, while the world economy is only some ~100 trillion or 4 orders of magnitude bigger than bitcoin. 
But lots nevertheless.

You could acquire some older coins. Kinda like using a 2011 euro coin in 2009 would be wrong, although that would probably go unnoticed.

Bitcoin mining efficiency doesn't matter. What matters is the price, and the mining network will use energy about as much as the bitcoins mined are worth. Difficulty is still going up.
But yeah I don't see that as a huge problem, considering how much other systems use energy. Bitcoin block reward will halve, and the energy can be generated in an environmentally friendly way.
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:02:22
Can't really push them, these are difficult issues and warrant great consideration. IIRC we won't see floating fees this year, and I don't know about the blocksize issue. Probably not this year either.
Yes, it means bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption but there's plenty of other stuff (security etc) to be done too before it is. Better do it right so that the system stays trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:16:14
You're quite right. Will be interesting to see. It's just that there's so many options to litecoin now that it doesn't seem to make much sense anymore to most players.
Still, if there's another influx of new money and people to bitcoin, i.e. a bubble, I wouldn't be surprised either. Just might not gamble on it myself, instead choosing some other alt.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:14:05
That would be sad. They are such a wizard after all.
Maybe intentionally "lost", though. I don't think they ever meant to spend those.

Yes, although maybe there weren't any in queue? I think the average block size is still at 250kB or so, which means most blocks can't even be close to 1MB. The slow blocks could be, though.
@_date: 2014-08-11 01:12:54
Mobile wallets and other lightweight "nodes" do work though. Full nodes will probably keep getting rarer, but soon we'll probably have pruneable chains and those nodes can still perform essentially all necessary functions, but save tons of space.

No fees, not even the currency conversions?
What about the monthly fees of the card or your bank? Surely all those great things don't come free.
Also, those credit card perks are mostly for Americans too. In Europe I don't think you get any real benefit with credit vs. debit, except maybe a month of no interest credit. But those cards cost.

This is a worthy cause for sure. I don't know what their chances are, but for the cost, it's *definitely* worth finding out. And the experts agree. The implications of this if it were to work would be absolutely groundbreaking.
Please, read their indiegogo campaign and maybe an article or two before you dismiss them. They're out of the box thinkers, pioneers like us and the general public doesn't believe them. As bitcoiners we should understand that and support them. Just like we've shown the world that bitcoin is an experiment worth following, lets let them do that too. We have lots of people of means here, so we can do it!
@_date: 2014-08-10 19:15:53
Eh, not quite. There's still bandwidth/CPU/(storage) to consider, and implementing this and block size increases.

This isn't really a tragedy of the commons, higher difficulty is not a bad thing for bitcoin.
It's stupid miners who don't know maths. Though more and more it's the big companies who probably actually profit from this due to cheap chips and electricity.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:55:28

@_date: 2014-03-12 23:41:37
Global. Great when travelling and not incurring any additional fees/conversions.
As an investment/store of value. Bitcoin is a bit like electonic gold with regards to this. It should appreciate vs. fiat currency.
Prevention of card theft, you don't have to give access to your money away to merchants.
To your last point... Merchants have an incentive to accept bitcoin because of no chargebacks and lower fees. Some pass those savings to the customer, and hopefully more will in the future and then it might become more lucrative to go bitcoin. With trusted companies you shouldn't need fraud protection.

Far from true, 20nm/14nm and smaller will be coming out for CPUs, GPUs, mining ASICs and others. We have many years of node shrinks left still, but they are getting more expensive and possibly slower to come.

Agreed, it's far too early to be saying such things. Besides, bitcoin is rather easy to implement and it's no big deal if you're not the first to do so. Plenty of time after it's more relevant than currently.

While I am not affiliated with them, I believe this kind of research is of the utmost importance. It would be for the great benefit of everyone should this succeed.
Please, read through their FAQ before dismissing them, they answer many common criticisms and questions there. As bitcoiners we should understand how difficult it can be for out-of-the-box ideas to gain acceptance.
Their method (hydrogen-boron fusion), if it works, would result in a much better form of fusion power than the well known ITER (deuterium+tritium), which would still use the usual heat turbine. This project would result in a much smaller reactor (decentralized!), an order of magnitude cheaper (~$0.3c/kWh) and also more efficient power generation in the form of an ion beam and x-rays.
Their lead scientist also made an AMA here: 
CTRL+F for bitcoin. Should they get $2800 more in BTC we'll be mentioned as supporters. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:49:37
Thing is, they aren't giving refunds anymore to those who upgraded... We are well and truly fucked.
At this point it's just about minimizing losses. I might get back 30-70% of the fiat I spent, but that's little consolation when BTC was at &lt;$100 when I ordered with them.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:52:55
I have done research on them and thought critically about this. I realize that it's probably not very likely to work, but for the cost it's definitely worth finding out.
And they have published a paper.  It's the most read article of 2012 in that Physics of Plasmas journal. I couldn't check the science (nor do I have the qualifications) as that requires logging in.
Also, this committee of experts thinks they have merit in their approach: 
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:07:54

That 1MB block limit will not stay around forever, though. It's not large enough if we ever wish to go mainstream. But pruning and tech progress should handle that.
Internet speeds keep going up as companies roll out fiber, 4G (and beyond) etc. 100/100 is already rather common is many countries, and some even have 1000/1000. It'll only get faster.

This is true, if price suddenly crashed to $100, it would take a long time before difficulty adjusted down because most everyone would be mining at a loss and likely thus stop.
It's not a problem with regular price moves, but if something catastrophic happened it could actually become one and make it even worse.

Their response on the campaign FAQ:
"Dr. Hopkins’ analysis misses the whole point of our July 2012 paper, which was about our demonstrating record-breaking temperatures in our confined plasma. Hopkins complained that we had not demonstrated record-breaking fusion yields. But yields depend not only on temperature but on densities as well and we were not claiming any superior density or yield. The paper was about the record temperatures. It was demonstrating that this temperature—sufficient to ignite hydrogen-boron fuel, was indeed confined in a small plasmoid that made our paper the most-read one of 2012 in Physics of Plasma, the leading journal in our field. Evidently a lot of our colleagues got the point, even if Dr. Hopkins missed it. As to densities, we expect to greatly improve them and achieve record fusion yields as well in our next series of experiments."

Thing is, they need customers willing to pay with bitcoin so that implementing it is worth it to begin with. Bit of a chicken and egg problem, but we are making progress slowly. I mean only the fanatic fools thought we'd be mainstream by now, for someone more aware of bitcoin's current limitations and problems it's not been unexpected.

So, how's the situation with getblocktemplate nowadays? I heard something about it not working with Stratum. 
AFAIK, it would allow miners to see what's going on with the blocks they mine, thus being more decentralized. Although none would probably pay attention to it, and an attack would still be possible.

@_date: 2014-07-06 15:38:34
Well they'd most likely be in the main chain block that caused the orphaned block in the first place, as both miners should have almost all the transactions in their memory pool. If not, then they'd go into the next one where they fit.

Yes, I didn't mean that we should increase it to 1 GB now, but a relatively modest 10MB would go a long way. Obviously increasing it even that much is no simple task and warrants great consideration.
And coinmaiden doesn't even come up on google, only your posts about it. So pardon me if I won't take your word for it.

When your margins are thin, it can be significant. Imagine you're selling something at a 5% markup, and payment processor gets 1% so you'll end up with 4% profit. Now getting free processing would be 4%-&gt;5% so +25%. Also you're gonna have to pay salaries, upkeep and what not so that 1% can be even more than that.
Bitpay has a 0% plan though.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:54:27
Considering most nodes will do fine with just the relevant info (unspent transaction output set), combined with high enough fees to avoid bloating it, I think it will be fine. Storing a full archival copy of the blockchain is not something that many have to do, as all those old spent transactions have no bearing on the current state.

It's so very easy to default on bitcoin loans. That's why the great margins, and also those defaults happen all the time. So yes, it's too good to be true.

Bitcoins are different, they can be stolen with little tracks to follow. Most people have their money in stocks and such, and those can't really be stolen.

Those exist.
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:41:01
But those are usually done in big batches, so the fees for them are pretty negligible.
I think it might be high so that people don't want to withdraw, and instead opt to keep their BTC in and trade etc.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:53:23
Ah. The confirmation thing. Even dogecoin with its 1 minute confirmations is way too long for coffee, as a confirmation can take anywhere from 20 seconds to 5 minutes or so due to random variance.
But that doesn't matter. For small transactions, accepting 0 confirmations is just fine. It is actually very hard to double-spend a properly implemented system. So that's not a deterrent for bitcoin working for small transactions.
Note that credit cards actually take months to confirm.
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:37:11
We had a bubble, and now we don't. That's why price came down. I was speaking long term. How are you going to have lots of people transact/hold this currency without it going up? You can't even convert a huge sum of fiat money into bitcoin or the other way around without it affect market price a lot.
And usage rate is not up much, we've been pretty stable there this year. More companies have adopted bitcoin, sure, but progress on the user front has been slow.

Weird, nothing about the moon. Even if you type "bitcoin will go to"
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:24:39
To be honest, that's not very common happening for a regular Joe though. Certainly not something they're concerned about, so it's not a great selling point for bitcoin.
I'd use it for the convenience (at times), and discounts. Though as a bitcoiner to support the BTC economy as well of course.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:58:47
We've come a long way. Pretty damn cool to see the multibillionaire CEO of a huge company care about bitcoin and tweeting about a miniscule (compared to their size) purchase done with it.
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:23:59
Also, it's going to decrease. When the supply cap of 21M approaches, cost of mining will approach the value of transaction fees. It's hard to tell what those will be, but for now the costs are mainly in the mining of new bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-23 01:05:24
It's intentional.

No, not many. Just the big operations really, and hardware makers. For most, mining hasn't been a very profitable endeavour, especially not with ASICs.

Too bad it took gox's problems to jolt me into finally doing it after thinking about it for a long time. Alas, it was too late to save those goxcoins. An expensive lesson.

@_date: 2014-05-09 01:39:59
Fair, but also I'm not sure they could survive a bitcoin implosion, being so much exposed to it.
It would certainly be *very* bad news for the whole cryptocurrency space, and would likely set things back by a long time. What could take bitcoin's place, and have people trust it after that? Certainly not litecoin or such. Maybe something like Ethereum eventually, but it's a long way off and would take years to get to the level bitcoin's at now, IMO.

Luke-jr doesn't run it anymore.
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:30:47
Yea most mined back then. Still it's not the mining really but the holding of BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:40:42
Just .03%? Seems like a lot of effort and noise for some spare change.
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:03:03
The average computer can handle much more than that, and hardware is going to keep improving as well.
Also, there's really no need for every average Joe to run a node, but it can't be too centralized either. There's a balance, but needing requiring a decent computer/connection wouldn't be a big deal to me.
I'm not familiar with this coinmaiden thing, but off-chain transactions have their disadvantages and problems. You can't do everything there, and 1MB will not cut it if adoption spreads. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 04:04:11
It's because bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and credit cards/PayPal/etc. are not. It would be too easy to buy bitcoin instantly, withdraw it and then just chargeback the payment, or using a stolen card.

It was common in Diablo as well (duping).

Rumours are on the order of 100k+ BTC. Could be just tens of thousands too, but still.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:58:31
Well there's these 30k coins, then DPR's 144k but he hasn't had a trial yet so I don't think they can be sold yet.
Then there's MtGox's 200k and nobody really knows what will happen to them. Maybe the US Gov has them, maybe not. They'll supposedly be liquidated at some point as well.

You're the exact reason Dogecoin is even a thing. LOL
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:21:35
Nah.. unlikely they hold any, as they're not in the business of speculating. Plus it's somewhat involved to hold bitcoin as well still. Especially for a big company such as that.
I think they just like it and want more people to use it. It would be great for them.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:30:44
Yes, if you trust they have BTC.

Only until the block reward halves a couple of times.
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:06:22
But currently their main competitive advantage is that they get the chips at cost.
When selling to miners, manufacturers will price the ASICs as high as possible, settling at "this unit will make its cost back in x months at current difficulty projection". When using the ASICs themselves, they're much cheaper and that's probably the biggest reason that regular miners can't compete. Another is that businesses get cheaper electricity.
With GPUs it was different. Those are all purchased from retailers, and nobody gets a special price. So the only advantage big farms had was electricity prices, which is obviously still big. But they also have overhead costs with employees, air conditioning and such. 
If ASICs reach that point, then we'd be in a much more preferential situation than we are in now and hobbyists could possibly compete again, at least somewhat. Especially during winter when the heat won't be wasted. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:44:30

Perhaps he meant 1-2 years for User Interface moment, which then can signal the start of mass adoption, but it would still take time. Although he's also saying no fees, which isn't true. Maybe he isn't that well-versed in bitcoin.
I dunno. He could be right. There's still the scalability problem to solve though, and also consumers already have credit/debit cards so bitcoin isn't a huge improvement for the common people.

Doesn't have to be third world. 
1 USD (or 1 mBTC) is 112 Japanese Yen or 1140 South Korean Won.

IDK either, just thinking out loud here... But if you order them somehow, you could reasonably guess that everybody will have the older transactions in pool. You could only broadcast the last few seconds worth of transactions that come in the block. OR maybe even better, you could just not include any too recent transactions in your block, so it's reasonable that everybody would have everything until then.

Why? Bitcoin is about the users, not the miners. Miners are supposed to just work for the users and validate transactions. Not decide on matters.

Untrue, there have been a couple at least. 2013 spring hard fork split, and the infamous billions of bitcoins bug back in 2010 or so.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:02:00


I'm not so sure on that any more. One big miner is causing a lot of drama right now. There's only a couple of ASIC makers, and they mostly hoard the chips for themselves. Most of the mining is based in China, which is a massive risk because of possible government intervention.
It might get better if Bitcoin grows and more players join in (AMD?), but that might also never happen. As it is, I'm not finding ASIC-PoW very good or decentralized.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:18:52
If we were using GPUs (AMD/NVIDIA), it'd be much more decentralized. They sell to everyone and don't make amazing exclusive deals. 
Everyone would have to pay roughly the same for a miner, which means the small timers don't have a disadvantage besides more expensive electricity.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:56:13
Yes, but it'd be worth it. Mining malware doesn't hurt Bitcoin security either, and it'd also lead to people caring more about securing their computers. Not at all a bad trade off IMO.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:44:11

@_date: 2017-03-25 20:37:05
Nope, I'm not so sure anymore. But missing out on BTC going to the moon is such a terrifying thought after all these years that it is very difficult for me to sell. Hence only that amount. But it isn't really a rational decision and I am not too confident right now.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:54:22
Why would it stabilize? Miners will always mine that which is more profitable. Unless BTC falls enough to be never profitable I don't see this situation fixing itself.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:19:26


Way fewer than that, because the top percenters own a lot, and many coins are lost too.

@_date: 2017-08-25 12:20:03
It just means sending yourself money. Some wallets let you choose the inputs yourself, but if not, it's still possible to do although not as intuitive.
For example, if you've received 5x 10 mBTC transactions and a 3 mBTC transaction, you can send yourself a 53 mBTC transaction when the fees are low and then the next time you want to send a 40 mBTC transaction it will cost much less than if you hadn't done that, because it only has one input instead of 4+.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:04:50
That's an exchange withdraw transaction. This dude didn't receive that much.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:27:40
And that's assuming no lost coins, and an even distribution of coins. In reality the 1% own a massive portion of BTC, so there really aren't very many left for the rest.

@_date: 2017-08-13 15:42:18
This is great. You completely flipped people's expectations of what the risky asset is around. How times have changed.
That said... I partially agree, I would be scared to enter the stock market now. It's not like I'm not scared of hodling BTC, but there's a huge upside to balance that risk. 
I would most likely stay in fiat (or some very low risk assets) if I were to cash out BTC now.

No miner is going to allocate a ton of their hashrate to that when the profit simply isn't there.
It's a tragedy of the commons.

Oh, you sweet summer child.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:59:24
It's forced upon us by mainly miners and a couple of big economic players. There was no proper discussion and there isn't consensus.
It's also a waste of a hard fork, if/when we do one, we should fix a bunch of stuff at once instead of doing one "small" change.
Also, we need time to evaluate the new economics for the bitcoin blockchain after segwit + second layer is online.
Personally I don't have anything against doubling the block size, but it's not worth a hard fork with no consensus and firing the core team. The core team is far more important than a bit more growth potential. I would have been okay with it if pretty much everyone agreed it's the way to go.

Certainly. By now, most any country should have somewhere to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:37:52
Sure. I sold some at back in spring at $1k, thankfully not all and I did buy a bit back. Could have easily gone worse for me, I was really quite afraid of the fork fears and miner dictatorship back then.
Hodling is not easy. With this year's rise we have many quite rich people here, and it could easily turn into a bloodbath when things start looking iffy and those guys start fearing for their fortunes.
 Some won't mind though, being confident that in the long term it'll keep going up.

Because the backlog is huge now and BTC lost a lot of hashrate to bcash, so it's not going to normalize for a while most likely.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:23:33
With digital encrypted backups you can make multiple copies and have enough redundancy against data failures then though.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:15:48
Thing is, it's not stable... far from it. Just catching some breath. It won't simply stabilize here after such a huge rise. It's calm after and before the storm.
I do long for truly stable times, where the price doesn't move much in a couple of months and I can concentrate on something else than cryptocurrencies...
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:15:25
Even now it's out of reach to most.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:05:12
No we wouldn't. If segwit was used to capacity (~2MB) we'd be fine for a while longer, assuming blocks were coming at the standard 6/hour rate. The mempool would be draining something like 3-4x faster than it does currently.
Right now it's really bad because of the hashrate loss due to higher bcash profitability.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:01:16
During quiet times (Sunday/monday morning, probably not this Sunday though), you can consolidate those small inputs to a bigger output though with a minimal fee.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:01:18
Did you use the same armory wallet for new addresses? Because I heard some people to say that if you know two private keys from a wallet (or one private key and the public seed), you can generate all the keys making it unsafe. But I'm not sure if that's correct, certainly not something I'll risk though.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:20:12
Not really. It's an alternate chain. It's also not the first one to be distributed to bitcoin holders.

Yeah, Kraken has been great so far. I wonder how long it'll last, though... They don't even require proof of ID/Residence from europeans unless you need to withdraw huge amounts. Feels like someone will crack down on them soon.
@_date: 2015-08-21 07:20:44
Doubling of hashrate is about one week faster halving. Quadrupling would be two weeks. So it's definitely not gonna be moving up more than two weeks unless the price skyrockets.
Also you gotta keep in mind this close to halving that investing in new hardware can be a bad idea, you only have 9 months or so to make good bitcoin and then it gets halved which might make mining almost unprofitable.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:19:06
My point was that outputs are like 25 bytes each, while a transaction with 1 input and 1 output is like 200 bytes. So adding an output doesn't increase the cost much, and a tx with 70 outputs is something like 2500 bytes. You could only make about 12 regular transactions with 1 input and 1-2 outputs with that.
 So basically exchanges can overpay and still the cost per customer isn't that bad, although 880 sat/B is quite an overpayment regardless.

Bittrex / Binance seem like decent options. Though Poloniex is a ton better than Kraken IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:09:37
Tbh that's still pretty cheap if you're sending to 50 outputs with one input. Way overpaying, but those transactions are tiny per output. Consolidating inputs is the very expensive part.

Yeah. One could say we are sky high already.

Yes, but they don't have to run full nodes obviously. They can still use bitcoin. It's not like they run rest of the internet infrastructure, either.
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:57:42
Untrue. Stores don't hold BTC for refunds, this is true. They can still refund you BTC though, just the USD equivalent that you spent. Meaning you get less BTC back if price went up in the meanwhile. 
Even if they held BTC, it'd be stupid to give BTC refunds for the BTC amoun paid because people would easily exploit this. It's not going to change until BTC becomes as stable as other currencies.
@_date: 2015-08-21 07:07:49

By micro changing the algo? Whatever do you mean? 
I don't believe you can do that, and the effect would be the same as lowering difficulty even if you could. An easier (lighter) algo means more hashrate. A lower difficulty means your fixed hashrate can get more. They're essentially the same thing.

Not really viable / possible currently to make dedicated crypto GPUs. They might not save enough, not worth it to redesign. Maybe eventually if the crypto market keeps maturing and getting bigger.

That's ironic considering how wrong your math is, you're saying 500 000 gigaflops is enough? You do realize that is only 10 000 CPUs? Or 50 GPUs, considering a modern one is about 10 TFlops (10 000 GFlops)? Obviously, this is extremely far from the truth. I have no idea where you got that 1 PFLOP number from. 
The bitcoin network is actually around 500 Petahashes/s, and they aren't comparable to flops but common CPUs/GPUs do a hash in about the time they do 10 000 flops. Meaning you could say the network is doing 5 000 000 Petaflops/s, or 5 million times your estimate. Of course, because those hashes are from ASICs you can't do such a comparison, since mining ASICs can't do flops at all.
That said, lets assume a laptop with a 1 teraflop GPU. You would need 5 billion of these to 50% the current network (doubling the hashrate in the process). Assuming Moore's Law doubling performance every 2 years (it hasn't lately and has been getting slower), it'd take about 32 doublings to get there, or 64 years. For a single laptop to outpace the current network.

It is a problem, however the halvenings help. They cut down on the inflation and thus energy consumption a lot. But those remedies (2-3+ halvenings) are a long way off, and txfees might offset the benefit.

Note that you don't have to use multi-sig in P2SH. I believe making outputs to P2SH addresses is cheaper (less bytes required), but not sure whether spending single-signature P2SH outputs is more or less expensive.

Yeah. Could even mean some losing their money, not getting the final deposits from Bitpay if they handle it real bad.

Not so much the cost of electricity, but to how much electricity the bitoin network would burn. If the value goes up, the mining power follows (and so does electricity consumption). There are limits to how high the electricity consumption can go, before it starts causing real problems and backlash, hence it's sort of a "soft cap"... or at least a brake.

Uh, they haven't made a block since ~12 hours ago. It's not like they can switch the blocks they already mined...

Quite the premium price though.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:00:17
No, it doesn't work like that. Miners will get all the bitcoins (12.5 per 10 minutes) anyway, it's just that if they aren't paying enough to do so, others will join them until it is not too profitable anymore. 
So it's not really possible to mine $200M of bitcoin with $1M of electricity, because soon enough you'll get competitors until the profit margin is more reasonable (like $50M of electricity).
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:27:32
It went up like 50x this year, at some point the party has to end and reality set in. People realize it won't go up anymore, and sell before everyone else does too.

Checks out, can confirm.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:04:15
It kinda does soft cap the value, at $100k the network would be generating $180M worth of bitcoin per day, which would probably also mean $50-100M of electricity consumed. 
At chinese ~$20/MWh, that'd be 2 500 000 MWh / day, or about 100 GW. That's like 50 powerful nuclear plants, or several 20 GW hydroplants, which are the world's largest.
Not impossible, but kind of an unreasonable amount to use. It'd be about half of Germany's installed capacity at $50M / day burn!
I think we need a halvening or two before such values, unless Bitcoin *really* takes over the world and is worth all that energy.
Edit: Actually a better comparison, that $50M daily is about 1000 TWh annually. That's 5% of the whole world's energy consumption. Or 25% of China's. Now *that* does seem very unreasonable indeed.

This can be known, it's going to be 1MB most likely, starting from the highest fee. However, problem is if it's found 30 minutes from now, there could be a ton more TXs waiting. 
So yeah, you're right. It's pretty much impossible to estimate what you have to pay for a priority tx.

I also did a little research and found this:


Jet fuel has energy density of 35 MJ / L, which means a 747 burns at a rate of 35 MJ/L * 4 L/S = 140 MW. That's less than the Bitcoin network, but certainly within the same ballpark.
Granted, a jet engine is very efficient AFAIK and a coal plant is not, so the burn needed for the bitcoin network might be closer to 1 GW.
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:15:43

@_date: 2017-06-29 08:37:45
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:00:21
Apples and oranges also. Lots of bitcoin transaction volume is from change which gets returned to you, and also shuffling money between your own addresses and such, whereas paypal is pretty much all 'real' activity. 
So that's not very useful either. You could compare bitpay and paypal instead, but not everyone uses bitpay.

@_date: 2013-05-21 08:29:23
Yeah, well, it's mining. Mining is a very risky business and requires a quick ROI, and I wouldn't call ASICMINER's that. I don't think it's likely at all they'll be able to keep their current percentage.
@_date: 2013-09-03 17:18:56
Because it's still hugely profitable. Everyone has orders in and is waiting for their hardware, hopefully before the time it will never ROI. However of the current preorders, it's likely none will actually return on investment.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:24:04

We will get a few fast doublings, and then it will level out probably.
@_date: 2013-05-07 13:58:38
Does it now? I've seen some calculations that ROI at current share prices would be 2 years or so, that's a very long time in Bitcoin land. Especially as it's unlikely they will be able to keep their 25% of the network when other asic players get in.

Yep, mining has often been a worse idea than just buying BTC, particularly with ASICs and their preorders. That will likely not change, although I suppose you could buy used ASICs for rather legitimate prices now.
Price rise is a bad thing for miners, it means difficulty will skyrocket and we will NEVER make our precious BTC back.
I feel you man, and I'm in the same boat. Pre-ordered a BFL single on the very first days sales opened for 220 BTC ($1400 or so), made back like 15-20% of that. Pre-ordered a minirig late march for like 350 BTC ($30k), have fuck all to show for it, as I upgraded to Monarchs because MRs were already obsolete and crap by the time I would have gotten it. I'm sure the same will be true of Monarchs, but I didn't really see a way out. Sure, I might make the $30k back if BTC is at $500-1k+, but 80-95% of that BTC is very likely never coming back to me.
Like you I could have 500-1k+ coins now, but alas... I **hope** I've learnt something, and my advice would be to hold on to the coins you have left, don't miss the train completely. Also just stop buying hardware, it's not worth it. Unless you get a real good deal of in-hand hardware and don't see the difficulty skyrocketing soon after, but think very carefully before doing that. I have a feeling it's gonna kick us in the balls again soon, if the price doesn't crash, practically invalidating all hardware bought at old prices, meaning it will make negligible BTC  after that.

@_date: 2013-05-07 12:37:52
Usually there isn't a 10-20k order backlog though with new products, with some of them ordered 10 months ago. In that case you'd expect to get prefential treatment.
Hopefully they really needed they money coming in from new preorders after those reviews, otherwise it's a rather dickish move imo.
@_date: 2013-03-12 18:52:32
BFL seems very good at turning 1-2 day (by their estimate) processes into 2 week ones.
Maybe next week for shipping... Probably shouldn't get my hopes up though. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 10:30:24
They won't. They'll refund the USD's worth, probably didn't keep the BTC anyways.
@_date: 2013-03-09 23:48:57
Max difficulty adjustment is -75% - +300%, so if enough quit it wouldn't go back to 10 mins straight away.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:12:57
Not that much more bitcoin, just 10% or so. I don't think that makes much of a difference, just as it hasn't until now. Bitcoin certainly has lots of challenges ahead of itself, but I don't think 10% inflation means much against the growth we're seeing. And also, it's not like nearly all of those coins will end up on the market. Many will hold those mined coins.
@_date: 2013-03-03 21:32:33
Conservative? Not hardly. It's pretty darn bullish, I reckon most think as $100 the highest for the next 12 months, and even that's stretching it.

@_date: 2013-03-06 22:53:51
True that. It's quite outdated by now, with the focus on mining and all that.
At least IMO, mining should hardly if at all be mentioned nowadays, as it's not something new users can do when ASICs really hit momentarily.

@_date: 2013-05-24 15:01:18
Maybe it's better this way. Mining ASIC market is highly competitive, unlike the desktop CPU market where intel is dominating. 
Do we even want them dominating the mining market? Good for security against government attacks I suppose, but bad for invidual miners. It's a zero-sum game after all.

@_date: 2013-08-13 16:36:30
It's not actually halved. That would mean a 100% increase in difficulty, or 2016 blocks in just 7 days. That would lead to 12 blocks / hour or a block per 5 minutes, and that is not actually happening. We've been seeing 20-35% increases now, and that means about 10-11 days for 2016 blocks.
However, at the end of the difficulty period it can get a bit closer to 5 min.

He means if they hold 20% of the mining power, they simply can't earn over 4 BTC per share because of the reward halving and halving until there's no more reward at 21M BTC.
Of course there's still transaction fees and they do sell hardware, but it's something to think about.

Bitcoins flow 24/7, but getting money into exchanges is possible only on weekdays. That's why it's usually likely for the price to rise Mon-Wed when all the money sent over the weekend gets there, and slump on the weekends.
@_date: 2013-03-18 00:42:25
Checked this list? 
If it's there, it'll probably go through eventually. Give it a day or so. If it still doesn't go through, look into solutions on how to rebroadcast it, preferably with a fee so it should go through. You may have to do some rescan or such, not really sure.

Didn't really read the article, but clearly the author knows nothing if he's calling +20% difficulty per month high. And &lt;1PH by August 2014 high estimate, that's just not going to ever happen. We will hit 1PH this year, I'm quite sure. Regardless, it'll be multiple PHs by Aug 14.
&lt;1PH in a year would mean I've made a killing, and there's no reason the market would let me do that.

As a June single order, thirded.

At 400k shares, if they keep making about 7k BTC/week (~25% of network), that's about 0.02 per share, or about 1BTC per year. That's 2.5 year ROI, which is *insanely* long in the mining world especially with ASICs, a technology most don't have yet. For example, a BFL (I know, heh) minirig I ordered a couple of months ago would ROI in 1.5 months at 120 million difficulty. I think I might have it before such a difficulty.
They can sell some units, but probably aren't going to do that weekly. In a couple of months difficulty will be up, supply will start to catch up with demand slowly, ASIC prices will go down and selling them won't be as ridiculously lucrative as it is now.
Time is running out indeed. While 25BTC block reward will conitinue for 3 years, soon everyone will have ASICs and it will be much more expensive to have a sizable portion of that cake. I do not believe ASICMINER will be able to hold their portion when new and better products come out and are readily available, and the ROIs are going to look extremely bad then, because they already do while mining is still easy.

That has nothing to do with this. There often are 1 hour windows where no blocks appear, due to the random nature of finding them.
Big block would not make the mining any harder, just broadcasting/storing it.

Less than 0.1%? Nope. I'd guess at least 5-10% mine.

Excellent. Been a while since I bought a bundle due to already having too many unplayed games, but couldln't pass this one up now.
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:06:00
Nope. per 2016 blocks.
And bitcoin probably wouldn't be here if you had them all :)
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:39:19
Actually you can. Just estimate from the network speed of the last whatever number of blocks. Doesn't have to be from this difficulty. Most calcs just get it wrong for some reason.

I do believe BTC is quite popular in Germany. Perhaps because it's a country with lots of Euro criticism, and Germans are very afraid of inflation. :)
@_date: 2013-05-18 09:16:22
GOTTA GO FAST
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:40:40
It's not, estimates right after a difficulty change are horribly wrong with some algorithms.
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:04:44
You never will. It cost like 3-4k BTC to buy back then. You should have just bought BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:27:06
This sounds VERY much like bitcoin back at $200+. People just buying in mindlessly without any kind of analysis at all, just because it's been rising fast!
The ASIC/mining hype has gone way out of proportion lately, and I'm quite sure it's a bubble waiting to violently pop.

If you use a pool, then no.
If you solo-mine, I believe you currenly do. Alternate implementations do not though, I believe a fully pruned chain would do. Meaning all spent outputs are pruned away, the miners would only have to know addresses with balances.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:05:29
No, they would still price the electricity in fiat obviously. You would only pay in BTC.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:00:05
Essentially infinite. Something like needing many times the age of universe with a computer the size of the universe or something like that. 
SHA-256 would be unusable at this point too of course, if we could generate hashes with all those 0's in front of it.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:00:19
Ah, yes. I was thinking of storage and not RAM. Still not really sure which one he meant.
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:04:29
That's a risk, bitcoin is risky but the upside potential is tremendous. I think that makes it worth it. 
Just don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and you should be able to deal with it being a total loss.
@_date: 2013-10-15 12:24:17
No, they're about equally as hard to mine compared to their cost. Free market with little friction, so no reason they'd be more profitable.
@_date: 2013-02-21 15:58:05
Yes. Asicminer has quite a few terahashes worth of ASICs online by now.
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:39:06
TL;DR at the bottom please :)
