Yeah dude that’s the point you don’t want people buying dollars to hold...

That’s not how it works.  Without demand from people spending currency those assets (often) aren’t produced which leads to less people working since there’s no demand for their services.
If you make people spend their currency via inflation they either invest it or spend it on assets which puts money into the economy.
The US had a deflationary currency before and it turned out incredibly poorly.

Because people want to make money and if you're sitting on your capital (ie waiting for later) you're actually losing money.

Hoarding currency hands down.  If you hold assets your money has been put into the economy.

Right but then no one wants to spend that currency once they get it which causes the economy to slow down because there’s less demand for goods and services.
If you get paid in USD you’ll either buy goods and services or invest it which means it’s going right back into the economy.
Comparatively you’d take your bitcoin and stick it in your wallet because you’ll make more money just sitting on it.  This might be great for you in the short term but it kills the economy because no one is spending money.

People don’t invest in dollars tho, theyre a currency not a store of value.
 Smart people just keep enough cash on hand to cover emergency’s with a decent enough interest rate to match inflation and invest the rest in stock or real estate or gold or whatever...
