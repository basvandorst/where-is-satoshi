Wow that's awesome! I know you've heard it a lot but its really cool having you and the few others who stop by occasionally. 
It's all going pretty well, just trying to figure out exactly what to do after this college thing! Iv always been a huge car guy and loved racing but never been around it enough to get into it.(thank goodness for iracing lol) A friend and myself are trying to start up a business as neither of us want to "work" for a living, so that's been fun! (Really meaning not sitting at a desk or working from 8-5 everyday).
How about your's? I liked the rant on about them having a race team, you have some cool ideas!

That's very true! Iv thought about something similar before but never was sure what would happen. The coolest part would be the "people" making the team. You could have people with ideas from across the world that could pitch in ideas, some who are probably really smart and might be able to come up with stuff that others have not thought of. 
Without completely giving it away at this time. We are wanting to start something in the restaurant/bakery area. It all started out as a fun project and before we knew it, its been 1 1/2 years of working on our product. We have done a lot of testing and are looking to start off at local events to see what we can do!

Sometimes you respond so quick and unexpectedly, that I feel like if I was walking down the street and mentioned your name. You'd pop out from around a corner to respond to what I was talking about then vanish before anyone knew what happened.
