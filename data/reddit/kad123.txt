Yep an email would be even better but it still has to be signed whether through the bitcoin protocol or otherwise

Obviously, this does not make the transaction immune to attack i.e. if the merchant's private master key is compromised. But it does shift the responsibility to the merchant rather than the customer.

Very good. Still has a fault: as a buyer, you need to put in 105%. If you don't get the item, you have no recourse. However, as a last resort, you can just say you did receive it to at least get the 5% back (causing the scammer to get 100%). And as long as 5% of shmucks do this, it will be a good opportunity for scammers to try to keep exploiting people.
We need to encourage victims not to let scammers get the 100% even if it means they lose the 5%, how? Perhaps, tweak the percentages a little?

Inspirational effort mate. I don't doubt your honesty at all, I think you did a great job. I'm thinking about the wonderful ways in which Bitcoin can aid charitable giving in future. Why don't you lead the way by providing a report of how many Bitcoins you collected (which no one can question as it will be on the blockchain), how many of them did you use on this event, what were the time points and exchange rates for conversion to fiat and a brief summary of how you spent your dollars. The future is brighter if all charities could be that transparent.

The point of making the buyer put an extra 5% is to encourage him to be honest and say "Yep got it" enabling release of funds to seller. Only then does he get 5% back.
edit: basically, i didn't really understand your post. sorry
