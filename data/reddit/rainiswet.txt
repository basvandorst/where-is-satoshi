Price doubled before halving dude. Don't expect any fireworks.
@_date: 2016-08-27 16:23:03
I have to disagree. Price goes up and all you get is more speculators. Addresses are a huge problem. They're long, ugly, nearly impossible to write them down, to average Joe they scream "I'm way too complicated for you". QR codes are clumsy and old, the contactless feature on my bank card is way quicker and easier, I can even use it on public transport in my city. It's effortless. The internet became mainstream when all the techy stuff was hidden. Pegged coins are essential. The average person will never want to "be their own bank", it absolutely terrifies them. Hell it even terrifies me...

@_date: 2018-01-22 14:33:33
I'm talking about a number of things. If you read my post carefully you will see that I'm saying that the *type* of transactions that LN will specialise in are not the same as the type that are currently filling up blocks. Bear in mind that Coinbase likely wont/can't adopt LN because it breaks KYC. In short, LN expands what Bitcoin can do, rather than moves activity from one place to another.

Ask yourself WHY would a supporter of X-coin be so critical of Y new development in Z-coin? Because they benevolently care so much about Z-coins future and don't want them to make any mistakes? Or because this new Y development presents a real threat to X-coins competitive edge and viability?
The fact an altcoin is shitting so hard on LN is the best indicator that LN is on to something big.

The idea is that LN will reduce onchain demand is because it will handle txns that are now happening on-chain, but I would argue that LN will largely facilitate additional txns that are today infeasible. In addition add more demand required to open/close channels. LN will excel at commerce/merchant txns and micropayments, two use cases that aren't happening onchain now because of high fees. LN wallets will be seen as hot-wallets with spending money (like your wallet in your pocket) while high value txns will remain onchain after LN because it is safer. Couple with this the fact that LN will increase Bitcoin's usefulness therefore we can expect more users/demand. The majority of Bitcoin usage right now is trading and speculation, this will be a major use-case for the foreseeable future. You need to close a channel before you can sell BTC for FIAT. 
The only onchain txns I can see LN relieving is cross blockchain swaps (decentralised exchange) which could be significant. Remember LN is not just for Bitcoin, it is for all blockchains.

The screen shot shows that if this rule is "very strict" as you claim, then it is violated by the style guides of the most mainstream of British press, which is a standard of correct english usage. So no, it's not "very strict", and if you correct someone using it casually on a nerdy forum on the internet then you are an A+ grade pedant and most certainly a full blown bore. Thanks.

@_date: 2018-01-22 12:09:18
is a den of delusion, but I personally don't think LN will reduce onchain demand or onchain fees, in fact I think it will likely increase them. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:35:44
Look at it as a bug finding bounty. Bitcoin is over 170 billion dollars secure. Lightning is over 20k secure. It's a honey pot for hackers and that actually helps.

Hello pedant, 'far less' is perfectly fine and correct. Thanks.

It's only cheaper because it has far far fewer users. It has solved nothing in terms of scaling.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:49:59
This is false. LN wallets could be directly exploited to make a txn to the hacker and then close the channel.

What do you think about Andreas's opinion that Coinbase wont/can't adopt LN because it is essentially like TOR and breaks KYC?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:59:08
Hmm, I guess the exchange could handle the private keys and you could send to an exchange on LN. Although LN is going to be tricky for exchanges because it breaks KYC. LN is like TOR for money. Would like someone to explain to me how regulated exchanges like Coinbase could adopt LN given it's privacy features. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:20:39
What does this product do exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:49:29
LN doesn't have a txn limit I'm aware of, it's just a question of liquidity. But besides that, it would be foolish to have your savings locked up in a channel, that's not what LN is for. It's for high velocity and low fee txns, perfect for a hot wallet. It may prove to be robust enough for large txns but that is not really it's innovation as large txns can happen on chain as fees are less of a concern.
Yes you can keep your channel open of course, but this assumes a BTC only economy which is a great goal but far off. Bear in mind that most merchants need to cash out to pay their overheads. Every cash out is closing a channel.
LN enables a different type of transaction activity, so will allow *additional* functionality but I'm sceptical we will see much change in onchain activity as a result. I feel adoption will far outpace any relief that LN brings to the blockchain.
I am essentially a Bitcoin maximalist and would love to see fees come down while maintaining decentralisation. LN is undeniably incredible tech and will change the cryptosphere forever. But I just don't see how LN is the answer to our low-fee prayers.

@_date: 2018-01-23 10:07:40
Regulated FIAT/BTC exchanges need to know that the blockchain address you send/receive from is yours. That's no problem on-chain as you keep a static address and your exchange address stays the same. LN is like TOR. The receiver doesn't know where the money comes from, only the last 'hop' in the chain. Also the exchange does not know the recipient is the final destination, or just another hop in the chain. There is no way for the exchange to know if the customer is sending or receiving the money, thus breaking KYC. This is my understanding anyway, someone more knowledgeable than me on LN pls feel free to correct me.

That's a fair point, with more adoption comes less 'hardcore' Bitcoin enthusiasts who care less about the whole 'be your own bank' thing. 
I don't think Ethereum has that much going on compared to Bitcoin TBH. Ethereum is good at marketing but it has far more issues to fix than Bitcoin. It's blockchain is already bigger and growing faster and it's no where near as old as Bitcoin. Also the only use case so far has been ICO's. Everything Ethereum does can also happen on Bitcoin. I have a bet on ETH too because I like Vitalik and their 'move fast and break things' ambition. But there is no way Ethereum can make Bitcoin redundant, it will never be Digital Gold, no one can even say what it's final coin issuance is, and they're are not against rolling back the blockchain, something practically impossible with Bitcoin. Where as on the flip side, Bitcoin *can* make Ethereum redundant.

Well done for not down voting this post for daring to take it's head out of the clouds. I've been into bitcoin for years. The amount of people including close friends I've recommended it to? ZERO. I live in a developed and wealthy nation. Why would I? What on earth are they going to do with a bitcoin? It just plain doesn't have any trick going for it *for the average person*. YET. I think the first reason my mates will want some bitcoin is to pay for some online content. Some big music/film/tv thing will use a streamium type service. This will only happen when Circle/Coinbase/Etc are nicely globalised. I'd say 2-5 years. (I'm going to go out on a limb and say we won't reach an ATH until something like this happens. The halving will give a kick but no ATH. Just a hunch really, tho my entire Bitcoin investment plan is based on a hunch so...)

@_date: 2018-08-08 14:22:07
Keep your cool, or buy more so it brings your average cost down. Even though my average cost started at $1200. It is now $400 because I bought more in the $200s. Easy to say I know, but dropping lower is a buying opportunity if you know you want to invest at all, you would of loved it if it were lower when you bought the first time... Anyway, I'd hold to 2021 at least, Bitcoin will rally after the halving if it won't happen before.

I've been around since 2013 and I would not be amazed at all. Last few bear markets have bottomed roughly around previous bubbles ATH. That would put the bottom of this market sub $2k. Just saying, if that happens, you should definitely freak out and buy with both hands.

I'm not going to short Bitcoin! I'm not crazy and my arse shall remain dry. I have no idea what's going to happen and I think neither do you or anyone else. That's my point by mentioning all the major price movements. You can't just pick some and say that they are halving related but not others. I bought all the BTC I need years ago and I'd love to see the price rise like anyone else. A bit over a year ago there was a small contingent over at that were hyping this 'bubble theory' idea. They had a lot of charts and stats and they convinced many people that a new bubble was imminent. Enough people were bullish that the price went from $450 to $650 quite quickly. Then it run out of steam and has been in decline ever since. Personally I expect a similar result from the halving. We WILL get a price rise due to the hype around it, but it wont bust the ATH and as such it will be short lived. Time will tell. I really don't see any reason why reducing the mining reward has any connection with price and no one that thinks it does has demonstrated any reasoning that isn't fundamentally misguided about the nature of price discovery.

Social attacks are a huge vulnerability. 100% agree. Just wait until governments direct their crosshairs at Bitcoin, which they will soon enough... 
Bitcoin is engineered to use human incentives (greed being a big one) to keep it strong. It's trustless. While the anti-fragile narrative might be a bit of a myth, it is still the goal. Yes Bitcoin needs an altruistic community to nurture it into existence, and we are part of that, but ultimately it should be resistant to minority evil (which was my point).
On the contrary, if the majority of humans want to kill it then maybe it get's killed then maybe that's just democratic...

I think over-the-counter sales will remain a novelty because NFC cards are quicker and easier. I don't think you can get much easier than a NFC card without doing away with the card altogether. I think Banks/Apple etc can compete with bitcoin in almost all the bitcoin-as-money cases. I don't forsee mainstream people in the west keeping their savings in Bitcoin any time soon, if ever. The exciting applications for me are new unprecedented ones. Decentralised share markets and contracts and DACs and such. It might not necessarily be Bitcoin that wins the race either, but blockchain tech isn't going anywhere.

I see your point. When  tweets some nonsense it's nice to see 95% of responses calling out their shit. I don't really want to discourage technical rebuttal and calling out false information. It's just that so often in this world loud-mouth idiots get legitimised by smart folk who engage them in debate, which can make a casual viewer believe that the idiot has a point. And personal attacks and memes don't help us either, just sinking to their level. 
As you know, BCash is a completely boring fork, a failed fork at that as it wanted to replace Bitcoin. The technical debate is over and they know it. So now they do this whole "BCash is the real Bitcoin" brand hijack shit which I honestly believe does them more harm than good *without* us engaging with them. Because there is no authority to say who is right the whole 'real bitcoin' shit is just strawman and best ignored. It's obvious to any noob that the real Bitcoin is the one worth way more money and is called 'BITCOIN'. So some other mob ranting about Satoshi's Vision just appear like scammers, no input needed. The whole brand hijack shit just will not work. It can't. It wont. Ignore it.
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:50:12
Battling them on the 'real Bitcoin' strawman is a sure way to keep BCash relevant. As long as there is a debate then they have relevance. It will NEVER be settled because, as you say, it's unregulated and ungoverned. There is no 100% proof that BCash is not "real Bitcoin" and there never will be. The only thing keeping the claim alive is the debate.

Even as a casual user I'm faffing around trying to find how it all works. This is money and whenever money is offered, seemingly for free, scam alarm bells go off like mad. As a non-bitcoiner I would not bother for a dollar. No way. I'd be certain there was a catch. Even as a bitcoiner you are bombarded with scams. Bitcoin sites HAVE to be super slick and pro. Not many are. Circle is a bench mark. Coinjar is great too. Changetip is just not in that league yet. This whole movement still has a way to go to be taken seriously. But that's why we're here right?

Depends how quick the run up is. If it runs up quick like it did Nov13 then it will def crash again.

IMO what will drive mainstream adoption is it's use online. I foresee large newspapers implementing this instead of paywalls. Pay per read and free with micro tipping. No mainstream newspaper will do this until it's completely easy to buy them. Whens that? When gov regs are super clear and the banks start getting involved. Few years yet to go guys...

A valid fear. The road to Idiocracy is paved with handsome popularist slogans. Don't worry about me, I don't have a pinch of power. I struggle to control my own socks. I certainly don't know enough about bitcoin core to comment on it's structure, and I don't mean it to sound trivial that 'magical code' can solve mining centralisation. It would have to be *genius* code and that is like inventing bitcoin in the first place. So we know it *can* happen, just don't expect it to. You're right, Bitcoin is worth enough now that if it had major flaws they would be exploited now. But it still doesn't allay my major fear (and I'm not saying it's def not irrational) that bitcoin has yet to truly enter the world stage, it's still a sideshow joke to the real holders of true global power. But if it ever gets to a point where it might threaten to take some of that power away (and I truly hope it does) I just really hope that it is strong enough and resilient enough to withstand a full force attack from powers so vast I doubt neither of us can fathom. Because *if* it did threaten those powers they *would definitely* attack it.

Let us make utterly sure because the risks are kinda high'. **Bitcoin's value utterly depends on 1.)

But it *IS* concern trolling, you just need to zoom out from the issue. This whole "If Bitcoin is THIS it can't be THAT" is irrational. Bitcoin is new, it's is many many things and can be so much more, it's not comparable to anything that's come before, it can be settlement, money, commodity,  contracts, database... It's potential is so much bigger I think many people just don't look up and see it. The most important thing is to build an absolutely bomb proof base layer as decentralised as possible. The rest can go on top, including yes, your fungible currency and payment network.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:09:02
I totally disagree. Flooding the network has happened many times. If anything it makes Bitcoin stronger. Sure it works if you have a bunch of socks ready to leverage it for FUD, but without the socks you just have a stress test, which is arguably more useful than lethal.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:25:10
BITCOIN: Decentralised, trustless, store of value. We need all 3. This has never been done before and it needs to be bullet proof.  I don't believe this *'ahhh but another coin will just over take bitcoin'* bullshit. Any coin approaching BTC marketcap will have all the same issues of sever scrutiny and FUD. Core: Take all the time you want, keep it decentralised and make it immortal.

@_date: 2016-03-05 14:33:10
There's been spam attacks or 'stress tests' like this, it's impact is negligible and hardly going to take bitcoin down. And if it was, we can just change the code to mitigate the issue.

@_date: 2016-03-06 14:02:22
I've been around a long time too my friend. My point is, spam and long transactions can be fixed with code, if a gov or some malicious actor can just flood Bitcoin and break it, and it can't be fixed, then Bitcoin sucks. But it can be fixed, with code. Can you fix a coordinated shill campaign and rampant spread of misinformation and FUD with code? If only. I don't think that's retarded.

Yes, there's people that have contributed more. But there's a hell of a lot more that have contributed less. As I've said before, Mike got me into bitcoin, so I'm biased. He did some really great presentations years ago where he clearly demonstrated some of the more creative and innovative potential of the technology.  Yes he can be conceited. Yes he can be smug, arrogant, egotistical... But I've met him, he wasn't a dick. Is he *"definitely a bad actor"*. No. Was he a malicious secret agent from the very start? Extremely improbable. Has he now been seduced by entrenched interests? Yeah it's looking that way. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:22:28
No. Mike didn't quit for personal gain, but I'm guessing you are in Bitcoin for personal gain. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:29:09
The sooner we can lock bitcoin code off and say 'that's that' the better. There is only so many hard forks that can be done. It will never be perfect but it does need to scale. After that it should not be touched unless there is a bug. The innovation can happen on top.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:43:37
The world still doesn't know what Bitcoin is for. And neither does for that matter. Is it a new world currency? (prob not) Store of value? (more likely). Backbone for internet of things once sidechains are a reality? (I fucking hope so). Brand new technology that's secured by a stupendous hashrate that allows a multitude of new applications to be created? (definitely). But what's it worth right now? Well the market is struggling to work it out. 
I personally believe it's got a future, enough to snap up over a one in a million share of the pie. But its got a hell of a tough time ahead. I don't expect 2015 to be any better FWIW.

It would be hard to disrupt the huge players as they are like banks in the entertainment industry, in that they will often lend money upfront to promoters to be payed back with ticket sales. What's interesting is what if the venue is unorthodox/pop up? What if you want to throw a huge warehouse party for specific audience and want to charge a few bucks to cover costs? There are thousands of uses for a once-off secure ticketing system with zero upfront cost and zero commission.

Don't care for your analogy but I agree. The whole revolution with bitcoin is that it's decentralised. It is potentially incredibly disruptive to entrenched wealth and the world's most powerful nation states. They will want to destroy it and a few nerds don't stand a chance. It's not broken, in fact it's one of the most resilient pieces of software ever written. It should be basically impossible to change unless it's broken.  The more it *can* be tinkered with by a few devs the more it can be infultrated by *powers of evil*. If we accept it as unchangeable like a fundamental force of physics then we *will* find ways to make it scale.

Upgrade if it breaks, which it hasn't for a really long time. Bitcoin in it's current form is remarkably resilient. Digital money! It's a really big deal and it's incredible it works at all. I'm just saying, don't fiddle unless it's really really really necessary. Doing everything on-chain is not a solution anyway, never was.

Holder since 2013, this shit is going sideways until October, with maybe new lows around 2k or even 1.5k. By October I think the imminent halving will push us out of the bear cycle and expect to see year end around 4-6k. 
8k by mid 2020.
After that we will build steam and eventually bust 20k again, and then it's game on motherfuckers.

@_date: 2017-11-10 14:15:20


True. In fact all of bitcoin's code is 'man made' ;)


Did you read the article I linked above? It depends on where you attribute the value. 


You can have it all. Scale, value, censorship resistance. This biggest compromises are being made by BCH at this moment.


Cash supporters seem to think that bitcoin can be used for payments at scale ON CHAIN. You don't have to extrapolate far until you realise that this is just practically impossible. You don't have to believe me, but you can believe one of the smartest guys in this space 
Cash has just kicked the problem down the road, and for what? I honestly don't think it has a superior economic model at all. In fact there are dozens of altcoins that do what BCH does already. What's the big innovation? Nothing.
I'm happy BCH exists, maybe the market will value it more some day. I personally think it is uninteresting. I think a super secure base layer is a better value proposition to build on top of, high fees may be necessary, but you won't notice them because your payments will be on another layer. I think most of the issue here is just impatience. Bitcoin *didn't even exist* 10 years ago and now all of a sudden it's crucial that we rush ahead. Give it another 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:16:27

If that were true then we will be seeing them abandon the fork, as it is miles away from having community (and developer) consensus. Until they announce they are abandoning the fork, it's safe to assume that community consensus means nothing to them. Have you seen any sign that they are abandoning this? Blind hope wont change the fact that this is an attack. It's a real threat. Don't simply dismiss it because you don't understand the motives behind it.

r/BTC is not really moderated. Your post wont be deleted, but if it smells even slightly of being anti BCH it will be downvoted to oblivion. r/BTC was started as a response to moderation in r/Bitcoin. It was supposed to be a free and uncensored place to discuss alternate clients and implementations of Bitcoin. But the irony is, that r/BTC has just as strict censorship via the downvote button, if you comment anything that challenges the party narrative it will be downvoted to hell and your comment will be collapsed out of view. You can see this on almost any thread there.

Totally. However not using a string of words in any printed consecutive order vastly improves security and if you don't know the source (in this case a published book) i think it would be uncrackable. Even then, scanning every published book with every combination of codes you can imagine is pretty high entropy. But I totally get your point. Humans are really really terribly bad at randomness. We are obsessed with patterns. We even want to find patterns in things that are truly random. You'd think bitcoiners would get this but have a cursory glance over at and you'll see bitcoiners looking for patterns in random charts all day long.

Yes Segwit is a Bitcoin improvement that has been rolled out but wallets have to opt-in to use it. If everyone used it we would fit more transactions in blocks and reduce fees. There's also a bunch of other more technical benefits.

With ETH reaching $400 USD again I thought I'd compare the market distribution since when it last did 5 months ago. Back then BCH was imminent but didn't exist yet, and the shadow of 'The Flippening' was growing.
**June 18**
* BTC 37.8%
* ETH 31.3%
* XRP 9.8%
* LTC 2.1%
* NEM 1.6%
**Nov 23**
* BTC 54.2%
* ETH 14.9%
* BCH 9.6%
* XRP 3.7%
* LTC 1.6%
Looking at this you could argue that BCH has taken share from other alts more than Bitcoin. You can draw your own conclusions. But with BTC way ahead of the pack at 54% of a 1/4 trillion dollar market, it's a sight to behold. I hope Satoshi is alive and feeling like a proud mother (you know Satoshi is a woman right?).

And now you are both just arguing about 'community support' because BCH hasn't actually innovated at all. It's true. And if it isn't, what is the big innovation of BCH compared to the dozens of other altcoins with low fees?

Thanks I know this sub isn't responsible for the fork. Personally I don't support it. But I started my first Reddit account years ago just to read and contribute to and I've learnt so much from browsing this sub. This sub is a first port of call for a huge amount of people learning about Bitcoin for the first time. So I guess with that comes some responsibility to use the platform to educate people. I get that it's a community and no-one is solely responsible, but a lot of mods, like yourself, were once readers and became mods after participating so helpfully. We always said that Bitcoin will be attacked one day, well that day has come, it's a war now, and the first vicim of war is the truth. We need to fight with clear and concise information. Thanks for the Wiki, It's a good outline and hopefully the more technically knowledgable of those amongst us can find some time to contribute.

He isn't "absolutely" right. He is right in the narrow and technical way he means it. But to say I am "not using Bitcoin" is also false, because I quite clearly fucking am. It's akin to saying that using a web browser is not using the internet. You could choose to argue that is true. You could also choose to not be a troll and contribute positively to the conversation.

OK I get that. I like decentralised digital cash too, but I like the idea of it being a layer 2 development on top of a Digital Gold store of value. That's the idea for bitcoin. Assuming you want it to grow in popularity, increasing block size only kicks the can down the road if you want to do all your transactions on chain. Personally I really like the idea of microtransactions, fraction of a cent, which will never be feasible on-chain. So I agree with you, but I think Bitcoin's roadmap is better and stronger than the BCH model.

I like the BTC/BCC split. There are two distinct ideologies in the community and now they have their separate projects. BTC has the best engineers and minds supporting it. There is a lot of noise and hysteria in this space which is hugely distracting. I'm very happy that maybe now Core can get on with their vision. On-Chain cash is a untenable. BCH crowd want to go back to 'the good ol days' of only 3 years ago like the exact same issues wont happen all over again. What about microtransactions? Never gonna be feasible on-chain. The whole roadmap is so short sighted. On-Chain cash is just not feasible. Incredibly gifted engineers like Andreas Antonopoulos are explaining this yet BCH supporters prefer the opinions of hot headed entrepreneurs who just want to make money.

When BitPay hired core dev Jeff Garzik sentiment was positive. BitPay even said that all major bitcoin companies should hire a core dev. Again, everyone seemed to think that was a great idea. Circle hired Mike Hearn for instance. Great. All bitcoin companies are 'for profit'.

**"Be Your Own Bank"** is an absolutely **PETRIFYING** idea to most people.

The second choice is Bitcoin.core FFS. They are both full clients that will download the entire blockchain. New users will just give up. A full client is not a light introduction to bitcoin! 
There should be a **Bitcoin Quick Start** that just gets you going with Coinbase or something (boooo Coinbase I know but what's better for noobs?), obviously with a highlighted bit that explains that you don't *own* your coins if you entrust them to Coinbase.

Receiving is fine but if you send BTC to a BCH address (assuming the receiver doesn't have the bitcoin.com wallet) it won't turn up. It's confusing enough as it is and this won't help at all. You can't expect new users to understand how blockchains work.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:48:13
At the blockchain level it is a Store of Value. It doesn't actually have to be technically superior to other coins, it can be forked at anytime anyway. What it needs is the largest marketcap and tons of liquidity. It has both. You don't hear it from devs much but the price is a feature too.

I've thought about generating an address from a popular easy to find book. (eg: DaVinci Code) Then generate an address from some pattern. Like every 15th word for 40 words. Or the 5th word on every page for 30 pages. Then you wouldn't need to store anything except a reminder of the code. I never did it as I can think of numerous issues (like differences in the print edition of a book). But the idea of hiding your wallet key in plain view around the world and only having to remember the code appeals to me.

Imagine the vast increase of such burglaries if it became normal for every home to be a bank vault?? That's even scarier. I store all my bitcoin on paper wallets and I really really am not comfortable about it. I just feel Bitcoin is still too unregulated and wild west to trust anyone with my keys yet.

For now just use BCH or another low fee crypto. Bitcoin is being prepared for much bigger things.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:29:07
If people are holding a lot of cash then (once it's stable) Bitcoin would be far safer. Considering you can hold keys in several places and have them encrypted (even if you wrote them down you could disguise them so anyone finding them still doesn't know how to use them). Cash is in one spot at one time and if anyone gets it then it's obvious what it is and it's gone. Far riskier. I know people with Silver buried in their back yards. I wouldn't be cool with that either...

Mass adoption can come when transactions are practically free. That requires layer 2. The fundamental innovation of bitcoin is decentralisation. If you comprimise that you just end up with really really expensive database. Don't be fooled. When we pay high fees we are paying for decentralisation.

The problem with those generic bitaddress.org paper wallets is they say "This is a bitcoin wallet, here are the instructions for stealing all the bitcoins". My paper wallets have no indication what they are, they are just raw unencrypted private keys in text and that's it. No QR. They look thoroughly uninteresting and almost like just random junk. You'd have to know exactly what you're looking at and that narrows it down a lot, if some random person broke into your safe they'll have no idea. I've gone one further and put them in an old book. People naturally would think it's the book it's self that has some sentimental value and wont notice the private key written near the spine on page 347.

I'm a pretty non-academic bitcoin enthusiast. I didn't know anything about monetary policy, the fed, quantitate easing, inflation, deflation, hyperinflation, banking, you name it. I certainly had never heard the term 'Fiat'. I learnt all that after getting into bitcoin. Thinking back I'm trying to think what DID hook me. It was two things. 1) The price going bananas coupled with the hard cap on the amount that can exist. (woah I could own 1 in a million share of this tech quite easily!!) 2) the decentralised programable money bit. The fact that you could put a bankaccount in a car or a fridge appealed to my nerdy side and I could instantly see the potential value of that. 
However "You could be a fridge!" is not a great slogan...

Bitcoin is not going to destroy banks, banks will just adopt it. Perhaps one of the reasons that companies like Coinbase and any exchange can't get a stable banking partner in the UK is not because the banks have their head in the sand, they just want to BE the exchange. Because what's the use of Coinbase if your existing bank suddenly supports holding a BTC balance beside your fiat with simple fluid exchange between the two? And further, after this what's Coinbase but another bank?

Don't ever destroy a paper wallet. Keep it on file. You may need to prove you had control of that address some day. Like if you were claiming CLAMS now for instance and needed to prove a 2014 balance. Or if there was a chain split and you still had a balance on another chain. Don't destroy them, just mark with a big red sharpie "do not use" or something :)
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:30:39
Yes it would. Bitcoin as a global currency is a terrible idea unless every country is economically equal. Which of course they never will be. Controlling your money supply is a useful economic tool. We don't need to destroy fiat, people just need to learn to not store their wealth in fiat.

Maybe why I never stand in line at a bank. When I buy bitcoins online the seller releases the bitcoins when they get the money in their account, which is often within 5 minutes.

True and people will LOVE digital currency. I think Bitcoin is going to be absolutely essential just like computers are now. But having your bank account drained with no chance of it ever being returned because you made a technical error? No thanks. This is where we are going wrong. People don't *want* their money in cash under the mattress. They want it in a bank where it's insured and protected by experts. But we can't trust banks now. So we build a bank you CAN trust. The innovation here is decentralised trust. Not some digital version of hoarding cash in your sock drawer.

Long enough to see this sub more than triple in readers... The idea of Bitcoin as a base layer of value, one that payments can be built on top of, goes back way before to the days when Satoshi was still active. Bitcoin is NOT meant to be a payment network. Bitcoin is meant to be MONEY. The US dollar is not a payment network. SWIFT is. The Lightning Network can be the SWIFT of Bitcoin. This is the thing the Bitcoin Unlimited crowd just refuse to understand. Once you get it you realise that Core totally get. Core are what's best for bitcoin and (almost) all old school bitcoiner's would agree. This says it all better by someone who understands bitcoin better than I understand anything: 
@_date: 2017-04-23 11:11:58

A Antonop and Amir are great. I've met them both and saw them speak on the same night years back. But what is the issue with inspiring other types of thinkers that appreciate the wider ramifications of this movement? It's the thinking that tech types have all the answers to questions beyond their discipline that I find fundamentally ignorant. I'm a non-tech person myself, I do not appreciate bitcoin for it's tech because I don't understand it, but I appreciate it's disruptive potential and that is what interests me most.

I'm hardly an expert but my understanding is no, unless you are 'closing out' your LN channel. 
The Eclair wallet I used is a Bitcoin + Lightning wallet so it can handle both. I think pretty soon all 'trad' Bitcoin wallets with have LN built in. But you still won't be able to send satoshis from your LN fund to an old school bitcoin address, they need to be sent to other LN addresses. 
When you want to close out your channel then you do that to a traditional bitcoin address. The idea is you'd only do that for cold storage so the vast majority of your transactions happen on LN.
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:16:52

LN is important but it needs tweaking and we still need more. We need Privacy/Anonymity and we need a framework for Turing Complete Dapps to be utilise the core network. On top of all that we need frictionless on/off FIAT ramps to enter the system. And bullshit simple UX. Then we need the bull rally to end them all and no shitcoin, or even worthy altcoin, will have anything on Bitcoin to compete with.

Back then people would always say "It's going to 10k or Zero, nothing in-between" Well now we say 100k or zero. I think Bitcoin will easily reach 100k, I'm more bullish than ever. Back in 2014 I thought FOR SURE all significant governments would ban this shit outright. It's way too late for that now. Bitcoin has survived so many attacks. Last year was the worst IMO. Moneybadger don't care. I think it will surpass golds market cap in the next 10 year's. It wouldn't surprise me if it did it in 3. Hodl.

Yeah I get that, it's really cool. But I'm asking Ledger to support Bech32 in their Ledger Live software. So saying just use Electrum as some kind of answer to that question is beside the point. Also Electrum doesn't support multiple assets in one wallet so I would be losing functionality.

Agree! Not suggesting that though am I? BIP39 seeds words are all incredibly common, yet it's considered incredibly secure. It's about the order of words. If you rolled a dice and picked random words from any old book it would be just as secure. But yes, don't pick 'ordered' words, ever!

I find it fucking hilarious (and sad) that my request for the wallet software I use to support a feature is met with 'just use something else'. Even a Ledger dev told me this. WTF? 
For starters Electrum doesn't support multiple assets from one device so I'd be losing functionality. SMH. Can I not simply request a fucking much needed bitcoin feature be added to a product *on a thread about that fucking product?* Christ this community is actually retarded sometimes.

Because Bitcoin is better money it will encourage people to save more and spend less. But remember, people don't want money, they want what it can buy. People spend top dollar on a new laptop today knowing it will be worth next to nothing in a few years time. People will still spend Bitcoin because people want stuff.

@_date: 2017-09-23 23:24:11
Yep. Though it doesn't have a hard cap - at this point I believe the supply is diminishing and apparently it will be capped eventually or be very fractionally inflationary. Ethereum dudes please correct me.

@_date: 2017-10-11 17:05:49
Why we are still early adopters? Because Bitcoin is still in Beta! Only once the base protocol is practically set in stone and we have plenty of layer 2 development (or layer 3 even) will this shit be ready for mainstream users to get it. For instance Bitcoin will never be mainstream while we're still messing around with ugly raw addresses like 3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r Does that look like the future to you? This shit has years to go, maybe even a decade. Price will be north of 60k IMO.

It's not the 2mb bit, it's the firing of the core devs. 2x is a different project and core devs don't have commit access to it. 2x is largely about taking the project and power from core (or arguably core giving it away by being stubborn)

There's talk about refunding the Parity bug ETH in the next hardfork too. I have some ETH but it's in a different league to Bitcoin IMO. No a threat at all. Doesn't even have a hard cap coin limit, yet, if ever.

TL;DR Bitcoin is volatile. I goes up a lot, it goes down a lot. But mostly it goes up. Just HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:08:04
Maybe I can help. Blockchain is redundant without a token of value. The tokens power the blockchain and the incentive structure that keeps it decentralised, trustless, and censorship resistant. Remove the token and why do you need a blockchain at all? It's just a vastly inefficient expensive shared database without the valuable token. Tokens power blockchain, not the other way around.

Drives me wild seeing people gloss this over when talking about bigger blocks. Sacrificing even a tiny fraction of decentralisation is unacceptable and undermines what makes bitcoin valuable and revolutionary. We need to increase decentralisation, doing so is the true and only path to moon.

Demand is right, but not the rest of your statement. The physical use of gold only makes up a fraction of its price. The rest is speculation. The labour of extraction is the same as proof of work bitcoin mining. It's only because of demand, not a value in itself.

Sure but main objective is to answer the question "will my coins be safe" which is getting asked multiple times in any thread about the fork. Worried users are looking for a straight answer, they don't necessarily care who supports it or not.

3 arguments against 2x off the top of my head:
* 1) Core devs don't have commit access to the project and don't support it. Core devs are the original cypherpunks who invented this whole thing in the first place. They are the least likely to be influenced by 'get rich quick' mentality and most likely to have bitcoin's best interests at heart.
* 2) We have segwit which hasn't come close to reaching it's potential yet. We don't need bigger blocks yet. Slowly, steadily, surely.
* 3) Less mining decentralisation. Even if only a fraction, is unacceptable. Decentralisation IS THE innovation of bitcoin. Without it it's just a shittier Paypal.

Whatever you do, DO NOT PUT YOUR PRIVATE KEYS IN ANYTHING IF THEY STILL HAVE A BITCOIN BALANCE!! Empty the Bitcoin to a new address first. Then you're safe.

About a week after I sold. All at once in one go. After I saw BearWhale cash out like 30,000 coins at $300 it occurred to me that there were probably a lot of early adopters taking profits and the fundamentals of Bitcoin have never changed. Today the fundamentals of Bitcoin have never been better.

You're right, I did say that. I meant 'in the spirit of' original cypherpunks. Which I believe is true. Core have an incredible track record of building and maintaining this project. I don't think anyone can reasonable argue with that. 'Firing' core would be incredibly reckless and hardly worth a measly 1mb increase.
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:44:03
Uhh if this is possible then it
is bitcoin that's broken, not some reckless miner. "Trustless" remember.
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:29:45
I edited my comment. Bitcoin is inflationary too at this point, it's just that the total eventual supply is known now and coded in. It will reach 21million coins when they are all mined in 100 years or so.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:23:46
This could of been (almost) any of us. To those saying 'you're a moron' have some sympathy. Bitcoin has gone up a shitload this year and a lot of old timers that bought a few coins years ago are suddenly minted. There never used to be malware stealing ya bitcoins but now there seems to be a lot of it and more by the day. Bitcoin security isn't as easy as people around here make out. Being your own bank is fucking stressful. 
**EDIT:** Some people still don't get it. My point is there are many people that used to have say $1000 of BTC on a paper wallet that now have $50,000 on a paper wallet. Perhaps they don't even see it as 50k, they're just like 'oh yeah 10 bitcoins' which was an amount you'd see tipped on reddit. ([20BTC tip right here]( These same people have been in Bitcoin for many years and are used to just using electrum on their computer to sweep wallets. That was totally fine a few years ago. Now it's not. There were no hardware wallets then. Now there are. Great. If you want to sweep that old paper wallet onto a new hardware wallet how do you do it securely? Get a whole second air-gapped linux machine to sign an offline transaction and write it down by hand so not to use a compromised USB key? It's easy to say 'it's easy' but really? Bitcoin used to be friendly and fun - now it's high stakes and dangerous and it changed overnight. So PSA for those complacent old-schoolers and a call to cool it for the ledger newbs. Just help your elders cross the road.

True, but less and less as it becomes ubiquitous. AC/DC and Taylor Swift held out for ages but they crumbled when Apple Music launched. Not many big artists holding out these days and lesser by the day. It's because it works. I used to torrent WAY more before I got a Spotify subscription. Now I just torrent what's not on it. And if they all go on then they get paid and I torrent nothing. Is that so bad?

The thing is Roger is an aggressive salesman. He boasts about being a self made millionaire like that gives him authority on computer science and economics. But Bitcoin was never invented by people like Roger, and it wasn't invent *for* people like Roger. Roger is not a coder/developer/cypherpunk. He's a libertarian capitalist and *craves* power. His tactics during this whole fork split debacle have been diabolical and very rarely based on technical merits.

Ho hum. This is just a paid download, and media downloads are dead now anyway. It's all about streaming.

1) Big issue. How do you verify identity in an anonymous environment? Could be solved.
2) No way. Bit torrent is about downloads. It's not going to compete with streaming services which is where it's at now. Spotify is killing it and the first successful model in a post-bitorrent age which destroyed the music industry. Why? Because streaming is more convenient therefore has value.

True. But if you look deeper it's the big labels that do bulk deals behind closed doors that make Spotify so bad for artists like Swift. Independent artists do quite well out of Spotify. It can consistently return twice the profit of iTunes. Source: independent musician.

1) Be very very careful who you take investment advice from
2) With massive gains very often comes massive losses, it's called volatility.
3)Bitcoin has the best proven track record of gains *over a long time*. If you believe in it, buy a bit and WAIT A LONG TIME. I lost a shit tonne before I made a shit tonne. How did I make a shit tonne? Buy not selling it ever. I may still lose it, but that's the ride should you choose to get on.

that 21 estimate is pretty unreliable. It says a 120 sat/byte txn should confirm within 7 hours anyway. I've had a 88.88 sat/byte transaction for nearly 1 BTC stuck in the mempool for a week now. I just want it to be dropped, have no idea when that might happen... It used to be that higher value txns would confirm quicker regardless of fee. Those days are long gone.

Seriously. In my experience Bitcoin can't beat Transferwise in either cost, ease of use, and most probably speed once you factor the bank transfers. International transfers is not Bitcoin's strong point until people start holding bitcoin, but then it SLAYS.
@_date: 2015-03-03 08:54:22
If bitcoin doesn't make it as a currency (prob the most unlikely use for bitcoin) and instead makes it as a trustless digital proof for contracts and a payment rail for banks etc then it could be worth the same as now or less and still be useful as you only need one satoshi to 'colour' a coin. It only needs to be worth 10,000+ to be a useful global currency and that to me is the most unlikely outcome for it.

Decentralised consensus. That's the revolution here. It's easy to take that for granted sometimes but that is a founding pillar of Bitcoin. Killing everything else is hardly necessary to keep the blockchain decentralised, but yes, maybe with very high fees (that is after all Satoshis plan - as the block reward decreases the fees pay the minors - they have to be high or the hash rate will plummet). Small blocks - high fees - solid decentralised store of value for everything else to be built on top of. Transacting with the raw blockchain is hardly the end goal. We are in the stoneage of what this could become if we make sure the foundations are simple enough, absolutely bomb proof and incorruptible.

This might help
"Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.

* OP is not making money off mining alone, he is making money by buying miners from Bitmain at a big bulk discount and then reselling them for profit after a few months of using them 
* OP is not purchasing solar panels just to run miners, OP has solar powered greenhouses and doesn't even need to mine bitcoin to make a profit with his solar system. 
* OP's mining 'business plan' relies on Bitcoin being priced at at least $2000 and *increasing in value over time*. This is the same business plan as hodling.
* OP makes big claims about his elaborate set-up but provides NO evidence and NO photos. OP claims that photos exist somewhere else on reddit but does not provide a link, telling you to sift through his extensive comment history to find them. If you doubt OP on anything, instead of duly providing evidence OP immediately want's to make a high value bet that he's telling the truth.
* OP claims that he is "unbelievably clever" for winning 2000 BTC in reddit bets already, and that is part of the money he's used to fund the MILLIONS of dollars in value this setup would cost. Oh, he also [bought a yacht](

Disclaimer: I don't use electrum. But I'm quite sure that electrum is absolutely fine as you can see your private keys for any of your addresses. So what happens at the fork, from then on you have the same bitcoins on two parallel universes. In the bitcoin universe you continue to use electrum as you normally do, you can send coins around as normal, nothing changes at all. To access the BCC universe you will need a BCC compatible wallet software and then you can import your Bitcoin private keys into it from your addresses that had a bitcoin balance at the time of the fork. (TIP - before you do this I would make sure those addresses are now empty in the Bitcoin universe - incase of funny business, those private keys will still work for those addresses in Bitcoin)  You can then send them to an exchange that deals with altcoins and sell them for BTC or whatever else you like. Withdraw the BTC, done. For info on BCC wallets etc try over at -
 maybe don't mention that you plan on selling them so they don't get mad ;)

@_date: 2017-07-27 10:23:43
Maybe you're getting stuck because you're imagining a smart contract implementation in 'today's world'. Try imagining a world where a machine (say a self driving car) has it's own bank account and can effectively own itself. It can make money (as a taxi) and spend money (on repairs/upgrades). Imagine one of these self owned machines dealing with another self owned machine (say a car wash). They interact, exchange value, pay tax, all automatically.  Now imagine a real life human lawyer or accountant involved and it's easier to see why they might be redundant. I think the best use for decentralised finance and contracts is in a future world that hasn't arrived yet, but is advancing towards us at speed.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:50:31
OK you could def win on speed if both transfers were local, you could turn the whole thing around in under an hour if you were lucky. But at what cost? What's the spread of bitcoin on LBC? If you got through the whole process at less than 2% of mid market exchange rates I'd be very surprised. Transferwise is often .5%.

Yes it's outperformed ETH in certain windows of time. If you had a crystal ball you could of made money trading it, but that is true with any coin. The important piece of information here is that *over time* ETH has performed better than ETC.

@_date: 2017-07-28 01:01:03
ETC v BTC is irrelevant. ETC was bought into to conversation because it is akin to BCC (as in it's a fork). So the relationship of ETC/ETH might give us some insight into BCC/BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:03:40
I did some math too and couldn't see it.
Sell 100 ETC $2 to ETH $12 on Aug 1 2016 (very near the fork in initial bubble) would result in 16.66 ETH.
Current value:
16.66 ETH: $3726
100 ETC: $1572
Sell ETC at the bottom price of 80 cents in Dec 7. 100 ETC 80 cents would have got me 10 ETH at $8
Current value:
10 ETH: $2230
100 ETC: $1572
EDIT: Here's the ratio  You can see ETC lost power over ETH over time. Best time to exchange to ETH was 10 days after the fork. But exchanging ETC&gt;ETH at any time would have done you better if you held onto the ETH.

When it forks it will be just another altcoin. I'm sure Bittrex et al will list it. Bitstamp only deals with very high volume coins. If it becomes one and can stay one I'm sure they'll consider it. It needs to prove itself first and that will take a year at least. They've announced plans to roll out ETH this year actually.

@_date: 2017-07-28 10:22:09
LOL. And what do you learn from cherry picking a tiny window where you might have made huge gains? Over time ETH has out performed ETC since ETC has existed. That's another easily proven fact for you. Literally every coin ever was as volatile as ETC when it started trading with ridiculous swings. It means absolutely nothing to go back highlighting tiny windows and saying "wow look great investment" when it crashed soon after, the fact is it's been a poorer investment *over time* compared to ETH. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:47:05
Exactly. If bitcoin is going to scale and become the backbone of global finance that (almost all of us) want it to be, then on-chain micro transactions is just absurd impractical bloat. A bitcoin transaction may one day be a quite expensive commitment, and bitcoin can STILL suceed if it is.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:01:33


No one will mine it at a loss. It has to be worth something. It's only a big deal if people use it and prefer it. Time will tell. Personally I think it will fail to gain much traction and will be selling mine asap.

No. PRE-FORK if you want the BCC supported exchange to split it for you. Otherwise control the private keys and split it yourself.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:41:36


Seriously WTF are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:03:24
You need to have the private key to a bitcoin address holding a bitcoin balance BEFORE the fork. If you don't control the private keys (IE: they are on an exchange) the last block before it splits is your last chance to get it to an address where you do to be sure you can spend your BCC or whatever-it's-gonna-be-called. Do it now.

Takes one to know one ;) 
Bear winter was a dark time. I sold everything at $330 taking a massive hit. A few days later I saw the bearwhale get slayed and I realised how many other long term oldschool holders had been cashing out. I bought back in for $325. The only trade I ever did. Until recently I sold some and got my initial investment down to 6% of my holdings. Now it would have to crash to $170 for me to lose money, in which case both me and bitcoin will have shit the bed hard.

Bitmain wants to scale on chain, layer 1 only, because that's the layer they (think) they control. It's short sighted by blind greed. Without layer 2 developments Bitcoin will loose a lot of its application potential, and it's market share will reflect that.

@_date: 2017-07-01 10:59:04
My turn to bite.
**Stuff OP has said in this thread:**
* OP is not making money off mining alone, he is making money by buying miners from Bitmain at a big bulk discount and then reselling them for profit after a few months of using them 
* OP is not purchasing solar panels just to run miners, OP has solar powered greenhouses and doesn't even need to mine bitcoin to make a profit with his solar system. 
* OP's mining 'business plan' relies on Bitcoin being priced at at least $2000 and *increasing in value over time*. This is the same business plan as hodling.
* OP makes big claims about his elaborate set-up but provides NO evidence and NO photos. OP claims that photos exist somewhere else on reddit but does not provide a link, telling you to sift through his extensive comment history to find them. If you doubt OP on anything, instead of duly providing evidence OP immediately want's to make a high value bet that he's telling the truth.
* OP claims that he is "unbelievably clever" for winning 2000 BTC in reddit bets already (again, no evidence), and that is part of the money he's used to fund the MILLIONS of dollars in value this setup would cost. Oh, he also [bought a yacht](
Conclusion: OP is a blue-ribbon colossal douche-troll.

Totally disagree. What happened last year was ludicrous. People buying any old shit with a Ctrl+V whitepaper and a wix website. Dentacoin, a coin for dentists, had a 2 BILLION market cap (now 20 Million, still too high). It truly was tulip frenzy and nothing but total bloodbath was required to make sense of it. The fact that Bcash and Faketoshis Vision are in the top 10 still makes a laughing stock of this space. Expert Bitcoin bull traders like Travis Kling have been calling for this (you MUST listen to his podacst with Pomp, best of the year). THIS IS HEALTHY. I mean it. Im also buying for the first time since $800 :)

Slightly OT... but it's it possible for an observer to know that a selection of addresses are from the same HD seed? (like a Leger Nano)
I get that chain analysis could link addresses together from transactions.  But without any transactions, is there anything in the nature of the addresses that would indicate they are linked by a common seed?

That's a lot of data, you'd only bother if you knew people were using this method. You could easily tweak it. Like every 64th letter of page 64 onward. You'd obviously not get on reddit and tell people your idea if you were to do it...
@_date: 2017-06-13 09:54:34
This is kinda the only thing I think. And I'm not sure that will be enough. Truth is that ETH has more devs and apps and is easier to build on. Digital Gold isn't worth shit if the base layer is not being used for other things. BETA was better than VHS. I know I'll get downvoted for this as I've been around here for 3 years now and know how blinkered and cocky the community is. But that won't stop what's quite clearly happening in front of our eyes.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:31:01
I know that. I'm just not convinced a hard cap is enough to make Bitcoin THE ONE. I think above all usability and adoption are what is going to be the most important factor. This comment sums it up:  You think I'm pumping ETH but I'm more interested in the truth by discussing it's merits. It's incredibly hard to have an unbiased discussion as everyone has skin in one game or another. I have split my hold 50/50 now just so I can try and remove the personal bias. It helps a lot tbh. I've been in BTC for over 3 years and I love it. But I think it's far from perfect or infallible.

Scaling will be solved, and when I take time to think about it, it actually is great that there is so much debate and it has been so hard to get something like Segwit activated. It shows how decentralised and hard it is to change bitcoin. It's a 45 Billion dollar honeypot and it's never been hacked. Fucking cool if you ask me. Anyway, see you at the millionaires ball mate. Keep learning and hodl hard :)
