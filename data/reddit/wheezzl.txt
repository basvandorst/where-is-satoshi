So are those strawberries from the looks of it ;)

We have new tech, it just needs to be adopted (lightning, segwit)
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:04:31
It doesn't matter how many times this gets posted, it doesn't make it any more true or factual... it's still stupid.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:45:16
Oh you have one of those too? I'm still waiting for mine to fully grow... that bitch uses up a lot of water though ;)

If you see ICOs push themselves to every possible screen they can by buying ads, you should be vary of them. Especially if you see Roger's face.
I think ICOs that really are going to shine are the ones where the tech speaks for itself and don't need fancy dubstep videos with nice effects to promote them. See Cardano, I don't think I've ever seen an ad for it.

Is there any way to import the blockfolio data into Delta? Took me hours to fill in everything in Blockfolio ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:45:07
Umm... bitstamp has BCash listed and tradable.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:46:16
Thanks, too bad. Will probably try it out anyway.
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:23:03
I recently checked some of these addresses and they had quite some BTC on them (they were only a few days old) so I think it's still a quite lucrative business
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:47:51
They don't get to choose I think, it's coinify that offers those as a payment option. I agree though about the BCH crap ;)
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:14:11
I doubt a company that big (for Swiss standards) will use a beta technology. Maybe once it grows and becomes more stable. Also they only accept it for payments above $200, so fees shouldn't be an issue as long as they don't reach January 18 values.
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:08:22
They use Coinify, that's why, I don't think you can choose what to accept if you use their service (pls correct me if I'm wrong)
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:40:00
...aaaand it's gone ;)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:25:28
I agree, sold my BCH yesterday for more BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:15:47
They are trying their hardest.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:16:55
You mean the choice to not leave any BTC on an exchange at the time of the fork? I think everyone had that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:37:05
You can only mine BTC with ASICs. If you want to mine with a desktop/laptop, you'll have to go for another coin that supports GPU/CPU mining.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:43:10
So outdated... 8620 already ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:42:55
Thats what i'm saying. The question is just whether they sell it for USD or BTC
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:47:45
That makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:01:31
Yeah that would be the perfect way. But if the price of btc keeps rising you're f...d
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:08:12
Nah I'm all good. Still have a bit more BCH to buy more BTC on another account ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:30:19
Don't you think most people would sell their s2x coins and buy even more bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:45:49
No I didn't post any screenshots. Yes, almost all sessions from Brazil, one from Austria.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:49:02
My account was apparently misused too. Got en email from reddit this morning and after checking my history, tons of upvotes on pro BCH/anti-BTC posts... this is getting ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:09:09
Because it could have just as easily gone down at that point, just like when we spent months on 6k before the big drop.
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:41:21
Yeah what an idiot for wanting to end the useless wars and ending the privately owned FED.
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:39:29
Pretty sure his followers know what those are
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:21:34
Salty much?`You do realize adoption doesn't start with the biggest players in the game?
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:18:30
If they at least changed the timeline a bit...
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:34:55
I think this is more about the growing trust in Lightning as people are putting more and more BTC into it (which technically could get lost at any point)
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:12:15
I'm already happy if it holds 9k for a while now. Slow and steady... that's how you grow in a healthy way
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:18:40
nah man, I'm hodling ;)
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:07:39
Yeah, go CNN! Oh wait...
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:23:42
Nobody really knows. I'm personally in it for long term, so I don't really care.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:12:22
Wonder what this jump is all about... within 1 hour more than $400 up
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:19:13
No, it's another repost
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:38:36
I find this movement pretty stupid to be honest. Why not both? I always keep some gold/silver in case of SHTF/no electricity situations. Bitcoin is great, as long as there's internet access (yes I know there's other ways to transmit a transaction, but those are not usable by everyday people)
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:08:20
Isn't the wallet from 2013? Not many big exchanges left that existed back then (I think Bitstamp is pretty much the only one). I might be wrong though.
