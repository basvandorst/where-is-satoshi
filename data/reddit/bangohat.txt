todays market song. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:27:32
I've been in traditional stocks and crypto and have learned very much over the years. I think I finally figured it out. The market will move up or it will move down.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:09:29
I like that. Kind of like getting married to a big lady hoping she will lose weight but just keeps gaining weight. You hodl and finally just get a divorce. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:03:28
Think Crypto as a whole is in huge trouble. Not that crypto is bad but the big banks and governments want to control it.  The worse part is that they know the Dow is at an all time high bubble and when that goes it brings the world down with it.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:12:19
Freefall time yet? My tether is getting an itchy trigger finger.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:26:33
My tether hat is strapped on tight.

Bitcoin has transacted a few trillion dollars. So not sure what you are talking about. You probably have like 50 dollars invested but the people that have a lot pay their bills with bitcoin.

In todays times our founding fathers would be called terrorists and traitors to their own country. Which they were. Everyone hates the south but they were just trying to do the same thing during the civil war as was done in the revolutionary war. So we were founded by terrorists and traitors so it's pretty clear why we are one of the most corrupt and evil countries in the world.

I enjoy tether more.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:40:25
Where is the money going to come from? It was mostly built up by kids that all made a nice profit and I think they are all selling now. Tell my why I should own bitcoin? Blockchain is great but anyone can make that now and you don't need anything to do with crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:01:09
Doubt many who say they are hodling actually are. If you hodl then why even check the price and come to the forums? Take a break and come back a year from now. I'm just waiting for it to hit 5k to buy back in. I hate losing money so hodl is not for me.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:39:39
What happens in the summer? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:33:29
They will short the hell out of bitcoin down to 1k
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:35:41
Actually you have a funny point. Lots of people don't know anything about bitcoin and will say "I can't afford that price" That's why most small time new investors buy coins that are much lower then a penny even though they have like 50 billion circulating supply. You see them all saying when this thing hits 100 bucks we will all be rich. Usually it would mean the markecap would have to be around ten trillion dollars for the coin but hey. Let them dream.
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:44:52
So when a coin vanishes or stock goes bankrupt you don't lose? That is the dumbest thing I've heard. My friend used to say that to me in the past. You only lose if you sell lol. So say you had 100k invested and now you have 5000 dollars. You go winner boy! You can try and sugarcoat it anyway you like to feel better but the math says you lost 95k.
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:31:45
Thought one guy said it was going to hit 500k or he would eat his own di  ck!?
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:58:23
Hodlers how they feel about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:13:11
I'm sure whenever you order something the local establishment probably remembers you and says the ahole is ordering again. I bet you are the type that calls back every time you order something and complain and try and get free items. I had a problem with a local grocery store. Ordered 3 times, they got it wrong every time. So My text was just F U and never ordered again. They are still and will be the richest local grocery store in town and I won't change a thing and don't really care. Have better things to do then complain like a little B.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:06:46
The people are fucked. The rich are setting this one up perfect. They have tried and done ok many times but this is the final blow I think to the average investor, 401k and more. The middle class is just about wiped out.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:20:34
Heard tether is backing around 2 billion dollars worth so I doubt that would crash anything when the market is over 300 billion.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:03:40
Adds are all scams. Banning adds is a good thing. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:11:33
It's how the markets work, same as the normal stock market. They shake out the week hands and suckers then the rich load up at a lower price then pump it back up then the suckers jump back in and the rich dump it again. That's the game. People say hodl but unless you are day trading the only way to stop them is to hodl. They can't force you to sell.
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:48:26
Good point. Nobody in bitconnect lost a dime if they don't sell! lol.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:43:51
Why does everyone get so mad when the market goes down? Just get to buy stuff at a much lower price. If you don't have money set aside you messed up.
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:55:54
If bitcoin goes to 999,999 he can eat my dick.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:29:13
All the charts say we are going to push back over 10k! 
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:26:53
My own bank won't open up with me losing massive amounts of money. I have  bank and they charge me 7 dollars a month. I can deal with that just fine. Crypto just like stocks is gambling. The blockchain is the revolution and most companies will just make their own. I'm honestly debating to buy back in or just sell my tether and exit the game. Tough choice. 50/50 I guess. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:35:35
You might be right. Sarcasm or real tip? I remember seeing Segate when it was like 40 cents they went bankrupt then back up to 40 dollars.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:20:08
So if a knife is tossed high in the air to we try to catch it? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:01:03
It's going much lower, you have no worries of that.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:45:27
He could be right. Bear markets can last years. Look at the past for stock markets and even bitcoin. The big money here, governments are wanting in, WallStreet is wanting in. Do you think they want in at 10k or at 3k?
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:00:20
Pretty sure the apple computer was probably 800 dollars back then. Wow he bought himself a new comp.
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:38:43
I think the OP was trying to say that he's just spreading the word. We are not going to get the old crowd in to crypto. They hate it and will never understand it. So he tips a kid in bitcoin so now the kid is trying to figure out what the hell is this and how do I spend it. He figures it out and teaches some of his fellow workers and they might teach some family members. So one guy could chain to 100's in the end.

Most Trump supporters are the smart ones. The SJW crowd, black lies matter and other losers are the ones that did not vote for Trump and they are the ones without jobs and have all day to protest. The working class voted for Trump.
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:28:14
Dead cat bounce for bitcoin? What do you guys think? I think they are trying to suck in people then the price drops to like 6k.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:21:07
Ask your friends. Google can work wonders. Heard they are like a billion dollar company. Think it's a great option. I bet your grandfather would recommend it.

So you are saying we will either go up or down. I will follow you anywhere good sir.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:52:25
I have done research most of my life on market trends and I can tell you for a fact I have figured it out. The market is going to go up or down from this point on. Don't take my word for it but I think I nailed it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:31:23
More people are starting to understand there is no need for bitcoin in the world. Blockchain yes but crypto coins no.
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:16:23

looks like we are going to drop to 5k min. Hodl and ride it out.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:48:32
The only thing I hodl is my penis. You have to remember when the hodl thing started there was like almost no marketcap. I know so many will say you don't lose until you sell but those are the ones that lose it all in the end.

Pretty sure it's not legal to pay a pizza guy $2.13 because they have to maintain their own cars but I think they can pay them less then min wage when they are driving even though that's when the wear comes in. Messed up system. If they are getting 5 dollars instead of min then that means they have to get a few dollars every trip just to make min wage. They will take the time to learn how to use and spend bitcoin if that's the case.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:47:09
8k is getting ready to be broken. What's your guess on the bottom? 6k? 5k? worse then that and ugg. Have my tether waiting but with the amount of scams in Crypto I'm sure they will vanish any day. The last 14 ICOS I went in where all scams.

Your money is gone :) You are correct. I own a lot of tether.
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:05:40
Everything in crypto is safe until the scam pulls the plug. Tether could last or go under tomorrow. That's crypto. They claim to be backed by USD. So the price of tether really never moves. So it's a good way to store money for a dip or a crash. Makes you sleep a little better at night knowing if you wake up to a crash you actually could make a profit off it.

If history repeats itself then everything is going to happen all over again. I noticed the price of my home has been going up a lot recently. Last time that happened the market crashed and banks were giving loans to anyone and the housing prices mooned. Then the banks all got bailouts , massive amounts of people lost their homes and the housing price then crashed while the stock market started to rise again. The rich rule every market. Was sad driving around and seeing peoples stuff tossed out on the side of the road.
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:32:25
there is no reason for any coin on the market. blockchain is the key but this kid stuff with crypto is done. If you are down or up just get out now. Just think about what I said. What is the point of coins? Most companies will just make their own blockhain.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:11:24
According to all the idiots in stocks and coins they will tell you that you lost nothing in your house unless you sell! That's such a good excuse but it does not change the reality that you lost a ton of money. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:18:47
Last time I ordered pizza from my local dominoes it said right on the box that the delivery fee is not a tip and does not go to the driver. So you are fine hooking the rich owner up but the kid dropping off the pizza is worthless to you.

This is the truth my friend. So many large companies going under. Toys R us is closing all their stores and laying off massive amounts of workers. Yet the stock market rises as well as the number of people on foodstamps in America.

Think the game is over. Starting to ask myself why do we need crypto again? A dollar is a dollar. Hardly get scammed using a visa card or transacting with my bank. The system we have works. Blockchain will survive but I think crypto is dead. No reason for coins especially bitcoin. Up and down prices, high fees and slow transactions. I feel sorry for all the companies that accepted crypto. Wonder how many are going to go out of business.

I don't see why. Crypto adds are always scams. They are not banning crypto talk but just adds.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:45:56
The average person does not think that way. They invest for profits. Imagine if you got coins in the pennies then it hit 10 dollars. I bet many sold because that's a huge gain then if they still held and it hit 100 then gigantic gain. If there is anyone left that got in around 1 dollar or even 10 dollars that is still holding then they are already rich and just let it ride. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:53:14

Gold is a joke. I tried to take some gold to my local store the other day and asked them what my total was and they had no clue how much gold I would have to break off and give them so I just used my bitpay card. What bigger con is gold? We say gold is worth money.. Why? More people use crypto then actual gold. People did a very long time ago it's time to move on. gold is like sending me a letter on horseback instead of just texting me.

Don't want to scare you with reality but every stock and crypto coin is a ponzi scheme. If the money stops flowing in it drops and could die out. So what happens if everyone starts selling Intel? and no more buyers. The stock drops to nothing. Just remember traditional stocks and crypt is just gambling.

Well I think the only people that lost everything are kind of retards. Look at the charts. If they lost everything then that means bitcoin went to zero.

I love your prediction I feel the same way. It's going to go up or down.

I just saw a commercial for a kids game using blockchain. Seems now the world knows and anyone can make one. Blockchain is not crypto.

bitcoin is the gorilla in the game. You don't need a good product. Stocks kind of work the same way. Read the gorilla game. Look at Apple. Growing up as a kid I knew one kid that had a MAC. Everyone else had a c-64 or others. I still don't get how they survived back then. Today I don't now one person that owns any computer from apple but the ipod and phones saved them. A good example is the Amiga made by commodore was the best computer around when it came out in 1985 and was the best until something happened. You did not need to upgrade it so all the hardware companies were angry and they would not allow any operating system from Gates so you probably know what happened to them. The gorilla ate them.

Looks like the crash is going to continue much farther this time. My tinfoil hat is on but I don't think it will help me when btc hits 5k.

Wow I typed about betting on the dog poop then just saw your post about horse poop. Brother is that you?  No joke, I posted this before reading your comment. I had a friend who would watch for dogs pooping.

Scary but the real bubble is the stock market that has been pumped by the federal reserve with trillion of dollars over the years. Fake money. Sadly it will hit the whole world, crypto everything. When you hear stories about chains closing every month laying off thousands of workers and the stock market keeps rising you know it's bad, over 45 million on food stamps. We are going to live the next great depression I think. Then WW III have fun.

Guess we are all waiting for the bottom. I just wish I knew where that will end up. This B moves up and down so fast.

Bitcoin is over. No need for it. Companies are making their own blockchains , no need for crypto at all.

So when and who is going to work on a crypto currency movie. I think now is the time and it would be pretty amazing to watch.
