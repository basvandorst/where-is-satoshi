The internet depends on trust. Any single node is able to break it entirely. Something like  is not a "bug", it's how the internet has been designed to work. LN shouldn't allow something like that, should it?

Finding a route is incredibly hard. We're not just trying to find a single route in a static, well-known graph; we're trying to find a very large number of routes at the same time in a constantly changing graph with Byzantine nodes.
This is not a shortest-path problem. Ignoring intentionally hostile nodes, it seems a lot like the Canadian traveller problem, which is known to be PSPACE-complete. Add to that the tolerance of Byzantine failures, and you end up with a problem which is really quit hard to solve.
The LN currently has 1.6k nodes and 5.1k channels, so for a graph it's still quite small. The next few years will show whether the developers have managed to actually invent a suitable algorithm, or if they have just implemented a "
good enough" one which will fall apart once the network grows to 50k nodes, 500k channels, and a significant number of them actually trying to break the network to profit from a price drop.

I guess that the V4 lead could come [somewhat close]( - if bitcoin had a  pretty massive heart defect...
