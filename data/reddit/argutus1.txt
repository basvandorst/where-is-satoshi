I had source since yesterday. I do not plan on making a website for it. I added a hosted version on github. CGMiner always sets off virus protection. And I added build instructions for people who don't trust me.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:09:32
This is only for USB miner's. Not enough people use GPUs to mine anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:06:19
I will release it in Linux sometime soon
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:36:58
To make it easy to host a P2P pool or to join one?
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:36:30
Meh, I considered that, but I posted this in It'll be fine.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:25:32
Is it working successfully for you?
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:04:26
Thanks! I will post it here and I will make a bitcointalk thread
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:26:47
Not now, I will make a separate version for scrypt next week
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:16:22
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:02:10
This software is just for mining. You just press 'start mining'. You get transactions to the address you specified before you hit the button.
Look at this image: 
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:04:10
Nope, I will release a scrypt version sometime next week
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:00:41
At most you might make $0.20 per day
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:03:20
I added build instructions on the github readme
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:00:47
Nope, it is the reader's responsibility to read up on any terms. Just take a look at Reddits TOS: "This agreement is a legal contract between you and us. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to this agreement, you should not use reddit." I believe he is fine with what he already has in his TOS, but I am not accustomed to his local laws.

I created a version of this for Windows called stableminer, you can look it up on github, however it was created while I still didn't have much experience in coding. It pretty much was a gui which called on cgminer, and while it did work, it's bad to run it that way and depend off of someone else's code. So I have started on building it from the ground up supporting every OS, adding some optimizations, and no longer depending on running another exexutable, I am very close to finishing so expect a release in the next week or so. Right now I am finished with the Linux version, and I am just faced with fixing some problems with Windows.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:32:48
No, it works exactly the same as if you were to setup P2Pool and CGMiner to mine on P2Pool. It uses the actual P2Pool, not the copycat pool. It connects to bitcoind or qt.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:10:04
It's CGMiner's fault, it always does that to me. If you don't trust me, build it from source, I added instructions.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:02:59
Fixed it anyway
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:45:53
It is the default address used for P2Pool
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:35:32
It's great to hear it works, I don't have an asic miner, so I wasn't able to test it.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:26:02
I am changing it today or tomorrow. I am considering 'FreeMiner' or 'StableMiner'
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:08:52
Wow, this has to be the largest tip I have ever received! Thanks, before these tips my BTC balance was actually zero! I had bought in at $1200 and a day later it crashed to $600. I tried to day trade and get my value back up, but I failed and practically lost it all.
Edit: I just realized you used 'bitcointiop' instead of 'bitcointip'
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:17:50
It is, it's the default address used for P2Pool, look it up.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:35:19
Nope, the software will setup everything you need in this
Edit: Sorry I wasn't thinking right. Yes, bitcoind or qt must be running.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:10:32
Then build it from source.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:51:08
Here you go mate. I created StableMiner, it is CGMiner and P2Pool combined in an easy to use (one click) GUI software.
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:09:23
Three questions, if the answer is 'yes' to both, I will send in my program in less than 24 hours.
1. Is the offer still open for the bitcoins?
2. It would be very hard to create a brand new miner to add in this package. My works by having CGMiner be in a subdirectory of the directory that holds my software, and it sends the commands over to CGMiner. Is this ok?
3. Do I need to release the software for Windows, Linux, and OSX to be eligible for the reward?
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:54:17
I will create a BitcoinTalk thread once I change the name
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:05:12
I added both
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:19:29
99% Done, I will upload it by later today.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:08:41
Binary was not made by me, I used PyInstaller to compile Python 2.7 and all the modules I imported, thats what the binarys are. If you don't trust me, build it from source, I added instructions.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:50:46
This is CGMiner 3.10. This is for only ASIC and FPGA minerd connected to the computer over USB.
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:10:22
It's not finished yet, and still only exists as a python module, but I will gladly put up the unfinished version now if you want
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:16:22
Thanks, this really means a lot to me
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:10:50
Yes, it must communicate with an active blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:16:05
Off of EFF.org: "However, courts generally do not require that you actually have read the terms, but just that you had reasonable notice and an opportunity to read them" Now he does have a link to the TOS in the footer of his website, which is debatable whether it would count as a sufficient heads up. If he wanted to have better chances, I would say for him to add in "By using this website you agree to the TOS: link" in the footer. I think that this could go both ways, but I actually believe OP is in the safe zone and may continue.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:57:11
I didn't know github had a releases section. I will add it to there later. And yes, it is me.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:05:40
I will change the name today or tomorrow
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:44:21
I know, it's a two day-old account. While it would have been very nice to get a donation of that amount, I realize that it was a fake account/post, and I am posting it for the community to use and expand.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:16:04
For right now is it SHA256 only, I will start working on scrypt sometime in the next few days
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:52:08
Thats one P2Pool's end, not mine. Technically I could have it communicate with bitcoind for tracking incoming transactions from a certain address assigned to P2Pool and split them up, but it would be a pain. Maybe in a later release once I get all the functions setup.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:41:09
You must be running bitcoind or qt. This uses CGMiner 3.1, it does not support GPUs or CPUs, they don't have a high enough hashrate.
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:01:10
Everyone listen, ignore this if you don't know python or are a software dev! This is from the read-me 


Functionality is limited, address and flag-bar are broken, and I have not added in a terminal display.
I do not know for sure if mining even works, as I don't have a bitcoin miner to test this on!
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:25:10
Nope, it setups a true P2Pool node using the p2pool software
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:16:59
It's cgminer. If you still don't trust me, you can download the official cgminer, unzip it, and drag the folder over to the dependencies folder
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:03:36
I am a pretty adept Python writer. I have done all the code for the bots running at (tipbot and market info), been contracted to rewrite part of P2Pool for the litecoin foundation (Except they later changed their minds as they found the original creator had made what they wanted, just didn't release it publicly), and I created a program to ease the use of mining on P2Pool to the click of a button. I would to work on this project with you, feel free to message me.
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:29:27
Heh, I'm a teenager, and I just coded a bitcoin program and make 2.2 BTC in donations. I am planning on doing some investments with it, and small day-trading.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:04:28
I added build instructions
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:39:19
When you setup P2Pool, it uses that address on your local host as the connection. So to mine, you point your mining software at that link.
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:21:47
Yeah it's fine, if the other one goes through somehow, I will send it back. It's not the amount that matters, it's that you are helping support me
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:19:39
Max price would be around $250
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:38:24
If you read right under the title it says that it is a sponsored post. You obviously are then only told the positives and everything that it can do. Don't listen.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:12:49
I was trying to code something like this, but I ended up quitting because the bitcoin python-wrapper is confusing to install. My plan was to have members go to  a Google docs forum and add their bitcoin address. The code would then pair two addresses together and prompt them to chose an amount to pay, and then once both people were done, the code would automatically send their bitcoins to eachother.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:30:29
I was thinking about security too, I was thinking to maybe add a Bluetooth module, so you could connect your phone to it and enter in a passcode and it would make you do it before you could access any of the codes. The bluetooth would have no access to the data, it would just let you unlock it.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:11:00
So here are the current features that will be in the prototype
* Digital e-paper wallet
* Ability to generate and store many wallets
* Archive no longer needed wallets in the chance of an accident (Thanks )
* Ability to export wallet information over usb (Thanks )
* Long battery life (tbd, but over 20 hours and you can turn it off to save battery)
* Cheap, in the range of $250 USD
* On device wallet creation, it does not connect to the internet, and it will not have internet capability (security)
* Emergency mode, if battery &lt;5%, all info will be saved on the screen and will stay so until the device is recharged
More features will come as development continues, I play to have a working prototype in 3-4 weeks
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:47:56
Good point. I am also currently working out the battery needs, and asking the community is always the best. For a device like this, how long would you like it to be able to go without plugging it into the wall to charge it? Also, because it uses an epaper display, which require no battery to display an image and only when they are changing the image, I could set it up to go into shut-down mode if it was on low battery, where it would display all the bitcoin addresses and their info (indefinitely) until the device was recharged.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:58:55
And I understand that. I found out about it at ~$20, I just wasn't able to buy it until now. Ever since I discovered it I have made monitoring tools to track the price. Every drop is followed by a gain.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:47:29
Today is my birthday and I am a freshman in highschool, so I was finally able to convince my parents to let me buy some bitcoin. I bought it at $1,100, and then it instantly dropped. Birthday surprise.
