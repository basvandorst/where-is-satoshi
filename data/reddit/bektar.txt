Does lower centralisation always imply lower revenue though?
I would argue that as soon as the huge efficiency increments on each generation of mining hardware slows down small miners will actually have a huge advantage:
The heat generated in a huge data center is usually just wasted, but the heat generated in private homes is not. That means small time miners will have anywhere from around 30 % up to 100 % discount on electricity (depending on the need for heating as well as the cost of other options)
I'm looking forward to bitcoin radiators, and I believe I read about someone working on something like this a few months ago.

This doesn't compute for me… are you saying it's way more profitable for them to sell them? Why aren't they selling all of them if that is true?
@_date: 2016-03-14 05:59:51
What if you could use the waste heat for heating your own home? During the winter that could in theory subsidise the electricity cost from 30% up to 100% depending on your alternate means of heating.

Unless you have a multisig wallet it is my understanding you should be able to just create a new bch wallet using the seed from your current copay wallet. Just make sure to move you bitcoin to another wallet first (basically just create a new wallet in copay and move everything there, then import the seed to the old wallet into the bch wallet software of your choice)
If you have a multsig wallet i have no idea… just came here to ask the same question myself. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:05:43
I feel i need to clarify myself slightly… copay can have both normal wallets (addresses starting with a 1) or multisig wallets (addresses starting with a 3). I'm fairly certain that if you have a normal wallet you should just be able to import the seed into most other software. I do not know how it works with a multisig wallet though. I was hoping for an answer to this question when i clicked on this thread.

I believe parts of what OP is saying is correct, however, I do object to most of it.
First of all, even though this post does not actually claim that the core devs are proponents of 1mb in perpetuity, it sounds like that in my ears. I apologise if I'm reading it incorrectly, and the ironic thing is that my post will actually now do what I'm accusing OP of doing :)
Definition of a "Straw Man" according to wikipedia:


I'm calling a straw man since from what i've been reading (all? or at least most of?) the core devs seem to believe that the blocksize limit will need to be raised, they just don't think right now is the correct time. 
**Now on to the actual arguments in OP:**


By increasing the blocksize (and not doing anything else) the room for transactions grow linearly. Meaning if we double the size we double the room for transactions. Imo this will probably be needed while the whitepapers turns into actual solutions, but in time its unsustainable (yet again imo). Even though network capacity and processing power and what not is always growing, they still impose a limit.
Turning the blockchain into a settlement ledger on the other hand allows pretty much unlimited transactions to be secured by the blockchain, and we don't have to pray and hope that the technology is getting better at a faster rate than the transaction rate is growing.


This might happen, but on the other hand (as far as i understand) you could (in theory) run the current bitcoin software as one of the sidechains, and there you are free to do have as big a blockchain as you'd like. If people don't feel like settling back on the "main blockchain" they never have to. My main point being that there is nothing that makes your claim a certain future, there are ways to decentralise these kind of things :)


I agree. Testing things on smaller sidechains to see how things works in practice should make developing easier.

# Step by step instructions
Please note, there are some gaps in command line knowledge on FreeNAS and i don’t know how to add a jail, connect a dataset and have these show up in the ui. Due to this the first few steps will take place in the gui, and the later steps are all in the cli.
This guide was last tried on 2017-04-10 with FreeNAS 9.10.2 and bitcoin-core 0.14.0
 Step 1 - Create a jail
1. Log into gui
2. Select ”Jails” and then ”Add jail”
3. Enter name and click on ”Advanced Mode”
4. Make sure the value for ”IPv4 address” is DHCP
5. Make sure ”Autostart” and ”VIMAGE” are both checked
 Step 2 (optional) - Add storage
I won’t go into the details here since it has much more to do with FreeNAS than bitcoin and is entirely optional. The basic steps are:   
1. Create a dataset -    
2. Connect dataset to jail -    
 Step 3 - Connect to the command line interface
Option 1 - Using the webui:    
Option 2 - Using ssh:    
Once connected to FreeNAS use the following command to enter the jail:
	jexec NAME_OF_YOUR_JAIL_GOES_HERE
 Step 4 - Build  bitcoin-core
	
	pkg update; pkg upgrade -y
	cd; git clone 
	cd bitcoin; git checkout v0.14.0
	pkg install -y autoconf automake libtool pkgconf boost-libs openssl libevent gmake
	./autogen.sh
If you don't need the wallet functionality:
	# Build without support for wallet:
	./configure --disable-wallet --without-gui --with-daemon
	
if you do need the wallet:
	# build with support for wallet
	./configure --with-incompatible-bdb CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/db5 LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib/db5 --without-gui --with-daemon
followed by
	gmake install
 Step 5 - Configure bitcoin-core
	touch /usr/local/etc/rc.d/bitcoin
	touch /usr/local/etc/bitcoin.conf
	chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/bitcoin
Paste the sample rc script from this gist  into /usr/local/etc/rc.d/bitcoin and change any bitcoin-core settings you like in /usr/local/etc/bitcoin.conf
Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf
    bitcoin_enable="YES"
And finally start it by running the command
	service bitcoin start
Please let me know if it works… I actually set up a new node right now to test it, but it is not impossible i managed to miss some step during my trial and error while copy pasting between the cli, vim and the reddit editor window :)
 
@_date: 2017-04-15 05:16:27
Yeah pretty much. (sorry for slow response, reddit didn't mail me about your comment for some reason)
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:05:49
If you want to run a node of your own, and just happen to have a FreeNAS box up and running, it is an excellent way to do it without setting up another machine.
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:10:15
Are you using 9.10 or the new Corral?
I've put up a few nodes on 9.10 but haven't looked into corral yet. I suppose there isn't a big difference other than that there is no official support for jails.
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:05:47
yes, use "cd" to navigate between folders. "ee" should work for editing files. I haven't used it myself so can't really help you with the details (i use vi, but that's a different can of worms that you probably shouldn't open right now(: )
"service bitcoin start" is a command.
Yeah, you can either do "jexec NAME_OF_JAIL" or "jexec NUMBER_OF_JAIL" so as long as you got it working its fine :)
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:03:32
Basically if you want to be able to receive bitcoin you need the wallet functionality. Tbh i'm not sure of a smooth way to do that using FreeNAS unless you are comfortable with using the cli.
I run my nodes without the wallet stuff since i just wanted to support the network.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:09:07
I've started to write a step by step guide, which i will post on bitcoin.stackexchange.com as well as link to here. Right now it is building core and that will take a few hours, i'll get back to you once i see that it finishes building without errors
@_date: 2017-04-15 05:19:24
you need to use the "bitcoin-cli" application to communicate with the server… you will probably end up with some issues regarding authorisation, give it a try and see if you can figure it out for yourself, if not send me a msg and i'll try to help.
Basically you need to add some rpc authentication parameters to the config file, and make sure that both bitcoind and bitcoin-cli starts up using the same config file
