Tbh i found out about good places to buy as investment properties while looking for a place on Zillow. I don't own my own place yet and I'm still looking at purchasing an investment property. 
The area im looking into is around 70k for a 1950's to 1970's 1300+ Sqft 3 bed 2 bath, mortgage is around $650-$750. Rental prices for a place of that size are around $1300. So your able to make money while also paying the place off.

I mean technically speaking I'm a millennial. I've been looking at bitcoin since it was 7 dollars, made money, though made a bad choice of pulling out early. Doubled my principle a couple times though. 
Now I've made 80% trading between btc  and eth. This gave me enough money to purchase quite a few components, which should be in the next week or two to start mining. Roi will be 6-7 months and for a awhile I should be able to pull 4-600 a month depending on market prices and difficulty increase for a little

Their hot dogs are nasty, idk what it is but I never could eat a Nathan's dog. In my state though the coney Islands have $1 or $1.50 coneys one day a week. Usually there anywhere from $1.75 to $2.75 (the higher price is a loaded dog, 2 slices of bacon, chilli, cheese, onion)

Ehh I wouldn't say I'm doing it wrong. I hodl but I'm also not afraid to trade or pull out some coins at a time I deem right. I made 100% on my initial investment in 2 months. I exchanged coins for other coins atleast a good 12-15 times, sold and waited for the drop to rebuy, and I even made 10% immediately by playing a large spread between to exchanges. 
Everyone has a different investment style, it doesn't make it wrong.
