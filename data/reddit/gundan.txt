I have some questions: 
Why was my thread EDITED in the subject and BFL changed from Important Questions to Dumb Questions without other comments AND my thread MOVED to Off-Topic ?
I am a paying customer, it is not normal and not happened to us on other sites to have our threads EDITED in this way or in ANY way.
Second, after all this, why did they not refund the order as promised?
Why do BFL "Advocates" respond in THEIR PLACE ???
WHY DO THEY NOT WRITE BEFORE!! ORDERING AND PAYING THAT THESE DEVICES STILL DO NOT EXIST???

FINAL UPDATE:
I GOT THE REFUND NOW VIA PAYPAL FROM BFL, transaction is now Clearing with Paypal SO:
From my point of view, I consider all MY threads on this matter : CLOSED, SOLVED and I somehow thank BFL for finally solving this.
Happy mining everybody.

So yesterday I spent ALL day and half a night on this forum and I also sent BFL 3 emails with my Paypal address and Bitcoin hash.
I just woke up now and I found the following email from them:

Dear Mr. Daniel,
Your pre-order is in the queue for a refund. I can only send these wires during banking hours and sometimes I don't have enough hours in the day to do all of them. Our website specifically says that all sales are final and that we will not refund you. Even so we have made exceptions and are working to refund those orders from people who no longer want to wait in the pre-order queue. If possible I will send your refund on Monday. Either way I will let you know if it was accomplished. Banks do not make sending wire transfers as easy, nor as quick as using PayPal.

In essence ButterFly Labs edited my post 
Important Questions 
changed to
Dumb Questions
Since when CUSTOMERS with $5000+ deposited at BFL are treated this way?
SINCE WHEN EVER A CUSTOMER IS INDIRECTLY CALLED DUMB by the company still refusing to release the refund?
ANYONE???
