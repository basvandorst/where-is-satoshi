I created a site where you can post links, videos, images, and blobs of text (html allowed).
It works much like most social news sites where visitors can vote up stories they like to the home page in various different categories. The difference is that the voting is in bitcoins in increments of 0.001 units. 80% of the bitcoins received go to the poster of the article.
Posting and voting up articles is an anonymous process, and no login is needed (also IP addresses &amp; sessions are not recorded). For those that are into Tor, onion links are welcome and are marked with an onion icon. Hopefully this will help with the discovery of content on the onion network.

You still need to pay 20% of the post value to keep it up, and it will decay off of the "hot" list as other stuff comes up.

This is easy to implement.
End your emails with:
bitcoin_reward: 0.1 BTC in this private key XYZXYZXYZXYZXYZXYZXYZ
Leave that private key in your wallet (still spendable), and if no one reads the email, no one gets it. 
This could be shortened to:
and the mail client could check the reward and sort by it. The reward could go to zero if it gets spent.

Funny that reddit chose the video icon from the site. Oh well.

Possibly, but since there is actual bitcoins at stake, only the best stuff will get voted up. 
@_date: 2012-01-24 21:55:54
The typical vote is 0.001 btc, so a vote is worth about half a usd penny. 
You should vote up stuff on that site for the same reason you vote it up anywhere, you like what you see. If someone posts up something great, they get rewarded for it, and can then vote up other stuff with their earnings themselves.

I think making entry into the game set to a very low amount would be beneficial. If you could take .005 from a bitcoin faucet and get in the game for practically free, this could start you on your quest, and still add to the economy.
In the mmorpg type world, this might give you a wooden stick to fight with (or nothing, you have to go get your own stick). If there was an even slope of ability/BTC put in, a person with 1 BTC in the game would have a 200-to-1 chance of beating you if you had equal skill to that player. The odds would close quickly as you were able to take from the environment to bring yourself up to his level. He would have the advantage of better equipment, but determination might win the day. 
Or you can toss in the equivalent of about $3 and be propelled up to more even footing with out so much fuss.
Dynamic good pricing is another important factor. The wooden stick shouldn't be able to be sold back to a merchant for .005 btc all the time. Otherwise the merchant might get flooded with them as a way to get bitcoins. It might be better to have merchants be real players or at least bots that have a limited amount of money to spend (and some wits to them).

It is ok. I neither store public or private keys. In fact nothing is stored and the pdf is dynamically generated and sent to the printer and then stamped. I scan the QR code on the public key when I am about to ship.
But really no amount of words reverses one of the fundamental problems, which is that this requires trust in me to actually not store the private keys myself. I wouldn't bother saying to trust me, as that is meaningless. 
Keep in mind, these are cheques. The purpose would be to have the money go in, and then go out. The amount that I could possibly steal would be the float, and I make more money on selling the bills than I could ever steal, and I am so open with who I am, the blow back would be bad. 
That is why I also don't store a darn thing. If someone was able to get private keys off of me, it would be the equivalent of me stealing in the public eye. 
Mike and I are working on a scheme where we would each create a private key and the combination would be required to access the funds, so we would both have to collude in this case.

"if there's a significant penalty for transferring money into the game, whats to stop someone from buying in-game currency from someone else?"
Where would that someone else get the in-game currency? I guess they could earn it in-game, but I don't think this would be a problem. If you earned 100BTC in the game, you could cash all that out to yourself, which is easier than giving it to someone else. 
"Competitive games of skill have a tendency to deteriorate as a core group of skilled players forms. "
I think it is important that a skilled, but under funded player can beat someone that has more funds, and thus profit. As long as the game is engineered to have upward and downward mobility, this will work out. 
"This is why competitive gambling games (that a lot of people play) always have an element of chance."
Some chance is important (but not to the degree of being gambling). If it was perfectly deterministic (like chess), then the skill cliff you define would be a problem.

When you put coins into the game, some go to your character, and some get distributed to the "environment." How they are distributed to the environment is something to grit your teeth over, but even if you are wrong, it just effects the rewards that players will have to interact with the game (perhaps you are paying out too much to get fish from a stream). This could be a self adjusting algorithm where you keep adjusting rewards till player behavior matches up with the % of the time that you want the average player doing something.

The problem with that is the transaction delay in bitcoin. 15 minutes is a long time to wait to complete a transaction with an in game merchant (this is a major impediment to bitcoin IRL as well).

What if that armor increased the odds that you would earn more BTC in game? Then it goes from an expense into an investment. 
Just don't lose it to another player :)

Players can cash out at any time, but when you cash out, you cash out with less than you put in, unless you went around the world and were more successful than other players.
Investing in weapons would likely make you more successful than other players, and you can use that to extract value from the game world.
