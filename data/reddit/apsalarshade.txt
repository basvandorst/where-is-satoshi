An apt analogy to the banks in Greece at the moment.

 If I used Electrum, how would I link the card in order to send payments? So far I've only used coinbase and blockchain (android apps) and a paper wallet I generated offline on a thumbdrive. I'm not familiar with electrum. Wouldn't I have to sweep my private address into Electrum in order to move/spend it?
thanks for the help so far :D

Bitcoin is open source.  Doesn't matter if a semi retarded duck wrote the code, it works and anyone can check it.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:28:32
How would anyone even know that?
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:13:47
Would this work with an encrypted card that has a password assosiated with it? Wouldn't your private key basically be exposed doing it this way?

Put them in a paper wallet in a safety deposit box.  Leave contents of box in a trust

The debate is because they think it's the only use of it. So the topic, how to address it, and articles like the one in the OP are relevant because they are useful to counter argue that money of all kinds are used this way. You may have overlooked the part where I had the person say it was fake money.
This article and others like it are useful to show that bitcoin being able to be used in illicit transactions is not a reason to dismiss it as a form of currency. Which can help get people to look at bitcoin from a fresh perspective.

You say that it's not a current debate, but I would disagree. 90% of the conversations I have about bitcoin start off roughly like this:
Guy: what are you talking about over there?
Me: oh, nothing much [friend] and I were just talking about this news article on bitcoin.
Guy: oh yeah, that's the fake money drug dealers use in the internet right?

What does the dude have to do With any of this?
@_date: 2016-02-02 02:30:35
That's, like, your opinion, man.

I didn't say I had to trust you. I said your argument that I should trust you is not a good one.

Read the response I gave to the other guy. 
bit coin is supposed to allow for a trustless form of currency exchange. If I  now have to trust you, I might as well just just a regular bank.

I'm just saying that "Trust us" is a bad response. I'm not arguing for tinfoil lock yourself in the basement paranoia. No organization that, when security concerns come up, should say trust us. It is one of the worst responses. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:34:22
Those were not my words. They were the words of the poster to which I replied. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:00:18
"Trust us"
Yeah. Okay.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:52:54
Just saying that the "Trust us" argument is the same one that the banks use when dealing with everything from interest rates to security.
Not having  to "Trust us" is one of the main reasons why people switched to bitcoin. It's never going to be an acceptable answer.

I think you mean the us dollar,  not bitcoin.
