Hey _Vet_ - any updates on your thoughts on bitcoin futures?

All long / short positions are temporary depending on your time horizon. The duration is tempered or otherwise by the magnitude of the position behind it.
I’m not debating the mechanics of futures. I’m pointing out their absence till now and my view on the *initial* impact of their introduction.
Has there been an avenue in the market to express a very negative public viewpoint on crypto prior to these futures? No. 
Will the futures price affect the underlying asset price? Possibly. 
Considering the size / risk appetite of the incoming investors relative to those already long my view is that the *initial* position will be negative. 
LT crypto is the growth centre of our generation (bears repeating).
EDIT: corrected spots to futures

X-post from an earlier post on why I’m bearish (certainly for the ST) on the impact of the introduction of bitcoin futures:
TL:DR - Bull and bear opinions influence the price of an asset relative to the magnitude of the capital behind the opinion. Up until now the bear opinions have had a natural cap on them which is removed by the opening of a futures market. IMO speculative asset pricing is largely psychological and my view is that the futures market will influence the underlying asset price. If this view is negative (which I believe it will be) then this may drive down the price in turn in the ST. 
LT I am strongly strongly bullish on crypto - I believe  it is the growth centre of our generation.
Investors buying an asset express a long position that is theoretically unbounded other then by how much they can spend. Investors selling an asset express a short position which is bounded by zero (i.e they can only ‘short’ what they have already gone long on.) Therefore there are bounds on how much negative sentiment can be expressed by a market on an asset without a futures market. 
Imagine it this way: a) you run a survey on the service at your restaurant and you phrase the question as follows: “How well am I doing?” and ask them to rate out of five. 
Compare this with b) you now ask the same question but provide them with a range from -5 to 5. If the service is exemplary and everyone is happy then you might not expect much change between a) and b). However if the service is not great even poor you might expect a marked difference between a) and b) because everyone who was previously restricted at a ‘0’ now can survey even lower. 
If you’ve repeatedly run the a) survey then when you switch on the b) survey your customers might even take the opportunity to *initially* exaggerate their negative response given they haven’t had an opportunity to properly express how negative they feel about it. 
Take it a step further and consider if your a) &amp; b) survey results were public - customers that were previously ambivalent about your service now see that there are those who feel very strongly negative about your service and this is turn might make them turn slightly more negative. Even those were strongly supportive of your service levels might have their opinion changed or at least softened if they can  now see that there is a large negative contingent expressing their point of view.
Given crypto in general hasn’t had this outlet for a complete expression of investors sentiment across the spectrum my view is that the initial (of an unknown duration) users of this market will be those seeking to express a negative viewpoint past their previous bound of zero (i.e. futures will be low or even correct in the short term). 
There’s a lot of other factors going on here in terms of the type of investors that will play in the futures market that wouldn’t / can’t buy and sell the underlying asset - in short that our little boat is about to be tested on some vaster oceans. 
This being said I am strongly strongly bullish LT across many existing cryptos - this is the growth centre of our generation.

You’re right I’m being glib about all potential durations being temporary. However I’d be reluctant to consider the duration of land ownership when talking about this asset class. You’ve got guys out there making decisions on positions with &lt;6 second time horizons. 
More importantly and still unaddressed - how have investors with very strong negative sentiments on the underlying asset been able to express this sentiment past the zero bound?
Thanks for picking up the typo on spot versus future. 
I still disagree on the impact but the upside is we’ll know who got it right on Sunday - I’ll be camping so see you Monday. 
Cheers

TL:DR - Bull (‘good’) and bear (‘bad’) opinions influence the price of an asset relative to the magnitude of the capital behind the opinion. Up until now the bad opinions have had a natural cap on them which is removed by the opening of a futures market. IMO speculative asset pricing is largely psychological and my view is that the futures market will influence the underlying asset price.

If indefinitely long bitcoin = frozen wallets then the absolute value of this could be &lt; temporary short positions forming for the first time on Sunday. It’s not just about tenor at this point in the market evolution it’s also magnitude in my view.
Bears repeating that psychologically a drop in futures prices (however temporary) may influence the spot which may in turn strengthen / lengthen the short. 
No doubt a firm bottom to things though and strongly strongly bullish on crypto LT.
Agreed expression of both good / bad sentiment is good for reduced volatility and a LT good thing - but we haven’t had this until now.
Thanks man! Can’t wait!

Jesudason has landed a role at Hong Kong start-up called Block.one, which is, of all things, a blockchain and cryptocurrency firm. While much has been made of the fact Jesudason is keen to eventually test his skills as a chief executive, he will be chief operating officer in his new gig.
While it feels like this is a very sudden step sideways for Jesudason, it is worth noting he was based in Hong Kong in his previous CBA role as group executive for International Financial Services. Sources say his family hadn't really settled in Australia and favoured a return to Hong Kong.
