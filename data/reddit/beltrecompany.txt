If you speak with sense in cryptp subs most of the time holders downvote you because saying trading makes momey too is a sin. Im a millionaire thanks to crypto, but I gor to the point holding altcoins, not bitcoin. But if I were to make a thread about it be 100% sure people will downvote m to hell, however if I make a Meme saying OMG thank yoi bitcoin i bought a lambo guys! Upvotes like crazy. That is why now days I just reply to people like u/MicroToast that say things as they are. Holding is not a secret, everyone has a selling point. If you want to hold do it, if you feel like selling that is good too. Neither is worng, profit is profit and not everyone can hold forever. Im debt free now so the bitcoins I have left will hold without thinking twice.

Best thing in this stupid sub. Everyone posting memes so stupid. Everytime it goes to x price: 1 Bitcoin= X, pretty sure nobody needs 100 threads saying the same thing. If you have even 1 satoshi you know what bitcoin price is. This should be a sticky.

Hey dont speak with sense you will get downvote! ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:02:53
But I make Bitcoin with altcoins not holding bitcoin ��

I lost respect fir McAfee, he is becoming irrelevent. Said Bcash will be the dominant Bitcoin, and now back inti the bitcoin train. He doesnt know what to say or do anymore.

Maybe he is playing the long con. Said yes to them just to get them on board. Months or years later he can say I was joking bro

End of the day in their time zone, not yours.

Forgot today was Sunday :)

Just like people buying and holding BTC thinking it will go to the moon. Most people in this subreddit just want to get rich quick, that is the only reason they care about Bitcoin.

Happened to me as well. Call your bank and tell them to unlock your card because it seems some bank and credit cards block Coinbase, so you card and they will ask if it was you etc. After that it will go through. However some dont, like CreditOneBank they close my new card over it.

Still nothing man :( Im contacting daily twice per day :/
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:03:38
Ok, good luck, I hope bitcoin goes to $10K and make you even wealthier. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:35:36
No thank you, Im dumping bitcoin for alts.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:02:41
How can you be so good at ignoring your clients? or should I say victims?, does it really takes a law suit to be abke to get my $5,000 back? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:34:26
I link to the source material like a normal fucking person. redditor?? LOL 
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:47:25
Ok. Next time. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:24:31
Yeah, and then people go back to Alts. Same O.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:11:18
Why did you sell alts at a loss?, eventaully a lot of money will go back to alts. This is not 2013, bitcoin is not the only crypto out there. Lots of great projects, you probably did something very dumb to get to 3.5btc and back to 1.7. Dont blame trading, but yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:11:45
He made that GIF so its his material. He is that gif maker so yes you guys are fucking wrong. Dont speak without facts make you look like a damn idiot.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:10:12
I have some BTCs left, I will listen to your advice and ride the wave. But I wont sell the Alts I have. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:32:52
Yes, at the end we all profit regardless. I do have bitcoins as everyone should, but buying alts is so addicting :(
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:27:47
Teach us your ways oh grand master of self control :). jokes aside. Not looking at the market does help a lot. Most I did was like 1 week and oh man does it feel good. Unfortunately for me I have to keep checking as I made videos etc :(
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:39:50
Why is it rising when market domination is under 60%? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:00:02
is it me or you bought .1BTC for $!700+?
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:46:29
This is a ponzi scheme, when new suckers, sorry users, stop to come in they will steal all the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:51:21
isnt op and idiot for buying during ath? if he bought at 1800 he is already losing money. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:30:47
This seems fake or the guy is a scammer trying his luck to see if people sending him Bitcoin. His clothing is all new, even the cardboard. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:15:22
Dumb money is people buying into cryptos without knowledge? Is this a good thing or a bad one?, I can see this people panic selling if they dont know how crazy cryptocurrency market can be.
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:47:28
Do you even read son?, did bitcoin make you rich yet?, stupid puta.
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:52:47
Thank you for the nice tutorial! :)
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:00:17
But what will happen if bitcoin or cryptocurrency at all is not around?, You need to keep worst case scenario in mind as well, not just what you wish for.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:51:37
Thank you! for one second I felt bad for him, thought he made a mistake while putting the buy order. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:49:53
Op is expecting bitcoin to hit 10k, a lot of people in this sub needs to wake up. I trade bitcoin on and off, I dont see this shit hitting 10k anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:28:56
I know this comment will get lots of hate but you are an idiot. Buying at ATH + 191.118 x$10k(If ever) = $1,911,180. If I had the type of money I would rather invest in something like NEM, selling at .11cents at the moment, 2,956,718.18 coins, goes to $1 which should happen sooner than Bitcoin hitting 10k and you make almost 3 millions dollars, more as you can put those coins to harvest and get you more coins, so by the time it gets to $1 you will have more than 4M xem. Heck even if it gets to .50cents still more money. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:48:56
or sell, this are your bitcoins and you can do whatever the fuck you want with them. If you need to sell it do it. Everyone always preaching hodl in all the cryptocurrench sub; Ethereum, litecoin, etc. Let people do whatever they want with their money, at the end you dont really care you just preach hodl so that the price goes up and you be able to sell for a better price later on. Such disgusting.
