When last I used oclvanitygen I got around 7 megakeys per second, which I calculated to be 7 × 1024^2 keys per second. Then, I divided 58^26 ÷ 27 by that.
TL;DR (58^26 ÷ 27) ÷ (7 × 1024^2) seconds, converted into years.
Edit: I screwed up somehow, you're right. :&lt;

I use an intermediary: Steam items. Buy a game or DLC with your monies, ask for a little less than it's worth in BTC, wait for them to pay and for the transaction to confirm, and trade them the loot. I like to think of it as expanding the broad range of things you can buy with bitcoin.

Namecoin has become irrelevant. Basically nobody uses that DNS system, and slush has already planned to remove it from his pool. Stratum mining doesn't work with it, etc etc. Whatever spotlight Namecoin had was stolen by Litecoin.
