"the bitcoin", she doesn't fully understand what she is talking about. I am from the East coast, so I am just speculating. I think there is only one way she ended up with the segment.
Producer: "Lauren you look like you know about tech stuff, with them nerdy look and glasses you have going on. Could you do the segment on *the bitcoin*?"
edit:words and her name is Lauren ..

I would consider one of the larger evil banks, while AML happens in ALL banks bigger ones have more trouble keeping up. Go to bankofamerica or capitalone they won't bother you as long a you don't start bouncing checks or transferring over 10k explainable often. Just make sure to get their fee schedules and make sure you know what their account "services" cost.

This is also true, but mostly small businesses and sadly just because it costs more to process AMEX. Most major retailers that I know of ( walmart/target/BJ's/amazon) take it and the benefits are pretty awesome.
