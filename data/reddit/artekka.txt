Yeah June is when I took the plunge as well. Been following since 2013 when it was just office talk with some coworkers. I failed to learn how to mine at the end of 2013 and had no clue how to buy BTC, so I gave up. I should have put a little more effort in hahaha.

This is not shots fired at you, but imagine if he knew how much other people were making. Doubling is insane to traditional thinkers and old money. I'm still up 7x my initial investment from June after this crash (lucky as a mother effer, obviously) and those that followed me into the market around November are sitting in similar positions as yourself. Up, up, and away! We stayin strong!!!

Oh, totally. I'm completely supporting what you're saying. It's always people ready to criticize, often times I just feel like it's because they're upset they didn't get in on it so they justify their feelings by trying to poke fun at it. It's just traditional thinking and fear of change.  
  
Blockchain and crypto are the future. Everyone made fun of people with computers, saying it was for geeks and nerds. Everyone has one now. Everyone made fun of smartphones, saying it was for geeks and nerds. Everyone has one now.  
  
There are other examples I'm sure, but I think they're great points to illustrate how everyone comes along eventually and it's all because of us "geeks and nerds".

Saw 18.9K, went to sell, phone couldn't load the exchange. Went to work computer, wouldn't load (ultra terrible internet and reception here). Exchange loaded, down to 16K. RIP.

So happy for you. Congratulations! Don't worry about the potential gains you could have had from the spikes these past days. It's all about those realized gains as well as intangibles like your mental and physical health. So happy for you!
