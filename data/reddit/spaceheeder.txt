There have been a couple efforts like this popping up, and I'm genuinely curious: Why is nobody trying to build a decentralized exchange on top of Open Transactions?

12 trillion USD would still be a preposterously high market cap for BTC, so the "three orders of magnitude" problem stands.

Please add "labor" to that list. Imagine a decentralized version of fiverr where prices could float! *Imagine harder, damn you!*

For the sake of clarification, everything should be thought of in terms of 2014 dollars :-p

Haha, right!

At 1Bn USD per BTC, the market cap would be around 21 Quadrillion USD. According to [Wikipedia]( the GDP of the planet is estimated to fall somewhere between 71 and 85 Trillion USD.
For currency specifically, the single biggest currency on the planet (USD) is estimated to have about [1.2 Trillion in circulation]( or less than 2% of the GDP of the planet.
Even if Bitcoin became ten times as ubiquitous as the dollar (which is mathematically impossible as most of the planet's GDP is in stuff you buy with money as opposed to money itself) you would still be off by more than three orders of magnitude.
It's "To Tha Moon," not "[To Tha Sun](
EDITS: Confused meters with kilometers when checking the scale of the universe, coincidentally three orders of magnitude over the distance to the moon is actually the right number of powers of ten to *just* get distance to the sun to come on screen. Also, updated figures for dollars estimated to be in circulation.

I don't know that most people equate all labor with the service industry. Maybe to the extent that employees provide services to their employers?
Anyways, one example I can think of where a labor contract might not fit neatly into the service box would be if someone created a decentralized version of fed ex:
* Distributors put up a surety bond to insure packages delivered to their residence and collect fees when packages are collected
* Couriers put up a surety bond to insure packages in transit between distributors and bid to pick up individual packages
* Recipients put up bonds so that packages can be returned to sender to weed out people placing fake orders
* Senders put into escrow a pool of cryptocurrency from which they pay to transit a package from its current distribution center to the one with the best A* score (calculated as a function of cost per unit distance) relative to the recipient, without knowing the recipient's physical location or the physical location of the package after the first distributor
* Packages are cryptographically tracked to make sure they are still in the network and still moving towards their intended destination. When  a package comes to a Distributor within the recipient's accepted pickup radius, they pick it up themselves
The moral of that hypothetical spiel is that the entire *network* of people provide the service to the sender and the recipient. Who is the individual courier servicing? The distributors? Maybe an argument can be made that they're servicing the sender, who is paying for the package while it is in transit. Who are the distributors servicing? *Everyone*?
It makes more sense to call that a labor arrangement to me, since it is composed of many contracts, most of them agnostic as to who is providing a particular service to whom.

United States isn't an option under "Domestic Private Shipping." Is this on purpose? Are people in the U.S. not allowed to register?
