Both our current factions sit around that number.  It's less about currently though and more about what's possible.  If 51% of the population decides to create a "party" where they can internally make compromises to achieve a common goal, that party can trump all others without regard to morality or the welfare of others.  With representation, at least communities where the chief population are 'minorities', those minorities can elect individuals to represent their voice (no matter how tiny) in the massive governing structure that they belong to.

Clearly apple intends on releasing the iCoin, only applicable for purchasing apple products.

The part about factions, if a faction surfaces in direct democracy it can almost certainly maintain a dictatorship of the majority.  Certainly 51% approval doesn't warrant the morality of tyranny.

So if we were an anarchocapitalist nation, healthcare would be so cheap that anyone could afford it, charities would take the place of welfare, and everyone would be help everyone because they're all lovey dovey friends.  Wow!  Why isn't Somalia already like this!

You should read federalist paper  by James Madison, it discusses why the US created a representative government and makes a great rebuttal to direct democracy.

I really think you should get some therapy.

Give me a break.  You live on (presumably) State property and therefore consent.  Just like if you were in a hotel you'd consent to their contract.  It's the foundation of property laws.

Er, we do.

For your second paragraph, who is "we in economics"?  I am fairly certain that I was taught monopolies can arise without government when I was in uni.

Why is a consolidated global government a nightmare?  Globalism doesn't necessitate centrism

What about a democratic central bank?

It can be planned.  A central bank can stabilize an economy in a major way.

I'm arguing for my own comment that capitalism only cares about money, which you so vehemently detest.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:46:47
Oh I'm sorry, your profound argument changed my mind. Hail mighty capitalism, the system of all that is holy that has other goals than generating capital!
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:57:43
You're actually completely wrong, I am advocating society above capital. Capitalism is capital above society. 
Also, those businesses are following the rules of capitalism. In a free market, who's to say that each ISP will be allowed to build infrastructure over other's private land. If your house is surrounded by land owned by one corporation, how can you have access to broadband by another corporation?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:08:52
The free market already hardly takes care of that. Even with regulation, these companies bypass them as best as possible, giving the cheapest and most shoddy product available. What makes you think that taking away the regulation is going to make the product any better?
Also, it's easy to lie to the consumer in a 'free market society'. Enjoy your non-fda food products, with no agency to determine if their telling the truth about their ingredients.

But...but freedom! Libertarian pipe dreams! Market freedom! You're just a filthy statist!
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:12:10
Actually those things were created in an attempt to generate money. Let's take pharmaceutical companies for example, an industry notorious for not selling treatments that are too cheap to produce when there are other more expensive treatments that can be sold. Also, what about the ISPs who leave data caps and charge for over-data limits when they have nothing to do with congestion? That's capitalism run amock. Additionally, the proof is in the pudding, capital means stock or accumulated goods, ism is a suffix from a greek word which means philosophy of. Thus, capitalism means philosophy of accumulated goods. Now say again why capitalism is a system for anything other than generating wealth?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:10:37
I think that capitalism only cares about a quick buck, there is no other goal. Besides of course, the long term buck, which is significantly more rare.

Stocks are not the same as currency, if you want to store your wealth you want something stable, people who store their wealth in stocks are usually gambling addicts.
