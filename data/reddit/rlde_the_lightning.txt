Just move your BTC to USD wallet on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:03
Just get the Coinbase app or go to Coinbase.com and set up an account.  You can pay with debit/credit or ACH.  have fun!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:57
has Coinbase stopped reporting for anyone else?  It's been stuck at 390
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:52
ah, ok.  thanks man
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:08
On Coinbase, is there a quick way to dump my LTC holdings and into BTC?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:57
that .1 of a BTC will be very valuable soon
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:37:21
I remember people saying this 12 months ago
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:12
no you can't cancel, but I had the same feelings when I bought at 5k.  Im glad I couldnt cancel it now tripled my money.  Just leave it in bro
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:39:06
congrats on cashing out man
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:14
many believe BTC will soar past one million, so yes.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:39:46
I expect a reverse dip
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:04
There was no cryptocurrency investment in 2008.  This isn't NASDAQ, bro.   They were saying BTC was a bubble when it hit $1k
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:54:37


Ok, so I think I understand weekly buys - it just means that it auto-purchases BTC for a set amount (ie; $500) every week on the same day.
But what does cost averaging mean?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:48:36
OP - can I ask how early you got in the BTC game?  Congrats!!  My first $500 is going in this week!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:14
AI have been trying to make my first BTC investment since 9800 but Coinbase keeps rejecting my order.  Now I wake up and it's at 11300.  so frustrating
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:42
interesting.  I tried to purchase .5 of a BTC last night but CoinBase kept rejecting my order.  Glad it didn't go through.  As a new investor, I have no idea whether to jump in right or wait a bit.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:13:59
Question, so if you make a purchase on Coinbase, and it takes 10 days - you still are "locked in" at your purchase price, so even if BTC continues to move up you are still increasing in value, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:40:57
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:14:06
excellent reply, thank you
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:33:19
Litecoin is next, gentleman
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:48:23
thanks for the reply, can I ask how long you have been involved with digital currency?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:57:58
thank you for the reply
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:02
Hello guys, I just made my first BTC purchase using ACH banking/routing.  It says it wont be available until 12/6, but I am still locked in, right?
Also about how many days can I expect the funds to leave my bank account?  I hear it varies greatly 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:24:50
Hey guys, new here and I have a quick question: 
Using the Coinbase App, I just attempted to place a $1k order in BTC.  On the mobile app, it said purchase complete.  But I never received any type of confirmation email, and now if I open the app there is zero record of me making any purchase   Any idea what's going on?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:30:13
I won't sell until it hits 2 million
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:35
Do you use GDAX for the limit buy/sell?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:01:09
THE DIP IS OVER.  WE ARE NOW HEADED TO $1MM
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:38:03
Get a hard wallet?  Check out the Trezor
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:35:17
Thanks for the heads up.  I'm looking at a Trezor cold wallet right now
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:47
Yup just patiently waiting until 9am pst to call lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:39:57
Kraken or Gemini are other options
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:34:59
For me, I don't even see any pending transactions.  I guess I will just have to wait and see
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:17
thanks.  Coinbase rejected my orders for some reason anyways.  I will try again tomorrow

Let say maybe 5 years ago somebody mined 50+ BTC and then forgot all about it.  Today he realizes where BTC is at and decides to find his hardware wallet (for example) and cash out.  How much trouble would this person having trying to cash out $550k+ BTC to USD?  What would the process look like?  All theoretical of course.
On a side note I used to mine BTC and had a digital wallet with 12 BTC in, back in 2012 or so.  Its lone gone though dont even have the HDD the wallet was on.  Ive pretty much given up and will be making my first $500 investment this next week.  Maybe I have missed the party, maybe the party is just starting!?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:31:05
yes from bank account directly
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:19:08
Would you say this applies to LTC and Eth as well, or should I go balls deep into BTC?  Im new here still trying to wrap my mind around this investment
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:35:39
"yes, that was fraudulent transaction, please cancel"
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:25:47
nice.  thanks.  so why do people stress so hard during the 10 day period?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:15:14
thanks for the update, good luck man
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:23:37
the banana boat is setting sail!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:57:58
Mobile devices in general are not secure.  Hard wallets are recommended
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:41:36
I am making my first purchase of BTC on Wednesday through Coinbase.
After the purchase is complete, should I immediately place everything in a cold wallet, or just leave everything on Coinbase?  We are talking a purchase size 1/10 of a BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:56
can you elaborate, please?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:21:48
So, my bank for years has been a reloadable prepaid card and I love it.  However I tried to purchase BTC the other day through Coinbase and they said prepaid cards were not accepted.  
Long story short I ended up opening a new BofA checking account online last week and I have been patiently waiting for my new debit card to come in the mail.
but with BTC hitting 10k tonight I got super motivated and pulled $1k out of my prepaid account and I am just going to walk into a BofA tomorrow with the cash and my new BofA routing/checking numbers (I still don't have my new BofA debit card yet) and I am going to deposit into account in the morning, then attempt to use the same routing/banking tomorrow to make a purchase in Coinbase.
Should I notify BofA of my intention?  I hope there isn't any issues.  Any advice?
Edit, for what it's worth, I just found out there is a BitCoin ATM near my house?  Never heard of them before tonight
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:18:35
this is not NASDAQ man, this is crypto.  never b4
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:56:59
thank you bud
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:52:13
Im new here so please forgive this question.  Let's say you "get out" early and store all of your 15 BTC on a hardware wallet.  Even if you are no longer online, the value of your BTC in your hardware wallet still continues to increase as the value of BTC increases, no?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:03:58
same here
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:28
PANIC SELL PANIC SELL
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:00:03
My big question is did the order go through, or not.  If not I need to place another order
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:38:44
I think GDAX is good to go man, it has been stable for me and I have peace of mind putting in buy/sell limits and it all being automated - even if I cant login I know it will buy/sell from my presets.  good luck
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:44:55
Personally I wouldn't keep a wallet on a mobile device
