Government is the monopoly of the use of force.  The community leadership (Government) is responsible for murdering countless people. I have given no authority for any "community leader" to represent me.

The United States Government is illegitimate, bitcoin can not make the Government legitimate.

For recreational gamblers the volatility risk is offset by high fees for deposits and payouts.  I gamble online with bitcoin, I would rather risk a little volatility than pay 10% for deposits and cash outs.  Most Books charge large fee's for bank wires under $1000.  I have had check pay outs from books bounce, this has never happened with bitcoin.

Your close friend Nick Niergarth (gbmantis) was coached and backed by Josh Fields (JJProdigy).  Nick was roommates with Justin (stealthmunk/YourTimeIsUP).  By association of your friends, you are connected to JJProdigy.  I am not accusing you of cheating or running a crooked room.  I give you big props for your efforts exposing the UB super user scandal. You have done a good job promoting bitcoin in a positive manner.  Having pictures of yourself portraying a murderous dictator photoshopped with a notorious poker cheat beside you is not the best marketing idea.

I am not a fan of Seals With Clubs.  The software if terrible.  I would never trust a site that has stealthmunk as a team member.  Justin Schwartz is backed by the most notorious and prolific cheater (JJProdigy)  in online poker.  Bryan Micon has ties with JJProdigy as well.

Most gaming sites use the US dollar as the default currency. Even sites like Pinnacle that do not take US customers.  A change in the exchange rate by more than a few percent could be devastating to a bookmaker or serious gambler.  Online gambling is a 40+ billion dollar a year market.  Most gaming sites are currently using bitcoin as a deposit and cash out option. Gamblers and bookmakers adopting bitcoin as a payment rail is interesting and good for bitcoin.  Gambling sites are going to create many new bitcoin users.  I find the real world use of bitcoin as a payment/settlement rail more interesting than people just using it as a store of value.

We should boycott any exchange that knowingly exchanges these coins.
