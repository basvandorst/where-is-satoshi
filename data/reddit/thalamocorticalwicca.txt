You should never give that away tho. A robber can steal your fiat wallet no matter if you're dead or alive but they can only get your Bitcoin keys if you're alive. If they want your Bitcoins they won't kill you. If they want something else they'll probably kill you anyway.

That's 144GB per day and 52.5TB per year. And that would only replace the capacity of VISA, then you have MasterCard, AMEX and more too. It's funny when Bcash people claims centralization won't be an issue with Bcash, how are they gonna do it? they would have to carry around a $10´000 NAS with 100TB on 10 disks, and that's gonna be useless after less than 2 years.
Another option is cloud storage but that would cost at least $5000/month (50TB without backup) plus $400 more every month, once again just to replace VISA. It's funny how they believe that Moores law will solve their storage issues even tho it's for the amount of transistors in a CPU, it has nothing to do with hard drives.

Denmark uses green and renewable energy, just like most Bitcoin miners. Traditional banks uses local offices and are bound to use whatever source of energy is available nearby which is often coal or oil.

That and keeping track of how much you have. Be careful with that as well. When you have a portfolio worth millions of USD a robber may consider torture.

Almost forgot about that, it would take at least 15mbit/s to keep the chain up to date assuming the device is powered on 24x7. After 5 years the chain would be 262.5TB, that's 2308974418329600 bits. That means 26.7 days, assuming that you have a 1gbit/s dedicated connection. For the average Joe with 10mbit/s consumer network it'll take 10 years.
[Luckily Amazon has an elegant solution to their problems]( But joking aside, even Amazon would have trouble hosting the Bcash chain after 5 years, even if Roger could afford $30´000/month to keep his copy of the chain (the only copy) up and running.

If you pay them in BTC you can buy more BTC for the paper you would have paid in tax otherwise.

Classic pump and dump (or bubble) in action. Someone with too much money use a relatively small investment to pump the price up 10-15% or so while remaining price gains comes from people who actually think the price has a reason to rise, so they buy and think they can make some profit. 
The rich person then sells of his investment at 30% profit while everyone else loose their investment. It's just like those bug eating plants, they invest some energy to produce a liquid that attracts insects and then bam they catch the bug, eat it and gains more energy.

None of the current scaling solutions are good for long term usage. However BTC at least tries to improve the scaling while BCH will stick to "just increase the block size" until block size becomes a couple of GB and only centralized companies with enormous server farms of hard drives can afford to host full nodes.

I'm gonna ask you the same:


It was stated by Gordon Moore, Co-founder of processor manufacturer Intel back in 1965. However, crypto currency blocks isn't stored in the CPU transistors, it's stored on traditional hard drives or solid state disks of various types.
Let's do some math to see if you can see the problem alright, the biggest consumer hard drive today has a capacity of 15TB and it's expensive. With a block size of 2MB and maximum load you get 12MB per hour and 288MB per day added to block chain. That's 8.6GB per month and 103GB per year. Now that may not sound much but imagine what happens when adoption increase and block size becomes 4MB or higher:
    4MB: 207GB per year
    8MB: 414GB per year
    16MB: 829GB per year
    32MB: 1658GB per year
    64MB: 3.31TB per year
    128MB: 6.62TB  per year
    256MB: 13.27TB per year
To compete with VISA, MasterCard etc we need to process thousands times the amount of transactions that can be processed today but as you can see, after just 128 times more than today's max capacity you're filling a 15TB Hard drive every year. 
Average users won't spend hundreds of dollars every year (not including maintenance fees) to host full nodes under these circumstances and as a result of that you'll get a useless centralized crypto currency.

It's kind of strange tho, So Le Pen hates Bitcoin, how about other right wing politicians? They don't talk much about Bitcoin even though they would benefit the most from it considering how left wing governments keep shutting down their social media accounts, bank accounts etc..

Nope, adoption needs to come from all directions. However, I just find it strange that people who would actually benefit from bitcoin avoid it just like bank people who actually has a reason to avoid it.
