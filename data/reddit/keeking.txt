I don't think bitcoin have any chance to increase block size after it missed plenty of chance to scale. And blockstream will not agree, because big block didn't fit their business model, miners will not agree, because they are strung along by devs and insult by community for such a long time.

1, News confirms that they will close any exchanges which can trade between fiat and cryptocurrency. 
2, Saying blockchain and exchanges are separate things just bullshit stuff, they just want ban any thing they can't control.
3, News from caixin.com, caixin.com is a wellknown media which has special relationship with Chinese gov, so this news is very large probability to be the truth.

What will happens if miners locked &amp; activated SW by SWx2 before August 1st? Is there still a chain split on August 1st?

In any case, the on chain scale must be happen, the users only need a convenient "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" not a full node cash settlement system

Bitcoin will become an altcoin if POW changed, then I'll leave this sub and go to rbtc if that happens.
