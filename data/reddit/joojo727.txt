This is great! I'm from St. Pete and attend all the local meetup groups for bitcoin, BitPay has been at a majority of them to speak with our groups. They are really trying to engage the local community and make this great city one of the most Bitcoin friendly cities in the country!! I love what their doing here and I'm glad that I'm able to help as an integrator for them to sign up local businesses.
