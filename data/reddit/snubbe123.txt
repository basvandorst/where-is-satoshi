[This]( is a downtrend dumbass.
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:45:10

Bunch of jerk offs.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:19:22
We are still in a downtrend since ATH.

The day that cme trading started so did the dump.

Get a microphone for fuck sake..
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:42:00
It's an overall downtrend since ATH. We are in a descending channel. We could go up to 14k in the next 10 minutes and we would still not have broken out of the downtrend.

Thanks just sold 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:50:36
Bitcoin Crashed hard in 2013 and you would have sold everything then. There is no way you would have held until now.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:05:45
Hmm, really makes you think.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:14:52


You sell.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:02:09
Again with this fucking picture. On a linear chart we could be at "take off".

Don't even bother.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:47:42
Couldn't the dip just be a correction from the massive pump? People selling for profits?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:28:38
I know that feeling. Went all in at 3500 and sold at 7100. Then on a drunken whim, i FOMO bought at 7450. I feel really bad right now. Greed got a hold of me.

Someone, please tell me it will be okay. I am literally having a nervous breakdown here.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:57:44
I bought $50.000 at 7500. Imagine my pain.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:30
No, you're not. That's what i though when i bought at 3500.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:35:25
WHAT THE FUCK
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:19:09
BITCOIN CASH! Not Bcash.

What if Bitcoin Cash takes over and BTC become worthless? Will you still hold then?

He just claimed he got hacked for 110 BTC lol.

Put everything in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:09:47
Many people are selling above $10,200. Is this correct? Why are the bars always a slope? Shouldn't more people be selling at 10,000 rather than 10,2000?
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:28:45
We broke through long term channel resistance so who knows.

@_date: 2017-09-27 15:08:37
Why do people take photos of their monitors?
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:54:44
Literally no one knows. Could be $0, could be $10,000,000. If you have to ask that question then i don't think you should invest 50k.

Historically the price has always surged after Chinese New Years.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:27:01
Buy when you see a steady increase. You don't have to hit a dip at the very bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:53:14

Trying to hit the bottom is futile. Who knows, maybe it will reach 3200.

@_date: 2017-05-24 18:22:42
Because fuck it. I'm the all in kind of guy right now. I've been doing stocks with good gains but i can't wait 10 years to get rich. I've got no girfriend, no kids, no car,i rent an apartment and work a low wage job. Money doesn't mean much to me unless it enables me to quit my dead end job. I can either work for 10 years or invest all i've got nw and have the possibility to double my savings and quit my dead end job. These gains are killing me. Every month i've been thinking about investing all my money in to bitcoins but i've been to much of a pussy to actually do it. If i would have done it 4 months ago i would have been able to quit my job and do whatever i want by now. I am tired of regrets. Fuck it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:54:36
No one knows. Everything is speculation. If you are unsure then you should not be in the game.

Would you really have bought then though? It's easy to say now when you know the outcome.

If we knew that we'd all be rich by now.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:52:31
If we could predict the future then we'd all be rich now, wouldn't we?

Wait until the daily closes over the log line.

How the fuck do you even know it will drop under 1500?
You have no idea where it will end up. Sounds like you're gambling.

Thank you based China.  I was in a deep hole both financially and mentally.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:49:58

You would probably have panicked and sold during one of the early crashes. Just like most of us.
