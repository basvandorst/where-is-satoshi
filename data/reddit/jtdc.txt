I think the US-only thing is just a consequence of using Coinbase as a payment processor.

Holy shit. That was awesome.

Overstock has $3 shipping per order last I looked.

That's because you live in a state where Amazon has a business presence and Overstock does not.
I live in Utah (where Overstock is headquartered) and I pay taxes on all my purchases from them.

Overstock *does* sell lube. Check their Sexual Wellness category, IIRC.

Has nobody at HSBC ever watched that scene from Mary Poppins?

As a former programmer at OSTK, I can tell you that there is an enormous amount of red tape to comply with international trade laws. Give it time. Overstock has some damn good coders, they'll roll it out in a few months.

There's no way filing a false police report could backfire...
