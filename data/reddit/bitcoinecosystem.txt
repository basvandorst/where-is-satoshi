Why don't you use circle.com? They recently launched in the UK: 
@_date: 2016-04-29 00:51:06
I pretty much alternate using both. Looks like Circle is overall cheaper in your screenshot because Coinbase charges that extra 1% on top. But sometimes it's the other way
@_date: 2016-04-25 13:06:21
Here's the thing. If you think BTC will ever go mainstream we need bank-like services like Xapo, Coinbase and Circle to be available to everyday non-technical folk. They should be able to move easily from fiat to BTC without having to download multiple apps, create multiple accounts, memorize multiple passwords/seeds, back up paper wallets etc. Heck, all three of those very credible VC-backed services above are fully insured against theft and loss by third-party insurers... So it's even safer to store BTC with them than keeping them on your own where you're liable to get hacked and lose all your BTC. 
Look, personally, I want BTC to go mainstream, you may disagree. That's why I love promoting Circle primarily, to me they are the easiest to use and I've been using them since they launched. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 13:45:49
How do you measure success for these companies? Broad adoption? Return on invested capital? Because by a lot of those same metrics, one could argue that Bitcoin has failed as well...
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:41:49
Yeah not exactly the best outcome for investors here...
"Sources with knowledge of the deal say that AirBnb has hired a majority of the employees of ChangeCoin, which operates the social media-based tipping service. Among those hired by AirBnB is CEO and co-founder Nick Sullivan, sources say.
Left unacquired is the ChangeTip codebase as well as the developers working specifically on bitcoin projects."

Circle is probably the easiest way to get BTC if you've no technical experience with it (Coinbase is also good, but less user friendly I've found). You can just download the Circle Pay app and connect your debit card to it, like you would with Venmo. Then deposit some money into your account and hit "Send" and enter the BTC address you're looking to send to in the "To" field (or hit "Scan" to read a QR code of the BTC address). That's it.
The main reason people here like to shit on Coinbase and Circle is that they are out of touch with the reality of mainstream users who don't necessarily want to master all the complexity of holding your own private keys for the BTC. In this case Circle and Coinbase are acting as custodians (like a bank would be) and sending the BTC out on your behalf.
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:41:57
Why don't you use Circle or Coinbase? I use Circle mostly (0 fees vs 1% on Coinbase).

Hi Will. Thanks for your clearly demonstrated devotion to the Bitcoin community and for creating a novel on-ramp for newcomers to the technology via Novauri.
Just curious if you think it might not be self-damaging to you and your company's reputation to attack and belittle other companies like Coinbase and Circle who are merely also trying to serve the Bitcoin community the best way they can. It comes off as petty and self-serving when you insinuate that the management of those companies are clueless, instead of acknowledging that they might have instead grappled with different trade offs (such as usability and mass consumer appeal vs fraud rates and strict KYC), or when you take cheap shots at their website design choices.
I tend to see the entire ecosystem as struggling together to find the right way to expand awareness of Bitcoin to a wider world audience. Let's not be divisive and small-minded just to promote our own self-interests. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:01:32
Weird, Circle usually only a tiny amt cheaper than CB, never seen the spread this big
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:30:16
WTF are you talking about? Inflation is running at most 2% per annum. And most developed economy central banks are struggling to keep inflation at even those levels...
@_date: 2015-05-27 18:19:52
Circle iOS app friggin rocks, best way to introduce friends to BTC
@_date: 2016-03-09 18:50:23
You can return money to any credit or debit card you currently use, via your Circle.com account.
Just link your credit or debit card. Send BTC into your account. Then "withdraw" to your card. This effectively pays down your card balance.
The only downside is you will have to pay the 2.9% card processing fee for credit cards (but it's free for debit). From what I understand this isn't Circle charging it, but it's the interchange fees that the card networks/banks charge.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:39:08
Try Circle for debit cards. Doesn't always work in UK, but I have some friends there that only use them
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:54:56
So I agree with you, but actually one minor correction. Circle has only 1 price, meaning you can buy and sell from them at the same price (there's no spread and no fees).
So if you are buying, the Circle rate is a bit higher than Coinbase (though in my experience it's still cheaper after you factor in the Coinbase 1% fee). And if you are selling, the Circle rate is still higher than the Coinbase rate -- so you are actually almost 2% better off by selling on Circle than Coinbase!

His BTC performed a lot better than most of the BTC companies he invested in...
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:39:59
I recommend you go to Amazon and buy as many 21 Bitcoin Computers as possible
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:22:47
Sad to see this option for getting into BTC go away. They were far and away the best product in the market
@_date: 2016-02-16 02:30:59
So when Circle says they don't charge a fee, that really means 2 things:
1) they don't charge different prices to buy and to sell. The difference between the buy and sell prices on an exchange is called the bid/ask spread. Circle doesn't have one.
2) they don't charge an additional transaction fee on top of that single price. For example, Coinbase charges a bid/ask spread (meaning you'll pay more to buy than you will receive to sell) and then on top of that you will pay a 1% fee. Circle charges 0% fee.
As mentioned below, there is no "official" Bitcoin price, and just looking at different exchanges the highest exchange is about $5 above the lowest exchange. So it's not that unusual that Circle might be higher that a couple other exchanges. But I do agree with you that as a buyer, you sometimes get a worse price on Circle (though it's probably still better than Coinbase after Coinbase's fees). If you were a seller, you'd probably find Circle is the best exchange to sell your BTC for dollars compared to everywhere else.
@_date: 2016-02-08 04:05:19
Not sure what services is referring to, but I believe circle.com doesn't charge any transaction fees. They also have the same buy and sell price, so they don't charge a bid/offer spread.
@_date: 2016-02-11 03:26:20
You're making my point for me. I agree speculation, market-making, secondary trading of all kinds are important in financial markets. BTC is an asset that has no intrinsic value, generates no cash flows and has few if any practical uses.
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:40:56
Yes, if by speculation you mean secondary trading in real financial markets. By contrast, speculation on Bitcoin adds very little value to the global economy and is primarily a way for intermediaries (BTC exchanges, brokers, banks) to extract rent from retail investors who don't know any better
@_date: 2016-02-15 22:21:16
I doubt they are even properly licensed as a money transmitter...
@_date: 2016-02-18 00:55:59
I've been doing it since they launched, it's almost made for this kind of thing. They don't charge any transaction fees and they don't have any bid offer spread, so swing trading through them is great. 
Never ran into any issues. Maybe because I'm not doing tremendous volumes? But no one has ever stopped me
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:33:50
They are the world's premier investment bank and almost universally respected, or at least envied. Feel free to ask anyone who is actually involved in the "banking world."
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:10:34
Ah ok, you make a very good point. Yes I think there would need to be some kind of industry consensus around BTC pricing benchmarks to fix the consumer experience

BE CAREFUL: this site is NOT related to circle.com in any way shape or form.
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:49:06
If you think their price is high, you can sell at that price with no fees on top... there is no fee and no exchange spread
Compare that to the Coinbase or Bitstamp price where you would have to pay 1% fee or 0.20% fee respectively on top of the price.

Let a spottedmarley post go by without downvoting? Not even once
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:11:31
wow token_dave, just in this one reddit post, I count at least seven negative comments from you against circle. I'm curious if perhaps you work for or are invested in a rival?
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:23:42
I'm curious what you mean by this? Because what you describe sounds a lot like arbitrage, i.e. buy BTC on Bitstamp, resell at a huge markup to "people who have very good usage for it" on Localbitcoins
@_date: 2016-05-15 04:31:44
Hmmm... I think offering any amount of collateral above EUR 100 is not the correct move here. But in particular, offering collateral of 5x the EUR 100 loan amount is very much a bad idea.
Say you offer counterparty EUR (100 + X) in BTC collateral. Counterparty could loan you the EUR 100 in cash and then immediately turn around and say, "release EUR (100 + X - epsilon) in BTC collateral to me right now and I will give you back EUR epsilon in BTC." You would have to do it because otherwise, you are left only with his EUR 100 in cash, and you are strictly better to get the EUR epsilon in BTC back as well.
From the counterparty's perspective, he might be out the EUR 100 in cash he lent you, but if you are acting optimally, you would need to pay his demand to receive any more back. Of course you may not choose to act optimally out of spite. In this case none of you get any money and you are out EUR X and counterparty is out EUR 100.
If X &lt; 100, then human nature might make it such that you would act out of spite and not comply with the counterparty and thus both parties lose (but you would lose less than counterparty). However in this scenario (where you are offering 5x the loan amount), X = 400 so you will be unlikely to act out of spite because your loss will be much greater than the counterparty's loss.

Been a big fan of Circle from their beta. Glad to see them enabling more mainstream users to be able to make and receive payments using BTC!!
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:31:55
Got it. But I still think my point stands. The only viable business model in Bitcoin right now is arbitrage.
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:25:27
I've had similar problems in the past and a simple phone call to their customer support solved the problem fairly quickly
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:26:14
What's Coinbase? Are you talking about GDAX?
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:24:47
Your response is a bit of a straw man. You realize why money transmission laws exist right? Very bad people can abuse money transmission mechanisms that don't abide by the law.
@_date: 2015-10-05 05:40:39
Your post really just underscores that there is basically one workable business model in Bitcoin, which is doing arbitrage.
@_date: 2015-10-05 03:27:39
Yes, Circle has gotten tremendously better since I first signed up about a year ago, though it's hard to tell sometimes because they keep rolling out changes on a gradual basis and they don't often communicate them to users well:
- If you connect a credit or debit card to Circle, you'll get instant bitcoin
- If you connect a bank account, you'll need to wait around 3 days
- Debit cards are completely free. So are bank accounts. But credit is 3%
- The limits vary, I have $3000 per week, but I know some people who just signed up only have $300

I would love an answer to this question from How is Gemini differentiated from itBit and Coinbase -- both of which are regulated and heavily courting both retail and institutional participants?
To me it seems an inferior offering, at least off the bat, because of lack of initial liquidity (a problem all exchanges face) and extremely high fees (25bps for both sides, which will certainly exacerbate the lack of initial liquidity)
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:23:51
Thanks for this extensive post about your experiences. Great inside perspective from someone on the bitcoin startup front lines!
@_date: 2016-05-29 01:59:14
Circle is the best price and easiest way to get USD out in the US.
Bitfinex is the second best place to cash out. Circle generally has a higher price than Bitfinex, but only works in US or UK.
@_date: 2015-10-06 01:10:18
Thanks for this response. I'd like to see all honest and well-run Bitcoin companies succeed, so wish you the best.
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:07:25
Wait, sounds like it WAS bad, then they fixed it?
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:17:57
Agree Circle works just fine
