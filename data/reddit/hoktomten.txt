Thank you! So I have managed to understood it correctly then? I have been sitting with it for a few hours now and it just makes more and more sense haha :)

Yes I forgot to mention that but I did write down the seed on a piece of paper and stored it in my safe. Prob going to try and memorize it just in case :) 
Yes im planning to use it mainly as a investment as first and then maybe start looking Into how to buy with it once I feel I have to spend :) kinda hoping for crashes so I can buy more haha

When I finally got Bitcoin it were at 7300 so ofc when it crashed the Only sane thing to do was to buy! Doubled my investment at 6600 and then again when it went to 5800 
Looking forward to 10k (with maybe a dip before) ^^

Bought Another 50E now because its at 6700 ^^ if it goes below 6k ill buy Another 50E

Great thanks :) then I can start buying a little each month and educate myself further, still a bit iffy on some of the concepts like Fork hehe, But feels good to have actually started now!

I bought my very first 50E worth of Bitcoin when it were at 7300. Then when it went to 6500 I bought Another 50E and then holy shit it went down to 5800 so I bought Another 50E
Really looking forward to investing a bit in each dip and hopefully next year or so ill reach 1 Bitcoin  (first goal)
