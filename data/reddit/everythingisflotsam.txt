When I ask, "OK, Google what's the price of a Bitcoin?"   in AndroidAuto I get an answer, so I expect that should work in Google Home too.

Yes, Satoshi could decide it benefits Bitcoin in the long run if there aren't 5M bitcoin in the hands of one (presumably) person.  Obviously it effects valuation and adoption not to know what the deal is with this buttons and not to know whether there are 14M or 19M in circulation and for how long.  The question is more about how is could be done in the real world, not necessarily about if there's a mathematical mechanism already in place.

Is that real, or just someone's tricky joke?

The question is how one would "lose" coins intentionally and provably to the world.  The only motivation to do it would be if you could prove you did it, otherwise it would be pointless.

If I understand what you're saying, nothing would prevent you claiming it in the future, so this wouldn't actually prove to anyone that it was destroyed.  That's no more than you could accomplish by simply promising to never trade your bitcoins.

Yeah, because bears never charge you either and bulls never sleep.  Everyone knows that.

I don't know, but a secure link to Coinbase can't hurt you.

It doesn't look like it can be a phishing scam because the two links in the email just authentically direct to

And it looks the same as the email I got from confirming a new device and the email I got from changing my password.   Are you sure you are not seeing an issue where there isn't one.

Mark my words:  One day 1 BTC will be worth 100,000,000 satoshis!
