I didn't like being downvoted without any discussion. How would you like bringing up an idea and having it shot down without being given any reason?
It feels like being told "Hey your idea is shit" without being given a reason or holding any discussion about it, it's absurd and kind of insulting.

Would it make sense for wallets that haven't been touched or accessed on the blockchain within a given amount of time, say 20 years, for those coins to be released and reissued? 
All that would be needed is for a wallet to post to the blockchain anytime within those 20 years, if nothing gets posted then the network relinquishes that wallet and reissues them as block rewards.
Edit: JFC, get your head out of your asses. I'm downvoted immediately without consideration or conversation. Rub a few brain cells together before voting, why don't ya?
Edit 2: I continue to be downvoted. People, these are bitcoins that have been forever lost to the world. You're not going to recover a private key that you forever lost 20 years ago and get your bitcoins back. They're gone. It only makes sense for them to be recovered so they can be used. Yes, there are 21 million bitcoins and they can be divided up, and the lost bitcoins increases the value of the remaining bitcoins, but it's just dumb to have them locked up, never to be used again.

2 months is an insufficient amount of time, obviously it would have to be an extensive amount of time, beyond what one would consider to be reasonable.

It's there. You can go get it. It's recoverable.
And this isn't socialist, not in the least bit, your understanding of socialism is about as accurate as your ability to spell.

If you don't spend or move your gold, it either gets inherited by your children or you die and eventually it either gets taken by the government or someone finds it and takes it for their own. Either way the gold is still usable in some way.
This way bitcoins that have been forever lost to those wallets can be recovered and redistributed to miners. 20 years is a pretty long time (heck it can be 50 years, whatever), all you'd have to do is have the wallet issue some 'keep alive' signal on the blockchain and you're good to go.

Sounds good, realistically it's something that's not a concern now and if it is it'll be addressed in the future. I wonder if in the future, with additional computational power, if mining for private keys could be possible. Shit that sounds bad. 
Likely not possible with current or near future technology and can be remedied with a fork.
Edit: btw I'm drunk at a 4th of July party so don't mind me too much

If you don't pay taxes on your house, it gets taken by the government. It doesn't take much, just a ping on the block chain indicating that it's active.

Really intended this as a conversation starter and thought experiment, but that sorta backfired

Finally, someone of culture and education.
Well, a big issue I would see is identifying wallets that are inactive. You'd have to scan the entire block chain for years going back, which would be computationally expensive, and then scan the block chain again for each wallet you identify to determine how many coins are in that wallet.
Realistically it would be easier to add a decimal place, but its interesting to think about a solution.

Idk I just thought it would be an interesting discussion but that backfired
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:55:52
Screw you
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:14:03
I have read the white paper. I wanted to open a discussion about the subject but that backfired.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:33:57
More bitcoin to go around before the need to add more decimal places?
Wallets that haven't posted to the blockchain at all within X amount of time could be recognized by the network as inactive, and reissue those coins as block rewards. 
This is 'napkin math' here, not proposing an actual solution or final implementation, just wanted to discuss and theorize BUT instead I'm being shut down.
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:16:34
Good point, I see how it could open up to manipulation
Edit: what this got downvoted too? I'm agreeing with the guy!
Damn my Karma is going down today :(

You realize that debt, loans, credit cards, all these things are possible with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:01:23
Bitcoin would be better than the current system, but to say that none of the systems we have now is not in some way applicable to Bitcoin is foolish. It's just a vastly different process to create money from nothing. 
Someone will find a way, that's a fact. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:30:27
Jesús Christ, do you really need everything spelled out for you? It's just a different monetary system, that doesn't mean that the way debt is handled under Bitcoin isn't possible, just different.
You all get too caught up in the HODLBITCOINMEMESDERP to think about things. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:03:36
Banks... find a way.

I mean I know that crypto is a new path for people to invest and make money, but it's not a solution to those struggles... If crypto was our primary currency, there's nothing stopping people from taking out student loans or mortgages they can't afford.

Damn! They beat me to it. 
Well... first smaller vendor!
I had been considering adding it to the site since December/January, but it was pretty busy back then and didn't really have the time. As I've started seeing more and more businesses also start accepting Bitcoin, I knew it was about time to get off my ass and implement it!
