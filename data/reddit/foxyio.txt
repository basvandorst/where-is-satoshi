Let me rephrase my question because I seem to have caused quite a bit of ambiguity and people think there is some info I am missing. Obviously I am that is why I am posing this question to you guys to help me understand. Here is the real question I have.
**If there are no bitcoin transactions going on can miners still earn bitcoins?**
I shouldn't have to do any additional research to get that question answered I believe at least from a simple yes and no standpoint. If the answer is yes miners still can get bitcoins for their POW regardless of transactions then I am confused on what is happening. How can a new block be added without transactions it is just empty data sets hashed of null values and nonces?

Is the transaction fee paid in bitcoin ultimately though? Sorry that is what I am getting at. Sorry for so many newb questions you are helping tremendously though.

Ok Let me paraphrase and see if I am understanding you if you would be so kind. Besides the reward or "subsidy"... in a block counting as a transaction. If there are no other transactions on the bitcoin peer to peer network at that time. You are saying a miner can still earn a reward for being first to complete the POW and getting it out there etc to other nodes first... even if earning the bitcoin was the only transaction recorded in completing the POW at that time i.e. 10 min interval etc.. for that block?

Wow.. you just opened up a whole new set of questions for me on this one lol!  
Not sure you want to take a stab at them but basically what I want to know now is. "Sum of all fees paid on transactions" how are those paid? Obviously the fees don't cost as much as a bitcoin. Are people able to sell fractions of a bitcoin or pay with fractions of a bit coin their fees? Or even buy with fractions of a bit coin? If so that would kind of solve some of the dilemma I was thinking was happening.   
Also if people can earn a subsidy regardless of including transactions. If they receive a transaction while working through a nonce or whatever do they "have to" include it in their next attempt or are their miners out there that simply try to solve the proof of work and purposefully exclude the transaction data as they only want to focus on solving puzzle quickest and earning the 12.5 BTC?

Got it thanks.

Ok I guess this is the heart of  my original question.. are there many transactions per day going on in bitcoin any longer since the price has gone up so much? Did that slow transactions?
