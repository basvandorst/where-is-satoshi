I think it's atomic swaps he's referring to.  Essentially you can swap coins instantly without a trusted third party such as an exchange.  E.g. Swap 3 LTC for .01  BTC.  Decentralized markets will just make it easier to find people that are willing to swap with you.

It's a pretty difficult topic to explain. Essentially there was a way for miners to shut down full nodes that were connected to it by incorrectly including transactions that used the same input multiple times. If another block was accepted on top of this, then the double spend transaction would have been made "official" and let's say there was 100 bitcoins as input, then the miner gets to spend the 100 BTC twice. Therefore increasing the total supply of Bitcoin by 100.
  It's unclear to me how the rest of the network would have behaved with this.  Updated Bitcoin core nodes that  were directly connected  to the attacking miner would have crashed, but Old versions of Bitcoin core and alternate clients such as  btcd full nodes would reject this chain.  That would have caused a chain split.
That's what my understanding of the issue is. I hope some developers will write up detailed break down of this in simpler terms.

How? More variety would just destabilize the whole network.  Right now, if a bug in bitcoin core causes a fork, at least 90% of the nodes would just accept that as the valid chain and the network would stay operation.  If a competing implementation has equal market share in nodes and then causes a fork, that would be catastrophic.

I bought an ancient laptop for $100 and a 1 TB hard drive for around $80. I keep it on 24/7 and it's very quite. I would say it costs about $10/year for electricity. I put Linux on it and it works great. I'm also running LND on it for lightning, and quite a few different self hosted services such as home network wiki, media server to watch movies anywhere on my network, some dashboard software to monitor my services and other stuff.
  
Now that Raspberry Pi 4 is out, that would be more than sufficient to run a good node for around $100.
Edit: oh you asked about difficulty.  It's not more difficult than running any other software that you've used.  Download bitcoin-core and run it.  There are plenty of guides that will help you configure it the way you want (e.g. password to run commands on your node, port settings, ram usage, block download, etc.).

Miners that have invest millions in huge mines are gonna need a helluva lot of money to essentially trash all their hardware since ASICs will quickly become very expensive paperweights of Bitcoin price collapses.
  
Also, watch some of Andreases videos on 51% attacks. He lays out the case that they need to keep the attack going for weeks to have any impact on Bitcoin. Weeks. Each hour costing roughly half a million.
Also, some of bluematt's work on pool software will let the individual miner decide what consensus mechanism their machines are running instead of just going along with the pool.

What makes Bitcoin different?  It was the first demonstration of block chain, it's the most popular and recognizable.  However, different doesn't guarantee survival.  Any number of competitors could come with some cool new feature and make Bitcoin obselete.  It just hasn't happened yet because the market has decided Bitcoin over the other currencies.
That is a hard if not impossible sell to your investors.  The first Google search will bring out "bubble" "volatility" "crash" and a number of other buzz words that is antonyms of reliable.  In fact that is problem one of bitcoins strengths: it is such a revolutionary technology that nobody knows what the hell will happen so your bets can go very far.

If you want no fees, then use gdax bank transfer.  It's owned by coinbase people.  The limit is $5k/week.  That might be a fine strategy to enter the market so if there is a drastic price drop (like now and this could continue to $1k) you don't take brunt of the hit.  Especially if your plan is to hold for long term, you shouldn't time it for short term gains.

@_date: 2018-06-07 15:05:49
Yes, the delay for the first confirmation is a problem. Thats where 2nd layer tech can help. For example, coinbase allows you to send Bitcoin between coinbase accounts without actually going through the Bitcoin blockchain. Second layer technologies comes with some negatives, in the example, coinbase is storing your keys, but they can solve some problems.

There is no "in-between" in Bitcoin.  It's either in your wallet or in somebody else's.  In transit bitcoins is bitcoins that your wallet is stopping you from sending again, it's still fully under your control.  Worst case, it will be in the mempool for a few weeks and it ends up being kicked out and you can then send it again from your wallet.  I've gotten away with absolute minimum fees for a long time, just relax and let the miners do their job.

Coinbase is very shady, they're already giving up all their customers to the IRS and recently they hired a cyber terrorist group called the Hacking Team probably to track their customers and other people's utilization of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-12-01 22:06:29
Take a look at your debug.log file. It should have some hints. Hourly progress is meaningless since the block size varied considerably. You can also check to see if you have connected peers. I use a tool called btc-rpc-explorer, it connects to your node and has a pretty UI to get all the data.
  
You could also try upgrading to the latest version of Bitcoin core Wich has 2 additional connections solely for downloading blocks.
@_date: 2019-04-30 04:59:51
Not possible to tell since transactions are only broadcast to nodes that are actually transacting instead of the entire network. I would guess the total number of transactions are second only to Bitcoin itself per day.  No shitcoin comes close.
@_date: 2019-12-22 07:55:33
Every Bitcoin node knows what the correct reward should be for any single block. For example, blocks 0-210k should have at most 50 btc + fees in the coinbase, 25 + fees for the next 210k blocks and so on, expecting at most half the reward every 210k blocks. If the block doesn't, then it simply is not a valid block and is rejected. So if the miner wants their candidate block to be accepted, they better follow the rules. No hard fork/rule change required.
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:26:45
I think the whole premise of the question is wrong. It's too absolute. Either it is maximally priced in by the entire market or not priced in by anybody in the market. Yes, some investors are fully aware of the upcoming supply shock and have invested all they can. Many many other investors are not aware of the happening or have not taken action on it.
  
Therefore, the answer to this question is always "NO" because it's not priced in by all investors.

@_date: 2019-04-04 23:47:13
You can use zap or RTL to see how much is in your local side and how much is on the other nodes side. As for balancing them, it's a little tough. I was able to make some gift card purchases just so I'll get some inbound capacity. But I'm spinning up a new node so I can push funding back and forth until channels are somewhat balanced. It's hard work to make money from routing transactions. I have routed only 5 transactions and made 3 satoshis so far. Hoping to route more with a few nodes that I control.

I took a look at your node. Most of your peers are those LND-\ nodes. Most likely what happened is they opened big channels with you and you haven't spent made any transactions so all the balance is on their side. Try buying some stuff so your peers have some inbound capacity to route through you.

Make sure you're connected to good nodes with high availability (check on 1 ml). Make sure your channels are balanced (you have inbound capacity as well as outbound) I use RTL or zap to see capacity on a UI. Try to connect to nodes that might receive traffic like a game or some popular lightning services.
@_date: 2019-04-06 13:52:55
I was wondering the same. According to Christian decker on a recent podcast, clightning is built for always very powerful servers, eclair focuses on mobile or bad connections/node going offline periodically and lnd is for the DIY/techie community that's easy to build stuff on. I'm primarily running lnd, bit might try clightning on a new node that I'll be putting up in my mom's home.

"the miners" aren't a collective with a single mind. They're all out to make a buck. If some drop off, it'll make the remaining more profitable and they may stay. We're currently seeing some drop off maybe to other chains and it's causing difficulty to adjust downward by many percent so the remaining are making more BTC with the same costs.

How much would price change if Russia actually buys $10B in a single transaction?
  
Of course if they go OTC, (if they find enough buyers since $10B is 15% of the market cap) there would be no change in price until they announce it.
  
I'm wondering if they go through exchanges and buy market price in 1 shot, how much prices might increase. Double? Triple? Before they announce it and everybody FOMOs.

1. Yes, you can sell at any time (may take a few hours if you have it in cold storage like paper wallet) obviously, you may have to take a loss if you need to sell before you realize any gains. **Do not put more money than you are willing and able to lose entirely**
2.  Nobody knows.  That is why there is high risk (and high reward). Although unlikely, bitcoin could easily become obsolete and entirely worthless due to political or technical reasons.  I am expecting a healthy return of at least 100%.  But I have diversified to altcoins such as ETH, NEO, OMG, BAT in case bitcoin goes down the gutter.
3. Terrible question.  What kind of skills do you have to start your own business?  What kind of business?  You can possibly do both.
Definitely take advantage of dollar cost averaging by easing into the market so you don't end up buying the peak.  Go in a few thousand per week, figure out the best way to buy coins, how to store your coins, how to diversify, how to maintain discipline during panics.  
I think you should make a video or write a personal essay explaining the reason you are dropping so much money into this investment, justify and convince your future self to maintain discipline.  That way, you have something to refer to if bitcoin dips to $1.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:59:34
Wtf these people are nuts.  How can it be peer-to-peer when there's no freaking peers to connect to.  For a truly decentralized peer-to-peer network that is censorship resistent, you need as many nodes (mining or not) as possible.  Nodes that are controlled by your "peers", not big businesses that can afford profitable miners.

Yep you are *very* early on in your research.  Nobody knows what the price will be.  It has more than quadrupled in the last 8 months, after being flat for years.  I think this is the start of mass adoption and we probably won't see BTC price less than $4k.  With less and less BTC out there in the world, I expect prices to keep going up.  How high up is based on adoption and how much new money comes in.
As for when to pull it out, you have to make the decision.  I am never going to sell my BTC for fiat.  I expect that in a few years, more and more places will be accepting it as payment and therefore I never have to be taxed on the gains.   I can just use it as currency.

Tipping to random Redditors over the lightning network is quite the technical challenge. You need to open up a channel which is a full on Bitcoin transaction with a fee, then get them secure access to the payment channel. Even if you can do that, they can only really just stay in the lightning network since most tips won't be worth doing another Bitcoin transaction to keep your Bitcoin off chain. Maybe there will be services to get cash or something when you empty your payment channel to another channel and just never settle on chain.
  
I'm sure once the tech matures a bit, these challenges will be handled. Very fun and exciting stuff to work on!

The chance of just stumbling on an address that has bitcoins or had bitcoins in it is so infintisimally small that it's hardly worth the time to ponder it happening.
