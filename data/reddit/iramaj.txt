The quantum resistant ledger is meant to hedge against this eventuality. Our Medium account has a number of scenarios to provide our assumptions and rationale behinds it's necessity. We would love hear people's input on our implementation design. Our website is theqrl.org

The quantum resistant ledger is being developed just for this reason. Our GitHub is available through our website, theqrl.org. we are very excited about the project and providing a hedge against this eventuality.

Financial institutions are already preparing and they are regulated. This there is the threat of militarized forces and reaction. This makes Bitcoin more vulnerable

True, but 50% of users dont

Sure, who wouldn't shill their own project and something they believe in? By the way, trying our hardest to stand apart from projects without substance. Would love your thought and feedback about our actual work

Lol, so basically I need to dumb it down.

I appreciate the bot below, because the audio was missing. However, what is not clear is the message being conveyed by this post. It is great content, but does being an incubator for Black swan mean it will not be destabilized by a black swan event? I don't think that was what was being conveyed. 
I figure Bitcoin can adopt a change of course and it just requires adoption, but the main issue is that given the current institution like speed of consensus and implementation of solutions, there is a strong possibility that the Bitcoin Network will not be prepared.

I also disagree strongly with it not being a target for anyone. It is the biggest target because it unregulated and has no enforcement power. It could be an act of destabilization because of market disruptions and power moves or black funding for covert operations. This is an assumption that is based on logic that is not always reflected in reality. There are numerous reasons why agents would engage in quantum attack theft.
We are still discussing Segwit, so we see how that goes. It would require a majority acceptance and recognition of the risk. In addition, 30 years is not the time frame advocated by many intelligence agencies and organizations. The breakthroughs are near constant and they are already preparing.
