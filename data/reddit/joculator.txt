Maybe they should try democracy first.

The Bolsheviks seized power through violent means and held an election that included only their candidates. It was not a free election. The first free election in Russia took plaice in 1991:
The Nazis eliminated democracy after they took power.
Mao did not come to power through a general election or did he allow general elections after he came to power and he suppressed opposition political opinion. 
Assad inherited power from his father. He is also, relatively speaking not one of the worst dictators in history. 
Castro took power through violent means and eliminated democracy
As I have said, democracy required free elections and free press. It is also a continual process taking place over many years.

The fact that some individuals try to defeat the system that originally let to their gaining power is a consequence of all political systems, not just democracy. Democracy is an attempt to prevent such individuals from obtaining too much power. 
I don't get your claim that democracy has nothing to do with government, it is a system of government? It is essentially a decision making system that blocks dictatorship.

Which ones, cuz there's like 100 of them.

Kinda hard to kick out a dictator who has the backing of the military though.

If people who are in power dispense with democracy as a means for establishing authority and they adopt methods that are undemocratic, it isn't an indictment of democracy as a system of government. Today there are more successful democracies in existence than dictatorships or the like. The fact that dictators attempt to justify their authority through sham elections shows that the democratic system of governing is necessary and possibly a requirement in today's world in order to have a functioning state. 
When it comes to the majority oppressing the minority - well I wouldn't call that a democracy in any pure sense. 
I think it's a mischaracterization to claim that the majority of government projects are funded with only self-interest in mind. In a democracy if those who are elected to power are unsuccessful in advancing the interests of the people who vote for them, they will lose power.

That's a matter of perspective. Democracy really can't be mob rule with an educated population and a free press. But there is one advantage that democracy will always have over competing systems, particularly a system where a strong man runs the nation based on his favoritism. Democracy seeks to generalize the benefit of any decision according to the general values of the population. Take Russia for instance, they are now forced by threat of potential violence to adopt the values of Vladimir Putin and his sycophants. This doesn't help the general population but only those close to Putin.

There's a pump-and-dump going on watch out.

Nothing about democracy makes it's outcomes a sure thing except that it eliminates concentrated power in hands of those who seek to advance their own interests at the expense of everyone else and against the general values held by society. 
Virtually none of the worst dictators of the 20th century came to power through a democratic vote.

r/politics almost seems like it's being programmatically manipulated. The sheer number of posts being served up focusing on one single topic is very suspicious.

It is this kind of thing that will spur anti Bitcoin legislation to be passed.

You have to figure it the Chinese Communist party is going to go get anything that they cannot control. How could you not see this coming, and there's likely to be similar legislation on the US side.

Ugh, the CCP controls the internet with in China, they restrict political expression, they also restrict religious practices, I think they only permit about 34 foreign movies that into the country each year. What makes you think that they're going to continue to permit a non-traceable, relatively easily manipulated exchange mechanism to flourish? You don't even have to think about it. If they haven't shut it down then they are already controlling it.
Charlie Chaplin... Very appropriate because when the cryptocurrency pump and dump schemes start people holding cryptocurrencies as an investment are going to fall on their asses like it's slapstick comedy.
Invest in something with some intrinsic value why don't you.

The CCP will not permit anything that it cannot control.

You need a fucking source to prove that the CCP doesn't permit things that are out of its control...?

@_date: 2017-10-08 14:00:27
It's not going to be permitted in China either. At some point the CCP is going to make it illegal.

I've observed Keiser since prior to the 2007 crash and I'm familiar with is antics. I have also been a spectator on bitcoin since probably 2013. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 10:40:27
Do you honestly think that those in power will ever permit something that they cannot control and that lessons their grip on control?
