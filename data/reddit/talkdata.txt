Yeah, that's made pretty clear. Just saying, people going "omg they took $50k sooooo much money!!!" - that is not a lot of money, at all, for a team of software developers, especially working in this field.

I agree. The first thing that struck me was that those quotes really didn't seem legit. From what I can tell too, Sandhill has no investors. Nor do I think an employee of the SEC would use the term "doxxing" - this really isn't anywhere close to what doxxing is.

$50K is nothing to fund this, any of those developers could easily get a $XXX,XXX+ salary with a BTC company.

Id say no, this is not how you're thinking it is, although yes, altcoins are alternatives to bitcoin - all using blockchain technology.
In this context, they're usually referencing using blockchain technology to is something other than a monetary value transfer protocol (bitcoin &amp; altcoins). Bitcoin is merely the first "app" built on the blockchain. The vast majority altcoins are just that, alternatives to bitcoin.
Examples of things being built on blockchains: Smart contracts, DAO's &amp; DAC's, land title registries, asset ownership, decentralized cloud storage, prediction markets, notaries, etc. The list goes on and on, and a lot of them are actually making really great progress / doing very well, despite the common "vaporware" comments.
The blockchain provides many fundamental innovations that can be leveraged in a means of more than just a transfer of value. It's a world wide immutable public data ledger thats decentralized in nature never falling victim to being forcefully shut down/seized. More and more people are starting to think about what they can use the blockchain for outside of just funny magical internet money.
