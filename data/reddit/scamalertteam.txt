Okay, we will work on it ;) thanks for the alert. Any information you can provide on us to help us demolish ourselves?

We like you already :D. Join us?

Can you provide any specific listings for us to study?

Thank you.

We agree, 
but it is not worth our time to dedicate to such a large legal scam that is constantly covered (unless you can provide more information about it than is known). In future, time permitting, we will do a scam alert on them in depth

We are glad to have your support

We are not surprised. Thank you for bringing more attention to it. Our team is investigating this more.

thank you for the report. We will look in to this.
We will take a few days to read through and prioritize scams but we will rapidly publish any urgent alerts

Thanks for the support. We appreciate that everyone has their own view on how to do this. Luckily bitcoin is p2p. Our group of peers does not need to agree with what another group of peers agree on. We all agree on the protocol of bitcoin, and that is the foundation of our shared interest.

As we are a group of whistleblowers and are considered to be a group of journalists we do have legal protections. We will require solid proof and will present all sides of the argument for public consumption. We will wait for both sides to contact us and give both sides a chance to reconcile before bringing much information public that is private. We believe everyone deserves a fair chance. We also feel that at times everyone has a mess up from one thing or another. Repeat offenders are different than first time problems.
we have a lawyer on retainer for legal counsel. We *will* do our best to help. If an error occurs in our reporting we will admit it openly and attempt to go to all means possible to restore lost trust.

Thank you for your support. We feel it is important to police our own community. We feel that some people do not wish to provide information to all and do not wish the hassle of going to court. 
We believe everyone needs a chance to build reputation.

We thank you for the information. We will investigate this listing.
