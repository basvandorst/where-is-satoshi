I was waiting for the crash when it was at 11,000, obviously that didn't happen.  Said I'd jump in if it hit 12k then it hit 12k , And the 13k , 14k ...and on and on .  You know the deal .  
     Today I jumped in , I will be holding and accumulating ....period.  I will be funding from a small pension that will end when I die.  This is money I can afford not to touch.  Wish me luck.

Ask around Las Vegas....every now and then some tech winning hedge fund type drops a million on the red/black bet.  I give you a better than 50% chance, so do It.

Oh ,..so after 17 months I’m even.  This is better than the REIT (real estate investment trust) that fucked me for 16 years.  Almond Orchards anyone??

I’m one of the folks who bought at $13,000 on the way down ....then at $8000 and steady.  Lucky for me my total spent is just under $500 so I don’t give it much thought other than no ever says what their total account is and how far in the toilet they are.  Reminds me of the bus back from Atlantic City ...everyone was a winner ...except me.  I probably lost $50-60 and had a mediocre buffet lunch.
