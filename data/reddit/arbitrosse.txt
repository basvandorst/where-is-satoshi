No, I see it as market volatility 101. It will correct downward significantly, but still north of where it started, and overall continue to climb for a while.

I think it will correct below $10k.

IIRC 2013 opened below $50 and closed at nearly $1000, but feel free to correct me — I can’t find a reliable citation there and one would be appreciated.

It’ll come back after correction.

Thanks. Yeah, I had a hard time finding a 2013-specific graph. For me, citation just means telling someone where to find the source data.
To the question, though, it went up in 2013, corrected, then continued climbing, ending the year higher than it began. I suspect we’ll see the same here, although perhaps not by end of year.

Instinct &amp; long experience in other markets. My opinion is worth what you paid for it. ;)

Is that in English?

Assuming you mean outrage and not outage, there’s no rage, of the out variety nor any other. If you review my comments with a cool head, I think you’ll see that’s the case.

Pointing out that women read this sub is feminism?

Write whatever the hell you want, and keep on thinking only men buy and follow crypto currencies and blockchain technologies. If centaurs seem more likely, then godspeed.
