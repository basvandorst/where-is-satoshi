Take your investment plus TAXES out and leave the rest in bitcoin. This way you have your important health money out and you can chill and watch your profit bitcoin investment.
Bitcoin is high risk and volatile even at this stage - and if you do it this way you have bitcoin which could go way up in price and you have your money for emergencies.
If you believe in bitcoin you can always buy back but ONLY with money you never need!

Did you ask yourself how a subreddit gets to r/all? Right, through community and MANY upvotes. The community is rising because bitcoin is getting adopted by many people.
Maybe think about it this way.
Maybe you are wrong this time, just maybe? Watch one video about bitcoin (andreas antonopolous is great) and decide for yourself if Bitcoin could have a future or not.
Even if you think not, you know that you read about it and did not like the concept.

Haha, okay not what I expected

Just because you use bitcoin you are not free of taxes. Not everyone is a criminal that uses cryptocurrencies. It is high risk to invest! And in some way it will be regulated, but this is also the reason why we are seeing this high returns.
Bitcoin is only a small niche at the moment and IF it is getting adopted by the masses, your investment is going to the moon.
But you are right, it is dangerous. That is why early investors either get nothing or everything. At the moment it seems pretty nice though.

Better just buy the rest
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:47:31
Credit cards or how? Are you invested in crypto as well then as you don't seem to need cash?
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:31:27
You pretty sure only get one answer: YES.
Also I think bitcoin is great and you should try it out, maybe use the dollar-cost-average for buying.
It is high risk: Regulation, Quantum-Computers and other things could destroy bitcoin in the future. But in Europe the european court of justice already thinks about bitcoin as a currency like thing. So banning it may be pretty hard and is getting harder the more people use it.

While I like your attitude to programming in the future you shouldnt call your customers losers. They paid you and you should be grateful for that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:05:13
Yes, it is just meme. Do not take it too seriously. Bitcoin is fun - sometimes.
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:29:48
It is going to, then rise, then crash and rise again and so on

So bitcoin is criminal money? Where did you get that from - media? I get that you have your opinion about bitcoin and this comment won't change your opinion. I am not attacking your opinion but I want to say this to you, maybe just maybe you are thinking about the bad AND the good side of cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is backed by an algorithm called proof of work, so you have to work for it. It has no intrinsic value so it hard to get. But maybe do some research because maybe you are missing out on something.
PS cash is better for criminals as bitcoin arent completely anonymous and traceable.

Just pick an exchange and buy for 1000 dollar. You can own a fraction of a bitcoin. So you receive about 0.25 bitcoin (21 Million in total and deflationary).
After that learn a bit about wallets, buy a hardware wallet, transfer it to your hardware wallet and forget about it for 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:41:50
It is hard at the beginning but worth it. Could be your once in a lifetime chance!
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:18:28
Do some research first and if YOU think it is worth it, invest what you are willing to lose!
I think it is worth it.
Also what is your bank?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:52:48
It is accepted in many local stores and you can for example buy from amazon with purse.io.
Bitcoin is only 8 years old but many businesses accept bitcoin. Just google pay with bitcoin.
If you don't like bitcoin that is okay, but only if it is your opinion and not if it is from an article against it. Many like it, many don't.
Decide for yourself, but if there is a little voice in you that thinks it might be successful, maybe do some research :) Perhaps you are missing out a great investment.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:48:31
It is both. This makes it so hard to understand in my opinion. It is something that has never been here. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:24:15
Why 150 days?
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:10:01
Sure it would be possible. But the operating system of tablets/PCs/smartphones is more at risk because of malware.
If you only download mycelium, backup your seed on paper  and only go online for a transaction, then you could also use mycelium with a tablet and you should be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:16:55
Do you have any information on how to pay for fees for another tx? (I have 0 btc left in the wallet from which I sent the btc)
Easier: How to pay for transaction A (wallet A) from wallet B (TX B)?
Thanks a lot!
Edit: Found a TX accelerator. Trying it now.

Hey still need an answer?
I like the trezor over the ledger nano s because I had more options which I could see immediately and I thought it was more intuitive to use.
You generate a seed first when boosting your device which you write on paper! Never store it online of course. Your seed is your private key. Keep it private and store it safely.
Both trezor and ledger have to be connected with an App/Interface (Chrome needed I guess).
Both have multiple wallets for altcoins.
Hardware wallets are called hardware because you have a device (=hardware) only for storing your coins. Also you can think of its connection like a USB-keyboard - so your pc recognizes the device but never has access to the device like to a USB-Stick. So it is safe from malware from your pc (at least I understand it this way).
A desktop wallet has a risk of malware on your pc and your Smartphone also could be full of malware, although a Smartphone is much more secure because there are not as many viruses like for windows for example (antonopolous said that). That is why it is more secure (in simple terms).
Hope this helps! I am not an expert and nothing is 100 percent safe but I would say hardware wallets are 99 percent safe.

Lol okay. I am pro bitcoin with segwit - just look at the price of litecoin... Also LN seems to be great.
But I don't like emotional attacks at people. They have their reasons as everyone else. Behave like grown ups who are in the same room, not like anonymous internet strangers.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:26:00
Bitcoin was rising every year except one. This isnt going to change the next 5-10 years in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:21:36
This is a really great comment! I also appreciate his effort, he thinks his way is the right one. That is just human.
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:04:30
Thanks a lot for your answer!

Why not?
