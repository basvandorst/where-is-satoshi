Yes, the ones I have seen all confirm at least a cell phone number.

Hmm, not always. Yes if you are going full retail. But if buying generics, slabs I think more in the 3-5% range. I guess when those precious metals atms were charging ridiculous fees... but those things are pretty much done.

Well, yeah that is the crazy part! Nuts.

Wow, shocking.  A country 22 trillion in debt, drowning in fiat and a Wall Street hustler pronounces the soundbess of our currency as weak. Brilliant.

When governments spend 100, 600 billion or a trillion or who knows how much PER YEAR, to develop war machines to annihilate each other’s citizens, you quickly realize why humans have a hard time making it, sometimes.  Imagine if the priority was spending that 600 billion on food and literacy. Every year. Imagine.

Stop posting about this ahole dinosaur. He has already lost the battle, resorting to name calling, insults and pure ignorance so he can defend a fiat currency that has lost 99% of its value since 1913. He is a clown in an expensive suit and is wrong about mostly everything that emanates from his piehole.

He is just about ALWAYS wrong. Maybe he made a prescient call at some point in the last 3 decades. But, this guy is just a dollar stooge.  Nothing more. A dollar fascist, if you will. Makes zero sense that Congress would want to fill their own heads with yaps from this discriminating and obnoxious ahole.

Not having children? Yeah lets see how far humanity improves without children. No house? Pay a landlord rent for the rest of your life - that is called landlord slavery. For most people in the West - their children and land / residences ARE their most important asset. You have to remember - even when people go into fiat debt to buy a house - the goal is to pay it off as fast as possible.

Why anyone listens to that guy is a total mystery.
