I said it before and I say it again... Coinbase is a bunch of shills.
When I said that last time some asswipe started making fun of me, but whatever to each their own. Proof is in the pudding. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:52:26
It's something. 
It's on the right track. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:52:47
Yes I know, but it's a move in the right direction.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:54:53
Yeah ok, that's a tenth of the fees I was paying last week for transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:16:20
Oh gawd these fucking newbs.
Hold on to it, it will rise again after the new year.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:05:22
Ha ha ha cute. You must be a fucking newb.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:01
Coinbase is a bunch of fucking shills, stop using them. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:43:18
Nice come back fag, wipe it off your chin first next time.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:48:11
No offense intended, didn't know if you're a newb or not.
But yeah it took about 12 hours for me to send coins to my wallet over the weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:53:40
Good call on that one. 
Great way to circumvent the high fees, cheers.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:54:13
It's actually quicker than both Kraken and QuadrigaCX.
It's your typical, photo ID, a billl, and you holding the ID, pictures.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:09:13
My understanding is the CME trades in BTC, and it is in no way physically attached to the mechanism or blockchain at all. 
In that effect yes you might see a smaller trades and volume and the price will depreciate a bit, a la the dips we saw all through out this year. However this will not be enough to crash BTC at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:55:51
Yes BTC is bitcoin, they sell both. 
That's correct they hold it for 3 days after you xfer money into account.
But you can still play with it, you just can't take it out of the account till the waiting period is over.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:35:38
Most people use the most economic way to process those transactions. 
While your wallet will see the transaction right away. 
It took me about 12 hours on Sun to conform a transaction.
There is a difference between seeing the money and having the money. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:21:06
F**k no!
BCH is a scam. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:57:10
Yeah me neither, not sure what the significance of this is.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:55:03
Price you pay for fast transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:10:55
Exactly. 
It is a separate and totally self regulating market.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:58:26
I use 
The reason I like this one because you can fund your account with interac e transfer and it's instant. 
So you can buy quickly no need to wait 3 days for your funds to be available. 
I've used Kraken and QuadrigaCX before as well. 
Long waits to fund your account.
@_date: 2016-09-16 14:18:17
Hmm I see. 
My only worry about these rotating addresses is that I can potentially lose my wallet and all the bitcoins. 
How do you prevent that?
@_date: 2016-09-17 17:07:19
Thank you.
@_date: 2016-09-16 05:37:25
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:14:54
Ha ha ha, yeah whatever. 
They can't trace or track it, they can kiss my white ass.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:40:21
You look like a well groomed homeless person.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:52:32
You don't. 
How do you pay taxes on something the gov't can't track?
The USA does not recognize crypto currencies as neither a currency or a commodity. Hence there is no legal avenue to pay taxes on your Bitcoin gains.
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:49:01
HD wallet, what is that?
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:48:49
Good luck tracking and auditing those anonymous transactions. Lol.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:48:22
Sure thing there champ, good luck tracking my Bitcoin profits. Ha ha ha.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:05:05
I buy $100 every pay cheque.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:00:00
Good luck to them. I buy my bitcoins in another country half way around the world. 
Ha ha ha.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:22:38
I'm telling them to buy from a reputable foreign exchange so they don't have to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:58:37
Cool, thanks. Looks like it's caught up and I'm up and running. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:27:40
I just invested $10k in Bitcoin, lost a bit of money but I'm in it for the lang haul.
I will be spending every spare penny of this for the next little while, personally I think I will get a greater return on investment with Bitcoin than paying into my mutual funds. 
Also cashed out all my mutual funds so I can buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:40:47
I'm sorry I don't have the Docker running anymore, I can't provide any more details. I have since setup an alternative docker on my server. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:38:36
Cool thanks. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:32:31
That's fair.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:31:09
Yeah my thoughts exactly. 
But Gladacoin is not a coin, it's a trading system. They trade in Bitcoin.
Basically I invest an amount and they lock it in, then they proceed to invest that in the market and trade with it. Like a trader would, sort like an RRSP. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:17:31
Can you recover with the 12 word seed multiple times?
I just recovered my wallet last night and wondering if the seed is useless right now and need to generate a new one?
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:38:19
How come?
Do you know of alternatives to this?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:49:41
Yup, I am aware. I have been watching bitcoin for the last 3 years.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:23:19
Guess what , Windows owns several patents of that Linux pie, so every time you develop for your precious Linux you are giving money to that Microsoft Windwows place.
Like I said go to any Enterprise level shop and there are very few Linux machines. The only thing that gives linux fanboys the illusion of it being popular is the likes of Google and Facebook because they are running custom linux distros they inflate the numbers. 
In other words no one gives a shit in an Enterprise environment. Something that takes 5 min on a WinServer takes 2 hours on Linux from an administration perspective. In Enterprise it all comes down to cost/support. 
Next thing you'll be saying that desktop OS is dominated by linux as well, ha ha ha.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:31:57
Yeah it was giving me errors about not running.
Will switch to the other one.
What am I looking for on the web interface? 
I see a JSON string.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:03:42
Yeah that's understood. The words are in a safe place.
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:19:16
I did, and I have in the past, they are slow as fuck. 
I kid you not, it's the most traumatizing experience ever.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:03:01
I'm not looking to trade in other currencies. What I meant was is there an alternative to gladiacoin trading. Where you invest and someone trades in the market for you.
Sort of like an RRSP... I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:16:40
That docker does not work. 
It has errors in it, reports as not running when running and exits with errors as well. 
I suggest you fix it if you're going to advertise it. 
I am now using an alternate docker.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:29:13
As sweet, just pulled the docker and will run it on my server. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:28:15
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:29:58
I share your sentiment, it's a hard decision. 
Although to me it smells a little fishy that a decision was made fairly quickly rushed even. Also the interest of a few outweighed the interests of the many, and this is not how the bitcoin democracy is operated.
 
So USAF it is, I hope, if not then oh well at least we tried, hopefully the currency wont be subject to manipulation.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:49:12


Oh no I'm 100% serious. 


Absolutely, I don't gamble on things. I purchase things that I am 100% sure on and about. 
Been watching BTC for the last 3 years, was buying briefly when it was at $80.
Now I'm all in, if I lose it all I don't really care, it's only money.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:29:37
I don't trust Ethereum, it is easily subject to currency manipulation.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:52:14
I finally got through to support and bought BTC.
It's under XBT -&gt; XBT/CAD
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:27:56
It will post Aug 1st, the split will temporarily devalue the crypto currency. 
HODL the cash till then, I'm doing the same.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:15:21
If I put my bitcoins in a paper wallet my assumption is if it splits that currency will exist on both chains?
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:55:10
I am unable to locate where I change the pairing. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:37:03


You're saying i should invest in Ethereum?
I've been on the fence about it, but I did notice the growth of it.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:39:14
Could you elaborate? 
Also are there alternatives to this?
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:21:38
If by modern world you mean social media, then yes. 
But when you walk into an Enterprise environment it runs 90% Windows based machines. Because even though there is a price tag for licensing, support, deployment, and maintenance is way more time and cost efficient on a Windows Server. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:22:05
If I ran docker ps, it showed the container as up and running. 
But got error (2) docker not running or something along the lines when I tried to run "docker exec" to check and see if the container was communicating with the BTC network.
Then on docker exit I would get error 175.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:47:23
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:07:46
Can you explain why I would want to run a UASF node myself?
I'm trying to understand the benefits and implications of a USAF.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:42:52
Amazon.com takes bitcoin.
Buy them directly from them.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:17:39
Yup, got it up and running with said port. Saw the port on another docker.
Here is my docker run:


Question: How do I tell that it is running/communicating successfully, is there a command?
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:24:15
What's ripple?
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:24:31


Great new, thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:04:58
Thanks, I got it recovered.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:31:51
Bitcoin is a threat to the Globalists plan. A decentralized currency, that is hidden in plain sight and there is not a God damn thing they can do about it.
Truly revolutionary and empowering. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 03:21:23
I'm not sure, that is why I'm asking. 
Also I was not aware that copay.io is part of BitPay.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:38:02
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:46:56
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:44:34
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:48:03
Why wouldn't it?
