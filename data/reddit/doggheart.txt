The problem isn't that not enough bitcoin exist, it's that a few thousand people have all of them and that is not a framework that makes it easy to build a global economy on. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:06:08
Yes, and on the spectrum of possibilities maybe "hand it all out to a few hundred people in the first few years" was a bad way to kickstart a new currency

Yeah, bitcoin itself might be unbannable or whatever, but actual companies still have to follow laws and if some company is helping everyone dodge taxes and run money illegally out of the company it's not like china is going to throw it's hands up and be all "but it's bitcoin! so we need to keep letting this exchange stay open and we can't stop subsidizing these miner's electricity warehouses!". It's not like they are secret companies run on the blockchain or something, they have offices.

If bitcoin in china got openly used for this sort of money laundering at any kind of scale it would be absolutely disastrous for bitcoin, not something to cheer. 
Only bitcoin itself is decentralized, actual bitcoin companies aren't immune to laws. The government isn't going to watch people openly flaunt financial laws saying "what can we do!". 
If bitcoin starts being used on any scale to launder money in china all that will happen is the largest bitcoin exchanges on earth and a majority of bitcoin mining will all simply be raided and shut down for openly flaunting capital control laws. It's not some magic untouchable magic code that because bitcoin is decentralized governments are going to give companies licences to break laws. It would instantly shut down and seize the majority of the bitcoin economy.

What's the interest rate on the be your own bank that bitcoin gives you? 
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:06:01
What do you think money laundering is if not moving money in a way to avoid laws and taxes? It is blatant money laundering and is 100% openly super illegal in every single country.

That is extremely normal in bitcoin world. Welcome to the currency of the future. Where the price isn't even stable on 1 minute timeframes. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 15:29:54
If bitcoin can wait two entire more years to be able to handled 500,000 people a day (if each user agrees to never make 2 transactions in a day) then bitcoin might as well just shut down.

Usually they aren't actually suspending your account over "bitcoin" in some generic sense, they are suspending your money for some specific breach of their terms of service, such as running a business out of a personal account or making large deposits of unknown origin. Or so on, things that will also get you kicked from your next bank as well.

I mean it's easy to misinterpret his statement to answer an easier question but what he means is:
Bitcoin right now is about 75% 'premined' by maybe 750,000 users, how does that go from there to a global thing?
Is the idea the entire world economy is going to trickle down from the small number of early adopters? How do we get from a place such a small number of people have bitcoin to a place people have bitcoin? just through the slow process of the haves selling to the have nots?

the blockchain isn't magic or an AI, it adds little to voting.

Uh yeah, dodging capital controls and taxes are a crime, in every country, even if your bitcoin buddies told you it shouldn't be. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:16:03
No? Did someone tell you that?

The capital control laws.

What good is bitcoin for someone who believes in orthadox economics? 
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:01:51
The problem is It's not about running faster than the bear, it's about running faster than the other guy. 
In a world where other payment systems don't require you to buy any hard disks to use bitcoin looks like the worst option on that front. Making it even more worse just makes bitcoin look more bad. 
 
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:17:44
Legal to hold bitcoin, illegal to break laws with them. You own as many bitcoin as you want but if you start using them to avoid taxes or something you are clearly breaking laws. If you are selling bitcoin to knowingly help people not pay taxes or to break capital controls that is money laundering. Own bitcoin all you want but you still have to follow laws.

One of the lawyers working on the ETF was arrested for running a pyramid scheme. 
And like, bitcoin may not be a pyramid scheme but no one actually NEEDS and ETF to buy bitcoin and the whole benifit of the ETF was to put a layer of respectability onto buying bitcoin. Having scammy mcscammerson attached to the project basically sapped away any benifit the project had over buying BTC itself and probably killed it forever.

Nodes don't matter anymore, miners use a centralized "relay network" that buypasses the nodes and most processors submit transactions directly to mining pools, less and less people even use bitcoin through nodes, there is no benefit to it for most people.

This is why we should transition to a wealth system where 75% of the money has already been handed out to a few thousand people, many of whom were given the wealth for running a program on a toy computer part that played videogames?

Look at that exponential growth! More and more people talking about Bitcoin every day! 
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:38:49
I know bitcoin people told you that tax fraud and avoidance of capital control being illegal is totally bogus and should be legal but it isn't and is a crime in every single country on earth. Trying to avoid taxes or avoid capital control buy buying "some other asset" called bitcoin is money laundering

This is good for a currency based on wasting electricity! 
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:06:32
I mean, the crypto currency itself is an abstract enough thing no government is likely to shut it down, but not of them are magic enough that businesses that use them can run openly illegal things and not be shut down. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:57:21
You'd need some centralized dispatcher for that.  
@_date: 2016-01-29 18:06:34
Okay so as anarcho capitalists we are mad about this why exactly? Why should a state fix this issue instead of the market? How is this free market transaction even a problem?
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:58:26
Are you seriously just learning now that not paying taxes or bypassing capital controls are crimes? 
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:13:33
Okay, so ignore the idea you might double spend or anything about double spends. 
What happens in this situation if you used too small a fee by accident and the thing doesn't ever confirm. 
Until the transaction is in a block it's not real. Even beyond you being a criminal who double spends.

Note that it didn't even take the actual apollo project this long to get to the actual moon. Visa moved it's TPS from 56,000 to 65,000+ and bitcoin is deadlocked for this long on maybe possibly allowing 5.5 tps sometime in a few years?

I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea -Satoshi June 17, 2010, 06:46:08 PM
Good idea or not, SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later.  They'll either hack the existing code or write their own version, and will be a menace to the network. -Gavin in response to the above

That doesn't really help in a world miners are talking to eachother on the relay network bluematt made and most wallets are sending transactions directly to miners, less and less transactions go over the p2p network to the point maybe in the future the p2p network won't matter at all.

Would you rather depend on people that have jobs and educations in cryptography or do you want these amature app developers with no background to be the ones making your secure cryptography? 
Being respectful is not messing with other people's money this way. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 00:23:46
It doesn't really matter if you think it's fair or not. It's the question if handing out 100% of the currency so far to a few thousand people is a practical way to start a successful currency. 
It can be the fairest thing in history and if it screws adoption it's going to be the few thousand people congratulating themselves forever about how fair it was. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:31:04
Be aware you are largely asking people who have a lot of their own money tied up into bitcoin and see that people selling out large amounts lowers the price of their own investment so will mostly tell you lies and half truths to try and convince you it's a much more sure thing investment than is even remotely true.

If I found a bug in my soup that doesn't make me good at making soup. Why should I be respectful of them playing with this stuff with other people's money on the line? What benefit does this provide anyone except that a couple of amateurs get to work on some hobby implementation of things people with actual degrees in the subject already have implemented?

@_date: 2016-02-01 15:28:19
Blockchain is public, if there is millions and millions of bitcoin users they sure do seem to not actually use bitcoin since the number of transactions per year is still less than 10 million and we know that sites like satoshi dice make hundreds of thousands of transactions alone. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:41:04
I like how it's this infographic about bitcoin "not slowing down" then merchant adoption in 2013 is a bunch of small but real companies, then you come to 2014 and it's some major world class stuff,  then 2015.... nothing. two sites no one has ever heard of and some weird money laundering site for criminals that I am pretty sure took bitcoin in 2014, not even one real company. I wonder if by 2016 we can get bitcoin accepted by

Can someone explain to me again why a bunch of nobodies with no experience in doing this stuff think the best solution is to make their own cryptographic and random functions?

It's not indestructible. Even in bitcoin's history blocks have been removed, 50 entire blocks specifically was removed after an early bug let someone accidently mint 184 billion bitcoin. Along with every transaction from that period.
Many alt coins functionally identical code to bitcoin have had individual transactions reversed after thefts and stuff. 
Nothing about bitcoin is actually magically immutable. It just takes the will to change things. Whoever sold you on the idea that bitcoin has some magic unchangeable nature simply lied to you. Tried to sell you a product that doesn't exist, presumably to get you to give them money by exaggerating an aspect that excited you. 
Blocks and transactions are rarely removed, but it simply is not some mystic thing where it can't happen, or even a thing it never has or will happen.
