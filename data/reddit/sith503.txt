I don't pretend to know anything about their motives or business plan but from a design and marketing perspective, I have to respectfully disagree. The endless variations of "bit" and "coin" -based  names have been discussed here before. I think the basic shape of a circle is a great symbol for a coin-based currency and a cool metaphor for an economic system. I always appreciated their sense of aesthetic and design sensibility.

Circle: Install app &gt; press Buy Bitcoin &gt; enter account details from your bank account of choice pretty much like PayPal or Amazon asks &gt; verify account &gt; tell it how much you want &gt; presto. It is super user friendly fast and easy.

You are fine. These coins are pre-fork if it forks so no problem. Just watch any transactions on Aug 1 and a few days later.

Suggestion for you if you would rather just listen to an audio version. I listened to this at the gym on the treadmill.
