BTC and LTC do not compete on hashpower. I'm not sure why anyone would need to wait for 70 confs before a Litecoin transaction is as secure as a Bitcoin transaction after 1 conf.
One cannot simply turn off a BTC miner running 256 and start mining LTC using Scrypt. You have to build chips, machines, warehouses, power stations, contracts...
BTC is majority hashpower. LTC is majority hashpower. They are the big dogs in their respective corners.
They do not compete directly, and 1 conf on BTC is as good as 1 conf on LTC for almost every intent.
Disclaimer: I'm more pro-Bitcoin than I am pro-Litecoin, but I don't think this is a reasonable portrayal of this metric.

There are economic forces at play to prevent these sorts of things.
Who is bribing which miners, and for what reason? How big would the bribe have to be to deliberately undertake an *extremely* expensive and risky endeavor like trying to 51% and getting ahead of the rest of the pool?
Also, who has the ability to purchase all of the new mining equipment coming online while blocking others out? There are several mining equipment manufacturers, and they produce a ton of equipment. What's the current hash rate? 79EH?
Perhaps a large government could pull it off, but outside of a state actor I think the odds of it happening are fairly low due to the extreme scale and cost involved.

Doesn't that only apply within algorithms, though?
I.e. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is majority hashpower, so a group of large miners could point their hashpower at Bitcoin Cash and attack it.
Between Bitcoin and Litecoin this is not possible because the SHA256d equipment used to mine Bitcoin cannot mine Scrypt coins like Litecoin. Litecoin is the majority hashpower Scrypt coin.

@_date: 2018-09-17 06:52:26


Not necessarily - it depends on where all the extra money landed. It didn't all land in consumer's pockets in the US.


That is a very simple article you just linked. It has some charts in it with little to no explanation. Yes, the monetary base has expanded but the debt that would normally be created from it hasn't really shown up which means inflation has stayed low. This can be seen in the general lack of velocity since the expansion began. Financial corporate debt and consumer debt haven't changed significantly in nominal terms since 2008. What debt has been generated is mostly concentrated in the non-financial corporate and government sectors.


If you did not receive a pay rise each year, then this sucks - it is tough in the USA for people at the bottom - and maybe there's a rightful place for you here complaining about inflation and speculating on bitcoin. For everyone else (which is the vast majority) inflation is a strawman.
These two need to be addressed together. There are more people at the bottom than the top in the United States. The simplest way to illustrate this is simply by virtue of the median household income being lower than the average household income. If one looks into income distribution one finds things are heavily weighted towards the two extremes, with a certain thinness in the middle that's growing ever thinner. Income disparity grows worse every year, and this has been the case since the 70's.

I do enjoy this as a thought experiment.
Say a cup of coffee is $1.00 in your local currency, and say BTC is $10,000.
A cup of coffee would be B0.0001, or 10,000s.
At BTC$100,000 it becomes B0.00001 and 1,000s.
At BTC$1,000,000 it becomes B0.000001 and 100s.
@_date: 2018-09-02 17:13:29
Addressing a claim in the article - Inflation doesn't only help the rich and the governments - inflation helps everyone by decreasing the real value of that debt.
If the first year you make $2, have $2 debt, and need to spend $1 to live it will take two years to pay off the debt.
If next year there were 100% inflation you would make $4, have $1 debt, and need to spend $2 to live, resulting in you having $1 left over instead of $0.
That's the super-simplified concept, anyway.

Mr. X does not own the satellite, yet he does have access to the wallet that accepts payments.

Good suggestion. The possibilities are only limited by what we can use hot air and hot water for.
Water-cooling the ASICs would be most useful. Those chips can run at 100C+. Pre-boilers for industrial applications like paper mills or canneries, water desalinization, commercial or high-density residential heating, and integrated road and sidewalk de-icing systems all come to mind.

I get that. The 6" semi-rigid I use for larger airflows is always coming apart at the bends where it accordions together.
I will say the semi-rigid 4" was way more pleasant to work with than the foil 4" for what you see in the photo with the miners. The airflow restriction with the foil was insane. Temps were completely unmanageable. Switched to semi-rigid and everything was OK.

Because it's only a simple two-party example and the addition of any further complexity almost necessitates a fluid medium of exchange.
For example, a second mechanic would mean that one mechanic or the other would receive coffee guy's business. Coffee guy wouldn't be able to promise his car business to both mechanics equally in that scenario.
Also, there's one or multiple coffee bean producers who may also take Bitcoin. What service would coffee guy barter to them? Coffee? Is that even valuable to the coffee bean guy? What if coffee bean guy needs to do business with a mechanic? He can't just trade coffee beans for car work because the mechanics don't want coffee beans, they only want coffee.

Edit: A modern T9+ using electricity priced @ USD$0.10/kWh produces about 40% profit nowadays based on my usage and daily payouts. Imagine having all the hot water you want while making $1.40 revenue on every $1 you spend in electricity. That is what this is capable of.

Exploring this further - mounting the ASIC chips directly to a water-contacting metal surface and insulating the entire thing from external loss like a typical water heater arrangement should achieve the same thermal transfer efficiency of said water heater, with the coin output as a bonus. This should also allow hot water temperatures of up to whatever the operating temperature of the ASIC chip used is (Typically 70C - 105C) as it would eliminate the losses from going chip heatsink -&gt; airstream -&gt; coolant.

I think the distinction you make is a good one. In the past a bank run would imply a liquidity issue, and I have to admit I assumed that association in my head. In today's world where nobody really pulls significant USD out in cash I'm not sure a system-wide\* bank failure would occur in that fashion. In normal use everybody simply makes small withdrawals to via debit card, or via transfer to pay off a credit statement, and in a system wide\* bank run situation I think the Fed / FDIC would step in to alleviate the issue despite the potential inflation issues.
I honestly don't know. Have we ever experienced a system-wide\* bank run on a majority-digital currency like the USD? Is there anything we can look to for perspective?
Edit 1805190334z: * - clarification
Edit 1805190359z: [Here is a list of bank runs on Wikipedia for study.]( It appears as though the bank runs in some majority-digital countries around 2008 lead to nationalization of independent firms. Could we look forward to huge gov-backed loans, or possibly a partial or total nationalization of the US banking industry, in the event of a major run &amp; liquidity crunch?

If I'm reading this correctly - they are using the mining operation to warm the space within the rooms like a greenhouse as opposed to trying to get the heat out of the airstream. Heat-soak into the water seems to be a secondary benefit for them?
Still, I like the concept of a Crypto Greenhouse. Very cool if paired with LED lamps. I'm imagining a multi-story farm in the middle of a city that does food grow-op + mining.

By turning your crypto miners into water heaters.
[Like this.](
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:05:49
Edit 180516t1124z: To summarize - If a water heater uses $30/mo to heat water, even a very inefficient mining box like the 3-year-old S7s pictured would cost roughly $30/mo and return $20/mo in coin revenue to heat that water. That's after 3 years of profitable operation as a coin-only box, followed by hot water production at a 66% discount vs. the old pure cost approach.
I've added a section to the OP titled "Practical uses" which now includes powering a radiator system to heat your residence.
While I agree that there are certain economic forces at play that complicate the issue - if one can use the ASIC to offset a pure cost, like that of a standard water heater, it really helps with the ROI period. I want to say my break-even on modern bitcoin ASICs is around 18 months and Litecoin ASICs around 12 months @ USD$0.10/kWh. This is based on electricity use measured at the wall with meters and daily wallet payouts over many months.
By offsetting my apartment heater with the hot air from my mining operation all winter I managed to save an additional $80/mo on top of the margins I was seeing for the ASICs alone. I really enjoyed having a free hot tub to lounge in whenever I wanted for a week, as I used it about twice a day instead of my usual shower, and that benefit has a monetary value as well... If I were to use this setup to completely replace my water heater it would shave off  the cost of whatever electricity use my showers and dishwasher / clothes washer consume.
I hope this helps illustrate how the benefits of cost-saving, when coupled with the coin output on even severely outdated boxes, is still financially more efficient than simply burning electricity through a resistive coil.

It's been one of the most influential and useful tomes in my financial studies. Its is best read chapter-by-chapter, with breaks to digest each in turn.
While the majority of the hard maths applies to established, mature companies and industries, it provides a lot of soft insight into analyzing management decisions and seeing if they are operating for their own benefit, or for the benefit of the investor. This latter point applies to all companies, especially startups.
As far as ETFs it does address active / passive investing. It recommends reading Security Analysis if one decides to pursue active investing, and recommends low-cost index funds for the passive investor. It also touches on portfolio management / mix and how that plays into risk management.

At this point it is irresponsible not to have a representative portion of your holdings in Bitcoin.
Stock Indexes / AAA Bonds / Bitcoin are three of the most liquid and powerful investment vehicles around.
* Stock indexes track the companies in the underlying economy.
* AAA Bonds typically provide a safe and reasonable rate of cash return, also backed by the strength of industry in the underlying economy.
* Bitcoin provides safety as a world commodity - flight capital - see what once was Gold before the confiscation of 1933.

Correct, although the benefit comes from the fact that my water heater would then also be making 50% to 150% return on energy used via bitcoin / litecoin payouts.
Even if it uses twice the electricity it is a profit-bearing enterprise as it offsets the pure cost center of a water heater heating water at a total financial loss.
Ex. for a week of running the open-circuit system 24/7 @ USD$0.10kWh a T9+ based hot-tub would cost about $25.20 and yield about $37.80 for a net of $12.50.
If one wanted to use this to supplement a regular water heater a system could be plumbed directly into the house's existing pipes, or the cold tap lines feeding the water heater could be run through a hot bath like this to pre-heat the water, thus offloading the amount of work the water heater has to do.
The nice thing about this is it is not capable of reaching temperatures above about 50C as that is the exhaust airstream temperature. If I am correct it is impossible for this system to boil over before critical ASIC failure occurs.

As far as I can tell - currently every ASIC I've ever bought has been an R&amp;D box with the market paying to fund said R&amp;D by purchasing these boxes. I own a few, and they are all somewhat unstable by modern processor standards. The Bitmain Sx series and Lx series for Bitcoin/Litecoin specifically.
I'm really looking forward to the market diversification we should see now that Bitmain's retail R&amp;D phase is concluding. They made a lot of money on it, and I thank them and the community for their efforts.
I really, really, really want to see a liquid-cooling ready rackmount ASIC with some sort of standardized, high-output, easily-replaced power supply. A modular APW3++ would be A-OKAY.
Fwiw - **people who mine in apartments - a liquid cooled ASIC would be a boon to you.** You could connect it to a large radiator on your balcony / patio / whatever with a 12"+ radiator fan and never have to worry about noise again.

Recycle the heat?

Good question, and I have to admit - I didn't get so far as a true ROI calculation. I did this because I was bored, it was January and cold at the time, and I wanted a crypto-currency hot tub to lounge in. In this instance yes, the tub heatsink is a stand-in for another kind of active heat removal loop.
This was the first half of a big glycol chiller arrangement that I was planning on using to cool the intake air charge. I live in balmy Alabama and from May to October I have to turn my ASICs down during the day. The closed-loop version could be integrated into a larger box housing the intercooler + ASICs that could be kept outside even on 40C  / 104F days. Electricity is cheap enough here that both T9+ and L3+ ASICs should  remain profitable even with the inceased electricity draw. I will have to re-run the numbers, but I had basically calculated the BTU requirement to cool the intake charge from 40c to 20c @ 80% humidity and worked out favorably.
The closed loop also helps because I don't have to worry about filtering the air of pollen, etc.

Absolutely agreed. Their approach would be far better suited to analyzing a financial services company that provides consulting, management, etc to the Bitcoin retail market.
One of the big lessons they espouse is that of rational, reasonable management.
Domino's Pizza DPZ is an interesting thing to analyze these days... After they took out around a billion in debt to fund share buybacks in the past few years. LOL
I wonder how they, and many other heavily-leveraged companies, are going to maintain their debt covenants / interest coverage ratios when the Fed hits their rate target?..
The conclusion I've come to is a lot of these companies are not intent on ever paying it back. They are just carrying it forward for the past few years, and I suspect will bail on it when it becomes unsustainable.

Ahhh I gotcha. The Bosch pump pulls around 3-4A @ 12V, and the starting amperage seems to be around double that, although I don't have a great way of measuring such a short impulse.
I'm not sure what the long-term durability on the pump I listed is. It's an automotive pump, and gets noticeably hot when run continuously. It was easy to get and was useful for the little garage-style experiments I was performing.
Here is a company that I've found that provides a lot of different demand and circulation pumps. Some are rated for intermittent, some are rated for continuous.
I'm interested in how your experiment turns out, and am open to helping with any design problems that come up.

Okay everybody, possible effects:
* Decrease in volatility due to increased market-makers.
* Increase in volatility due to higher exposure to speculation.
* Increase in price due to increased demand / exposure.
* Increase in adoption due to legitimization (see price.)

Agreed. The ability to subdivide infinitely handles the technicalities of forever-decreasing prices because you don't have to pay in half a penny or w/e.
There are other issues at play, though, namely the difficulty in maintaining a stable economy when the currency used within that economy is not directly controlled. In this way fiat does have an advantage. The disadvantage, as we all know, is the allure of infinite borrowing for things outside market or economic purity. I.e. endless wars, subsidizing the rich, etc.
Bitcoin's obvious advantages are that it's not centrally manipulated and that it operates outside of the existing government-banking complex. There are other issues that are not readily fixed, though, namely the issue of loans. Loans taken against bitcoin would be akin to lifelong servitude. Imagine you take out a 1 bitcoin loan due in a year, spend it, and in that year's time your 1 bitcoin went from $1,000 to $10,000 in value. Deadly.

I'm not talking about Bitcoin's volatility, I'm talking about the stability of the economic activity within a given nation or market. Ex. when the domestic automakers got into some shit in the US years back the government was able to step up and offer them the means to carry on. In a purely Bitcoin environment that may not have been able to happen and the economic shock could have been immense compared to what it was.

@_date: 2019-03-01 16:02:08
There are two pieces of information here that are immediately useful.
Referencing the coindesk survey from 2015, 94% of survey respondents were between the ages of 18 and 65. 50% of respondents were from North America.
I run a survey once a week to determine the rate of active crypto participants in major, large-item classified ad markets in the United States. My data suggests this rate is about 1%. Nearly all of my market participants are also between the ages of 18 and 65.
So if the rate of active adoption in the population of the United States between the ages of 18 and 65 is about 1% we can start to draw some estimates.
This age range accounts for roughly 64% of the US population, or 208 million people.
1% of that is 2.08 million people. If we include 1% of the same age range in Canada that comes out to about 2.25 million people.
If there are about 2 to 2.25 million active crypto users in North America, and that represents roughly half of all active crypto users, then we can estimate that there are roughly 4 to 5 million active crypto users in the world willing to perform significant transactions using cryptocurrency.
Coinbase alone states they have somewhere around 20 million accounts, and I've performed some rather informal surveys and have found a significant number of people who are interested in crypto, or hold crypto, but do not actively participate.
By my estimates the interested-but-not-active crowd lands somewhere between 40 and 80 million people worldwide.
Could the difference between the 5 million or so active worldwide participants and the dormant 40 to 80 million users indicate latent demand?
I think there is a possibility that this is the next group to on-board. When wallets become easier to use, when vending machines and stores start to accept crypto via NFC, etc. I think this could indicate the size of the next state of retail crypto participation growth.
These are just some scattered early-morning thoughts. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2019-03-05 12:02:11
Agreed. Unless we see some crazy monetary expansion and inflation in the coming years I doubt the market cap of Bitcoin is going to be nearly 4 times the current money supply in 5 years.

Also - a credit card is registered to an account that is registered to a person. The card has the account holder's name printed on it. The ID check is *supposedly* used to ensure the card is being used by the registered cardholder and not a thief.
A bitcoin wallet has no registrant, so what would they check the ID against?

There's no real way to untangle the knot like that.
One thing to keep in mind is that there is not enough credit outstanding to satisfy all of the debt outstanding.
The system is balanced so that the money supply is enough to keep defaults low and inflation reasonable.
I.e. the supply is large enough to keep the system liquid, yet constrained.

The weird thing is that 100x from 0.066T isn't really that big of a jump. It just puts us somewhere in the realm of gold's market cap. That extra 10x from there is a much bigger leap. There is only about $15T in US money stock.
It's my personal opinion that we'll hit somewhere between BTC $200,000 and $400,000 sometime in the next four years or so.
Other people's research puts the US crypto community at about 50% of total worldwide users. My own personal research puts active US&amp;Canada adoption at around 1% for people aged 18 to 64. This would put adoption outside the US at around 1/20th of a percent.
All we really have to do is get worldwide adoption up to about 1% and we'll have nearly 10x the amount of active crypto users that we do now. Increase US active adoption from 1% to 10% and that brings us up to about 15x the number of active participants.
This would effectively bring the average amount of Bitcoin *currently* available to each participant down from about 2btc to about 0.3btc.
The usability of Bitcoin needs to increase drastically for us to attain those adoption numbers, though, and then once the functionality is there we need to raise awareness for people to give it another go.

Thank you.
I think if we could get some solid privacy features in Bitcoin &amp; manage to market it towards the generally oppressed segments of society we could kind of bootstrap adoption among regular people. Rap, hip hop, etc are genres that are popular in cars and clubs and other places.
Get the sex workers &amp; black market folks safely using it again, like back in the Silk Road days, and it would drive from there.
They already have the hardest time accessing proper banks, and pay the highest fees on banking services because of it. Cash is dangerous to haul around for a number of reasons. Economically it's the demographic to aim for.
Edit: I also think it will help drive adoption among the downtrodden demographics if there's also this kind of lux-sheen on it. Jewelry stores accepting it is definitely something to encourage due to how visible and status-driven it is. High-end clothing retailers would be another good one.

@_date: 2018-10-07 02:14:18
That's a complicated question. I think it may have some validity.
One of the theories going around as to why we have seen such low inflation vs. monetary base growth is because almost all of the new money created has been lent out to institutional banks and investors. This would explain the growth in assets and equities while keeping overall prices low.
This can be corroborated by the low velocity of the USD. Low velocity illustrates a high amount of currency vs. GDP indicating that the economy has not grown nominally through either price inflation or growth to make up the difference.

Click / tap to convert is a winner, I agree.
I agree with elsewhere that consistency will be key. I'd like to see the community adopt a BTC/sat arrangement by default. One can enable further modes in the settings like mBTC or bits.
I'd like to see BTC split by 10,000ths like 0.0002 1595 BTC and sats by thousands like 21 595 sats. I think these divisions play to the relative strengths of the different presentation formats and allow easy use in different international markets.

The official inflation figures are based on things like the Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures index which measure a range of goods.
So far the PCE, used by the Federal Reserve, tends to show the lowest inflation figures, the CPI shows a higher inflation figure, and monetary inflation has been higher than both.

True. How would we want to manipulate the numbers, though? A straight comparison is the simplest.
If we want to manipulate the comparison by using Bitcoin's market cap then yes, we'd need significantly more USD to reach sat-cent parity. Livecoinwatch has Bitcoin dominance at 52% as of this writing. If we use that multiple it'll take about 16 to 20 years to reach sat-cent parity instead.

I don't think a whole bunch was bought volume-wise at 20K. We have to remember that the spot price is simply the marginal cost to buy / sell the most recent coin. Given that we were only above 16k for a moment I can only imagine the market was terribly thin up there.

I agree that bitcoin will probably be the premier cryptocurrency in the new world. There will be a lot of other ones too, though.
Right now the value of a bitcoin is about 120 litecoins, yet there will only be about 4 litecoins per bitcoin at the cap, and only about 3.4 litecoins per bitcoin currently.
Litecoin is very, very similar to bitcoin and is typically used as a sort of live-testnet currently. Going forward with Lightning network and the usefulness of atomic and submarine swaps I think litecoin will find use in onboarding the many billions of people in the world onto lightning due to its increased throughput compared to the bitcoin network.

If you want to talk about the utility of a bitcoin improving, sure, I'll agree to that. Segwit, Lightning Network, Gemini, Bakkt, etc. are all progressing and improving the utility of bitcoin. This improvement has a good chance of increasing the market valuation of btc as they lead to increased adoption.

Bitcoin may not find a level price in fiat unless we find a fiat currency that is forced to plateau or deflate for more than a few years, and any previous attempt to do so has been disastrous for the economy that underwrites it.
If Bitcoin becomes the standard currency for the world I could see a significant dropping-off in the voracity of mining, sure, but by then Bitcoin's inflation rate will be so low (far less than 1%) and mining so well understood that there should be little economic incentive to gamble on the future speculative value of a coin.
I'm sure individuals could do something silly and speculate on a large rise in the value of a coin in a coin-denominated world, but the market as a whole is a different beast.

Velocity is a derived number. MV = PY where M is monetary supply, V is velocity, P is the price level, and Y is the real economic output (real GDP) To get V you do Velocity = Price Level * Real GDP / Monetary Supply
A decrease in velocity means either monetary supply has increased, price levels have decreased, real GDP has decreased, or some combination thereof. We then take a look at the individual inputs to try to determine the cause of the velocity drop.
In our case velocity has decreased against slowly growing inflation and real gdp showing a quickly growing money supply. Where has the extra money gone? If we look to assets like real estate and the stock market we can see one potential target, and if we look at the trade balance we find another.

Thank you for your post. I'll stick with my burger comparison because I'm hungry.
**What does it mean for a value to be intrinsic?**
An intrinsic value is a value pertaining to something simply because it is. If I have one burger it has the intrinsic value of being able to satiate my hunger. If I have two burgers, then the presence of identical burger  does not remove the intrinsic value of being food from burger  Either burger will satiate me just as well as the other. The fact that there are countless Bitcoin clones does not remove any intrinsic value from Bitcoin itself.
**Value vs. Price, and the Subjectivity of Value**
You conflate value and price several times in your post. A value is more akin to a characteristic, and a price is what the market decides those values are worth in any given currency. There is no real lower or upper price bound for gold or silver if you're pricing them in US dollars. In fact, there is no upper or lower price bound for anything given the correct market or transactional medium. If you walk into the woods and try to sell your gold coin to Ted Kaczynski's ghost he's going to laugh at you until you leave. If you try to sell a burger to a robot the robot is going to laugh at you until you leave. If you try to buy a burger with Chuck-E-Cheese coins as currency you're going to get laughed at, unless you're actually in a Chuck-E-Cheese willing to honor that arrangement.
**Values Can Change**
We have to discuss Bitcoin for what it is today, and what it can potentially offer in the future. A burger today is food. A burger tomorrow, if wrapped and chilled, is probably still food. A burger six months from now after it's rotten is not food to a human, so it has lost any intrinsic value to us beyond use as compost or a mean prank. Could Bitcoin rot? Certainly, all things fall to the brutal assault of time, but it is not rotten today and I doubt it will be rotten tomorrow. Until then it will continue to provide values like immutability, ease of transfer, and financial independence to those who use it.
**Is it possible to price Bitcoin?**
Given everything I've typed here I hope it's clear that it will never be possible to say, "Bitcoin has these values, therefor Bitcoin is worth this price in the market."
Bitcoin's value at a given price is either worth it to you, or it isn't, and you as a market participant have to make that decision for yourself. Nobody can determine its value to you, and nobody can determine the price you're willing or able to pay for those values.

They did it in an effort to prevent cascading business failures. The thinking was, at the time, that deflation would cause a runaway condition and destroy more value than simply flooding the markets with cheap liquidity and allowing zombie firms to exist for a little while.
I think they were right to do what they did at that very moment, but I think what happened in the years after that was a policy failure. Nobody wanted to take the bump on the head during 2011-2015 so rates stayed low and everything was groovy (or so we thought.) The pain never came, and now there's a possibility it will come in all at once.
@_date: 2019-10-12 23:15:23
Value is relative, but I'd argue that to a human being things like air, water, food, shelter, relationships, entertainment, etc have some intrinsic value to us.
Edit: I'll elaborate a little bit. Intrinsic just means, "belonging to something by its very nature."
So "intrinsic value" is really just a value belonging to something by its very nature. Food has an intrinsic value to humans because it allows us to maintain ourselves. Fuel has intrinsic value to a vehicle because the vehicle cannot move without it, and a car has intrinsic value to most people because it allows us to cover large distances quickly and easily.
Some of the intrinsic values of Bitcoin, to humans, are things like immutability, ease of transfer, and financial independence.
How the market determines a *price* in $ relative to those intrinsic values is through the process of price discovery. There's no real way to accurately determine this amount in a scientific way as there are simply too many factors that vary all the time. How much $ is in circulation compared to Bitcoin, and compared to other currencies vying for Bitcoin? How many people want to, or are able to, buy or sell at any given moment? etc.
Ultimately the market price of something relative to its intrinsic values to us is just a floating number, and it's up to each and every one of us to determine if that value is rational at any given time.

Things are different this time, you're right, but what we've gained in mortgage regulation we've lost in the health of corporate balance sheets. A lot of companies have really gorged on cheap debt. Dominos Pizza is a favorite example of mine.
I don't liken this to real QE. It is a return to a method of market regulation that was employed for a veeeery long time in earlier decades.
My big concern is that they're now taking action in the face of a weak domestic situation *and* a weak global situation. In this case if America falls, so does the world.

There are businesses, big businesses, that exist at the moment that are not viable. They survive on very low-rate debt and just roll it forward instead of paying the principle. So long as they maintain their debt covenants the principle never comes due.
The pain will be when those companies are faced with either deteriorating balance sheets or rising interest payments, either one of which would breach most of these marginal company's debt covenants. These covenants are usually focused around income-to-interest ratios. I.e. if you pay $100/yr in interest you need at least $400/yr EBITDA, etc. If you dip below 4x coverage the loan is due.
Then there are covenant-lite loans which have become very popular recently, and boi-oh-boi are those gonna be fun. They're usually issued to companies that would not otherwise meet the usual covenants while paying a slightly higher %. These should be one of the first classes of debt to start defaulting.
Then there are aaaaall the companies rated BBB/Investment Grade. If they get downgraded to BB they become junk debt and that's a problem.
Anyway, the charade can keep going a little while longer, but there are big structural issues right now in corporate debt.

The debt markets are as wide and varied as the oceans are deep. Financial engineering is a rabbit hole you should check out sometime. It's far beyond my ability to type out here in this little comment window.
In a very basic sense it just comes down to lenders wanting the debtor to maintain a certain level of financial health in addition to whatever rate they earn on their principle. This in turn protects investors, lenders, etc.
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:57:12
In that case the covenants would change towards other health metrics whenever the loan came up for refinance. If a company is making negative money then it doesn't really matter how low the interest rate is.

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:27:40
By Rich Miller and Christopher Condon
October 11, 2019, 10:02 AM CDT Updated on October 11, 2019, 11:04 AM CDT
The Federal Reserve said it will begin buying $60 billion of Treasury bills per month to improve its control over the benchmark interest rate it uses to guide monetary policy after turmoil rocked money markets in September.
The central bank, in a statement Friday, stressed that “these actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation” of interest-rate policy and “do not represent a change” in its monetary stance. “In particular, purchases of Treasury bills likely will have little if any impact on the level of longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions.”
In foreshadowing the Fed’s decision earlier this week, Chairman Jerome Powell repeatedly insisted that any planned securities purchases would not be a resumption of quantitative easing -- the crisis-era stimulus programs that the central bank used to lower long-term borrowing costs and boost the economy.
The New York Fed’s open markets desk will “purchase Treasury bills at an initial pace of approximately $60 billion per month, starting with the period from mid-October to mid-November,” according to a central bank statement. The Fed said purchases of Treasury bills will extend “at least into the second quarter of next year,” leaving open the possibility of a change in the pace and duration of purchases.
A recent and unexpected scarcity of lenders in overnight funding markets caused yields to spike sharply in mid-September, briefly pushing the Fed’s benchmark rate outside its target range. Since then, the Fed has been injecting liquidity into overnight markets on an ad hoc basis. The central bank said Friday that these would continue at least through January.
The Fed said the aim of the bill purchases would be to maintain bank reserves in the system “at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.”
“I don’t know if this is going to be enough, but this will certainly help,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. “It will paper over some of the remaining technical issues that still need to be fixed.”
The central bank said Friday that policy makers held a videoconference on Oct. 4 to discuss the moves.
The Federal Open Market Committee is next scheduled to meet on Oct. 29-30 to discuss monetary policy amid expectations it could cut interest rates for the third time this year to further protect the economy from global weakness and trade uncertainty.
“From a monetary policy standpoint, I’d say that at the margin it means they can focus on whether to cut or not cut at the next meeting, and not be bothered with the discussion about the plumbing,” said Thomas Costerg, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management.
By purchasing securities, the Fed will add a cushion to the supply of excess bank reserves, a pool of money that helps provide liquidity to the overnight market.
Overnight money markets -- where banks, investment funds, companies and other institutions borrow and lend cash -- help set the baseline costs for longer-term lending. The Fed seeks to control overnight rates as a tool for influencing the broader economy.
The Fed said it will also continue to inject liquidity into the markets through overnight and term repurchase agreements. Term repo operations “will generally be conducted twice per week, initially in an offering amount of at least $35 billion per operation,” the Fed said. “Overnight repo operations will be conducted daily, initially in an offering amount of at least $75 billion per operation.”
Until recently, the Fed was reducing the size of its balance sheet, unwinding some of the crises-era bond purchases in a process that lowered the supply of excess reserves. Fed officials had readily admitted they didn’t know how far that process could go before it might cause a shortage of reserves and disrupt money markets, but they anticipated that threshold would be lower than they now believe.
“It very much looked like we were still a bit perhaps above that” threshold, Powell said in Denver. “Until September, when we found we probably weren’t.”
For the week through Sept. 4, bank reserves deposited at the Fed totaled $1.49 trillion, according to data from the central bank. That fell to $1.39 trillion on Sept. 18 before bouncing back to $1.51 trillion in data reported Oct. 10.

BTC has majority hashpower in the SHA-256 space.
LTC has majority hashpower in the Scrypt space.
SHA-256 and Scrypt are the mathematical processes through which miners discover new blocks n' things. They are incompatible with each other so they each have their own mining space.
If a coin has majority hashpower that means the entire rest of the coins in that space could divert all their available hashpower and still not pull off a 51% attack.

To put it another way something that cost $1.00 in 2013 would cost about $1.08 today, and something that cost 1 bitcoin then would now cost about 0.066 bitcoin now.

Monetary inflation is not the same as price inflation. The PCE and CPI, which are widely cited as inflation, measure price inflation.

Money goes in, money goes out.
Where money goes in is privileged, where money goes out is disadvantaged.
Deficit spending and debt monetization (in) increase the money supply, among other things. Taxation (out) pulls this money back out of the system.
Bitcoin solves a lot of it by providing a relatively fixed point for fiat currency to peg against. In the event Bitcoin completely replaces fiat, which I think is unlikely in our lifetimes, then the entire paradigm changes because deficit spending doesn't exist, and taxation becomes a much trickier issue.

I think the underlying technology improves daily. Bitcoin and Litecoin have some impressive projects being developed, and Lightning Network grows by the day.
The price action is not really correlated to the technology or how useful it can be, or how useful it *will* be. This is especially true if people jump ship because the stock market goes down 50% year over year. People gotta pay rent and eat and all that. USD is getting scarcer by the day and I am really interested in whether or not it's going to cause a liquidity crunch and ensuing market crisis. "The bubble of everything" will not survive a liquidity crisis.
My strategy is to buy a little coin here and there at the current price level. I think cash will be king early on in the event of any major market issues and I think that will be the time to deploy USD in both the crypto and equity markets.
Edit: I think the day we see a huge price run-up that doesn't crash back down will also be the day that the technology meets the needs of Mom &amp; Pop. The big run-ups really bring attention to whatever the current state of crypto is, and this previous round really disappointed a lot of people when TX fees and TX processing time went sky-high. Maybe during the next run-up it will be ready, or the time after that.

Bitcoin is but a kite in a hurricane, as the SPECTRE quote goes.
Fed's upping rates while simultaneously selling off assets n' things, so the dollar's getting stronger by the day due to increased demand and decreased supply. This is directly counter to the price of a Bitcoin valued in USD.
The tariffs and trade uncertainties are having a negative impact upon business prospects in the short to mid term as things get shuffled about. This isn't boding well for the price of the various stocks that make up the stock market and thus the stock market itself.
Which leads people to be a little more antsy and risk-averse, and Bitcoin is a risk-on sort of thing.
Market demand is moving towards cash, treasuries, high-grade bonds and the like.
If the markets really tank similar to 2001-2002 and 2008-2009 I think there is a good chance Bitcoin will test the previous ATH of ~$1,000 per coin.

Does Bitcoin not have any inherent value? I say it does, and you say it doesn't. I say its value is in the ease of exchange. It is far easier than carrying around cash for any purchase. This is akin to pleasure-seeking in drug use, or profits in manufacture. *Bitcoin is an improvement to an existing paradigm, that model being the cash model.*
We may see another 80% devaluation if anything major occurs, akin to the Mt. Gox crash, buuuut now that we're seeing major projects in other nations working to integrate cryptocurrencies into established payment systems, which breeds resilience for all crypto, which is good for Bitcoin... 
I'm not holding my breath on a buying opportunity of that scale occurring again so soon.

Yeeeesss. Spend $3,000 - $6,000 initially, then go up to $30,000-$60,000 or so and just do multiples of those until you've bought all $300,000 worth.
Orders of magnitude, risk profiles, and all that.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:34:32
I mostly agree with you.
I'm of the opinion that it's an untenable position to deflate the USD through any kind of major market pullback and the ensuing economic calamity. We have around 85 years of continuous USD inflation averaging around 5% to 6% per year with the occasional leveling or pullback. I think that in the event of a major upset we will see a return to NZIRP and QEx. I agree that Bitcoin and bullion will be the primary benefactors here, with Bitcoin the primary benefactor between the two.
I really think that trying to reduce liquidity during a time that a lot of companies are trying to reshuffle their supply lines is incredible. Even more incredible is that growth projections have not changed significantly. Non-financial corporate debt has grown substantially with a sizable portion going to share buybacks over the past six years or so, and all of this debt will need to be rolled over as most companies do not have enough cash on hand or cash flow to manage paying it off in the next one to three years.

In these cases I typically resort back to, "Who has the power?"

As powerful as bankers are they're still rather vulnerable to things like M4s, drone strikes, etc.

Let's go back to the Hermit in the Woods analogy.
Say he's an unlikable fellow and we need to pay him to stay in the woods. We have $100 in our little economy and we print up $5 to give him. He accepts the $5 and stays in the woods.
This hermit is completely self sufficient and does not purchase anything from our little economy. He hunts on his land and sleeps in a hut. The money supply has increased 5% yet that money never really touches the economy in this case.
Say one day the hermit thinks, "What can I do with my $5 that doesn't involve spending it?" He puts on a deer pelt and walks into town. He approaches a banker and says, "Banker, I would like to invest my $5 in something so that it may grow." The banker obliges and invests the hermit's money in the local stock market. The stock market's price goes up relative to the $5 investment it has received and the hermit takes his certificate of investment back into the woods with him. The person who sold the investment that the banker bought with the hermit's money decides to sit on their newfound cash because they can't think of anything to spend it on right at this moment.
Now we have a situation where the price level is still unchanged, the money supply is still up 5%, and the stock market has also gone up by some amount.
It is in this way that money can be captured and kept out of the general economy. So long as that $5 is not spent on deer pelts or maize or what have you the price levels will not react to the increase in money supply.

Take it easy with the posting keys or recovery phrases stuff.
We're in the ~$3500 to ~4300 range right now. There was resistance here during the bull run and now we're finding some support at this same level. There was volume then, and there is volume now.
The next point where we hit some resistance during the last bull run was ~$2,000 to ~$2,800. We may end up in that range if we see another leg down. Again, a good bit of volume was traded in that price point during the bull run.
Past that it gets a little more interesting. We saw a previous ATH at around $1000, and then in the very early days of the previous bull run we saw resistance around ~$900 to ~$1200. There has been a lot of volume at this particular price point and I think it has potential to be a strong level of support in the event of dark days and a real risk-off situation in the wider markets.
I'd be really surprised if we dropped much below that ~$900 price point, but everything's off the table if we see a worldwide market collapse with the ensuing economic difficulties.
If the governments decide to try and inflate their way out of their problems, especially the US, I think we might see a huge rebound after the initial plunge.
Just some speculation on my part, though.

Taken from my post elsewhere, and in agreement with yours...
It is confusing, unfortunately for all of us.
Bitcoin Core is the reference software, aka node software, that defines Bitcoin as a currency and as a network.
Bitcoin Core = The reference software client, or "node", that defines Bitcoin.
Bitcoin = The network that Bitcoin Core defines.
Bitcoin ABC = The software client that defines Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash = A network that Bitcoin ABC defines.
In both of these the thing to remember is that there are miners and there are nodes. One needs the other to function.
A node validates the network.
A miner forges a block.
A node sees this new block and validates it.
If successful, the block is accepted by the nodes, and the next block begins.
Every complex system can be broken down into simple and discrete parts that are much easier to digest.

Theoretical adoption of LN:
If we want to on-board everybody in the world over the age of 14 into Lightning Network it will take approximately 84 years to do that on the Bitcoin ledger with Bitcoin throughput.
If we use Litecoin it will take about 17 years.

Litecoin has shown immense value as a test market for proposed changes to the system. Things that prove useful in Litecoin often get adopted into Bitcoin.

I can imagine both sorts of worlds - where BTC is the primary means of exchange, and a world where BTC is a value store and it is converted by local business into whatever local fiat they have to complete the sale.
A world where the BTC holder has to convert their BTC to local fiat will never work, as it is too easy to choke the btc/fiat pipeline that way. Businesses will then be faced with a decision to only accept fiat or only accept BTC. Strange.

No, TX represents total trades.

Consumer / merchant relationships are difficult.
It's also very difficult to show someone that they've been hurt by their own mistake. A lot of people will not acknowledge this. It is an attack on the ego.
It helps if they have someone other than the merchant to aim their inner upset at.
Maybe we should point them in Roger's direction?..
Edit: Here you go. People who send you bcash should ask Roger why their "bitcoin" aren't really "bitcoin."
Instead of "Why did **you** buy Bcash? It's not real bitcoin. **You** messed up."

This analysis ignores the levels of entropy for both address types.
If the level of entropy is the same for both address types, then the 34 character vs 90 character thing is largely moot.
We can see this in old wallets generated by a poorly written Java implementation. It created private keys with low entropy levels, and it is suggested that owners of those wallets abandon them and move to more secure methods of generation.
Edit: I can have a seeds of 123456789 and 987654321 and 147258369 and 963852741, but if the encryption algo only spits out 111222333 or 333222111 as possible keys from those seeds then it has low entropy.

Here we go.
"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period (quarterly or yearly) of time."
"In economics, any commodity which is produced and subsequently consumed by the consumer, to satisfy his current wants or needs, is a consumer good or final good. Consumer goods are goods that are ultimately consumed rather than used in the production of another good. For example, a microwave oven or a bicycle which is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, whereas the components which are sold to be used in those goods are called intermediate goods. For example, textiles or transistors which can be used to make some further goods."

No it doesn't.
Bitcoin's (BTC) current inflation rate is a steady 4%/yr. The next block reward halving will occur around May of 2020, which will reduce it to about 2% inflation.
Once all 21,000,000 coins are mined via block rewards there will be no more Bitcoins without a hard fork.
We can, however, subdivide into near-infinity.
Sub-Satoshi amounts are possible on Lightning Network currently, although the mainnet doesn't acknowledge such small quantities yet.

Volatility is inversely related to size.

It may not be that much compared to trade volume, but it is significant on a daily basis to generate that much new coin and for the market to absorb it gracefully at this price point after such a decline.
Also, it being a small % compared to that should reassure traders that manipulation via rates is off the table.
Then we get into the Fed rate forecasts, the deficit, the collective debt, distended market valuations, a continued pressure away from USD as the reserve currency of the world, RussiaGate, the on again / off again trade war with China, the new war threats in Syria, and all the other stuff we're seeing recently.

The article answers the question quite well:
For the average user - yes. Lightning Network will take care of this for typical transactions.
For miners - Maybe. Segwit is definitely an efficiency improvement for chainwork. LN allows a day, week, month, year, or lifetime's worth of transactions to bundle into a single on-chain tx fee.
This allows for 1,000tx's to share a single tx fee. $50/1000 = $0.05/tx + ln fees ultimately, while having $14,544,000/day in tx fees available to the miners.
This is more than the ~$13,000,000/day we see now @ 12.5btc + tx per block @ BTC $7000usd.

It's output within the context of a financial transfer.
However, all of these transactions are simply throughput in a financial system.
Financial transfers do not contribute to GDP directly.
UTXO is not a finished product that can be sold and consumed. It did not take any intermediary products to create.
In order for GDP to be created - a consumable finished good must be made.
We must take wood, an unfinished product, and make a chair. All the labor and mats that went into the chair count towards GDP when that chair is sold in the end market.
If two people trade their chairs, and one guy gives the other guy his chair leg back, they have not created a chair leg's worth of GDP...
Unless that chair leg is now used as a peg-leg for a pirate and resold as such, in which case it does count towards GDP in a weird way, but this is getting rather nuanced for this particular conversation.

The difficulty is declining along with the hash rate. I hash to heat my living space so a difficulty decline is good for me until it's warm again.
In a way this is a positive thing for the health of the price of bitcoin, too. As unprofitable miners pull out there is less frantic selling. If a miner only needs to sell 80% of his proceeds to cover his costs that's a 20% drop against a miner who needs to sell 100% of his mined coins in order to break-even. As the difficulty adjusts down to compensate for the loss of less efficient miners so too do the remaining miners increase their profitability also reducing selling pressure.
People worry about the offline miners attempting a 51%. As long as the least-efficient miners typically leave the mining space first this won't be much of an issue as the marginal cost to mine faster than the more efficient miners causes the effort to be more and more expensive. This reduces the economic incentive to attack the network significantly, and incentives are what the game is all about.
I'm disappointed that this post has received the amount of downvotes it has without any real discussion. It seems like has more critical discussion in the bitcoin space anymore if only because they have skin in the game and money on the line.

I tend to agree with your assessment.
Between quantitative easing, rising rates at the central banks, and the large amount of debt issued since the beginning of NZIRP in 2009 I think we could very well be heading towards some sort of liquidity crisis. If dollars get scarce defaults should increase which should drive markets down when combined with the almost certain downward revisions to forward earnings in such a climate.
Low markets coupled with high risk should drive people and funds towards high-grade bonds, treasuries, and cash. Even gold did not do well during the last recession, and only took off in the face of inflation worries due to central bank action.
I think Bitcoin could really shine in the event of a return to NZIRP and quantitative easing. From Jan/1978 to Jan/2008 the US monetary base grew at about 6%/yr, or $130B to $830B. From Jan/2008 to Aug/2014 the monetary base has grown at 27%/yr from $830B to $4,000B. From Aug/2014 to Oct/2018 the monetary base has shrunk roughly 3%/yr from $4,000B to about $3,500B.

There certainly is a chance of spiking up and out of the $3k to $5k range in the short-term, and it's only my opinion that we are more likely to trade sideways or leg down.
As every day passes the underlying utility of Bitcoin increases. It becomes easier to use, security flaws are found and patched, and the potential for adoption increases. When it is again Bitcoin's time in the spotlight it will be better equipped to cater to the needs of the audience, and I think we will see big things happen compared to what we see today.

Are you saying you think 4LTC to 1BTC is high? If so, I agree. I think there's a natural premium on Bitcoin v. Litecoin, or a natural discount if we want to think of it as Litecoin v. Bitcoin.
I can't see Litecoin being worth more than 20% of Litecoin + Bitcoin. So if the total worth is 100, and Litecoin is 20 of that value, and there are 4x as many Litecoin as Bitcoin then it comes out to 1/4 of 1/5 of a whole, or 1/20th, or 0.05. Thus it would take 20 Litecoin to equal one Bitcoin in value. At today's BTC price of $3700 that makes my speculated fair price $185 per LTC.

$3300 is a good deal, but $2100 is a better deal, and $900 is a crazy deal.
Let's say there's a 100% chance we'll see $3300 (we're already there), a 40% probability we'll see $2100, and a 5% probability we'll see $900. Why would I gamble my future on 5%?
No, what I'll do is keep some currency on the side and change my proportions as the price of Bitcoin declines. Say my cash to crypto ratio at $3300 is 50/50. If it goes to $2100 I may up that to 40% cash 60% crypto, and if it hits $900 I may go 20% cash 80% crypto.

I agree that the events you outline have a real chance of occurring. There are a few other possibilities, but as we roll on that series becomes more likely.
One thing I disagree with is your timeline. I think it's too condensed. These things take time to play out and I don't think 18 months is long enough. It will take time to get to a point where QE4 will be implemented, and it will take time for the increased money supply from QE4 to impact the markets. I could see 24 to 48 months being very possible before conditions favorable to a very large appreciation in Bitcoin's price emerge.
I think we will initially see a very large decline in the price of bitcoin at the outset of any given market collapse as people flee to cash and treasuries. They'll want liquidity in a world where liquidity is in crisis, as you said.

I'd like to share, and thank you for asking. It's all talk right now as far as the desalinization thing goes.
I apologize if this gets a bit rambly.
The anchor point for this idea is that bitcoin mining is still the primary aim. Beyond that any further waste heat recycling doesn't necessarily have to be very efficient to have a reasonable impact. If the initial setup and ongoing costs are low enough for the recycling system even a small revenue stream would ultimately improve the overall profit for the operator.
The water carrying capacity of air is not very high at 50C, but it increases exponentially up until 100C. If all I want to do is create irrigation water, sans salt and other non-evaporating impurities, then I think there's a good chance I can figure something out. I'm not entirely sure if there's any merit to creating potable water on a mass scale using this system, but I plan to explore it anyway through lab testing.
Building a Bitcoin farm in an area with cheap electricity, a nearby source of salt water, and a lack of fresh water is the ultimate idea for large-scale operation. Waste heat would be piped over the salt water where it would become humid and then fed into and underground condenser. A pump would bring the condensed water to the surface which would then be sold or used for typical irrigation or hydroponics.
Alternatively the condenser could be built above-ground with a separate cooling loop. The cooling loop would be a radiator connected to pipes driven into the Earth to act as a heatsink. Condensation would fall off the radiator into a collection basin.
The nearby body of salt water could also be used as a heatsink if it is cool enough.
If this system were built in a cold place I think construction could be simplified. A hydroponics greenhouse could be heated via waste heat, the cold air could be used to condense water out of the hot, humid exhaust, and the miners could be run full-tilt if desired without much issue as intake temps would be very accommodating.
I have other ideas to increase overall system efficiency but I won't go into those at this time as they present their own problems to sort out.

Agreed, especially with atomic swaps being a thing.
It's kinda wild to me that LTC trades at such a discount to big-daddy BTC. I think we're at 130LTC to 1BTC right now. Both are so similar and hold so much promise through that symbiotic relationship. I think 20:1 or 16:1 would be more reasonable, and that's still factoring in a significant discount to the 4:1 supply ratio.

Thanks for responding, and I like your points. I'd like to voice my thoughts on your comments.


IOER has done a good job of this.


This ignores interest coverage &amp; concentration of wealth. Velocity has not recovered over the past decade.


This doesn't jive with the prior money velocity comment, and is reflected in the still-low velocity figure. Maybe IOER is doing too good of a job? Low interest rates &amp; debt accumulation by people with pre-existing wealth who then use it to seek out yield?


There is a middle ground here in the fabled controlled landing scenario. I'm not sure such a delicate balancing act is reasonable to expect, though. Like you pointed out - almost any other outcome leads to pretty serious consequences.

This is exactly what I do every winter. I typically only run 720 to 1440 watts, though. If it gets down in the 20's I might have to run 2,880W to stay above 68F / 20C.

They could be blue, or green, or grey, or black, even!

People like to compare market movements to sine waves, exponential curves, and what-not. I thought it was fun in a novel way that there was such a resemblance between the market over the past fifteen months and a square wave.
I'm not suggesting anything more than, "The charts looked pretty." :P

Not in this setup. Salt water would be downstream of the exhaust. Intake would be ambient outside air run through a filter. It's important to keep the salt water away from anything important due to how incredibly corrosive and fouling it is.
The idea here is to make a lot of hot, humid air and then cool the air by some amount to squeeze the water out of it, thus leaving all the salt and other nastiness behind.
I've looked into water cooled ASICs but the way in which they go about it has never appealed to me. It would be ideal, though, as the chips themselves are often rated to near or just over 100C which would make some properly hot water in the right configuration. Chip -&gt; Waterblock -&gt; Water is very efficient. This hot water could be used in many more processes than the 50C to 60C water I can get with the chip -&gt; heatsink -&gt; air -&gt; heat exchanger -&gt; water situation.

This is for the hopium, brudda.
Personally? I think we might range between $3k and $5k for a bit before legging down to around $2k-$2.8k.
We miiiight leg down to around $1,000 after that, but I think it's more likely we'll climb out of the hole after we trade around $2k-$2.8k.
I'm thinking $200k-$300k in the next 24 to 48 months. \^_\^

Agreed. I'm looking forward to confidential transactions, etc, in Bitcoin and Litecoin.

I really like your post and I think that's the only thing I'd change about it.
Seriously though I'm trying to DCA while the price is low. Y'all do whatever you want.

I was in awe at how bad it was. It's a marvel.
It will be interesting to see if we all get to stand around and laugh at Kevin Drum years from now while we look back upon this monument to opinion.

Same to you.


So what's all this $3600 business for the past two weeks? And $6,000 for like two months prior to that?
What are your thoughts on Bitcoin's price action in the event of a significant market downturn and accompanying risk-off environment?


I think we'll be in the $X00,000's sometime between 2020 and 2024.
