On paper.

If everyone stops, that would make the price pretty close to zero. Actually just zero.

I understood almost nothing of what you just said sorry.

It's the sender address that's visible.

Yes, bip148 "creates a split" even if it's literally 1 node. Nothing changes between two nodes and the majority of them.

I think we all assume they do. It’s just pointless not to.

must be another typo

PoW has a different purpose that I don’t entirely understand. It definitely doesn’t do anything like checking validity of transactions.

If you found it by chance then it doesn’t mean much. But if you publish a collision, there’s a certain possibility that you know a better way, so people will react as if it’s broken. Saying “It was random” doesn’t even matter, maybe you’re lying, or don’t understand what you did well enough to see that it wasn’t random.

It’s evidence that there’s nothing weird in the algorithm, people would cry foul if it never happened.
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:48:33
well that’s definitely a wrong idea

Are you sure you didn't know this before creating the thread?

The freshly minted coins come pre-sliced. No such thing as a whole coin? Although a transaction that assembles a lot of tiny pieces into one UTXO is a thing... 
Basically you can buy coins that haven’t been used before (from pools) and little UTXOs are effectively little pieces of a coin but there’s no difference in practice between a whole coin and a bunch of shards because all transactions work by burning the whole lot and recreating the amount in one piece.
tldr: you control that by withdrawing 1 btc instead of withdrawing 0.2 btc five times.

To speed it up, use an SSD, get more RAM and configure the cache size.

It's tricky because the potato doesn't do that. The energy comes from these metal rods, they get used up faster than the potato spoils. You can cut a potato in 3 pieces and get 3 times the energy, since you would use 3 times as much metal.

Oh, you mean how much would 1 billion buy move the price. Naively it would be a ~$60 move (1%), but it doesn’t work like that.

Miners have a node.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:42:27


Miners make the blocks. They decide what the block will look like, they are free to never include any transactions, or include only transactions that pay 30 times the average fee. There is no official block that miners have to look for.




No. Every block includes a reward transaction. The miner chooses the address and the amount (up to a limit), that’s how they get paid. If the block is rejected, that transaction never gets confirmed (and contrary to normal transactions that need 1 (or 0) confirmation, the reward transaction needs *a lot* of confirmations).
