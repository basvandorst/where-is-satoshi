Yeah I have 2x GTX 980 and they "mine" about 17 cents both, so your 1060 3Gb is more powerfull then one of my GTX980, but anyway the profit estimation seems right.

all that hype around BTC is gone, most people think it is a bubble and a lot of them are 100% sure it is a bubble, so people stopped searching for it.

Ok that means running my small coffee shop with LN-payments won't be easy :) without public IP

good idea is to invest in mining instead, since the hashrate has dropped very much last month. and all btc mining hardware costs very little right now, when the price pumps again so will the hardware cost and you will effectively sell the hardware to cover all electricity costs

Sure, new asics will be on market, but old ones can still be sold for good price once they become profitable. This already happened when s9 came out and the price boomed and older s7 could still mine a $5-$7 per day

So you saved on beer to buy some btc?

This is from a movie where Bogdanoff is trying to make a trader do a suicide while manipulating btc exchange rate

Bitcoin will survive, I'm sure, the developers' team will find a solution, and who knows maybe encryption algorythms will evolve as well...

There's nothing mentioned in this guide about the public IP that I need to obtain from my ISP for LN-node to successfully function on my raspberry PI...
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:28:20
To buy more?))
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:50:40
That's cool, we have plenty of time ahead to buy more btc while it is so low
