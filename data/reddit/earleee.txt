via this thread: 
tl;dr: Never use a wallet you can't trust. Even offline wallets can leak your secrets through the transactions.

The point is: If it isn't useful information, it wasn't useful information with classic Bitcoin to begin with.

I neither said that, nor did I imply anything of that kind. I said that Zerocoin has a relative proof.


Stealth addresses don't even have a relative proof.
EDIT: Even on the contrary: Stealth addresses have obviously no advantage over regular one-time addresses.


To use coinjoin you have to find some other users and make arrangements with them. With zerocoin you get the same without the need of talking to anybody else. (Other people have to use zerocoin as well, but nobody has to arrange anything and you don't have to do it at the same time. Your zerocoins get mixed up with coins from the beginning of zerocoin until the block where you spend yours, which will be most likely much, much more than any practical coinjoin application will ever have.)




Direct mapping of addresses to real people is not a requirement to extract information from the transaction graph, don't you get it?

Same was true for Bitcoin without stealth addresses. That is pseudonymity, not anonymity.
Shaddow addresses seem to improve pseudonymity, but they do not bring anonymity. With zerocoin, you provably do not know where a coin comes from, but still have a cryptographic quarantee, that nobody creates coins from thin air.

My argument was not about locking up coins. The problem is: You mix your coins only with coins from other users who use the mixer withing a few minutes, which means you mix it only with few users.

You don't know which person belongs to an address. but you know which addresses are related, because they appear in transactions. For every coin input in a transaction you have to tell where your coin comes from.
Only Zerocoin breaks this link.

You seem to imply that an attacker would have to exactly know which address belongs to whom to analyze social networks of people. You simply cannot assume that. He might just group addresses that show patterns etc.

This is not how you do serious security engineering. You can't just say: "I don't know how to extract information from this, thus the attacker can't." That's faulty reasoning. An attacker can use over 9000 ways of extracting information that you never heard of.
You have to /prove/, that no information is leaking. Zerocoin does that. The Zerocoin paper mathematically proves in a nutshell:
"If an attacker can break the anonymity in zerocoin, then he can use this very attack to break several encryption schemes that everybody believes to be secure."
And zerocoin defines anonymity in a formal sense. If there are two zerocoins minted, and one spend, the probability that an attacker can tell whether the source is the one or the other minted coin, is negligible. (This means the probability is exponentially small and not useful for any attack.)

Yes, but the attack is different. It is not just leaking private data, in addition it guarantees that nobody except the attacker can detect the leak. For everybody else it provably looks like random choices of k.
