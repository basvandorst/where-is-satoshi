In fairness, lead and iron have intrinsic trading value:  They are commodities that are highly valuable to manufacture products.
Gold's value is derived solely by rarity, and appearance.  More or less by luck.
USD (And fiat) derives it's value as a credit note:  The issuing organization will pay you for it (ie, by reducing your debt to the organization, for example).  The USD is a strong currency, because we MUST honor all debts as a nation.  The US cannot default on its debts, constitutionally.
I'm still trying to figure out what backs Bitcoin.  Saying "the blockchain" is silly.  I cannot eat a block chain.  I cannot use a blockchain to manufacture something.  It's not backed by any nation's full faith and credit.

Your problem:  I can always sell the apple pie.  There's always a market for it.  I still have my pie.  You stole nothing from me.
Yes.  It might suck that you backed out of the deal.  Hell, I might stop agreeing to sell to you.  But, it's hardly "theft".  Theft is when you take something that doesn't belong to you.

Starting to think?  I thought it was rather obvious from the get-go.

True, in isolation, that's all it means.  And, yes, it had to do with people questioning the validity of debts racked up by the states during the time of the AoC.  And, when read with the 14th amendment:


We cannot, constitutionally, default on our debt.  Which is why our currency is considered the world reserve currency.  Our debt is way better than anyone elses, since we are required to repay constitutionally.

Nothing was stolen.  Money never changed hands, and BTC's never changed hands.  This was merely one party of a transaction acting as a rational actor.

Or, you're not reading enough?  That clause was added in response to France's concern we would default on debts incurred under the AoC.  Hence "full faith and **credit** clause".

If so, his defense team did a poor job during jury selection...

Sorry, I don't consider that you stealing from me.  I still have my apple pie, and you still have your money.  I've not lost any value at all, since I still have a pie.  Value only comes at the time where money/goods changes hands.  Until then, it's vapor.
Rational self interest and all.

Because currencies are generally not held onto for long stretches of time, and are "sold" daily.

"Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereo" - Article IV, Section 1.

It is backed because the US government is constitutionally bound to honor all debts.

So, the poster above never recieved any BTC?
Can I consider you stealing from me if you say you want an apple pie, and I go and get it, then you change you mind?  Did you steal $7.50 from me in that instance?
No!  You never took the apple pie, and I never got any money.

TOR is an EFF project:

If you cannot see where it says the US cannot default on it's debt, I don't know what else I can tell you.  It's there, in simple English, clarified by a later amendment even.
The US is the world reserve currency, because we cannot default on our debt, which lends us the best credit ratings on our currency.  Pure and simple.
I hope China would become the world reserve currency.  Then, all of our debt they own written in USD can simple be inflated out of existence, and then immediately deflated after payment.  We'd be able to completely destroy their economy, and cause no further ramifications to the rest of the globe.

Yes, it was.  But, it's open sourced, and ran by the EFF, so I'm not sure why you would even use the originator as cause to imply government agents? A !--&gt; B
