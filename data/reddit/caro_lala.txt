You shouldn't assume that Ross was DPR, or that he was the only DPR. The defense has always maintained that Ross created SR, but was not the one operating it continuously.
Various [evidence of multiple DPRs]( including someone who logged into a DPR account while Ross was in prison.

You don't seem to know much about the case. Ross did not "profit" from anything. It's common knowledge he was living a frugal lifestyle, and didn't even have a car. 
Don't read Wikipedia or Fakenews if you want to learn about the case. 
Give it a try and check [FreeRoss.org]( Everything is backed up with a reference. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:20:07
If you had taken the time to check [FreeRoss.org]( you would have noticed that every page contains dozens of **footnotes**. Everything is backed up with a reference. "Own research" by reading what? Wikipedia or some hit-piece from Wired?
You can't possibly think that the judge was right to sentence a young first-time offender with all non-violent offenses to **die** in prison.
Anyone who remotely followed the trial agrees that it was a travesty of justice: all mention of the corruption hidden from the jury, favorable evidence forbidden, defense deprived of key materials, blocked defense witnesses, blocked cross-examination (especially the agent who worked on Ross's laptop at the arrest scene and the lead govt investigator who, for 2 years, never identified Ross as the operator), Ross not allowed to acknowledge his family in the presence of the jury, the judge's reliance on uncharged allegations to justify her barbaric sentence, and much more.
If you don't have to time to read the facts, you should at least check the ever-growing list of well-respected [organizations and imminent figures]( who support Ross. That list is undeniably impressive, and clearly shows that Ross deserves a 2nd chance at some point.

These accusations were trumpeted by the govt right after Ross's arrest, yet they were **never** prosecuted, **never** part of his charges at trial (all his [charges]( at trial were non-violent), and later **dismissed** entirely "with prejudice." It's sad how the  media ran with the murder narrative without digging deeper.
Singlehandedly, these allegations destroyed Ross's public image, biased his jurors and because of them, people think it's okay for a young first-time offender to die in prison. 
Ross had always said he had nothing to do with these anonymous online chats. The govt was never able to prove he authored them. Carl Force, corrupt agent now in prison, had admin access to the site and was admittedly heavily involved in numerous shady plots. Even the alleged victim, Curtis Green, is a big supporter of Ross and publicly stated that Ross is not violent. More info and links and screenshots [here]( 


@_date: 2019-02-13 20:48:03
In the U.S Federal system, sadly it does. The possibility of parole was eliminated in 1987. There's no parole or any "good behavior" type of release. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:30:39
These allegations relied entirely on online, anonymous chats. Ross has always **denied** the accusations and the govt **never** brought the charges to trial (Ross was sentenced on all [non-violent counts](
The govt trumpeted these allegations to destroy Ross's public image in the media right after his arrest. If they were certain Ross was guilty, why leave these allegations unprosecuted for years and then later DISMISS them "with prejudice" (meaning these accusations can never be used against him again) ?
**Since when do people get a free pass on attempted murder when there is tangible proof they're guilty?**
**Carl Force**, corrupt agent now in prison, had admin access to the site and was admittedly heavily involved in numerous shady plots (one involving a hit on an admin). Even the alleged victim, **Curtis Green**, is a big supporter of Ross and publicly [stated]( that Ross is not violent. He even [stated](


**Serrin Turner**, the govt prosecutor, addressed the jury on the last day of trial:






Please, read about the case, dig deeper.  For a thorough narrative based on over 400 references, including documents you don't even know exist, read or watch [FreeRoss.org/railroaded](
*And for the sake of the argument, even if Ross had anything to do with these commissioned hits (which never took place), since when does that carry 2 LIFE + 40 years? Wouldn't 10 or 20 years been enough? Why do most murderers, rapists and child molesters get less? )*
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:00:42
When you present a clemency package to the Office of the Pardon Attorney and you include a petition with hundred thousands of signatures, that helps tremendously. Many Change.org petitions helped free non-violent offenders.
Alice Johnson, Cintoya Brown, Ricky G Minor, Timothy Tyler and more all had clemency petitions on [Change.org](
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:09:21
Clarification: Ross did not sell drugs. He started a platform where **consenting** adults chose to exchange **both** legal &amp; illegal items. Big difference. 
Non-violent offenders should be afforded the opportunity of redemption. Locking them in cages for decades is not the answer.
Ross is supported by close to 100 eminent organizations &amp; individuals. They all know about the case intricacies.
People who think Ross deserves 2 LIFE + 40 yrs don't know about the case and have read too much    [
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:04:40


Why don't you just read 
Everything is on there. 
“Of the six murder indictments trumpeted by the U.S. government in the days following Ross’s arrest, five have fallen off the table and the sixth sits untouched in a separate indictment (legalese for an unproven allegation) that was purposefully left out of the trial.” 
That one Maryland charge has been untouched for years, and it's about the staged murder of Curtis Green (who has publicly stated he doesn't think Ross ordered a hit on anyone). 
The other murder-for-hire allegations were never charged.
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:04:47
\- USP Tucson wasn't Ross 2nd choice. It was a recommendation from Judge Forrest.
\- USP Tucson has sex offenders as well as non-violent inmates who can't be safe in other penitentiaries where violence, blood and extortion are part of the day-to-day life.
Please consider signing his [petition for clemency]( We're hoping to get a sentence reduction or a commutation. 
Over **120,000** people have signed in just a few months. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:08:09
Yes. A life sentence is a PSF and even if you have a very low security score like Ross, it automatically puts you in a high security prison. If Ross had been sentenced to 10 years, or if his PSF was waived, Ross would qualify for a low-security prison. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:37:05
Ross was never charged, nor sentenced for these murder-for-hire allegations. If it was true, if the Gov had the evidence, why didn't they bring the charges to trial ? These allegations smeared Ross's name and denied him bail, which is exactly what the prosecution was aiming for. Please read freeross.org/making-a-murderer/
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:52:07
No. The government doesn't drop murder charges just in case they need them for later. Do you know of any criminal case where they did that ? If they had the proof, if they knew for sure Ross had ordered the hits, they would have formally charged him (Ross went to trial for drug charges only) These murder-for-hire allegations were conveniently announced the night before Ross's bail hearing. Interesting timing, isn't it ? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:25:40
What do you mean "you can't read that for sure" ? 
There is NO mfh charge in the NY indictment. And the govt kept the Maryland indictment pending for 5 years without prosecuting it for lack of proof, and now that Ross ran out of appeals, the govt conveniently dismissed it.

Thanks for saying this. After all these years, i still find it unbelievable how some guys are just simply hating on Ross.  They barely know anything about the intricacies of the case, all they did was read a few sensationalized news articles, yet they are certain he is a murderer and a drug lord who deserve to die in prison.

Do you even know that the most common transactions on SR were "generally rather small (e.g., a few grams of marijuana)" ?  (proof: [working paper]( from Carnegie Mellon University, page 12)
You realize Ross wasn't actually the one selling drugs, right? He created a platform where others did. Big difference. The biggest drug dealers on SR got between [5 and 10 years.](
Even if Ross was a "drug lord", are you aware that he still got [more time than the biggest, ruthless kingpins]( out there? Some of those kingpins peddled **tons** of drugs for **decades**, yet their sentence doesn't even come close to Ross's.
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:19:32
The government filed a motion to [dismiss the murder-for-hire indictment]( on 7/20/18 and it was **officially dropped** on 7/26.
These murder allegations were **never proven**, and not even part of Ross's charges at trial. All Ross's charges at trial were **non-violent**.  These allegations were used to deny Ross bail, smear him in the media, bias his jurors and justify the sentence he got.
The govt was **never able to prove** Ross authored any of these anonymous online chats, especially since there's proof there was more than one DPR and corrupt agents (now in prison) had admin access and admittedly took over accounts.
To humor you, even if Ross had tried to get people killed, he is still getting [WAY more time]( than the most violent kingpins out there.
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:34:45
Exactly. Ross, *a first-time offender*, who did not sell drugs himself (he created a platform where others did) got more time than violent, ruthless drug cartel leaders. For anyone interested in seeing a comparison in terms of sentences, you can read [this](
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:21:24
Not true. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:11:45
Ross is in a MAXIMUM security penitentiary that is known for housing violent gang members and dangerous inmates. Every day he has to think about his safety. His cell is the size of your bathroom. He is condemned to spend the rest of his life in prison. And you're lecturing me about Snowden and Assange and the Cypherpunk movement? TF you're talking about here? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:09:00
Trump said he will keep on pardoning more non-violent drug offenders, there's hope for Ross, especially given how many people are signing his petition each day. 
Also, let's not forget, Ross and Trump share a few common "ennemies". Trump fired Bharara, publicly makes fun of Schumer (Cryin' Schumer) and has history with Forrest. He could genuinely be interested in showing Ross some clemency knowing this would be a blow to them all. ([ 
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:09:44
Without the background story, if I give you a straight answer, you're probably going to say it's bull\*\*\*.
Yes, Ross was framed to take the fall for the whole operation of SR whereas it's common knowledge there were multiple DPRs (just from a technical perspective, Ross did not have the skills to maintain a site like SR by himself. A government witness actually testified at trial that Ross passed the torch early on). Just take a look at [chapter 11]( and you'll get a better sense of how the evidence from the laptop was produced. It's outrageous. Chapter 11 is a short read, you should really give it a try since you seem curious.
Ps: this is not a manifesto. This is some investigative work that took almost up to a year to put together by a whole team. A lot of the references are never-seen-before documents from the government. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:32:57
Ross was actually 26 yo when he created the site.
As he wrote in his [sentencing letter]( to his judge:


For those who want to read more, you should really check out [Railroaded]( It's a comprehensive narrative of all the available evidence surrounding the creation, investigation and shutdown of SR, and the prosecution of Ross Ulbricht. It reveals **behind-the-scene info** that most people have never heard before.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:27:50
Accusations never part of the charges at trial. 
Funny how the govt trumpeted these accusations to deny him bail and utterly destroy his public image, and then quietly dismissed them \*with prejudice\* (meaning they can never be filed again) 5 years later. 
More info [here]( 
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:24:06
The whole story is crazy and full of twists. If you're really interested, check out [Railroaded]( It's based on hundreds of pages of documents that most people don't know exist. Everything is backed up with a reference (over 400 total). From the investigation to the sentencing, it's just mind-blowing.
