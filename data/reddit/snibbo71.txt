Blockchain.info and Coinify are hardly small potatoes vendors and were initially recommended when I first looked into converting from fiat to bitcoin.
Bitcoin itself might be fine but if people can't convert from fiat how will it reach adoption?
And I have to have it some web wallet to start with and then move to a proper wallet - unless you have some way of converting from fiat to bitcoin without using the web?

But I can actually spell amateurs..

Hehehe, you certainly have a point there lately ;)

Funny :)

I think that's exactly the point. If it needs the level of knowledge that it clearly does in order to use it, you won't see mass adoption.
You can blame me and my ignorance all you like, the majority of the mass population are as ignorant or more than I am and this experience highlights for me why mass adoption is still a very long way off...
But carry on blaming the user, that'll help them.

Thanks, I'll check out bittylicious - I still think it's going to be a while before mass adoption occurs after my experience today. I've got some BitCoin and DigiBytes from over a year ago, but it's still too hard for the average person to interface with ( noting the headache I've now got from trying to talk my partner through using a "bullshit small potatoes vendor - nice way for the other poster to endear the community to normal people too..." ).
And not using a web wallet but setting up BitCoin Core on an average person's machine isn't an option either. (Though my DigiBytes aren't on a web wallet or exchange :))
