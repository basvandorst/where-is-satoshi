Lol, pathetic attempt to revive a dead copy-cat coin. 
Look at LTC's ratio, it has been dropping like a rock (the rock that LTC is) for years. It hit a new ATL earlier today, and price struggles to keep at $4.
I have shorted the shit out of Litecoin on okcoin. I expect the ratio to drop further, to 0.003 at least, and price to drop to lower $3 and upper $2 levels.
Also, almost none of the miners support SegWit, so this hype is fake anyway. Coblee bashed his own coin earlier today, stating that it's a pathetic Bitcoin copy (check his Twitter feed).
LTC's dead is long overdue. 
The next major crash will happen within 2-4 weeks. I strongly advice against buying and holding LTC, let alone longing it on leverage.
LTC is dead.

Stable for a year, while ratio is dropping. 
Also, a few months ago it went sub $3 USD.
Litecoin is dead. That is, for speculative purposes. It will NEVER rise like it used to. Those days are gone and nothing, not even SegWit activation within 2 weeks, will help it recover to previous ratio/fiat value.

It wont go up and I have added enough margin for not being margin called until $4.91 on quarterlies. I will sleep comfy.

Won't go anywhere. If you look at long term chart, you can see it's only ben going down since the last pump, which was almost 2 years ago. Coblee is also manipulating the shit out of it, which isn't really helping (look at his pump tweets, and look how LTC performed shortly afterwards, has happened multiple times in the past).
LTC is a dead coin. I have no idea why it even has such a relatively large market cap, I don't think anyone is buying it. I expect a big crash soon, I have shorted it on 20x leverage on OKC.
