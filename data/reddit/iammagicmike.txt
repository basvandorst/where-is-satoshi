Also, i believe the terms indicate that Robocoin can change the fixed 30% fee whenever they want.
I think the annual maintenance subscription is optional, but if you ever need maintenance say....6 months later, you are billed the 6 months that you didn't pay.

Coinbase charges a minimal fee, I haven't used Circle but if I understand correctly, they charge fees that are very similar to coinbase's fees.  I believe that **currently** they are charging the slightest bit less than Coinbase, but you need to get an invite from Circle to become a user and I've been waiting for one for months.  
So Coinbase is your best option.  I totally understand you're logic "credit cards are cheaper".  My advice, make a coinbase account and start going through the long process of verifying your account up to the highest level (i believe it's level 2 and you start at level 0).  You'll need to provide a lot of personal data, but it's worth it.  
Also, until you're level 2 with coinbase, you won't be able to buy anything instantly - you'll have to wait 1 week before you receive your coins.  
Finally - other alternatives are to use an exchange.  If you are unfamiliar with exchanges then you'll have to transfer USD from your bank account into your exchange account (not unlike if you were buying stocks).  After the 3 or so business days your money will be in the account and you can trade with that cash.  Once traded for BTC you'll be able to withdraw the coins almost instantly.  
**tl;dr - if you need coins before november, just look for someone on localbitcoins with good reviews, pay their fee, and thank them for providing a service that not many people currently offer**
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:00:04
I think you are probably correct.  I found this thread on google
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:48:08


10%-20% is about the standard markup that you'll find on localbitcoin.  One thing that you have to understand is that **the reason** that you pay this markup is **because they are providing a service to you**.  
For example, when an electrician comes over to install an overhead light and wall switch for you, you paid him $350.  But the switch and wires only cost $15....you are paying for his time, reputation, **and his experience**.  If you knew how to install it then you could have paid $15 and done it yourself.  
Just accept the fact that you'll have to pay a markup, because this other person knows how to get bitcoin (either he mines it, trades it, or just buys it from coinbase).  You need coins, he has coins, but why would he sell them to you at cost?  **One of the only reasons someone will sell at cost is if they are in need of liquidating some coins into cash suddenly - like for an unexpected bill.**  
If reducing the markup cost is most important to you, then I suggest you appeal to the sellers that have a sudden need to sell coins.  You can do this easily by making a localbitcoin account and then posting a **BUY AD** - this just says "I'm interested in giving you my cash for your bitcoin at $XXX.XX price"  You can set the price on your own.  
From here, someone may contact you when they want to sell right away and if they agree to your price. 
If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.

I've sold a few bitcoins on Localbitcoins.  Occasionally, I have a fella who will question my price.  
"Why are you selling them for $950 when they cost $900 on MtGox?"
I usually answer, "because you **can't buy them on MtGox!**  I have ways to buy bitcoins, which I am happy to sell to you, but it wouldn't be worth my time or my risk to sell them at cost"
And usually this is a much longer, time wasting, conversation.  Some people understand, some people think I'm just trying to rip them off.  The bottom line is, if you want to buy them from me, or from coinbase, or wherever, you'll have to pay the respective asking price.  Otherwise, find somewhere else to buy them.

**THIS** I make it a habit to always check the last few and first few characters. If I'm working with a friend, I refuse to send until they read post of their address to me out loud as well. 
Some people ask me "can you send it to my address I sent you last time?" 
I always make then send it and read part of the address again, even if it's the same one. Even if it's on a phone, computer, etc.

"you'll have to forgive me, but this sounds like a pyramid scheme, so I won't even consider it until I have time to study this service"

@_date: 2014-09-18 19:15:51
That's not really a summary of what I said. I apologize if you became confused. Allow me to explain a bit further. 
Currently op is looking at "sell" ads. This is when someone with bitcoin wants to sell coins at a markup that the seller decides. When op sees this ad he will decide if he wants to pay that price. 
But there are also "buy" ads. These are basically the opposite. The **BUYER (this would be op)** would post "I'm willing to pay $xxx for btc". Thus way the person selling coins can decide if they want to take that price or not. I, in no way, meant to imply that you should take advantage of "poor people with btc". 
An example of an unexpected bill could be the need to replace a furnace just as much as it could be the desire to buy a big screen tv asap. I'm sorry for confusing you.

it's hard to NOT have this mentality.  If you don't understand how bitcoin works, it can extremely stressful for a newbie.  **My advice:** Find someone that will meet you in person and pay with cash.  If you are worried about scams, then you can mitigate the majority of that risk by paying a premium to someone that accepts cash in person.

I recognize that you may have a different experience than me. I've noticed in my area that 10% is usually on the low end for **cash in person transactions**. This may admittedly be due to low competition, but I am still correct in my observations. I hope that you or op experiences lower prices but I'm just reporting my findings.

The top comment is currently a legitimate question that was asked in a respectful way. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:27:04
i understand that.  what I didn't understand was if I planned on using Armory exclusively, rather than using Bitcoin-QT exclusively as I was doing until now, would I need to keep **both copies of the blockchain**.  I mentioned that both Bitcoin-QT downloaded a 30 gb copy of the blockchain AND Armory downloaded a separate 30 gb copy of the blockchain.  I didn't think that I needed both copies if i was only planning on using armory.  
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:01:01
that's so confusing.  thanks for explaining - i don't understand why each needs the same copy of the blockchain, that doesn't make any sense to me.  does Electrum work the same way?

We live in the US, so we quote price in USD.  The apps we use (mycelium, blockchain, coinbase) all can quote in USD.  So you can say "Hey Schmiddy, send me $50 in BTC" and schmiddy will type in $50 into the app.  The app will use the most up to date exchange rate and do the math for you.
I'll take it for gas money, pizza, camping trips (everyone owes $45, pay me in cash or bitcoin), etc.  And since we're so often online it's easier to pay now than trying to remember to bring me cash at a later point.  Additionally, it's easier to pay digitally than to run out to the atm.  
You can achieve the same with paypal.  The experience for the end user is very similar to using paypal.  I'll accept paypal from my other friends as well.   
Naturally, this only works because a dozen (or so) of my friends bought bitcoin (and some are continuing to buy bitcoin every week).  
I try to buy $25/month, so when I collect payment in btc, that accomplishes my monthly purchase.  When buying from a site like coinbase, they charge a small fee (1% i think) so I would always prefer to collect bitcoin as payment at current rates.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:23:30
yes it is working for me now
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:28:17
so it's not just me then
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:56:59
you **can** absolutely have a very secure wallet and send payments without concerns of your identity being revealed.  This is not something that I stress to a newbie right off the bat though.  As I mentioned I just want them to become familiar with using Bitcoin before I explain things further.  Small amounts (like gas and pizza money) aren't terribly important to keep masked.  
When it's comes to keeping your identity secret, there are certainly ways to do this, but unless you are mindful of these methods then you should consider your transactions public.  Now when I say public, it just broadcasts the date, time, amount of bitcoin, sending bitcoin wallet, receiving wallet, and ip address.  This is hardly enough details to connect someone with, for example, a criminal offense.  However, it can certainly look suspicious.  
Now, if you use a service that collects your personally identifiable information (like coinbase) then those wallets CAN certainly indicate that you sent the money.  
I tell my friends that bitcoin is not 100% anonymous, but rather it makes it considerably more difficult to track certain financial transactions.  
So, to answer your question, I would have to say that YES using the app usually eliminates that advantage.  But there is always a way to reclaim that advantage, if you know what to do.  
@_date: 2015-07-21 13:54:27
thanks, that sounds like a good plan to me.  
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:49:35
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:47:38
it's a bit like the matrix, nobody can be told what bitcoin is, you have to experience it for yourself.  
I've given small amounts to friends and family that were curious about it just to show them how it works.  I don't explain anything until after I've sent them $1, then as I walk them through sending me $1 back, they've experienced it more than any explanation could.  
Still, it's rather difficult to "convince" someone to use it.  People need to have a reason to learn something new.  Most of my friends got into because I sold them on the rising price of the coin, but then when I started accepted their bitcoins rather than cash or paypal they really were sold on the idea.

@_date: 2013-12-23 14:12:42
So, as long as I didn't create any new addresses, then I could have this usb stick buried in a coffee can in the ground and still send or receive coins on my PC client?  
This would protect me from a computer crash, but not from theft (as in somebody hacking my pc and sending the coins to themselves).
Is this correct or did I miss something?

I don't believe that they are, technically, violating contracts.  Perhaps they are, but I assumed that the conditions upon purchase was "you'll receive the unit based on when you purchased it - AFTER we eventually ship."
They never commit to a ship date and so it's tough to say that they are in breach of contract.

Actually I printed 3 copies from my non-network connected PC/printer.  They don't need my public address, they all have half of my private key.  
* 1 full copy I keep in my fireproof lock box
The other 2 copies are cut into halves.  Half 1 and Half 2 and Half A and Half B.  
* Friend 1 = Half 1
* Friend 2 = Half 2
* Friend 3 = Half A
* Friend 4 = Half B
I cut them in half in different ways so Half 1 + Half B **may not** have the complete key.  I didn't spend too much time messing around with the cuts.  I have 3 copies of the private key total split between 5 people (myself + 4 friends).  
This way, if my house burns down and my friends are absent minded, I have a backup of my backup.

@_date: 2013-03-06 23:57:52
because they require payment upfront and many people that invested hundreds or thousands of dollars last summer were promised a delivery of early fall (at least i think).  These still have not been delivered, so even if BFL did ship, you would be last to receive them after all of these other people that have waited.
EDIT: and from what I understand, they are not very easy to communicate with and even more difficult to get a refund from.  You basically agree when you pay them that you don't care when you receive the unit, so you may get it in 2014 when it is worthless.

I feel, and I think many people agree with this, that while BTC is huge and popular and gaining momentum, it is still the first cryptocurrency (or at least the first one with such popularity). 
will BTC still as popular in 10 years as it is today? Maybe, maybe not.  Will some sort of Cryptocurrency be as popular as BTC in 10 years?  ABSOLUTELY!  
someone compared cryptocurrencies to social media.  BTC might be friendster or myspace.  So maybe Litecoin is facebook and TRC is google plus.  
I'm certain that Bremmer did not make that claim because of the reason I just explained, but he may actually be correct.

I'm responsible for one of the tied up, unpaid orders. I added it to my cart and couldn't pay within the 15 minute time limit (I had to wait an hour). By the time I could send payment, the "pay to" address was gone. 
I put in a ticket expressing my desire to continue this purchase and received no response. About an hour later I noticed that stock was available again and I pounced like a fat guy on a cupcake.  
I updated the ticket explaining that I had just placed a new order and to cancel the "on hold" order. So far, it hasn't updated yet. Oh well.

[Zagaberoo]( is absolutely correct and is commenting professionally despite the fact that [Vibr8gKiwi]( is crying about his problems with Coinbase as if [Zagaberoo]( is responsible for the **lost opportunity**.  
I remember when BTC was $13/$16/$18/$20 because I bought some BTC back then at those prices.  I didn't use coinbase, I used bitinstant/mtgox.  No lost opportunity there.  I think the lesson learned here is that you shouldn't rely on only one service when you are looking to strategically buy/sell BTC.
Hold on, let me type this so [Vibr8gKiwi]( will actually read it:

it says "ATX power supply" so I assumed it's a simple power supply.  I'll be getting my batch 2 order once they start shipping on 15 APRIL.  Batch 2 didn't have the option to order with or without the PSU so mine will have it.
I figured I'd pop it open and take a quick look-see and figure out what I need to buy.  AVALON suggested that you buy without the PSU to expedite shipping through customs.  Sounded like a safe bet to me.

I don't mind the downvotes, I comment with this a lot, on several BFL posts.  It makes me giggle.  If you ever get the chance to watch the Total Recall DVD, turn on [the director's commentary]( it is hysterical!  
I think that the dvd was released 10 years after the movie, so the director and Arnold got together to record the commentary.  This was still a fairly new concept and Arnold didn't quite understand the purpose.  He thought they were supposed to explain the movie while you watch it.  
I've watched the whole movie with the commentary and it was magical.  I love Arnold.

thanks for the good reply.  I have heard of the 'mixing' services, and that sounds just fine and dandy.  The purpose of my question was to consider a world where government regulation caused BTC to be black market only. I understand that, in this world, BTC could survive, but it would be limited (companies could not accept BTC as official payment).  
So if I had coins at one wallet on a spare computer that was encrypted with 5 BTC and I wanted to send it to a friend, I didn't want the coin to be traced back to me.  I understand that when I send BTC my ip address is recorded w/ the transaction data on the public ledger.  This is something that I may wish to avoid in this situation.  
So it sounds like physically delivering the wallet.dat file would work to protect my ip address and thus my anonymity, even though it isn't a very practical method.  
Thanks again for your input.  I've learned so much by asking questions on this sub, there are so many helpful people.

* I try to make of habit of buying anything I can with Bitcoin.  Now I have very limited Bitcoins that I am holding (let's say I am holding 10 BTC) and I would like to keep 10 at all times.  
* So I wanted to buy something on Amazon with my USD, NOT my BTC balance.  It was $50.  So I went to bitmit and bought $50 worth of Amazon gift cards with BTC.  Let's just say that this was when BTC = $100 USD, so I spent 0.5 BTC and only have 9.5 BTC out of the 10 that I wish to hold.
* As soon as I bought the gift cards, I bought 0.5 BTC through coinbase to replace the coins that I spent.  
* This is basically how I hold AND spend my coins.

Okay, now I'm a little confused.  I certainly understand that I could be mistaken.  If you don't mind, I'd really love to take this opportunity to learn a little bit more (because we can NEVER be secure enough).
* In the last year I've spent some time playing around with PGP encryption.  I installed GPG4win on my PC and created a private key with my very long passphrase which generated a public key.
* My **private key** is a file on my PC that I can unlock with my **passphrase** in order to decrypt any messages that someone has sent to me that was encrypted with my **public key**
* I always thought of paper wallets in a similar way, while understanding that it is not exactly the same.  
I have only used my aforementioned method of securing and safely backing up my coins as a one way street.  I only send coins **into** the generated address.  If I had to remove the coins, I empty the wallet completely and trash it.  If I had any leftover BTC that I wanted to go back into cold storage, I would generate a brand new wallet.  
* Is my method secure enough?  I send about 1 BTC to my offline paper wallet each week from coinbase (only sending BTC to my wallet)
* Also, I print the **shares** of the private key that I distribute to my trustees with an offline linux OS/usb printer.  
* I never put either the private key or the shares of the private key on any device connected to the internet.
* My public address for my offline wallet is online, but it has to be, right?
Am I missing anything here?

I'll tell you what, you can prove that it's not a scam.  All you have to do is:
* Buy the coinbomb yourself
* Wait for someone to buy it from you (and you'll make a little profit, right?)
* Repeat (many times)
If it wasn't a scam, then it would be in your best interest to **never stop buying the coinbomb**.  You see, **I won't buy it** because:
* I believe it is a scam
* I believe that someone will eventually get stuck with the coinbomb and lose their money (this is probably you right now...I'm sorry bro, that sucks).
* If you honestly believed that this was not a scam, **then you would continuously buy the coinbomb.**
I really just think that you bought the coinbomb and are now worried that no one else is stupid enough to buy it off of you, so you hoped to dump it on some poor sap here.  I could be wrong, but I'm probably not.  **It's a scam dude.**

Everything from my transaction is fixed, they honored the original transaction.  They are just a little on the slow side it seems, but I would expect with the growth of the company, they will have more support staff in the future.

if you make an account with localbitcoins they have an escrow service.  I had the same question that you did **"how do I know this asshole didn't just tell me he sent the bitcoins?"**
Well the escrow is pretty pimptastic, although most people hate that they have to pay an extra fee.  In my opinion, the fee is worth not having to risk it.  
* So you just find a seller on localbitcoins and say you want to buy 2 btc at his listed price.  Type 2 BTC and click purchase (or whatever the button is to make the sale).
* This sends an email to the seller, he is sent an escrow wallet address that is owned by localbitcoins.
* His email instructs him to send 2 BTC to that wallet and he can expect to receive $XX.xx as was listed on his ad.  
* Once he sends the money and it is verified, you will receive notification that he has sent the BTC into the escrow wallet.  **You are now given a 4 or 5 letter code** and this code is a secret, you do not share it with the seller.
* Now you go to meet the seller.  You show him the $300 (or however much it is) and ask him to **release the escrow**.  The seller can do this by sending an email, sms, logging into his account.  It's easy and quick.  
* Once he releases the escrow, the seller is then sent **the same secret code that you have**.  The seller must tell you what the code is, and you verify that the code matches.  
* If the code matches, then you give him the cash.  Once the seller can tell you the secret code, then you know that the transaction has gone through.

I really love CampBX, but I've never had to use them to buy BTC with USD.  I've only used them to sell BTC for USD.  They are fantastic for **BTC to USD**.
However, when I told my friend to use them to buy BTC, he mailed in a money order and they ignored it for **WEEKS**.  He was upset that he missed the opportunity to buy when BTC was around $65 a couple months back. 
So if you want to sell BTC for USD, it's great and fast, but not the other way around.  You might as well [use coinbase]( if you want to go both ways.

not necessarily, because he also could have meant the "first 0.007% of people" as 500,000 people.  In a year or two, maybe 500,000 more people will know about it, and that would be the "second 0.007% of people".  This is assuming the population remains at 7billion (yes, i realize this is not the case, but I think if I didn't define this, you would reply well - 'oh yea, well uhhh, like, there will be more people in a year and stuff so 500,000 people would only be 0.006%')

Let me reference you to [this post from 5 hours ago](
* I said *"In every case that I have heard with this problem, coinbase has always honored the original transaction."*  Please take notice of the part where I say **In every case THAT I HAVE HEARD WITH THIS PROBLEM**.  this simply means that, of the few cases that I was aware of, Coinbase has honored the transaction.  
* You replied accusing me of **"claiming they've always honored the initial transaction when they haven't"**.  This is where you fucked up.  
* I understand that reading is difficult for many adults, so I'll try to use small words (also bolded text) - **I never said that every order (including your order) was honored**, I said that every case with this problem that I knew about was fixed.  
So did I state something inaccurate?  **No, because you can not read my mind**.  Was it a correction?  **Sure** - that doesn't mean that I was wrong, if I had known about your fuckup then I would have never made that statement.  
Sorry for writing so many words with more than 4 letters, I'm sure it's difficult for you.  If you want to continue to feed the troll, then please do.  I'd love to rub all of my **successful coinbase transactions in your face all night**, but I can understand why your support requests were, most likely, ignored.  If you can't even read/reply to a comment correctly, how could anyone expect you do the same with something as difficult as email?
I wish you the best of luck in all of your endeavors.  If you happen to still want bitcoins, I'd be happy to sell you some of mine for **market price +5%**.  
I'd also recommend mining your own with the top of the line [BFL ASIC MINER](  If you ordered one today, you will **[probably]( receive it in 2 weeks and you no longer have to deal with Coinbase.

I created an account 2 weeks ago alongside with the capital one 360 checking account.  I was under the impression that if I deposited cash into my Capital One 360 account that I could send a near-instant cash transfer into BitFloor.com
I suppose I didn't read the details initially, the transfer will take 3-4 business days.  This is still faster than using Dwolla=&gt;MtGox but about 3 days.  
The fees are low, but I continue to have friends approach me with wads of cash asking for help trading for bitcoins.  At this time, I always advise them to use bitinstant=&gt;MtGox.  The fee isn't that bad considering that it is instant.

Whoa there [Vibr8gKiwi]( calm down.  If you read more than just the **bold text** in my comment you'll see this:


I only said that every case that **I was aware of** with this problem was fixed/honored by coinbase.  I did **not** say **coinbase has always honored every transaction in the history of their corporation**.

I'm not at all suggesting that this change should be coinbase's highest priority.  I totally agree that this is an minor issue that they could tackle when they aren't experiencing heavy loads like they currently are.  
@_date: 2013-02-23 04:59:03
They fixed the problem, at least with my scenario.  I am very pleased with the results, Fred came onto reddit and took a personal interest and has since fulfilled the transactions at the rate that I locked in originally.  
They are working out bugs, so there will be problems every now and then, but they DID fix the problem, so I'm pleased to continue to sing their praises.  
@_date: 2013-09-05 13:32:03
I also recommend **NOT TO INVEST TO MINING EQUIPMENT**. 
I'd say put in the following altcoins:
* BTC = 60%
* LTC = 30%
* XPM = 5%
* PPC = 5%
If you wanted to add NMC to that, then I would put NMC = 5% (change LTC = 25%).

[Vibr8gKiwi]( thanks to your terrible attitude I am now very happy that coinbase rejected your transaction resulting in your **lost opportunity**.  
This happiness compounds thinking about how **all of my rejected transactions were honored by coinbase**.  Thank you so much for bringing so much joy in my life.  
@_date: 2013-09-05 13:23:43
I received an extra 0.75 BTC one time and about 2 weeks later (after I had transferred everything out) my balance was -0.75.  Support explained the bug where I received extra BTC (I had no idea at the time, but the math checked out).  
I waited until BTC went down to about $70 and bought 0.75BTC to pay off the balance, because I like coinbase and I have a verified account that I didn't want to lose.

@_date: 2013-04-16 12:36:05
I've thought about that before.  Say MtGox price is $60 and Bitstamp is $70.  
* Buy 10 BTC from MtGox at $60 = $600
* Withdraw to Bitstamp wallet
* Sell 10 BTC from Bitstamp at $70 = $700
but now what do you do?  cash out the money into your bank account and dump it back into MtGox to start over?

ohhh, so BFL says that as long as they stated that the delay was going to be longer than 30 days, that you can not refund?  That's a good move, but as much as I hate paypal, I hate BFL 10 times more.

If I recall correctly, and feel free to correct me if im wrong, when I tried to post an ad to sell as many as 10 BTC, **i had to send 10 btc to localbitcoins to hold as my inventory**.  This was different from using their escrow.  
That's when I said "to hell with this"

It's easier to convince smaller businesses to start accepting, especially in light of [whollyhemp]( post of the [pie chart for his sales since accepting bitcoin](
I think this type of adoption will parallel paypal's adoption.  At first new users will try a purchase with BTC and (hopefully) realize how simple and effective it is.  Afterwards, it will suddenly be a new method of transaction that the user is no longer intimidated by.
I've found myself spending my BTC more and more just for the fun of it (god dam you Sealswithclubs)

Understanding that delays happen I would expect that any reasonable company would offer some sort of a compensation package if they outright refuse to refund.  
Back in January, I preordered (using paypal) one of the BFL [60 gHash/sec miners]( at $1299).  I read about the delays **after** I sent the money, but within a couple of hours I requested a refund stating 


Without question or delay they refunded it, but I believe that was because it was a fresh order, I could have disputed the charge with paypal (i believe).  People who paid in full in summer 2012 have requested refunds and are denied (i guess I don't have any sources for this claim, but I bet I could find some if I felt so inclined).
I got in on the [2nd batch of Avalon's Asic miner](  Hope to receive it sometime in April.   
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:49:40
you make a really good point, I definitely agree that the first big guy to embrace the currency will see sales increase initially.  That's a good selling point too, if you are the first, you'll see a lot of traffic and more sales from the bitcoin community.  
Similar to opening a new restaurant.  At first, they usually get a ton of business and it slowly starts to diminish.  The difference here is that even if said company only had 1 month of increased sales and it diminished to nothing, they still have the regular transaction methods that have not changed at all.  
tl;dr **they have nothing to lose at all**
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:35:40

When I ordered the BTC, we'll call this day 1, i had to wait 14 days to receive the BTC in my wallet.  On day 14, I received notice from coinbase "your transaction was cancelled...etc".  
I contacted Coinbase and posted on reddit (I linked my post as another comment to your post earlier this morning) and within a couple of days I received a message from Coinbase promising to honor the transaction.  Lets call this day 17 (I don't remember exactly what day)
If I remember correctly I had the BTC within 24 hours so I had the BTC around Day 18/19

Someone recommended the following method to me and it is really an outstanding way to secure your wallet AND add redundancy.  My friend compared it to the horcruxes in Harry Potter.
* First, You'll want to boot into linux (you can do this on a flash drive, if you don't know how to do this, comment here and I will be happy to help you out) and do not connect to the internet at all. 
* Second, you should already have the java applets  and  saved on a flash drive.  You'll need to access these files (they'll open in the internet browser.
* Third, the bitaddress applet will generate a public key (bitcoin address) and a private key (the password you need to extract your bitcoins).  Save the public key somewhere (perhaps the flash drive) so that you can send BTC into that BTC address.
* Fourth, copy the private key and open the passguardian applet.  You will want to select **split a secret**.  Here you will paste the private key into the box that says "secret to share".  
* Next, you select the number of shares (i usually pick 7) and threshold (i usually pick 4).  This means that you will receive 7 different passcodes and in order to recover your "secret" you need to have any 4 of the 7 shares.  
So I passed out my 7 shares to 7 people that I could trust, my parents got one, my sister, my friends, etc.  But shit happens.  People lose stuff, houses burn down, people get robbed.  If you set it up this way, you only have to rely on 4 out of 7 people to actually keep that share.  
This has the added benefit of making it fairly difficult for someone to betray you.

Yes that's what I said.  Overall, I mostly wanted to complete the transactions that I originally had agreed to.  Understanding that this is a new company and they are, naturally, experiencing some hiccups, I was very pleased that they honored the transactions.  
Sure, I see what you are saying, I shouldn't have to publicly express my problems so that they will fix it, but the bottom line is that **Coinbase continues to add to their track record of fixing the mistakes caused by their developing system**.  
This is huge to me, because I have faith that they will eventually rectify any future problems.

Hey BCNacct, 
I (and many others here) had the exact same problem a few months ago.  Contact support, ask them what the deal is.  I have heard many people complain about this problem, especially when the price was $25 when I placed the order and $50 after the 2 week waiting period.  It seemed a little fishy that my verified account would be "too high risk"
In every case that I have heard with this problem, **coinbase has always honored the original transaction**.

I don't want to use localbitcoins for the same reason.  I don't want any site to hold my coins.  I have no problem listing that I have 10 BTC for sale on LocalBitcoins and I have no problem sending the coins to the site for escrow once a transaction has started by a buyer.
LB is great, but when I tried to make an ad for selling BTC, they required that I deposit the amount of coins I had for sale into their wallets.  That's not gonna happen.  
@_date: 2013-02-03 16:21:51
yours considered a lot more than mine did.  I compared the difficulty increase only on a 2 week interval (cuz i couldn't really figure out how to factor in the new rigs' effects on the rate at which the difficulty would increase).  
But, i guess more or less, i had similar data, i would just trust that yours would be considerably more accurate than mine.  I figured if I got one by the end of march, I'd generate USD at current BTC price of about $150/day for the first couple weeks.

i don't know of any that are exactly the same, but I have tried [btcQuick]( and it works well enough, but the fees are a bit high.  Expect if you spend $100 that you'll receive $92 worth.  You can purchase with your credit card as well because it uses Google Wallet.  
But I've used moneygrams/zipzap/bitinstant/cash deposits and those generally turn $100 into $94 but I have to go to out and place a moneygram.

I have no idea, that was actually what caused me to [speculate about their high risk policy]( in the first place.  I'm guessing it has more to do with the actual bank than it does the individual user.  Banks have some sort of fraud protection built into their systems, so coinbase is likely working out the kinks for each individual bank.  I might be way off, I really have no idea.

i started running the same calculations, to determine if it'd be worth trying to order.  I generalized WAYYY more.  I like your numbers, I really wish I could have ordered one of the Avalon miners.  
Very nice graphs!

I have a couple people that I met through LocalBitcoins that are trustworthy.  I've noticed that LB is very VERY slow to go from "initiated" status to a "funded" status.  Funded status should only require 3 confirmations as stated on the site.  
As OP mentioned, even after 18 confirmations and several hours, the transaction was not funded.  I'm not sure what's going on, but I've explained to my peeps that we can do a direct transfer and they can verify right online that it was received.  But I only do this for orders that are less than $1000 (not that I've had any over $1000, but I need a standard rule).

ZOMG, I just read your comment here.  You spelled **definitely** wrong.  Then you said "someone get's stuck with it".  **get's** is incorrect.  You should have said "Someone gets stuck with it".  
I think it's really funny that you are calling me stupid.  I bet you think the strippers at the club actually like you too huh?

Yea I read that other comment, but I wouldn't be surprised if they just auctioned them anyway, sans FinCen registration.

I don't try that hard, look at my sisters account page, she has a lot more karma than me from wayyyy more posts.  I'm too lazy to fake it.

I thought about this when i cashed in my change jar in February.  I needed to get $1500 USD into BTC so I could preorder an Avalon (batch 2).  I cashed in $300 at a coinstar, took the 10% cut and then made bitinstant deposits.  By the time the money hit my MtGox account (via bitinstant) it was only about $250.  
I would have happily paid coinstar an additional fee if they credited my wallet, I would have saved about 30 minutes.

I completely agree with you that they need to prioritize their resources to better serve the current customers.  I agree that this is a very minor issue.  I'm not asking for an increase in referral incentives, I'm making an observation that with an increasing price in BTC, the referral reward is lowered.
If the referral was set in the same currency as the minimum requirement, then the reward would remain constant.  That's all.  I'm not crying myself to sleep over this, I'm a huge advocate for coinbase.  
However, I figured I'd voice this concern that I had because I know that coinbase peeps read these forums too.  It's an easy fix if you ask me, but then again, I'm not running the show.
