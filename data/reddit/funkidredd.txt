Cunts are closing people's bank accounts here in oz for using coinbase and BTCMarkets. Pricks.

Can I suggest taking your knowledge and resources mate, and perhaps take a local down and out that's not a complete lost cause, and change their lives? And/or teach some disadvantage teens how to trade with a pot you give them. You'd be changing lives on a much more worthwhile level and you'd be paying it forward massively with personal karma level up. Just a suggestion mate, you can do what you want obs :) 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:39:51
Yes they did mate. Ditched them for users just before Xmas too 
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:22:50
This is brilliant - just what I'm looking for - thanks! Is there a preferred anonymous wallet for iOS or should I be looking for rooted Android device, or just use laptop on premise at the meet? 
@_date: 2017-02-20 04:22:37
Imma heading to Google now to research this. Thanks for the heads up on this "gotcha" mate!
@_date: 2017-02-20 01:02:12
Been lurking in this Reddit a few weeks and already proper stoked I asked the questions! Hey man - thanks heaps! How do you initiate a double-spend transaction "chargeback" to yourself if you're a nefarious prick like in my face to face scenario, please?
@_date: 2017-02-20 00:15:55
can't thank you enough for the straightforward info and delivery mate! So if I was changing AUD10,000 at a time face to face - what fees (above and beyond the other party's) are involved in such a transaction. This is the second part of the BTC puzzle I just can't get my head around - I see peeps talking about fees going up that Miners are charging etc, and i'm a little confused. Again man, thanks heaps for the help on this - fucking priceless when it's made simple like you have.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:28:37
Thanks for the snippet of info mate. Could you elaborate a little more for the usage case I'm making please?
@_date: 2017-02-20 04:23:21
yeah cool mate. This sub is bloody awesome!
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:58:33
ELI5 anyone?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:08:49
Fuck it - Imma get TWO for you and me mate!    
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:09:14
Fucking bonkers hey?!
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:17:25
Ha! If only it was that price again now.. buy in dips and hodl as long as you can.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:56:23
Nah, just proper excited I’m up $1500 in less than a week per coin. Will now go and buy celebratory Subway. Make it a 12”. No no, extra EVVVVVERYTHING thanks - push the boat out.

If the Dev could fix it, that would be bloody good.
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:57:43
How long would it take you to recover the outlay do you think? Is there a formula / earnings calculator anywhere?
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:51:32
As soon as focus off the main app window, the core app auto turns off. I'm using Huawei P10 Pro and Android 9.

They're V1.0 services. It will get better. I think even though bisq etc out there, having someone at the end of a support line or chat is what the general public will want. I just want their 2FA to work..mumble...
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:36:07
Hey mate - I should have clarified in the post to be honest: This was the requirement I was put through to reset my 2FA their end on an account I've had for a year. You'd think they had a better system to identify me from all my original KYC. Again, thanks for getting back to me. Appreciated.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:18:58
I type like i talk IRL. All good mate, you and I would still have a giggle if we ever met in a pub and I said "cunt" a lot. Which I do.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:17:29
Bah haha. It's normally longer but yannow, Xmas with fam and all..didn't want to scare the small children and doges
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:53:37
Australian, fuckwit.
@_date: 2018-12-27 00:09:53
I see what you did there ��
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:40:22
Oh do so fuck off with your holier than thou shiite. Keep your words in your head bruv.
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:02:16
Nah fuck that. I'm cunted off, and the amount of DM's supporting the fact that this asymmetrical trust we have to put into exchanges, would bear proof that exchanges need to do better.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:44:36
Last time I looked was waaaay back this year. You rate it now? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:16:27
There's better solutions for this, is what I'm saying. I recently saw Monzo bank account in the UK. My friend opened an account there from his phone with a debit card embedded into android pay all within 7 minutes from literal start to it all being live and ready. You're telling me the exchanges couldn't do something similar?
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:23:59
Thank fuck I don't give a flying fuck what you think then, amirite? Don't worry your pretty little troll fingers over me mate, I'm ok. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:10:44
Trust goes 2 ways mate - I'm live chatting to who exactly on their site: A random outsourced bloke in bumblefuck on minimum wage who now had my deets? Again? Even though I've gone through KYC a year ago to set account up? That's what I'm saying - it's important as fuck to maintain security - but that trust is asymmetrical at the moment and gives a fucked experience to already KYC'd account holders: How about sending an email pin number to the registered email that the registered phone then texts in from, along with their current IP address in that text. Or use any of the off the shelf video authenticity products like how Monzo online bank uses in the UK I used recently.
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:02:00
Found the puritanical American.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:22:47
See YOU fucking get the entire goddamn point of my original post. That trust goes BOTH fucking ways. I've already given all my KYC shit to them over a year ago. Now I need support, I'm supposed to trust some random cunt on live chat who's in Manila or Bumblefuck, Idaho, who's on minimum wage and now has all my ID info again? It's fucking shit asymmetrical bullshit, when online banks in the UK and Europe for example, let you open an account that's got apple and Android pay available to use, in just 7 minutes. They have it right. Why can't the exchanges evolve to do better the same as an online fucking BANK?
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:50:31
Yes, you got me. Like, you know, how Civic wouldn't be a good fit for this for example. Never assume you know more than the person you're talking to. I produce software. You're a random fuckwit. See? I just assumed your IQ right there. If you have nothing to add to a Reddit conversation, shut the fuck up. Simples.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:05:54
Yeah, and their shit is out in the open market - this is who I was thinking in the original post to be honest 
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:05:12
Not heard of them mate. I'll take a peek. Ta for heads up.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:04:45
Fucks sake. I've already gone through the KYC with the exchange to set the cunt up. This was for a support chat with a random stranger in their live chat system. Trust goes two ways - like, who the fuck am I talking to - an outsourced bloke in Manila that's now got my ID? I have no idea. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:43:58
Yeah, needed to clarify this I guess - it was for a support request to change my 2FA on my year old account that had already gone through KYC.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:13:27
Yeah been reading about them of late. If the US Gubmint is considering giving them some dough, I think they're worth looking at.
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:26:41
I'll take a look mate ta.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:24:48
And accept the situation? Nah. I'm not a fucking pussy.
