£150,000 is a ton of money. Can you elaborate on exactly what every piece of that sum is going to?

10000 XBT

Hmm.. Let me try this..

It was a joke, I don't even have changetip set up, nor do I really know how it works. Nut.

I agree. I emailed them but still, very responsive and rational!

As someone who doesnt have too much grip on the history of BTC, care to explain exactly what is wrong with this article? Very curious!

How very informative and detailed, I appreciate your answer very much. -____-

I really like the part where you took everything into account

AWESOME! Have just been waiting for the day this happens! And as I live in a city where these kinds of things are very popular I hope to see it in my town soon as well! (Umeå, for you wondering)

I know that CV needs some work. I am working on a complete revision with a portfolio. Will post soon.

Stop upvoting him when he doesn't motivate WHY it's more sensitive.  Not only NSA could benefit from changes in this code...

I could develop for BTC
