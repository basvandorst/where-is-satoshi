Armory's Multi-Sig feature can be used on mainnet. It's just not recommended for large amounts of bitcoin at this point.

Everything can be done in a single client. It is not necessary to copy and paste anything. There are address book buttons available next to every address entry field.

Hi, I'm a developer at Armory Technologies, you have run into a known issue. 
The "unknown" address is only unkown because your offline wallet doesn't know how far to look down the deterministic address chain. This can happen when your online wallet gets far enough ahead of the offline wallet. Here's what to do. Go to your offline wallet, select "Expert" from the User menu. Double click to open your wallet. Click on the blue number next to "Addresses Used". You may now tell your offline wallet how many more addresses to compute. Select a 1000 or so.  If that doesn't work, select 10,000. You can look at your address list on the Online wallet and make sure to add at least as many as that.
In the upcoming release we are going to start the offline wallet with 1000 addresses, so most people will never run into this issue. In the release after that we'll have Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets, and all of this will be moot.
And another thing. You did the right thing by checking the outputs and not broadcasting that transaction. Armory is only as safe as the user. Check all of your transactions and signatures all the time. The most secure thing Armory does is display data, but that's a useless fail safe if you don't look at it.
