Good thing that there are articles and questions like this that professionals answers and they do provide exact instructions. Right now im still waiting for the [Trading platform]( to be live for me to invest and to do homemade wallets like they have instructed. Thank you guys for sharing your knowledge about this kind of matters.

I'm a newbie when it comes to gambling lets say I've been playing for 6 months already but you have to be very careful when it comes to gambling sites cause some of them are just trying to get your coins. You can definitely use google to search for top gambling sites that uses ETH or other coins to buy-in seats or chips. Also keep in mind to gamble moderately, not all problems or loses can be solved by gambling :) . But if you really wanted to test your luck why not try to gamble here in [Vegas](  there are many games you can choose like cards, roulette, table games etc. Well goodluck with the gambling journey that's all I can say, and do not forget "winner winner, chicken dinner" :D

This is a very alarming news, and I do not know what to do. If fiat crashes will crypto go above and beyond?  what if both crashes?  But if fiat will crash like what the video said, it's better to invest right now in to crypto just in case.

Yeah right now im thinking of investing in to a trading platform for crypto, I searched google for most promising ICO trading platforms that I can use when time comes. Fortunately I found one and will for it to go [live]( I will also start reading things about crypto currency and how the market works. Thank you for this video and I think this will be helpful for others who are already in the crypto world.

Awesome video you have here and I enjoyed watching it, feels like I'm watching my self before being into online gambling. Lol the way you react is somewhat funny and catchy. I was also waiting for you to successfully withdraw you winnings to see if their game really gives you win, but based on your comment you have successfully withdraw it by  re-pasting the invoice. You should do more videos like this or post videos once a week.

i think I would go with Malta as well, since many projects already moved to that country. But also after create opening a platform needs marketing etc. Try to get help from Crowdcreate ( [ ) They can definitely help you with that, the also have a free consultation right now its worth a try.

 I totally agree with you on this one, most of the ICO projects right now are not even trying to partner up with a great blockchain marketing agency. They don't know that a marketing company can boost their project and members as well. A great article he has here indeed.  
@_date: 2018-11-07 16:53:16
Yeah, same here i will wait for new projects that will hit the market especially if it will be coming from California. Hope they could partner up with a great blockchain marketing company and does have a great community management to make sure that all their projects will hit its target.
