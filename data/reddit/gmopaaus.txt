These artificial pumps hurt more than they help

The parties openly, and striving non stop to pump their coins. Getting added to an exchange guarantees an increase in the short term.

Because Coinbase is paid to

Because alt coins continue to eat up market cap

Yay, more shitcoins
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:20:24
Not to mention selling is a taxable event.

Great news

I just saw this chart elsewhere and became concerned. Certainly looks like it’s dying with no hope in sight :(

Whats the cheapest way to get coins off Trezor temporarily so that I can upgrade without fear of losing coins?
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:35:59
Stock transactions are tracked and reported to the IRS. Non issue.

Which is a non issue, and why no one seems to be talking about it.  Quickly the most credible company in the Crypto space, allowing for verification of buys in minutes, and a solid mobile app. It's all about getting new users to Crypto and investing in general.

People are buying Bitcoin with Credit Card (instantly) and selling right to fiat. Meaning they’re able to get a “Cash Advance” by avoiding the Cash Advance fee and interest that credit cards charge. Do you think Credit Cards will allow people to bypass their fees that easily?

Who cares. Its instant verification, and gets young people into Bitcoin easier than any method available today from one of the most trusted Businesses in finance. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:41:43
I have it, but don’t trust it.

When running a business, managing and securing on your own wallet is not the best use of your time. Especially when it comes to tax and reporting. Theres nothing wrong with businesses adopting payment processors so that they can focus on growing their business and not bitcoin.

What happens to old coins and their value? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:14:38
Coinbase can't force the money back to the end users because it creates a taxable situation. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:02:36
Thanks for the great explanation. At this time a fork is unlikely right? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:29:41
I see, will own coins but whether they are worth anything is a different story right?
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:15:58
Also the ability to easily track and report on coins for tax purposes 
@_date: 2017-07-14 03:15:55
If Coinbase pick, most will follow 
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:41:31
What happens to old coins held?
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:09:28
If segwit2x, how does that affect old coins held?
