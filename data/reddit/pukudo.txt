18% is like two days of trading volatility in the crypto scene.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:47:33
18% aint no dip.

Common sense isn't an argument.
@_date: 2017-02-28 11:03:51
Put up or shut up. I am a late comer and its already pretty clear you represent the stupid side regardless of the truth.

Physical presence is less secure than memorising quantum random numbers to sign stuff with Salts and time bombs.
If your salt and key take longer to explain in any torture scernario than an internet time bomb that you use said process to cull the trigger then you win.

Lol spotted the guy who lives in a state where police shoot random people and rob them if they carry too much cash on them and calls it freedom.

Jesus fucking christ, Speaking as someone who had a parent throw valuable shit out all of the time it boggles my mind that you think this kind of shit doesn't happen all the fucking time.

I will be very disappointed.

Except you can prove a negative, except burden of proof is more important.
For example if it could be shown that Craig was on a remote island with no internet for the domain of time in which satoshi was making and publishing bitcoin. That would be classifed as proof that he didn't make it. 
So please stop spouting fake Axoims.
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:39:01
Sorry, but you are an idiot if you think a negative can be proven without a doubt **in this case**
Moving the goal posts are we. You might need to reevaluate your axioms. 
My point is to stop using stupid false Axioms and has nothing to do with the infeasibility of proof.

Because its a heavy, soft metal with higher electrical resistance the copper you fan boy.
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:15:54
Copper is more useful due to it's physical properties as a conductor in all the the few edge cases where its nice to have gold contacts.
@_date: 2019-04-27 09:26:56
And the situation in which copper is more useful is over 95% of all scernarios. Where is gold is almost only used for contacts.

The whole point of a blockchain is to be decentralised. ETH shits on that mission statement.

It costs money to make devices. Why waste time reverse engineering a process which is already relatively easy.

No kidding, I just thought this might happen like 10 minutes ago. I'm a PROPHET!

Inflation is 2-3% if your interest rate is less than that you lose money. The reason the bank makes money is because the bank doesn't have your money. They use your money to make partially risky investments and what not. If you did that with your own money You'd be making like 10% nominal. Which is above inflation.
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:09:00
The tax exists so the money can be used to bail out retarded bank collapses due to the various problems with reserve banking and media caused economic collapse poopies. Why the shit would that at all be relevant to bitcoin. If anything during one of these peroids Bitcoin would actually grow stronger.

And then other people voluntarily offer up your private information :D
@_date: 2013-06-09 11:32:24
Do you even Mine Bro?
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:34:40
Unless bitcoin itself become unvaluable they'd always been incentive for some people to mine.. And there will always been incentive for hobbyists to mine. (to not allow a big hashing bias) I'll mine so long as the network doesn't fail and if it gets costly I'll find ways to bypass the costs.
@_date: 2013-06-13 03:28:33
But if I had to make an inaccurate intuitive guess I'd say ~90±15 days. After the machines arrival. But you're not allowed to quote me on that.
@_date: 2013-07-04 04:23:12
Patience bro.
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:05:08
You don't make money on your shit bank interest. But the bank does.
