You should look up the definition of manipulation.

Poe.

No they don't. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:51:59
No, only a small part of those 170k actively read this sub. Also quite a % are bot sign ups. Which i explained yesterday and got downvoted to hell for because apparently you're not allowed to mention that.

And their answer is gonna be "what about Bitcoin?".
Step out the echo chamber for a while. Maybe then you'll get it.

Ah the weekly 'what if' thread. How many of these have we done now? 50? 100?
OP, replace the word Bitcoin with any other item. Then wonder how much sense that makes. Then imagine it's the same for Bitcoin.

Welcome to 6 weeks ago. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:13:19
The monthly sign ups here are declining. Is that "progress"?
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:49:23
Yes. It's already happening non stop. By traders. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:52:26
It's basically because nobody really cares enough to do that. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:44:15
Let's stop calling it a stress test completely. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:54:15
This is an outrage! They didn't mention Bitcoin???! Absolutely crazy!
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:02:26
I fail to see why Bitcoin should play a role here?
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:25:32
Why are you telling me this? Where did i complain about it?
Calm down man. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:20:04
Adding Bitcoin to your store is pretty much a waste of your time. Nobody pays with it. 
Just never mention it in this sub when you remove it again. They will lynch you and make your life a hell. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:38:51
I must be misunderstanding you. 
You want to buy Bitcoin (probably with a cc) and then put them on a credit card so that it can be used as a...credit card. Without the benefits of insurance and chargebacks. 
I'm sure i got that wrong? I hope.
