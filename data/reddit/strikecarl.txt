It'd be cool if you could see the total BTC that has passed by your node :p

So you dont profit from this at all?
Is it expensive to run?
Can you give me a of what this is?
Kinda new to this :c
@_date: 2015-07-03 01:41:12
Is it possible tho?
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:06:41
How much do you profit from this one miner?
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:29:13
Ah i see, i actually thought that miners and nodes where the same, so basically when i send like 50$ in btc to x person, it has to get confirmations, that's the nodes job?
Is that thing expensive to run or is it decent cause you have to run it 24/7 i suppose?
It does look really cool tho, i'd create square hole in my wall and plug one of those in just for the street cred kek

So, i just made a new address on blockchain, if someone sends money to that address, do i get it into my wallet or is it basically a secondary account?
@_date: 2015-09-13 18:21:28
Hah, yay
@_date: 2015-09-13 17:00:31
How do i activate the feature so i can do stuff like you just did?
@_date: 2015-09-13 17:07:10
What's the problem with that?
* Disclaimer, i'm new to cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2015-09-23 05:31:15
can you buy btc with your credit/debit card with circle?
and can you withdraw btc directly to your bank account?
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:56:50
o shit that's cool
@_date: 2015-09-13 18:46:38
Enjoy the gold!
Thanks alot for the explanation!
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:05:39
So, if i understand this right, i can send money to someone elses circle account, which goes right to bank?
So it is basically MobilePay, but with Bitcoins?
can i use my btc wallet to send money to peoples bank account?

@_date: 2015-10-09 11:34:41
Could someone possibly make a ELI5 of these two attacks?
@_date: 2015-10-09 14:53:55

@_date: 2015-10-09 15:37:46
