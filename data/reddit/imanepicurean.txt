Right, but he ran out of cash so he couldn't double the bet on the last one.  He wiped himself out, most probably...

Doesn't matter as long as you have trillions.

What do you mean?  Don't they track the profit loss of satoshi on a forum?  Last I remember the website was up 70,000 BTC before it was sold.  That's like only 2 years of profit for the 126,000 BTC it sold for.

They moved in, stripped the town of jobs and money, then when sales couldn't suffice, they left.  CAN YOU READ???

Nevermind, I just read some of your other comments.  It's all you do...

And I'm pretty sure I remember their profits being just the same when BTC was $200 a few months back.

And then he did, for less than double the last bet.  He was maxed out and bet 123 instead of the double which was 170.  He's toast.

Right, which is NEVER the case...

I've had two transactions cancelled as "high-risk" after the price of bitcoin soared during the 5 day wait period.  They were for 0.1 BTC each.  Yup, super high-risk!  This after doing $4,000+ in transactions the month before.

Thanks for admitting you were wrong and proving I was right.  Many thanks.

Can you read?  
"During the last 20 years, Wal-Mart has moved into communities and destroyed them, wiping out stores, slashing the tax base, and turning downtown areas into ghost-towns. This is accomplished through Wal-Mart's policy of paying workers below subsistence wages, and importing goods that have been produced under slave-labor conditions overseas. Often, communities will even give Wal-Mart tax incentives, for the right to be destroyed."

Ahh, thought he was just a broke mofo.  Glad to see people are making the purchase price of satoshidice worth it.  
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:36:48
I still hope losing $123,000 stung him just a little...

Most gamblers know the Martingale is a 0 expected value system.  The eventual catastrophic losses outweigh the returns.  But, it sure is fun when it works!

Haha, well the system works just fine as long as you have a billion dollars and the casino doesn't set a limit.

Ok, if I had a bank account that accrues interest at an infinite rate, I could keep betting bigger forever.  Only thing needed would be time between bets.

So you're just a shill for your own for-profit site???
