While those are good methods they do not avoid packet sniffing. They might obfuscate it might it has nothing to do with avoiding the packet being sniffed.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:26:34
They don't. Most people here have no clue what they are talking about.
As a little sidenote: It would be possible IF there was a malware installed with the app that breaks out of the Android VM that an app runs in. If you have other wallet apps installed it theoretically could try to get private keys from them. This scenario is highly unlikely though and I am not sure if it would be feasible.
 Btw.: This could happen with any app, doesn't need to have anything to do with crypto.

No method of packet sniffing or detection could ever save my wallet. Unless I forward every packet manually I'll have the lost the moment I notice that my private key was sent (if I notice it at all)

Chinese said (like 10 times before) that they would regulate crypto mining because of the high energy consumption. End of story
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:29:59
Absolutely correct. Open-Source is not the holy grail finance wise.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:14:09
Could you elaborate on your opinion?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:07:15
Yep, absolutely. I just said that it's not the holy grail of product licensing. Please don't get me wrong, it does work in many cases but not always and it's not always the best choice.

Never even heard of Eurolines actually.

God this post makes zero sense. Even as a crypto fan comparing countries debts and the value of a cryptocurrency is pointless.
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:08:58
Might it be that you all forget about India buying a lot of coins? Look at their current financial changes. The government tries to decrease cash usage. BTC is a good alternative for that, which cannot easily be government controlled.

Can someone tell me what's the red white red flag left of the "HODL"? Looks exactly like the flag of Austria.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:16:48
What does any of that have to do with crypto?
If you'd compare the whole value of USD with Bictoin then it would make sense.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:40:51
The image does compare them.
It suggests that crypto is not a bubble since its volume is way lower than the volume of nations debts. And this is what makes no sense.

Hey, we are currently finishing our 180-page book about cryptocurrencies which especially targets beginners and advanced users. We were not happy with anything currently available so we decided to write something on our own. Almost everything was not comprehensive, new or simply good enough. I hope no one here will eat me for writing about it. 
To come to the point: I will quickly quote our explanation what hardware wallets are:


@_date: 2018-02-11 08:17:37
Easy, you just sell them. Perfectly legal. Especially when you hold them since day one in most jurisdictions (for example US or German) you won't even need to pay taxes on it because you held them longer than a year. There is nothing magic about this transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:09:35
Well as you can add a comment to every BTC tx I suppose that the victims see a unique string on their screens which they'd need to add to the tx. That way it should be fairly straightforward to identify systems.
BUT: That's not how the attackers did it because there aren't any comments with the tx so I have a no freaking clue. :)
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:07:17
That's a nice little thought but you forget that wealthy people usual don't have most of their money on cash or on a savings account. They have houses, gold and other investments and valueables which will still be very valueable when everything crashes.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:07:42
The trend clearly indicates that in my opinion. After the dip of the last days there should be enough fresh capital or new investments to easily manage this growth (which is not that huge percent-wise).
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:08:06
Yes, that's true as well
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:14:05
Probably because of the extreme rise and attention of ETH (ethereum) today.
@_date: 2017-05-10 11:51:34
Thought exactly the same
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:42:25
If we reach 2000 (which I think we will today) I guess there won't be a quick stop. About 2150-2200 could easily be at the end of today.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:25:38
They had a DDoS attack last night where the attacker sold huge amounts of ETH to drop the price and afterwards bought again. I am pretty sure that this is related to the current problems.
PS: Had the same problems. Just reload often enough and it will work.

Although you have to mention that this worm is self spreading so even if the hacker had paid for installs, one install (which he/she would have to pay) would maybe lead to hundreds of infected machines.

I would actually choose Kraken again. No problems so far.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:33:30
Well to be honest right now they must have really gotten so many new customers. If you are alone looking at how many are waiting for verification. So at least it is kind of understandable.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:39:39
No, he took his coins offline, not Kraken.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:50:38
What makes BTC so much better und so unique? Which function is it that others don't have as well or even better? Tell me please. Been here since 2013 and I really don't see it.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:21:13
Longer, definitely longer.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:23:30
I know they don't like to hear it here but bitcoin is NOT a stable value store (just like every other crypto) at least not now. btw.: As you said the current development of BTC is not too good, I exchanged most of it to ETH but that's me personally. Not to be taken as trading advice.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:16:27
Value to cash? It is just a worthless paper but it the evidence that someone gave you this value. Is that so different?
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:12:32
I didn't pump anything, especially not specifically ETH. I was just asking questions regarding BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:39:25
I don't refer to the technological development but the overall direction BTC is going at the moment. I mean not even you could deny that the scaling problem and the massive increase in tx fees is a good thing for BTC.
But yes you are right, I misinterpreted the post (which I read of course). 
But I am actually pretty surprised that I only got two downvotes. Not a lot considering that I am knee-deep in bitcoin county.
PS: Why are so personally offensive anyway?
