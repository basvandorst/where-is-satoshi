The fee you pay to the network for them to include the transaction, higher the fee, higher chances to be included in next block (about 10 mins). Go with an intermediate one unless you are in a hurry

It started already, the Krip phones are being sold in Caracas and will expand to the rest of Latin America. Not endorsing dash, I think all altcoin marketing and R&amp;D will end up in bitcoin and it’s a natural part of the process.

Well, in the world the prepaid phone market is bigger than postpaid. Not only used by low-mid income people, but travelers, privacy seekers.
Also bitrefill has vouchers now, Amazon, Ebay, Uber, etc

app.freewallet.com is doing this. They also have a built in exchange with many shitcoins. 
Would be nice if a non custodial wallet like coinomi integrates bitrefill to buy gift cards with a few taps
