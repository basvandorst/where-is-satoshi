If you want to deal with organized criminals and fraudsters then yes there is.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:47:53
I don't understand how you ended up with that assumption.

Watch how fast this thread gets deleted by and all dissenters banned.

Bitcoin paradise lol more like buttcoin paradise

As someone who knows a friend who works at Visa, I can assure you they give 0 shits about bitcoin.

For the unsafe issue, unless cryptocurrencies become engineered to allow reversible transfers, we will still be seeing a massive amount of theft and transfers made by mistake that lead to complete losses for users. Because of their irreversible and unaccountable nature, no matter how much effort developers put into making cryptocurrencies harder to steal, the malicious people will prevail and concentrate their efforts. One in 16 bitcoins are stolen, compared to the 0.1% fraud rate for credit cards.  As for the inconvenience and inefficiency, unless transaction confirmations go down to at least less than 20 seconds, it's a ridiculous proposition making people wait for 10 minutes or even more until their transaction gets confirmed compared to other payment services that allow instant payments and provide actual consumer protections.

Most of the "brainwashed users" are actually paid shills or the owners themselves.

This thread is a testament to how knows literally, metaphorically and figuratively nothing about politics or bit-coins in general. All the retards in here tooting about how Kim is better because of le fascist usa or whatever. I've been on reddit.com 27 years this April, and for 22 of those and I have NEVER seen this level -or perhaps, sub-level - of retardery in all my years. Huh? You people make me vomit in terror.
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:27:58
Don't interrupt the circlejerk.
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:23:11
I am a paid troll and I am openly admitting to it.
@_date: 2015-03-22 09:45:29
That's a very ignorant assumption on your part.
@_date: 2015-03-06 07:43:33


No they aren't


I never said it was
@_date: 2015-03-07 01:24:41
Damn it's weird how this statement gets massively downvoted in other threads yet stays in the positives here.
@_date: 2015-03-06 08:37:55
Because they are completely inefficient, unsafe, and very inconvenient.

Bitcoin is a scam ponzi scheme.  You should try to relieve yourself of delusions and get out while you can.
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:18:26
No I don't, for multiple reasons.
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:05:44
Can I get a flair that says "Buttcoiner"

Nobody appreciates your changetip spam any more than they would appreciate free AOL cds.

They're not interested in your neckbeard pesos and mountain dew.

Ah let's circlejerk about le evil banks again and how bitcoin is literally 100000000000x better despite the fact that many banks offer instant transfers and services like Western Union and PayPal.

I criticized and went against changetip in the past and bashco petitioned an admin to shadowban me.  I would give more details on this situation but I don't want to get banned again because this is the fifth account I've burned.
@_date: 2015-03-04 07:07:58
A great way to help people fall asleep during the long flights.
@_date: 2015-03-26 14:36:14
No worries I have it archived.

@_date: 2015-03-06 11:23:59


I had another account that was shadowbanned.


Yes they are.  And reversible transactions are a good thing.
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:06:59
This is good for bitcoin.
