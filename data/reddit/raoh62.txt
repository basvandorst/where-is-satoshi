not quite: it's from the latin "moneo" (greek Μνημοσύνη if you like)

calling the BP the oldest fiat currency is way off the mark. However this fail it's a pretty nice showcase of bubble wisdom and how fud becomes 'realitiy', if you rehash it over and over... at least call it the oldest still in use and even that is somehow inaccurate since there have been reforms and serious changes like implementation and dropping of gold standard etc.

well, not naive enough to not take prox. 40% taxes on trading gains ...

see, that's the problem with predicitions. I'm old enough to still recall the high hopes on the internet from pre 2000 aera. Everbody thought that we'd enter a new age of hyper information and super educated John Does, because freedom of knowledge and stuff.
And what did we actually get?. A new generation of smartphone zombies browsing memes and selling their data to big companies 24/7. And in my Book people feel as stupid as never before... high hopes are one thing, kidos, reality is just another story

kinda ... [disclaimer] not mean to hate: just an impression from 'the outside'...
with the midterms and their aftermath being done, crypto (due to the recent meltdown) proves very entertaining. You can have the whole scale from 'HODL hard, boys' to 'I'm financially ruined' threads. Frankly put: It's, where the lulz are at right now. Therefor people are reentering the discourse or just grab their popcorn and watch the show.

great one, thanks!!! Now my remaining question is: with about 81% of BTC already distributed: how do we go from the current BTC distribution to: 




is there a decent preditcion on how this could be done? Simply trading BTC for goods won't work, I guess...

my problem is this: if everyone is going into crypto now (and let's assume they do it at a fairly even rate), we'll end up having a distribution, that is close to the current one - but that's only among the late adopters... Problem is, that we also have the early adopter's side with a disproportional amount of wealth. And not only will this kinda screw over everyone, who's adopting late, I also don't see a path for distributing the early adopters side somehow evenly among the rest.

but spending a fortune is buying houses, companies, stocks etc. So it remains wale to wale transfer. Is there any educated guess on how much of their share (my guess is 99%+) early adopters and current hodlers would have to drop in order to create a distribution, that is kinda close to the current distribution of wealth? And as a follow-up: How should they do it?

Fair enough of a reading; I wasn't too precise to be honest.
However my main concern is not fairness but functionality. The distribution of wealth greatly determines the state of our economy. cost-supply-demand-style. It's not reasonable to produce 100.000 of high end sport cars each day, because there's not enough people to buy it - just to give an extreme example ... in the end the whole economy is optimized to 'serve' the current distribution in one way or another. And seeing BTC going mainstream would crush this current distribution, is well... Not saying, that the current state is fair or even advantageous for me but I'm not too excited about laying an axe on it either.
