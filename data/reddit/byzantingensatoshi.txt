Governments possess not only sticks but carrots as well. In a scenario, when Bitcoin gains track, governments will probably introduce some form of free money - Basic Income for example to win hearts of the people and to keep status quo for as long as possible.

Is dollar community stronger? I don't know what is bitcoin community. I think it already outgrown that notion unless you refer to a 'global village'. But still one must not put too much faith to personal opinions and disagreements of people who are involved in bitcoin. Like in any given (democratic) country.

Ask yourself, why would a regular person, even if he/she holds some bitcoins care so much about hard fork? And spends all his time campaigning for it? Why?
This is definitely a political thing, this is all about power grab. Even if Core developers decide to do hard fork ahead of schedule, insurgents would say 'not enough! We need moar! We want Classic Coca Cora!'

Name 'Bitcoin' suggests some kind of form or shape. Bitcoin obviously doesn't have a form (yet), it is composed of numbers, like an account balance in a bank. Maybe with advance of augmented reality bitcoin could attain a form one day. And not only form but sound as well or even smell, possibilities are endless.

I think Bitcoin serves as a safeguard for events like economic collapse. Look at the infrastructure building right now around Bitcoin. These are real 'green shoots' of the 'economic recovery'. As Bucky [Buckminster Fuller] once said “You never change things by fighting the existing reality.

Talking about ideas, I would like to see bitcoin to acquire some form with the help of augmented reality. Right now we only see BTC as numbers and that is OK. But wouldn't it be more fun to be able to see bitcoin as a coin, or paper squares, or shells - you get the idea.
You open your wallet and you can see and use bitcoin like you use coins and paper money today.
