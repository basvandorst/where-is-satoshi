This is just your daily reminder, that you are dealing in an unstable currency. One that had a major exchange close, losing people millions. If you continue to invest in it, you shouldn't be allowed to get upset if you lose a massive amount of money. Hence the unstable market. I'd rather put my money into a mutual fund where I will get a decent rate of return, and in 30 years, I will have a good chunk of money to retire with.
To each their own. But please, remember what happened with Mt. Gox and don't look at it as an isolated incident. This can and will happen again. And above all else, remember that this currency is unstable, and through hacking can be stolen easily.
You chose to invest in Bitcoin, it will probably burn you, the person you should be angry at is yourself.

This is an unregulated marketplace that people assumed was going to be worth big money. It was essentially gambling, and the people who gambled with gox lost. I honestly don't have sympathy, because there were other methods to hold coins. Also it just shows how much of an unstable market this is, and how as an investment, it is at best risky, and at worst, terrible.

This is your own fault.
Bitcoins will never be a stable currency because no one is accepting them as a currency. And as more digital currencies continue to pop up its use and price will continue to go down. Instead of putting your money into something stable, you decided to buy bitcoins. Honestly you should've lost your money and accepted it because the market isn't going to be steady. 
Heck if you had the price locked in, and price went up rather than down, this entire complaint would have been about how they refused to sell you coins at your quoted price.
