The price fluctuations are inconsequential, and will be an integral part of the protocol's acceleration until sufficient BTC market cap is reached.

I agree with you; we cannot trust human nature, it is ultimately corruptible.  However, the reaction to that should be either more governance or an improvement of the existing governing system; not letting human beings do whatever the market dictates.  Are you providing solutions, or just enjoying the art of debate?
@_date: 2014-04-29 04:53:11
This is making me nervous...  With all of the access points created for selling BTC, we still have the same amount created.  
In a traditional economy, when selling points are created, so are production points.  This could be a huge issue (gulp)

As I said above... "One cannot expect steady growth..."  This is in reference to Metcalfe's law, as opposed to Exponential, which would take a long time to go from '0' to '1' , less time to go from '1' to '2', and even less time to go from '3' to '4'.  With quadratic, you see steadier growth, but still lot's of spikes and valleys; you WILL NOT see exponential growth, but you will see "near exponential growth".

I've been disappointed with the Orwellian control (censorship) Reddit has recently implemented.  Further, the vitriolic and judgmental responses by the Bitcoin Reddit community is surprising.  Any contrarian opinion is immediately mocked and labeled as invalid and a troll; and any discussion on the price is met with mockery and contempt.  
This is the antithesis of what I expected from users that support BTC.  You, evidently, are part of this group.
Be well, don't look to the speck in another's eye; look to the log in your own.

The best comparison to BTC is the market itself..  This is due to the fact that they are both systems, not an individual entity.

To be fair:  
You begin, by stating "Metcalfe's law posits quadratic growth in value, not exponential."  Thereby assuming growth, or network growth, is an integral part of Metcalfe's law.  
Yet, then later; you contradict this, by stating, "I don't really get your point about steady growth (since Metcalfe's law says nothing about growth)"
Regardless, I just uvoted all you comments because of your conduct; very professional :)
Can I ask you...
What are your thoughts presently on BTC?
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:51:58
Two crucial issues to consider about BTC price and it's lifecycle:
The blockchain is being fought over.  The idea of BTC being an internet of sorts, allowing many programmables to be layered on top, is true but misleading.  In actuality, there are wars right now over the actual blockchain, as many companies want to use it for varies things.  If sidechains and trees were created, this would allow versatility, greatly increasing the ability to innovate, thus making it like the actual internet.  Currently, it is not like this; and if we do not change (gulp)
The BTC mining only allows for a steady output of coins; this will be an issue as the economy grows.  Why?  Well, consider that we have more and more locations to sell (creating a downward force on the BTC price).
In a traditional economy, as locations to sell grow, so do locations that produce.  This creates a symbiotic growth; that is not occuring in BTC (gulp).
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:41:55
No, the posted analysis is incorrect. The price is a result of the age of BTC.
What is occurring right now is a big issue; determining future outcome.
Essentially, there needs to be a larger base of coins being created; because more and more merchants are allowing access points to spend.  
The price will continue to decline until exchanges become much more popular.  If they don't...  BTC could die, or ago to a very low price.  
Everything is hinging on Silbert's exchange and one's like it; by summer we should know which way it goes.

He does have some great philosophical ideas, though on a large scale, they are impractical; similar to Communism.
His ego is clouding his ability to think rationally.  Which is causing his logic to vier.  Making his talks more and more grandiose, and less and less realistic. 
Non aggression is great; but can we trust everyone to live by this?
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:18:02
In response to both of your posts, I agree.  These are foundational quandaries, issues with no simple solution.  The declaration of independence and constitution were created to measure against hostile private interests; whether internal or abroad.  
I assume the stance which both of you take is just to let hostile private interests run wild, letting the market dictate what occurs?   Hmmmm, not sure you're seeing the entire picture folks.

The law analyzes how a network grows, we are in the early stages; these early times are prone to vulnerability, as the amount of money in BTC is relatively small.  A thirty percent change is nothing to freak out about, in fact, it will be standard for three or four more cycles of pennant formation growth.

A merchant like overstock is a selling access point, hence the downward pressure on price.
a merchant like overstock has nothing to do with the creation of Bitcoin, which is the crux of the issue.
because, essentially what is happening, is that there are many access points for selling...  but the same number of bitcoins being created...
in a traditional economy, access points in selling and producing grow together in a symbiotic growth cycle; Bitcoin does not work this way.

What are you saying?
Are you saying Overstock has anything to do with the creation of BTC?
That would be weird, because they don't.  Further, they are not even a buy access point.  To be considered that, you have to provide an infrastructure for multiple buyers, i.e. an exchange.

Thanks so much for the comments, you know your math!
Metcalfe's law is entirely about growth, specifically network growth.
'Near' is a relative term, employed for the average user to put in perspective; to say that Quadratic functions as far as from exponential as zero is, is reductionist; and a flawed form of argumentation.

To be fair, Mr. Molyneux has become increasingly extreme.  
He started by having education and proper child care being the keystone of his beliefs, and then evolved into a Anarchism BTC Hitler.  In his last talks, you can see his ego taking over.
Saying that, I am for free speech, and the American way.  
If we keep listening to Mr. Molyneux and co, they will tell us to trust the 'free market' or essentially, to trust corporations.  The problem is... 
Will corporations protect land, creating ecological green belts?
Will corporations protect and shelter the poor, by implementing a wealthfare system?
Can corporations protect the people?  Even Milton Friedman, a libertarian hero, said the military was the one thing that could not be privatized.  
Finally, will corporations protect our free speech? 
In the end, Mr. Molyneux's anarchist views are turning on him; with the very same corporations (google) censoring his words.  
Thank god we have the government to protect our rights; including Mr. Molyneux's.

Again, one cannot expect steady growth without losses.
Regarding your statistic on the Bitcoin nodes...  I assume you're inferring that the network is slowing, and potentially dying.  
In fact, what is occurring is the institutionalization of bitcoin; and it is passing through the hoops.  Once these bureaucratic measures are passed, which will be soon, you will see the near exponential growth metcalfe's law posits.  (Silbert's exchange and Winklevoss ETF)
Then, BTC will tank again, plateauing, then slightly dropping...  At that point the value will be approximately 4,400.  Then, the next massive growth spike will come from global adoption.
