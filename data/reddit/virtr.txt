@_date: 2018-01-16 11:38:03
Bitcoin gon be digital gold and dats fine by me. Eth can be the currency
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:37:36
Um what
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:55:05
And therefore u should just kys. Thats the logic of these bubblefags
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:27:26
Nah they didnt carry cash in the crackhouse. They left their cash in the crackhouse for future purchases
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:32:52
For people to make money others have to lose that money. Its just the way it is. So dont sell if u dont want to be the loser. Bitcoin is unique and will come back. Look how it pulls all the other shitcoins with it

Ok oracle
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:40:17
Yeah but isnt mining just an arbituary calculation that has no real life use? Like calculation pi to some crazy decimal? I thought transaction confirmations are just a tiny fraction of the actual hashing power. Cant we get rid of that and just use the miners for transaction confirmations?

Buy high sell low :)

@_date: 2018-01-14 20:33:55
Im just afraid bitcoin will fail to a coin that has none of the mining bullshit. Just look at the energy waste in china.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:35:30
why do anything if u have 100mil holy shit just play guitar go travel enjoy the earth u have 100% free time damn
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:48:36
Except as soon as you sell it will rise again
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:46:51
The real price will be at 100k or 1mil because there is only 20mil coins to go around
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:16
Why would you send 40dollars worth of bitcoin? Wait for the lightning network idiot
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:26:39
so ur saying its too late to get in. got it
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:35:40

Please donate to some animal shelters or breeding awareness. I have a scottish fold cat that suffers from osteochondrodysplasia and he wont live very long because of it. The vet bills are also getting unmanageable for us and soon we will just have to let him go. Its a shitty situation that can be stopped if people realize some breeds of cats and dogs arent supposed to exist.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:22
because its too early wait for the updates. ur collecting gold before people figured out how to use it as a currency
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:34
Youre amazing. I would donate myself if I wasnt crippled with student loan debt.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:00:18
no one cares anymore about using bitcoin to pay for shit. people only want a thing of value that can be exchanged between borders with no hassle.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:12:03
sure it will
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:13:19
Language young man!
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:08:45
Hes a russian bot spreading propaganda
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:08:48
Shhh let then buy i need to sell
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:26:18
Hold forever never spend and then die
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:23:13
i think yes
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:45:31
Hurr durr da shtockmarket guise
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:17:41
I think it only goes up cus of the hype and people want to get rich
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:36:50
did anyone pay you in crypto yet?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:39:02
Sell me ur expensive coins for cheap then ��
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:27:23
I dont think so. I think 6k euro is pretty much the bottom. Anything below that and even the most conservative ones jump in. Hell if it goes down to 6k ill buy 1k worth again. Too good to pass up.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:26:08
Ur smarter than all the idiots who bought at 18k and SOLD at 8k. Jesus. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:30:20
I would only be worried if Bitcoin had some serious new flaw. But bitcoin is going good and with lightning coming everything seems fine. Also all the other cryptos arent doing that well either. I think its some wales selling off their coins driving the price down (maybe bitmain?) and then theyre going to pump it back up and hype to make profit again. Business as usual for the big players. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:09
I bought at 3500 guess ill sell at 3500 then
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:23:35
I for one like the idea of having a store of value that no one can take a away from me and is definitly never going to be inflated. And I can send it across borders to my family without any fuck goverment giving me problems. This is why I believe in bitcoin. The currency part is secondary for me. I dont even care if I can one day buy a coffee with bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:28:32
I tried that once. Lost 400 bucks
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:24:38
When is the lowest tho
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:37:57
Better now than when its 15k
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:18:31
Get in at all time high. Thats the smartest move amirite
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:35:01
Why didnt u say this to newbs when it was 18k? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:08:59
Competition is exactly what we need to push space exploration
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:34:45
Pretty much everything in the world is only worth what the people think its worth.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:32:48
People have heard of it. But dont understand it. Hell I have engineers at work that have no idea about bitcoin and cryptos
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:43:45
Exactly thats why i put SOLD in big. Buying at all time high is not the smartest thing. But selling that buy at a huge dip... damn. You cant time the market people. Either u believe in it or not.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:23:25
Then sell everything u got!!! Quick!! The humanity is obvoisly throwing away all this crypto tech progress cus thats the way life works
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:37:07
not even true anymore. bitcoin is at  its best its ever been. its just a bunch of weak hands stupid kids buying high and panic selling
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:37:50
i would buy now if didnt already
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:44:08
Why u so angry
