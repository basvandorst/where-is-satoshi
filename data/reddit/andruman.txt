this isn't a binary state. even veterans can be scared if the drop is sufficient.. dont tell me you wouldn't shit yourself if bitcoin went to sub 1k
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:37:15
have fun trading on kraken. their servers puke their guts out. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 11:10:26
why can't we have both? segwit/lightning and a sensible bigger block size? i mean we can calculate blockchaingrowth if blocks have size Xmb so cant we find some kind of middleground for a sensible size? 
even with segwit activated there is only a transaction capacity of ~7tx/sec ~ 18,4million per month. So 18,4million bitcoin users could make each 1 onchaintransaction per month.
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:06:59
does lightning network solve the problem of the total amount of users? could 100million users use lightning and and get their money to/from the blockchain once per month?

in case of boredom: just take some jabs at r/btc that will teach em.
well done sir!
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:04:48
increasing blocksize could also lead to more people in total getting into bitcoin and wanting to run a node so it compensates a bit for the dropout node-count. I agree that the % of btc-users running a node will drop.

gave me a good laugh.. i hope you dont mind that i posted it.
@_date: 2017-02-11 12:47:09
so you would only need some entity opposing bitcoin to provide 6% of the hashrate to block any evolution ever in bitcoin. if i were part of the banking cartel this sounds like peanuts to me.
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:42:17
you cant put everybody in the same bag. i want a sensible bigger blocksize and segwit and i'd prefer core would come up with a solution. most folks there just prioritize bigger blocks over segwit/lightning. I'm convinced both will be necessary for bitcoin to gain more users and popularity.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:50:45
I'd understand if a miner would set a min fee/tx to cover his expenses but not reducing the size of the block artificially to reduce bitcoins tx capacity
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:12:20
I'm skeptical. on the github page( it says: Bitcoin Core v0.14.0 UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)
Maybe somethings wrong here
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:45:29
512mb memory might not be enough at all. you could create a swapfile with 1,5GB to compensate. might murder your sdcard though.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:06:03
well it seems users don't have enough power over them to make em activate segwit which is a small increase in onchaincapacity, some bugfixes and opens doors for L2 which bitcoin would really need.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:57:47
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:12:17
thanx! digged in as well and got my windows node up and running. unable to compile it for my raspberry pi arm32 though.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:44:49
Will there be an official bitcoincore client with BIP 148?
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:11:12
./autogen.sh CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/
this didnt work for me. instead I had to split this command in two. 
make and make install worked as you described
I'd expected it to show as 0.14.0 uasf or something. Instead it shows as 0.14.99 ... weird.. guess i compiled the wrong client
edit: didnt work for 
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:32:15
UASF please.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:53:55
i don't understand why the users let themselves bully that much from the miners. the miners are only able to stall any progress because we let em. i really hope theres an official tested bitcoincoreclient with BIP148 soon. at the beginning users and miners were the same thing. now many miners become more and more like banksters. power corrupts i guess.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:02:00
so how do i compile this on my win10 machine? anybody got a good guide?
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:28:26
binaries for win64 and arm32 please!
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:57:27
f2pool could block it. Users are in charge though so UASF and be done with this circus
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:34:13
but isnt 90% off the current miners signaling for 2x? doesnt that mean that there will only be 10% hashrate left on the original chain?
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:06:04
till LN works keep calm and use bitcoin as little as possible. at the moment its just digital gold with some extra features
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:33:38
sucks that theres no mining hardware competition.
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:31:36
i sure hope core will come up with a contingency plan. if really 90% of hashrate leaves and even only for 2 weeks i expect it to hurt bitcoin quite a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:43:58
I'm kinda surprised with how long segwit is on the line that there is so little walletsupport for it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:35:19
murrica! fuck yeah! 
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:45:53
wtf is it with the media and the image of bitcoin as a physical coin? it annoys me every time its done.
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:04:59
can someone help me understand transaction price in $ on blockchain.info?
how can the average be that high? i never paid more than 10cents so why does it show transaction costs of ~6$ or more?
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:45:03
fuck yeah!
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:51:08
just spend em on bitcoin. there shouldnt be a withdrawal limit with XBT. or you could deposit the minimum amount of £ and then withdraw it all.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:32:31
the next GFC is baked in the cake. it will come sooner or later no way around it. and when it does capital will flow into assets, cryptos for sure too
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:42:25
what about the potential loss of a lot of hashpower? i mean if the hashpower drops to a 1/6th and it takes 2016hours for retarget that would be quite painful imho. then we have the next hardfork incoming? with a new pow and difficulty and 4 bitcoin forks in total...
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:55:55
Well that would suck for me because Im allready all in and dont have anything left to buy more
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:53:21
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:51:02
finally segwit support.... faster than core devs i guess
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:20:41
Kraken had the biggest btc/eur pair by far... what are my other options? which is better gdax or bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:11:56
I really hope bitcoin somewhere in the future aims to provide secure affordable instant transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:45:28
too bad theres only like 40 nodes running UASF clients
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:12:07
thats why miners need a little UASF push. they either lead follow or get the fuck out of the way. if they dont want to mine a sha256 altcoin, or even throw their asics in the trash they better follow the users. once UASF binaries are provided by a reliable source I expect the node-counter to rise substantially. I could provide binaries for raspberry pis and 64-bit windows but how can I prove its made from the sourcecode of  
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:16:19
thats no FUD man and I wasnt cynical. I'm just disappointed that so few people are willing to go thru 2 hours of work and compile the bitcoin core 0.14.0 UASF client. I'm running 2 UASF nodes and I hope you're right. With so many core nodes running I just expected more people to upgrade their nodes to UASF. I wish I could provide binaries for the lazy users but its not possible to prove that they are compiled from the UASF source.
@_date: 2017-04-05 06:01:01
bitnodes shows only like 40 UASF nodes... 2 of which are mine. long way to go
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:07:13
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:40:32
ouch... sorry for your loss. :(
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:41:55
the guy is as good as dead
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:42:43
to be fair a paper wallet is unlikely to fail for a while or getting hacked
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:41:55
the guy is as good as dead
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:11:29
as long as there are no signed binaries available uasf wont happen. the majority dont compile their stuff themselves.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:08:54
holy shit there are compiled signed binaries for those lazies not willing to compile themselves and still so little uasf nodes. so frustrating
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:06:34
no thanks I'll keep running my 3 UASF nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:37:43
if it locks in tomorrow... how long until real activation?
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:47:46
i wonder then why i have consistently 200GB+ upload/week on my full node
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:35:02
yeah because there were no financial crises before cryptos... 
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:54:02
I upload about 200GB/week and consider this allready a lot.... 10 TB is very generous of you.
