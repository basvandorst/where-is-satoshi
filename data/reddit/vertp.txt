Yeah thats not really a solution either. The application needs only a web api. Blocktrail does this too but I need python support :(

Correct. I just want a simple api. I dont need USD stuff and I dont want to give my own personal info. I am using blockchain.info not but they have a limit of 1000 addresses per wallet which is forcing me to make new wallets

Then it makes sense why you so frequently do soul searching on reddit in exchange for gold. 
In my experience, deep sorrow is the only thing that can improve your life. Sadness is like a weight, you push against it only to become stronger. 
If you want to live, get really sad, and then fight your way to happiness. 
You have enough influence (financially) to benefit a lot of people, not directly, but through guidance. Since you were "self made" you can understand the commoners mentality. If you can summon the will to make the world a better place, you certainly will be able to.

Because you wont say what it is. This is super common with anything technical, people assume that their brilliant idea takes a line of code to implement and that's its worth a million dollars.

I'm not saying it's bad that it will increase the blockchain size, just that it will. There's no argument to be had here, I am stating pros and cons for each side. If there is a need to increase max block size, there WILL be larger blocks, and more storage needed. If there isn't a need, then there's no worry either way.

Excludes more users in the way that it is less decentralized by way of full nodes. It doesn't exclude more users from using SPV wallets, does it? And I would argue that any mainstream adoption would have 99% of users using SPV type wallets.
I think you are limited in your description of a Bitcoin user. Are you really saying someone who uses electrum is not a Bitcoin user? What about coinbase's 1M or so accounts, are none of those Bitcoin users?

Hi guys!
I have been working on  for the last few months, in order to help spread .bit and it's improvements over standard DNS through the use of blockchains. 
Namecoin was the first altcoin, and was create primarily to be used in conjunction with Bitcoin. Namecoin is one of the few popular coins that is merge-mined with Bitcoin, they are truly two of a kind. 
GetDotBit is a namecoin registrar that enables easy and fast .bit domain purchasing compared to the bulky Namecoin-Qt that can be unfriendly and resource hungry (it has to download the blockchain like any other coin). 
I am offering completely free domain names for your first, and only 1$ for each subsequent purchase.
Oh, and I'm accepting a ton of altcoins through  
You are open to transfer your name out at any time, as well as update it's nameserver. 
I am very open to feedback regarding the site.
Thank you,

I'm using Google App Engine for hosting, so yes, US servers. I'm not storing anything user related beyond what Google will log by default, and I think they clear the logs pretty frequently to avoid storing them (at least clearing them from my eyes, no idea what goes on behind the scenes).
If you are interested in anonymity, I would recommend making a fresh gmail account and using that. 
The primary reason I am using Google's oAuth is due to it being built into the App Engine framework, but also because it is by far the most secure form of user registration, I keep 0 information about your password / ensuring user auth. If I ever get "hacked" the most they would get is your content and bitcoin address.

Mixers are never "legit", there is always counter party risk. 
Use monero for mixing, it's anonymous at the protocol level.

Hey Luke - how are things progressing at blockstream? 
Are you still actively contracting there? Hopefully the environment improves due to Adam Back's new role.
Wishing you guys all the best.

thats hardware, I can build software. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 00:51:32


I thought this would mean a separate hardware device, not something like mycelium which relies on the phones (likely backdoored) hardware.
