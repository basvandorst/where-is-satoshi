Crypto clear.

Nice one, exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
Bcash is a great temporary band-aid for using crypto as a currency, but Bitcoin is the future.

Can someone please do some maths for me? How big would the blocksize need to be to exactly match visas TPS at the same speed (or close enough) in its current state?

Can someone setup a proper poll? Curious to see the results between: Bitcoin, mBTC, bits, satoshis? For me it's bits.
Simply one millionth, couldn't have an easier / more catchy / more mainstream word. 
Cup of coffee: 200 bits. Future coffee: 2.00 bits.
Millionaire with 10BTC: 10,000,000 bits. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:15:28
Yes of course :) I'm just trying to figure out the whole Bcash argument. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 10:30:33
Do you have any plans to sell these? 
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:39:12
Ahh that's annoying :(
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:38:05
Haha, I added it because I just got one :) Yeah it's insane!!

Bits are my personal preference too, that system's scalable even if the price rises to $250k per BTC - otherwise just SATs.
mBTC just seems to be a bit of a hassle, it feels too low for the cheap stuff already (and will continue to get lower) and I wasn't really sure how many decimal places to put - I guess they'd always appear with inconsistent amounts of decimal places if it ever took off.

 version: 
- Added clearer headers &amp; borders
- Changed background colour
- General cleanup of margins / spacing
- Added additional decimal place to mBTC as requested (- Reordered list BTC &gt; mBTC &gt; Bits &gt; Satoshi (- Fixed wrong Tesla image (- Fixed typo on mBTC Tesla price (- Changed mBTC to mB as requested (- Changed SAT to § (Suggested by - I like!)
How does it look? Price has already fluctuated from $9,191.15, needs to be a live-updating webpage really :D Do I repost this or just leave it here?
@_date: 2018-05-03 12:58:09
I like that, i'll try §
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:47:11
How many decimal places should mBTC have?
I was under the impression that web-stores would show as few as possible without disrupting the value they receive.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:40:54
I have a sticky 5 key :( Will need to correct it!
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:14:46
I've not seen an example of this before, so I decided to create this mock web-store to compare how different denominations of bitcoin might appear at today's price ($9,126)
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:39:00
Are you just referring to the typo on the Tesla?

If BTCPay is too much for you (I felt it would take too much time to set this up and keep it reliable without frequent support), I recommend Coingate. I can't fault them and they've been fantastic so far. One thing I didn't realise beforehand was that they take the risk of double spends and satisfy orders instantly. When our users make payments in any crypto (includes bitcoin lightning), they receive their purchase and we receive the funds instantly.

I'd like all bitcoin amounts / prices everywhere to be displayed in mBTC, followed by the BTC value in small / grey print below it.
242.07 mBTC (large font, hold / normal)
(0.24207) (very small and grey but still readable)
You can't replace BTC denomination, at least at the moment. But something really has to be done. I think the above is the only realistic option, then in a few years once all exchanges / websites have used this and everyone knows and expects to see mBTC, it alone can become the norm.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:22:30
Am I missing something here? I thought 2% inflation per year is entirely intended, and good for a healthy economy - encouraging spending. I don't understand how the USD being devalued means anything negative?
@_date: 2019-02-01 08:45:19
The same reason why I left funds in MtGox. In the unlikely event that it collapses, there's thousands of others who will go down with me. Well... Me and thousands of others went down :D
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:29:57
We made the move from BitPay to Coingate a few days ago finally. Already we have more customers and less complaints where I have to tediously explain why their wallets don't work... I highly recommend.

Quantum computing brings us closer to AI singularity, which pretty much is magic - but will almost certainly happen at some point.

The only two subreddits I've read every morning for the last 4 years.

I sourced my 21btc from localbitcoins, they were all on my MtGox account. They were my assets that appreciated, not Mark's.
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:44:27
Yup, took me about 5 minutes to get in to mine! The box is a mess after I was done with it. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:33:53
Awesome, that's perfect thanks!

Quick question,  something I'd like to confirm. Is the 24 word seed everything I need? I wasn't given any private or even public keys with trezor. As long as I have the word seed, that's all I ever need? I can lose my trezor and everything, but if I have the simple seed I can still get access to my crypto? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:16:33
I have a query.. Does each node along the route need to have at least the required balance? This is something I've just assumed but maybe it isn't the case!

We need to get Andreas to narrate it in a short video series, explaining each part in at least 3 different ways. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:11:58
My point was - if they never traded back in to fiat currency. If most things could be  bought with Bitcoin there would be no need to.

I think roads are covered by road tax aren't they (in the UK at least)? Which is different. But there are plenty of other services required.
