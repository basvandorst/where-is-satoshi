Mike, what do we need to do, to see bitcoin succeed?

Digital BTC has already been listed. I cannot provide expert comment on valuation. Prospective investors should always do their own diligence or seek the advice of a qualified professional before investing.

Thank you!

It is precisely this dichotomy between being your own bank and putting your trust in a 3rd party that makes the concept of a 3rd party cold storage solution for bitcoin highly intriguing. 
"This paper wallet is 25 (or 50, or 100) years old. Does someone else hold the keys?"
I would add that their entire business depends on consumer trust, and they are hardly anonymous, but that doesn't invalidate your points. In fact, it raises the stakes. Given the anonymity of bitcoin, one has to assume that somebody, somewhere is going to try selling cold storage solutions and storing the keys.
If bitcoin makes it through the long haul, something like this is going to be worth a fortune to collectors when you and I are long gone.

Even if you are not an investor, this is very interesting because ASX listing means compliance with disclosure requirements; we get information about bitcoin profitability and risks for large, centralized miners. It's a source of information that until recently has not been widely publicized. No thought experiments here, just dollars and cents.

Thank you, I use mine all the time!

Thank you for your feedback. I am not selling these on secondary markets, nor have I, nor do I have any plans to. I am not recommending against being in control of your own keys. 
These coins are actively traded, in some cases fetching significant premiums because they are rare and highly collectible. The people who collect these are very aware of bitcoin, and bitcoin security. In fact, many of them have been responsible for exposing scams. They are not fools.
While there has been an arguably successful attempt at compromising the coins, which has been openly discussed by the creator and is linked to in the blog, I think it would be erroneous to sling mud at the creator who has been very open and done good for the community. 
My criteria for selecting 4.5/5 was based on a level of trust, and for someone receiving these first hand. I do not agree with all of your comments, but I do agree that this rating could be qualified or revised down, and I will take this into consideration. There is certainly more risk on the secondary market, but it would be very difficult to quantify.
I do want to make fair recommendations, which is important for the integrity of my website, and so I'm open to hearing all opinions. Thank you!
[edit] I have revised the security rating down to a 3.5 in light of the DefCon report. I do trust Mike (the creator), although he has never claimed 100% security on these things. I do believe that he took care in generating the keys, and that they were never stored.

Thank you!

Funny you should mention that, look out for a review of mine soon :)

There is really only one place, and that's the bitcointalk goods forum.

This is a great library! Bitcoin for the Befuddled is a personal favorite of mine.

Interesting, could you elaborate? Mine's been working quite well and had no issues printing wallets.. and I haven't had to update in well over a year. The "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mantra.

I removed any of the fancy formatting for mobile viewers. Hopefully this helps :)

That makes perfect sense, thank you! Edit: The KeepKey team has reached out to me, and you are completely correct. This is a feature. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 11:16:06
It works with Electrum and Multibit, and could be integrated with other wallets. Some users will appreciate the Chrome Extension, others will not.

Thank you for your feedback, I'm glad I was on target!
@_date: 2015-10-03 12:31:02
Nice use case actually! Hadn't thought of that.
