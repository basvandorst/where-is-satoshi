Couldn’t have made it clearer. Not trying to discourage anyone but this isn’t something you can throw a few dollars at and expect it to be a cash cow without a lot of time and work.

Looks good! Downloaded it little while ago. I’m going to be using this over Blockfolio for a bit because of the added options.

2fa was probably hacked by you going to a phishing site and not the actual binance site. Like others said, check your browser history- I’m positive you will see something similar but not actually binance. 
And please everyone, takes your assets off exchanges! Hopefully it wasn’t too expensive of a lesson. Cheers!

You can only lose ALL your money if you put ALL your money into it. In that case you are plain dumb.

Just remember that you’ve been looking at it for some time and it ALWAYS goes up and down. If you bought at 14k it’s only been a month or 2 at most. HODL and try not to look at the price everyday or even every week if your hodling for the long term. Bc in that case short term is irrelevant. 
Best thing to do is make sure it’s stored offline and consider it gone. No fud anymore bc your not constantly looking at a dollar amount balance and you will be pleasantly happy when you get to the point of cashing out an investment for whatever u may be saving for. Cheers!

Their accumulation must have hit their desired quantity.

Lol. Dream big I guess. But really a billion in 7 years? Might as well have just made up an imaginary number. Just imagine the chaos when it goes down for whatever reason with 1/20th of that amount of users
I’m all for competing exchanges but this sounds very far fetched and monopolistic if any single exchange holds that many accounts.
