I am glad that I am not one of the one's that had issues with this company, but I feel between BFL, KnC, and CoinTerra, the one that comes out on top is still CoinTerra.  They may get behind, but they have generally been okay in service in my experience.
Among the three, I will not return to BFL, and I never bought from KnC.
If Bitmain starts selling something with less juice per hash, I might go with them next time.

I guess I just got a decent one.  I'm doing nothing extra to cool mine, aside keeping it on a cool basement floor, and its run right at 1.6TH and about 55-70C.  I can tell one core likes to run hot as hell sometimes, but haven't had issues yet.
BFL and KnC are really no better overall from my perspective, I went through the long haul at BFL waiting for my singles from February to October, only for them to be next to useless in less than the time I waited for them, and I hear horror stories of Neptunes shipping in parts bins, I probably won't get another anything from anyone in the near future unless I see something change.

I think Cointerra is still the best of the big three, despite its failures.  At least all TM-IV's were crippled just the same, but they didn't wait 5 months to ship something that COULD do their specs, like some companies.  All in all, they are the best &lt;30nm choice at the moment, though not a good one either.

None would join this because for all of them it would be bad PR right now.  No one is going to vote them very highly, and *many* will downvote them all.
