Attention? Fame? Career cred for being the "rumored mastermind"? People do stupid stuff for such things some times.

He's famous in the industry as a guy who really wants attention and thinks that he's pretty great. 
This way he gets the credit (if he did it or not) but maintains the deniability when dealing with authorities.

That's what I refer to in the first section. 
The second addressed the broader topic of this post, namely bitcoin/webmoney/electronic currencies in Russia.
@_date: 2014-07-29 20:49:29
They wanted Visa and NC to pay huge deposits (2 billion USD) against the chance that they might cut off banks in Russia through sanctions. Visa and MC said that they'd leave Russia before paying it so now there are negotiations underway, that will most likey end w the companies in Russia working with local partners and not paying so much.
The Russian government is also trying to create its own payments processor and even freed a famous cyber criminal, Pavel Vrublevsky, halfway through a prison sentence to run it. Vrublevsky has lots of experience circumventing payments processor efforts to block/restrict him.
They did pass different laws about electronic currencies however. WebMoney got its start among criminals but it's pretty big in the legitimate sector too.  There others of varying legality as well.
As part of a series of laws meant to control online activity (mostly political, but fundraising and money transfers in general are part of that), anonymous payments are illegal. There are also caps on amounts that can be added to centralized, permitted accounts on a daily and monthly basis.
Other laws on personal data require that Russians' data be stored in Russia so that's where your data will likely be kept too.
WebMoney is centralized  and requires your passport information to join do they can operate within these rules. They won't take US citizens btw - this isn't a Russian law, but rather to avoid having to report about customers to the US per the US' anti-money laundering law.
If you are not a US citizen and you don't mind signing up with your real name and passport, transactions being centralized and recorded, your BTC held by a third party, your data being kept in Russia where the government can legally access it and your spending restricted by the amounts that you can deposit from abroad, then this might be something for you.
**TL;DR anyone accepting bitcoin may be seen as progress but this is not exactly pure bitcoin use in the wild.**

This one and the hacker in a balaclava leaning over a keyboard are two images that  I never need to see again, and two that I am sure to see over and over.

It isn't exactly victimless. He is not only accused of running silk road - he is accused of hiring hit men to murder at least two and maybe more than six people (including the roommate of one target - he told the person he thought was a hitman that if the roommate was around and they got killed too, he didn't mind). 
The only reason he didn't actually have them killed is that he was talking to an FBI operation pretending to be a hitman. The FBI even sent him photos that looked like a successful kill and he was fine with that. 
I still question life in prison when successful murderers get less, but he did more than run a platform to sell some drugs. He paid to murder people directly.

Russia isn't very happy with the idea of anonymous payments. 
There are already legal restriction for electronic currencies and payments  (Russia already has a few centralized ones - Webmoney, Yandex, Qiwi, etc.)
There are genuine security concerns, law enforcement and money laundering concerns and also political control concerns. 
I can see many reasons why an official in Russia would decide to restrict Bitcoin. Even without a full ban I do expect restrictions on exchanges and payments. The law already prohibits any anonymous/unverified accounts of more than 15,000 rubles (about 250 USD) and verified accounts have a maclximum of 60,000 (so about 1000 USD).
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:23:07
It's even easier to track the other centralized electronic currencies, but they are quite regulated. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 13:47:40
It is easier to make Bitcoin anonymous enough that Russian authorities can't find the end beneficiary than it is for the centralized electronic currencies most popular in Russia. 
I can understand why authorities would be concerned. 
Even if ultimately Bitcoin is allowed on the same level as the others, there are still those restrictions on account and transfer size to contend with.

They did now. Many smaller business have no idea what the risks are or how to address them before something bad happens.


Also, I hope they now have good backup (key for ransomware mitigation)

Ross did a lot wrong.
He set up and ran a system to enable the sale of El Chapo’s products and all that entails.
He also tried to have someone with evidnce of his involvement killed.
You can argue about sentencing but he did a lot of bad things. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:13:42
But it isn’t. Because he wasn’t going I’ve never some excessive sentence for using or selling drugs. He was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics while enabling thousands and thousanda of sales of illegal products that most people think are dangerous made by people who are almost exclusively bad people (like El Chapo).
The US likes higher sentences than often seems fair but this guy is not a sad innocent victim to rally around. Not when there are too many actual sad people like three strikes victims that don’t seem to be moving things that quickly.
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:56:44
No one ever said the attempted murders did not occur.
They did and were established so in court. 
There were no murders, only attempted murders, because law enforcement found out on advance and staged them in a sting. Ross thought he had people killed and was OK with it.
The prosecutor chose not to pursue bathes because that case was messier than the other stuff, and they already had so much evidence that he was going to face a much longer sent eve than just the attempted murder anyway. 
But no one ever said they did not happen. On the contrary, they did. Read any of the coverage of the trial.
I felt sorry for his parents when they heard the confirmation that their boy tried to kill people. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 11:55:29
He got a cut of every sale.
He was a major distributor and enabler.
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:04:18
The murder accusations were not dismissed. The prosecutors chose not to  pursue them because there was no point - there was no more punishment that could be gained.
The exact quote and explanation and link to the court papers are already posted in this discussion.
The full description of these times are even present on Ross’s own journal that he posted online and saved on his laptop.
No one said they didn’t happen. Even Ross’s poor parents agree on this.
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:48:24
Because crime is a major use of bitcoin?
Sad but true :(
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:46:33
The fact that an adult may not have fully understood the implications of their actions (and attempted murders) does not excuse them from responsibility for them. That was on him for not getting it, he doesn’t deserve a pass for that.
The fact that he got set up so never successfully killed anyone is also not an excuse. The only reason he didn’t cause anyone’s death is because law enforcement stopped him. He certainly didn’t stop himself, he wanted death. 
Or would you be OK if you were the parent of a man he had successfully had killed because it didn’t “seem real”?
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:51:49
There are many examples of miscarriages of justice in the US.
Ross is not one of them though. He did everything he was convicted of, was a major enabler of entirely new criminal model and paid  to have people murdered (the only reason he faiked wasn’t because law enforcement found out first and made it into a sting. They even sent him a faked photo of what they said was a dead man killed on his orders and he was OK with that). 
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:18:07
This is semi true in terms of reasons people turn to substance abuse but not in terms of how addictive alcohol and those drugs are.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:28:59
Where do you think the drugs sold on Silk Road came from?
Canadian hippies’ organic cocaine plantations?
Ross was El Chapo’s vendor, just as he was for Chinese fentanyl smugglers and the Taliban’s heroin plants.
I believe that marijuana should be legal and drug addiction be treated as a disease first, but that doesn’t change the fact the the drugs sold so efficiently and so easily on Silk Road were part of a chain of hurt that extend far back past just the end user.
I also don’t believe in the death penalty, but Ross is complicit in El Chapo’s crimes. He enabled them. He played a key role in establishing the easiest way of selling them to end users that the drug barons ever had.
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:08:50
He got a cut of every sale
He ran the entire platform that made all the sales possible 
He knew he was doing it (even wrote a journal about it)
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:09:27
Well he was the main enabler and got a cut of every sale
The law considered a major figure in the entire platform and I think they’re right
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:09:56
Dude, there is a lot of proof
Including they guy’s own journals which he had online and backed up on his laptop.
Also, his defense team never said he didn’t do it, which is a pretty big admission
If you look at the actual filing (linked elsewhere on this page), the state of Maryland says that they are not pursuing the murder charges because he has such a long sentence anyway that they don’t have to - it will be messy and expensive and have no different result from what already exists.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:16:00
Silk Road sold a lot of opiates. Sailers have a lot of guilt but once they created that monster others profited too. Including Solk Road and it’s sellers. 
If you don’t like the mass sale of opiates, you can’t support Ross as a harmless guy who did nothing wrong. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:02:53
Also, he didn’t just “run Silk Road,”  He is convicted of money laundering,hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics 
He also tried to have someone killed who had incriminating information about him. 
All of which makes him sound a little more like El Chapo than OP probably meant. 
As for the connection to Bitcoin, lots of sellers used bitcoin on Silk Road. However, the fact that Bitcoin is popular among people selling El Chapo’s products and laundering the illicit proceeds is an argument against Bitcoin, not for. 
You will never get widespread adoption for something when “drug dealers love it!” is a prominent point.
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:01:06
Do you have sources on any of those numbers? I'd vey very interested to read them (German or Russian is fine).  Thank you.
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:02:22
His parents believe it’s real. 
The evidence included photographs of staged murder approved by Ross, financial payments, extensive communication, all handle do by multiple people at FBI and not the thieves, and also a big one - no contest of the evidnce by Ross’s defense team. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:51:53
Thank you!

Ross got caught in a law enforcement sting when he tried to have people killed before his arrest. I doubt he can do so successfully now.

What kind of adoption rates are you seeing? How much is genuine users seeking a currency as opposed to forex speculators viewing bitcoin as an investment? What is the regulatory environment like de facto and de jure? What is a "typical" Ukrainian user?

Using an email address he connected publicly to his real identity was his biggest mistake.
Assuming you don’t count running a major international criminal enterprise and trying to have people murdered.

[UN says 1/10th of that number were actually killed and estimates six thousand total deaths]( Even DPR only claims 3,684 civilians killed. [Russia Today cites Ukrainian government figures of 1800 military and 7000 civilian total dead for a total of 8800](
 
Six thousand, or even nine thousand, dead people is still a terribly high number of dead people, but not at the level that you describe. 


It was 46%, after [the central bank stopped supporting it on the recommendation of the IMF]( It has mostly [stabilized since then](
It is worth noting that, from a bitcoin perspective, the terrible performance of the hryvnia may help bitcoin. Inflation and a lack of faith in the currency may encourage more to look at bitcoin as alternate means of saving, spending or transferring. Ukraine (and the whole RuNet really) already was more comfortable with electronic currencies before bitcoin came and attracted forex speculators and people who didn't trust the centralized companies like Webmoney.
It is true that the Ukrainian economy is doing very poorly.  Economic activity continues, however. The GDP dropped from 183 billion USD in 2013 to 131 billion USD in 2014, which is  a bad and serious drop, but also means that there was still 131 billion USD in activity. 


Kiev keeps saying that the LDR/Russian military will, because the current territory controlled is not enough for a viable state, or even a viable frozen conflict zone. No one has though. Fighting continues and Minsk-II is violated by everyone, but there is no major offensive and it is almost August. I hope that there won't be, for everyone's sakes.

Every link cites the same German report, which itself is just the FAZ saying "according to security sources casualties could be up to  fifty thousand."
I'm not saying that figure is wrong, I am asking if you have any other sources. If not in total, but on a specific battle for example. If two Ukrainian thousand soldiers die per battle in a few battles, one can extrapolate that the total of Ukrainian dead is much higher than a few thousand total. 
If most are in Ukraine, are you aware of any reporting looking for the dead or the families? The graves and widows of fifty thousand dead soldiers is hard to hide - I would expect at least some online posts about lost family members.

If you read the indictment, he is not accused of selling hash oil, he is accused of helping launder the income made from selling hash oil, specifically that the hash oil was sold for BTC, and he bought the BTC for cash. 
The actual charges are money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transfer business.
