Stable is in a range of 10-20k for btc lol. Also they didn’t make all the money in one month. That month just happens to be a very profitable one imo

Post it and don’t forget to also show evidence of his 70% “hit rate” also thanks for his name lol. Very credible post /s

Because you don’t have any evidence???? Sorry I will apologize if you get some.

They made enough btc to crash the market for years, they can just milk it slowly by selling over time and keeping the price stable. Why let other people get rich when they already made enough to be set? They have to tools to keep the market stable via enormous profit to buy up a crash and have already earned more btc on paper than physically possible.
Think of it this way, how could the entire crypto market be rigged? You have enormous lowball orders for eth as an example.. you buy btc and cause a rally until eth crashes into your order, then stop and let the market bring you up and make your total cost basis smaller. Rinse and repeat until you have more than any other market participants, now you control the market.

The reason they can get away with it is because they are rich and have influence. 
It doesn’t sound like you do... good luck lol

If his operational security is perfect then they wont. If he makes one mistake, he will be investigated. The longer he evades the bigger the bounty. It’s harder to prove you don’t own something than to prove you do, and they will get you hard for that reason

You made a mistake and now telling others to do the same ?

Proof? U sure it wasn’t just a ton of traffic from users? The space grows every day

Don’t do anything let the market move it. Actually, buy more

In order to buy someone has to sell lol

Core developers will still do their thing and users are free to support them by participating behind them instead of 2x. Users do matter if they all leave 2x as soon as the smoke clears.

They are regulating exchanges, not banning. A lot of capital was leaving china via crypto as well as laundering and scam ico's. Your conspiracy still holds water though, explains why u.s. news spread additional fud.. to get them to cash out cheaper before regulations are set up 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:31:09
I think you meant withdrawing to somewhere that does not support 2x. I would put them in cold storage absolutely if you don't plan on selling. You will have control of your coins as well as any forked coin if it's in cold storage, if you leave it on coinbase ultimately they decide what happens with your purchase at the time of the fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:12:59
Tell us your story. I think it will be a wild ride

Dot com also was at 6 trillion before it popped

People want to be the first into btc for the fork and ride the wave upwards, but there is still a month left so who knows if this is just a good opportunity to buy Alts or if this will continue until fork. I expect people to take profit from btc and reinvest to alts. Nobody wants to cut losses on Alts just to have them rebound as soon as they do. I can't see this panic selling happen all month but who knows lol
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:14:59
Since they would let you take a small deposit of funds out at a loss, they will surely let you take a large one out at a 100% gain. Is that really your logic?
A scammer will try to make think it's safe by letting you withdraw a small investment and then you are hooked and deposit a large one you will never be able to withdraw. Your mind is clouded with greed just take a moment to think and research some stories of people who got scammed in a ponzi, it seems like you are acting like a perfect target to be a sucker.

I think there is game theory involved: in your example all governments would have to work together. All governments do not agree, and if there is a benefit in keeping it legal as a strategic advantage against the u.s.  dollar for example I don't see it as an employable strategy. 
Banks/fiat institutional networks are the most powerful influences on the planet - they wage(fund) wars and occupy almost all countries. Why would they take a different approach? But ultimately it is the users who decide if it dies or not

lol "daddy I sold my bitcoin and now it's too expensive!"

The dot com bubble was at 6 trillion $ before it popped we could have a ways to go who knows

It has more to do with stopping criminals that use bitcoin to get wealthy than it has to do with "robbing them" but ya spin it however I guess.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:37:24
If bitcoin goes up 10% from what you bought at, you will get 10% of your investment
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:05:36
Try sending a 0 fee to an address you own, perhaps it will go through on the fork chain and be returned on the core chain

this is the birth of a new wealth

China is concerned about money laundering and money leaving china. If they ban it then all the money will be black market. To avoid this china is just pressing pause and drawing up a rule book in my opinion which is good for bitcoin
