Let's put it this way: What if, even though the event carries only an infinitesimal probability of happening, next address discovered comes out to be one that a large and established exchange uses for user's deposits? Or that a future address discovered belongs to a major donation receiver eg. Wikileaks?
I think that being 99.999999% sure that it will not happen because of low probability, doesn't mean that won't happen.
Any precautions one can take? Will use of a multisignature address remove risks from this kind of brute-forcing?

Ok, reassuring to know you are following the issue. I will wait for more updates on my ticket. Thank you. :)

Yeah, before trying them, I wanted to be really sure I could not do this by myself..

Just tried the ViaBTC transaction accelerator for a transaction I had stuck. Returns "Submissions are beyond limit. Please try later."

This story is becoming even more ridiculous. 7 days after and 3 replies (without their answer) to my own support thread I am still "locked out" of my account. My login details don't get recognized for some kind of "error" on Hashflare side and even after resetting password multiple times.
A few days ago Iw would have said differently, but now:
STAY AWAY FROM HASHFLARE AND FROM BUYING THEIR SERVICES!
