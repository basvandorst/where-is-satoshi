Don’t flatter yourself.....
The nsa probably has full galleries of your nutsack already.

Nobody should be scared, it’s all going to be fine. Read more about Google’s computer, it’ll be obvious pretty quickly it’s not something to worry about

Gubernment all bad lizard people trying to rape your children, even da frogs fags now cuz of them. Bitcoin means I won’t have to pay for schools and roads which is really how the elite lizards rape kids at pizza parlours. 
Seriously man some of the bitcoin community need to get a grip, lots of billionaires are extremely fortunate people who are also greedy but in large are as dumb and human as anyone else. The system we live in is pretty fucked, but there’s not some shadow group of a couple of people pulling the strings. It’s all part of a complex system full of special interests and power that we all as societies kind of fell into over time, but has over time learnt to sustain itself.
Bitcoin and blockchain has the potential to change it all for the better or worse. It’s not some super sayan sword that will cut the heads off your imaginary snake cabal. They’ll be winners and losers like all systems. Maybe one day the hodlers will be the ones framed as the illuminati. Maybe it would be best to have real adult discussions about how to mitigate the disadvantages to society and excentuate the good, instead of saying things along the lines of “get rekt military industrial complex”. 
There’s an undercurrent of language used in this conspiracy theory way of talking that smacks of antisemitism too. 
Nothing is all bad or all good. Stop framing bitcoin as infowars wet dream, it makes us all look bad. Instead go and watch another David Icke video and leave this sub alone.

Bitcoin price went below an arbitrary number therefore it’s over, turns the lights out, finito. 
@_date: 2019-10-22 09:05:01
Wait I need to draw a load of stupid running average lines and arrows to make it seem like I’m not guessing. Which takes time and expertise because it’s not a complete stab in the dark.

The 5 best ways to lose all your sats in a matter of hours. Proper risk management isn’t fool proof and ‘risk management’ is why big funds pay big money for proper risk managers, it’s hard!

It’s an article on the verge. A den of stupidity.
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:55:53
It’s filling the sub with this trash that frustrated me today as it’s filling my feed, and yes they all are basically the same post. There are more interesting topics being drowned out. I don’t really see the point of your post.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:55:02
Lines, numbers and nonsense
Edit: I feel like the lines should be in crayon.
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:26:52
Just when I thought this sub had reached rock bottom

Yea listing Kraken over Coinbase as a reputable exchange is like saying hitler was better than Mussolini.

Bitcoins been around since the 18th century?
Edit: every Tom dick and Harry content creator says they predicted the current price. It doesn’t take technical analysis to watch it stagnate in August before a cliff and ‘predict’ somewhere around 7500. Get a real job and the right sub.

Degenerate gamblers all have strategies and systems too. When they win, they call themselves geniuses too.

This sub is supposed to be free of this crystal ball hocus pocus chumps who just pump out inane price prediction content. Price discussion was supposed to be another sub, yet all it seems to be is garbage content creators hawking their “tell you want to hear but include lines and numbers to make it seem like I have a clue”. I’m unsubbing
The creators of this shit don’t care if they are right or wrong, or even know whether that fleshy thing is arse or elbow, they just hope you read and share.
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:15:44
This sub is turning so cancerous
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:19:04
Technical. You idiots said the same about 8000. Stop trying to use buzzwords to sound like you know. Past trends do not predict the future ‘technical analysis’ or not you are gambling at the same time as pretending to be some sort of mind reader.

And in fact the rules of this sub are not being enforced, because this pointless discussion doesn’t belong here.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:45:28
Your a bot now?
Edit: every bot makes money? Even simple moving averages are enough to make money until they suddenly catastrophically aren’t. 
The main point here is this sub is not for pushing content creation, or squiggly lines that try and and make your mildly educated guess seem more than that. That is for another sub.
P.S. there’s a reason the wealthiest investors of recent times live by, time in the market always beats timing the market.

The most amazing thing is, they borrowed on the same asset multiple times. It’s like going to the banks and taking out a mortgage on your home 3 times with different banks, which will be fine til you can’t make the payments. Then telling everyone in your town they need to give you money to cover your mortgage payment otherwise the banks might get mad and they would all lose their houses.
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:25:36
Yea it’s more like when you go to a currency exchange and they have a spread.
