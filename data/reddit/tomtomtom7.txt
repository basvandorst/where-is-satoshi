I think this is a really odd usage of the term decentralized. Decentralization does not equal number of servers. 
Facebook is not more decentralized then Diaspora.
A protocol can be centralized, decentralized or distributed. The bitcoin protocol is decentralized even if only me and my mom use it; the federated signers model is centralized.
There is something to say for *quantifying* "decentralization" in a decentralized protocol, but calling the federated model "more decentralized" is a gross abusive of terminology as it is not decentralized at all by design.


Yes, but if I understand correctly, a 2-way peg can be build as a softfork as it only requires outputs to be unspendable until they are moved back from the sidechain to the mainchain. This seems to be strictly more strict and hence can be done as a softfork.

The idea of BU is that miners can set their own spam protection. 
It is not profitable for a miner to spent its time verifying and relaying a spam block unless its buried several blocks deep, which won't happen because most miners will ignore the spam block until its buried.

It is not a bad thing that Blockstream is only interested in "offchain" solutions.
I just hope that people interpret the different stances on the blocksize debate with this conflict of interest in mind. Wouldn't you agree that that is a good advice?
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:32:45
Really? I thought it is actually this pretty simple. You simply mark the coins temporarily unspendable on the small chain with a script hash spendable  on the big chain (softfork).
For the move back the small chain miners can check the big chain SPV style. More accurately, the big chain can separate its "move back" transactions such that the additional load for small chainers is minimal.
I believe there is actually a rather complete proposal for this somewhere, with the difference that it proposes the sidechain to be twice the size with infinitely deep levels of increasing sidechains. 
Directly unlimited seems to be a bit simpler.

Haters tend to be most vocal and their existence isn't surprising.
A large part of the bitcoin community has a concern with regards to the unwillingness to increase the blocksize limit.
A considerable part of that part shares the concern that the group of people most vocal about NOT raising the blocksize seems to coincide with the group of people gathered in a company that sells off-chain solutions.
These concerns aren't a "conspiracy theory" and aren't that far-fetched. Hence these concerns are quite common.
Of course there are going to be some very vocal people that translate these concerns into personal accusations and conspiricies; these people are best to be ignored.

Why would you want to use designated signers? If you allow a 2-way peg with an unlimited chain, you can just rely on merged mining to secure the secondary chain.
It might not be "decentralized" in the sense that the big chain can only be maintained by large players, but still decentralized in the sense of not requiring a designated central authorities.
Personally I think the latter meaning of "decentralized" is much more important; I don't see the advantage of designated central functionaries.

I am saying that whether full blocks are good or bad is pointless, in answer to the article, which basically says "1mb that are full is better than 1mb blocks that are not yet full".
This is obvious; the more bitcoin is used, the better. It doesn't seem to address the question whether having a 1mb limit is good in any way.

The thing is, I *am* using it for coffee. Given that it is decentralised, I don't see how other people can call that the "wrong" use case, or what "the goal" is.
I am not sure where the idea of "visa" scaling comes from. We've grown to 2.5 tx/sec in 7 years and even cheap nodes could easily handle a multitude (though estimates differ, 5tx/sec seems undisputed).
Hence I should be able to buy coffee for the foreseeable future.

It is not about Blockstream as an entity influencing bitcoin; it is about some Core developers being influenced by owning/working for a big company with a business plan. 
In itself that is not a bad thing, as long as we read their opinion as being coloured by their financial interests. 
Blockstream's proposition is offchain solutions, which is undeniably a conflict of interest with regards to the discussion about the blocksize limit. 
This doesn't rhyme with several key members being very (if not the most) vocal on that particular topic and makes it rather surprising that their direction is being followed.

I hope you are taking into account the enormous advantage to the community of cross-pollination and an open stance towards out-of-core developments. Picking the unlimited-scheme would be quite a bold move towards a more decentralised and friendly model of development.

The actual fee model hasn't been worked out in detail, but it is safe to assume that money is charged for money being locked away. 
If Alice transfers btc to Bob over multiple hops, it requires the amount to be locked in each intermediate channel; hence the total cost can be safely assumed to be proportional to the amount of hops.
Furthermore, the speed and reliability (in terms of possible disconnections), decreases when the amount of hops increases.
Unfortunately, these are things that routing can't solve; Tor won't be equally snappy as Chrome.


I am not entirely sure why you assume that many people will have incentive to lock away little more so then one person has the incentive to lock away lots.
It becomes quite attractive to try to become the "Google of LN" especially since one person needs a lot less money to lock away then lots of persons would need combined (due to less hops in a star model).

I don't think it is about the majority of mod actions which is probably very good.
The problem is *very specifically* about not allowing discussion of implementations other then Core that propose changes to rules.
This terrible policy means that the possibility of changes can only be discussed within the framework and governance of that single implementation. 
Such role obviously cannot and should not be assigned to a single team by means of a mod policy and the obvious consequences is the growth of anger, hate and confusion.
The policy is obviously terrible for bitcoin and I suggest you fix it.
@_date: 2016-04-11 21:06:43
This is exactly where routing comes into play. If Alice wants to receive money from Bob, they will transfer via Erik. This way Alice *can* spent the money she has received because she can route it again via Erik.

What upgrade would that be? I thought a two-way-peg is perfectly possible with the current system and the only problem is how to make the sidechains themselves secure without merged mining.
@_date: 2016-04-11 15:26:44
Rusty may solve routing *technically* but you can't force routing on people.
The unsolved problem in LN is that it is always cheaper to route through the biggest hub regardless of whatever clever algorithms may have been found.
The challenge is not to solve routing, but to solve the centralisation pressure inherent to the protocol.

To me the entire activation threshold discussion is rather silly. It is *merely* a tool for miners.
Each miner can start mining limit-x blocks with 0% threshold if they want. Or with 3% for that matter. However its blocks would be orphaned
As nice service for miners, they have a mechanism to indicate support before switching to sync activation and reduce this orphan risk.
Whatever percentage they choose is really up to them. The only sensible way to set an activation threshold is to let each miner indicate a minimal threshold, and activate if at minimum x% of the mining power has a threshold of at most x%. 
Why would developers decide what threshold  is suitable for every miner?

It is a good thing. I don't think many people that have read the code would consider the awesome implementation of Segwit to be overly complicated.
Nevertheless, don't you think it is rather unnecessary and disingenuous to say that SegWit requires the same amount of code than BIP109? Even if you *only* consider SegWit-consensus changes for the first, and include all surrounding (version-bips, validation-cost-measurement) code for the second, the statement is incorrect.
If complexity of  code-changes were the *only* consideration, increasing the limit *obviously* beats SegWit.

I still don't understand this. If a (minimal) fee is charged per hop; and money needs to be locked in each hop, how is the *optimal* path not simply to route all through "OneBigHub" ?

Except that Alice can't pay Bob with money from Carol because that requires her to have the money open in two channels. Money she might not have.
LN can only work with hubs, and one dude with a bunch of servers and 100k btc seems impossible to compete with.
Even a few big hubs won't be sustainable because the more hops, the more money needs to be reserved.
@_date: 2016-04-11 20:07:28
LN works with bi-directional payment channels. Let's say Alice starts with nothing. Consider the events:
Alice receives 0.5 btc from Bob. This happens by creating a bi-directional payment channel between Alice and Bob, where Bob locks 0.5 in the funding transaction and spends it to Alice "off-chain".
Now let's say Alice want to use this 0.5 to buy something from Carol; this requires a channel between Alice and Carol. However she has only 0.5 in the channel with Bob. You can't transfer *that* 0.5 to another channel.
Although LN allows everyone to act as a "hub" and  transactions can pass through multiple channels, the money needs to be available in each channel. You can't magically transfer bitcoins from one channel to another as each channel is managed by a funding transaction with the signatures of only two participants.

Batching transactions destroys your privacy.
@_date: 2016-04-12 15:17:31
You are correct. 
Each channel is between two parties and is funded with a fixed amount.
If I have a channel open with Alice and one with Bob, Alice can transfer money to Bob through me only if the funds are available in both channels.
I cannot fund a channel with Bob with money from the channel with Alice because that money is locked only by the keys of Alice and me.
This is why LN works with hubs. Only if I have enough money available to channel both Alice and Bob I can act as an intermediary.

If I draw a graph that goes up or down every minute at random, *you will find interesting patterns*, unless of course you know it's random.

Relying on graphical intuition isn't going to help.
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:31:17
Good explanation but it doesn't touch on the fundamental problem for which I haven't heard a solution.
If I get 1 btc from Alice over LN and I want to spent it on Bob, I can't do it over LN because that would require me to have 1btc locked in two channels. 
Therefore LN only works if these payments are routed through hubs. 
Now if I want to pay Carol through a hub, the cheapest, fastest and most reliable one will always be the hub that has most btc available for channels and the most active channels. I have no reason to pick another routing mechanism than "route through biggest".
Although trust is not involved, such monopoly is still rather nasty,  and I haven't seen a solution yet.

?? 
I am not sure whether your serious or not, but CoinJoin is used to *increase* privacy. If *n* people throw in money in a jar and than extract it again, the money is harder to trace. 
But if I have 50 UTXOs with which I need to pay 50 bills, then using a single transaction *harms* my privacy as I am sharing with the world that these 50 UTXOs belonged to the same entity. This is exactly the information which is used by analysis software to deanonymize the chain.
Clearly for most people here, the reduction in size outweighs the reduction in privacy, as one exchange is deemed "fraudulent" for not batching; yet its effect is undeniably there.
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:13:58
It is not impossible, but if Alice is going to establish direct connection to the people she pays from and to, she will have to put twice the money in her hot wallet than she actually uses. This isn't particularly useful for the common Joe.
If I receive my first 0.5 btc from someone directly over LN, and I want to spent it on someone else over LN, the first channel would have to be closed before opening the new one. This way the entire advantage of LN is voided. 
Therefore LN is implemented by routing money through hubs; that is people that have spare money can use it to lock money for others.
@_date: 2016-04-20 11:09:28
Thank you for your explanation. This sounds really good.
The only thing I don't really get is, wouldn't it be much better to use the same scheme as other implementations? 
If different implementations are using different schemes, the actual gain is much smaller as it only can be applied within the same implementation. 
The gain from compatibility seems bigger then the gain from a better scheme.

First a channel between two parties, A and B is created with an on-chain funding transaction. Let's say with 0.2 from A and 0.8 from B. These funds can only be spend when signed by both
Both have an off-chain transaction (signed by both), which gives them their funds, and can always publish this. 
Now together they can create and sign a *new* transaction which changes the balance, for instead by sending 0.3 to A and 0.7 to B. They can keep doing this, constantly replacing the previous one.
This updates the channel on-chain. What remains is a method to ensure neither of them publishes an *earlier* transaction now deprecated by a new one. For this, every transaction contains a "punishment" clause.
Thus after the first 0.2-&gt;A, 0.8-&gt;B transaction is replaced with 0.3-&gt;A, 0.7-&gt;B, B could try to publish the transaction giving him 0.8. But if A notices this (within a few days), he can use a clause in the transactions script to publish a punishment that gives him all funds. 
(disclaimer: personally I think LN is a terrible model for scaling, and I believe Satoshi's on-chain/SPV scaling-model is much more powerful and decentralized).

It's very strange to wait for "them" to fix anything. There is no "they". There is no authority to increase the block size.
The nature of Bitcoin is that *anybody* can change the rules by releasing software. This can result in either:
1. Nobody uses the new rules. This happens if you would for instance increase the supply.
2. Everybody uses the new rules. This would be a "clean upgrade" happens if you would for instance fix a bug.
3. Some people use the new rules. This results in a chain split and will eventually allow the market to decide.
Although a block size should have been a type 2 upgrade, it was a type 3 upgrade, due the persistently believed fallacy that small blocks somehow aid decentralization.
I don't see how it makes sense to increase the blocksize *again*, especially since big block advocates are now on that chain, so are even in a smaller minority for the main chain than before August 1.

The problem of centralization is rather different. 
The risk of centralization isn't people running an SPV node instead of a full node as some people claim; the risk of centralization is people not running a node at all and trusting their keys and money with a 3rd party.
With LN, even if everything works flawlessly as advertised, there are certain "inconveniences": You have to pay a high fee to get on-board. You can't receive money if you aren't online. You sometimes have to "top-up" your channel and wait for it. Larger payment won't always find a route. You have to include your private keys on your hot wallet.
These inconveniences mean that it is cheaper and easier, simply to trust your money and keys with a 3rd party service, like  which dissolves all inconveniences. 99% of the users aren't going to run their own LN node, just like 99% of the users aren't going to run a full node.
This is very different with SPV/on-chain scaling. It is just as easy to run your own SPV node on your phone, which  verifies the PoW and inclusion of your own transactions using the merkle tree regardless of the block size; a trust and security model which for end users is practically identical to running a full node.
I don't think LN is bad. I just think that the on-chain/SPV scaling model is much more powerful and decentralized.

The premise you consider flawed is one which follows from the inelasticity of financial transactions.
Miners have set tiny minimum fees long before blocks were full to prevent flooding. The value doesn't matter much: people aren't going to buy more coffee or pay more invoices just because transactions cost half a cent instead of one cent.
Demand for transactions is almost completely inelastic and the only elasticity occurs when fees are so high that it becomes unusable.
True, as I believe in bitcoin, I do regularly  order a $12 pizza at thuisbezorgd.nl with a $10 fee, but I don't think it is common and the possibilities of spending shrink rapidly.

What you describe is the antithesis of a decentralized network.
They cannot *push* SegWit adoption, or LN adoption. They can only write code and hope people adopt it, *just like anybody else can*. 
With the fork you *should* decide which rules you think will work best now in the future. This is the only reasonable "emotional attachment", and the name of the fork is irrelevant.

I agree that Core has a lot of influence on such things because a lot of people just tend to follow Core. I am just saying that this is problematic. 
Open Source projects tend to fork if people disagree on the vision and the roadmap.
In the case of Bitcoin, many people have attempting forking to raise the block size. The leftovers in the main project stand behind the vision of small blocks, and currently [pulling out the champagne]( for how well their fee market is working. They aren't going to raise the limit. Open Source projects always generate meritocratic bubbles.
If people wouldn't blindly follow Core and would choose their implementation (and rules) based on technical merit, the Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin distinction would quickly resolve.
If consensus on the block size would be made by *users* (either by choosing their implementation or by a setting) as a decentralized network is supposed to work, fees would never rise above a cent. Instead we are using "consensus by whatever Core says".

SegWit is bad. It is a rather complicated change to Bitcoin which changes the incentive structure of verification to allow slightly more throughput, with as primary gain has that it is forward compatible. Non forward compatible changes are deemed bad by some.
For these reasons it only got about 30% mining support and only got activated after a failed agreement to compromise with SegWit and bigger blocks. This has caused Bitcoin to split in August into Bitcoin (with SegWit) and Bitcoin Cash (with bigger blocks).

I use the example of adding OP_HELLO as it can be done *either* as a hardfork *or* as a softfork. This highlights the distinction and shows that arguments such as "softforks are optional for users" are nonsense.


Sure you can. If you use OP_HELLO as a softfork with OP_NOP redefinition, old nodes are tricked to accept without validation.
If you simply add the OP_HELLO opcode, nodes can be programmed and configured to either: 
* reject the block containing the unknown opcode
* accept the block containing the opcode they don't know.
A node configured to accept such block would work *as if it were a softfork*. It simply provides the ability for the user to *choose* the behaviour without *unknowingly* removing validation.
This is simply a better upgrade mechanism.
Sure hardforks are heavy, but so are softforks. In the end, it is the change itself which is much more relevant to the difficulty of upgrading than forward compatibility. For example, increasing the blocksize is much easier than implementing SegWit.

There is no authority to solve the problems. The only way to solve the problems, is by *anybody* attempting to do so. This is what some devs did in August and what is now called Bitcoin Cash.

Of course it's purely self interest. That is the idea.
Miners care about the utility of the product build and sell: minted coins. 
This why they called for a blocksize increase and agreed to SegWit+increase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:06:54
Why? Some miners mined a few blocks that nobody wanted to buy. It died. That makes it a case 2 upgrade.

I really don't know where you get your numbers from. All you've linked is a list of some people who reject SegWit2X, which we both know was turned (from both sides) into a political power game.
Surely we can't blindly assume that all these people oppose *any* hardfork blocksize increase, without any recent public statements to support such opposition.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:13:49

I am sorry but you are wrong. The proof-of-work validation *only* involves the header. The 80-bytes of block header are hashed. Then it is verified that the hash is smaller than the target which is encoded in a 32-byte nbits field of the header. Then it is verified that the nbits field is correct as calculated by the DAA.
Verifying the PoW  and following the highest acculated work (which is Sum(1/target)) is unrelated to verifying the transactions
Your idea of SPV would indeed be rather silly, Bitcoin would not be scalable, and probably never got where it is today. At least I wouldn't have fallen in love with it back in 2010, and never started developing for it.


Both a valid block attack for full nodes and an invalid block attack for SPV nodes require either 51% of the mining power, or controlling all peers of a target.


You misread.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:46:48


I am aware that a soft fork is forward compatible. That is the idea of it. Your wording is a bit strange though. Yes decreasing the max stack size is a bit easier then increasing as you simply trick old nodes into thinking something is valid which isn't. This doesn't mean it's a not a change in consensus rules that every validating node must adhere to.


This has absoluteley nothing to do with HF/SF. 
If we introduce OP_HELLO this can be done either by redefining OP_NOPx (SF) or by adding a currently disabled one (HF). In both case it is optional for people to use.
On the other hand. If we decrease the max tx size (SF)  everyone must adhere it. If we increase the max stack size (HF) nobody has to use it.


What is the purpose of running a full node if it's not fully validating? It seems to me that upgrades that trick nodes into believing they are fully validating isn't a particularly secure practice. With a HF (eg adding an opcode), nodes can *choose* whether they want to accept it unvalidated, reject it or upgrade to ensure validition.


Yes. SF makes for an easier upgrade path by tricker old nodes that they are still validating. This is exactly what I wrote.

The hardfork was actually well tested, and went very smooth. The only way to get community support is to support it, and it seems pretty likely that Bitpay and Coinbase will soon do, and others will follow. Their businesses model is falling apart with $20 fees.
I am not sure what "real" kind of fork you are expecting. Many people mistakenly believe that larger blocks lead cause centralization so there is no way to get everybody on board.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:19:32
I am not sure that would work. With LN you can only receive money if you are connected. 
So anyone who wants to receive passive payments (invoice/salary/donation) will either have to run  a node 24/7, or pass control of their money to a third party.
As few people will want to rely on running 24/7, I think it is more likely that LN will cause BitPay and others to expand their services to ordinary users.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:19:06
Personally I don't thing a head count or authority is an effective measure. You should listen to the arguments and ask *yourself*: do you think limiting the block size is a good idea?
But if you want to "count", there are of course Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn.
Then we have all the developers currently active in the August 1 large block fork, such as: Amaury Sechet, Shammah Chancellor, Tom Zandler, Jonald Fyookball, Andrea Suisani, Andrew Stone, Peter Tschipper, Tom Harding, Jason Cox, freetrader, Ryan Charles, Marek Kotewicz​, Dagur Johannsson.
As for Core, I have no idea how many of the developers or contributors would like to see the block size increased as strangely, even with these fees, this doesn't seem to be a topic of conversion amongst them.
The only Core developer still speaking out on the subject seems to be Luke Dash Jr, who prefers a decrease.

Contracts are at the heart of what makes off-chain transactions trustless.


A channel between to parties is setup and updated using transactions containing contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:02:14
I also don't really think that LN and on-chain scaling go well together.
We saw before 2016 (and currently with Bitcoin Cash), if blocks aren't full the fee drops to ~$0.01 and 0-conf works fine for small amounts.
This would make it really hard for LN to gain ground.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:18:38
Well in August Bitcoin forked into one chain with Segwit "Bitcoin" and one with larger blocks "Bitcoin Cash".
This is indeed very confusing, but also deemed necessary as the two fractions couldn't get on the same page.
allows discussion of both, but as (positive) Bitcoin Cash discussion isn't allowed here, it tends to focus on Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:14:38
I understand that you cannot easily compare Dash, Monero, Bitcoin and Ethereum node counts. It would have been better to plot Bitcoin node counts at 1mb, 10mb, 20mb, but this data isn't available due to the block size policy.


This is incorrect. The block subsidy (in purchasing power) has actually *increased* drastically.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:31:22


I gathered that the ethereum count also represents listening nodes as non-listening nodes cannot be easily counted. I'll check that.


*Fraudulent??* I am using rolling averages which makes sense, and certainly isn't more "fraudulent" then rolling maximums. The fact that miners update their soft limit in steps doesn't change the argument at all.


The argument I am making is that VISA level is still many orders of magnitude out, so "visa today" simply isn't applicable.


I am sorry, limiting at this point as an economic planning measure for 2140 is IMO beyond ridiculous.

I am not sure what you are trying to say.
Yes, everyone can fork whenever they want with whatever rules they want. That was exactly my point. Welcome to the world of decentralized networking.
Personally I think that maintaining the block size is a terrible architectural decision. Increase it was in my opinion long overdue, which is why I am happy people forked to increase it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:33:03
sooooo.... what?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:40:33
You are right. I meant to say a larger block size *limit* which far exceeds demand, will always do, and will never attempt to restrict the almost completely inelastic demand to chase away people because of limited supply.
With larger blocks, miners impose minimum fees like $0.005 or $0.001 to restrict flooding without effecting the amount of demand. With small blocks and $2 fees, demand is effectively reduced.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:55:54

I am sorry for wasting your time sharing them.
Core is a group of developers loosely connected by a common vision and roadmap. The fact that early developers left (Gavin, Mike), and others started new projects with different roadmaps (eg XT,Classic,BU,ABC,BCoin and in my case bitcrust), could tell you that that vision isn't universally shared. Though you are probably one of the people that just believes everyone outside Core is dumb.
I wonder what it will take before you and others in this community stop treating there vision and plans as holy. Probably it won't be until a fork takes over.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:33:52
Your approach is understandable but also highlights a common problem in Open Source projects:
* It tends to attracts developers who want to create and push   their new cool ideas.
* The community tends to listen to the people with the new cool ideas more than the ones that say it already works.
The history of Bitcoin scaling is a prime example of this. Engineers like Gavin and Mike who tried to explain  it already scales on-chain with SPV have had a hard time getting through. 
While a cryptographer like Gregory Maxwell, who invented the clever trickery for sidechains, and went from "Bitcoin can't work" to "Bitcoin can't scale unless we use my sidechains", actually got a lot of support from the community and raised $300m to develop these sidechains.
Yet here we are, still following his roadmap.
More generally, this pattern explains why - despite the fact that the early Bitcoin barely involves any crypto - Core slowly "replaced" general engineers (and a google scaling expert) with cryptographers, whose ideas appear a lot more advanced. And why the current focus of Core is on things like MAST and CT instead of a more user-oriented (but "too simple") feature like a blocksize fix.
I am also impressed by the cryptographic expertise of Core developers; but it is this general attitude that has turned Core development into a cryptography playground, losing the focus on keeping Bitcoin usable.
The community is biased towards complex solutions. This is well illustrated by the recently pinned Andreas talk, where he said something like:
*"In engineering the simplest solution usually isn't the best"*
I respect Andreas, but surely I am not the only developer who raised an eyebrow there?

I believe that the block size limit should have been lifted years ago. Waiting for SegWit to be adopted isn't going to fix the fee problem.
Larger blocks don't harm decentralization. They *increase* decentralization. See my [arguments here](
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:07
Miners did not signal Segwit immediately in nov 1 2016, but did so on august 1, 2017.
So they "blocked" it for 9 months. (they were skeptical whether it would do enough to reduce the fees without a block size increase).
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:59:00
How does this counter my point? Deadalnix doesn't need anyone's permission to make whatever change he wants.
In this case, everyone went along and it was a clean "upgrade" (case 2). There is no longer a chain without the new DDA. Whether people did so reluctantly doesn't matter; I can assure you that if deadalnix or anybody else would release the code with a bad change (eg raising the supply), it wouldn't make it (case 2).
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:04:30
Well, unlike a hardfork, users can't really "reject" a softfork once miners have activated it. They have to either upgrade to the new rules or are tricked into not validating anymore. 
The only way to "reject" it is by hardfork away which is what happened. 
I am not sure why the times not being in sync changes the fact that there are now two chains, each with a different ruleset than before that every validating node must follow: one with segwit, and one with larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:11:41
I am not Roger. Ask him.
Some guy calling Bitcoin "my project" doesn't make Bitcoin less decentralized.
Roger in particular wasn't very interested in the BitcoinABC/Cash project during the months of development and testing before August 1, and started to show his enthusiasm for it only after the fork.
Still, he is not a developer and he doesn't seem to be involved in any of the development teams, or the technical discussions.

I seem to remember SegWit was locked in before August 1.
You are incorrect about the distinction between a hardfork and a softfork. Both are "voluntary"  only in the sense that you don't *have* to upgrade. 
But in both cases your full node is dysfunctional if you don't. Either it is dysfunctional because it rejects all blocks (HF) which defeats the purpose of running a full node; or it is dysfunctional because it no longer validates (SF), which defeats the purpose of running a full node.
Running a pre-segwit full node is like running pre HF bitcoin cash full node, effectively the same as not running a full node at all.
In fact, a hardfork is more voluntary as it allows you *not* to upgrade if you don't like the changes to stick to the old chain if some miners continue there. While in a softfork old nodes are tricked into no longer fully validating. (well explained [here](
So a softfork is a bit easier to upgrade at the cost of giving less power to decline to the users.
Both a softfork and a hardfork change the validation rules. And yes, I argue that BTC split in two which seems a rather accurate description, although there is obviously only one "Bitcoin" chain with the most accumulated work.
@_date: 2018-09-25 06:58:54
THIS is what I don't understand. BCH and BTC are decentralized networks.
An attempt was made to change the protocol, by releasing software that does so, to prevent the network from running at maximum capacity. This created the BCH network. It's a free world so it's up to the users to choose. Maybe you prefer not to run the change because you think a transaction auction model is a great idea. Or because you believe that at larger blocks running a full node would become prohibitive. Or because you don't think using bitcoin in brick'n mortar shops is relevant. 
I disagree but respect that.
But WHY would you base your decision on the opinion of people you hate? That seems backwards. I mean, surely every technology has troll supporters.

Incorrect. Both an SPV node and a full node download all headers from a peer. Then verify the proof-of-work in the headers. Because they verify this, they don't need to trust the peer.
The only difference is that full nodes download all transactions of blocks, whereas SPV nodes download only the relevant transactions in the block, and the merkle branches to verify that these transactions are indeed in the block.
(this is described in the [original paper]( section 8).


The work done is verified in the headers, both by SPV and by full nodes. 


1. Create and publish transaction that buys something (e.g. some altcoins shapeshift/changelly)
2. Start mining and withholding blocks that contain a conflicting payment.
3. Let the honest miners mine all confirmation until the goodies are in.
4. Release the chain with the different payment, undoing the actual payment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:42:34
The primary risk of centralization, isn't people running SPV instead of full nodes, but people using trusted 3rd parties instead of controlling their own keys and money.
Let us say Lightning Network works exactly as advertised. There are still some limitations by design:
* You can *only* receive money when you are online. So if you ever want to receive passive payments, you will need to have a node running 24/7.
* You can temporarily not access some of your money if a peer is unavailable. This will happen occasionally.
* You cannot use LN for large payments, so you will have to occasionally "top-up" your channels and wait for them.
These may seem like minor issues, but it means that for average Joe, it will be easier, cheaper and more convenient to trust a 3rd party than to control his own node and keys.
This is in sheer contrast with the SPV scaling model, where it is easier, cheaper and more convenient to use your own wallet that verifies the PoW and your own transactions, than to use a 3rd party.
LN may be cool for microtransactions, but for decentralized scaling it is vastly inferior to the SPV/on-chain model.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:25:02
Well, *one* argument sometimes heard against bigger blocks is that Bitcoin can work even if it is just a "store-of-value" and not "spending money".
But obviously not everyone can increase their spending money by buying Bitcoin, holding and then selling again. We can't create spending money out of thin air, so on average, people lose. 
You can only increase spending money with Bitcoin if somebody else's spending money decreases, or as they say by "selling to the greater fool".
So yes, *if* Bitcoin loses it's utility to buy stuff, it is a pyramid scheme.

No. Full nodes and SPV nodes differ, but neither requires trusting a peer. Also neither are fully cryptographically trustless.
When running a full node, if you receive a transaction with enough confirmations, the money is yours, *assuming* miners do not collaborate to undo it (which wouldn't even cost them mining power if they were withholding). We simply trust on their financial incentives not to do so.
When running a SPV node, there are some additional ways in which miners can collaborate to defraud you using invalid blocks. Unlike the attack with valid blocks, such an attack costs them $200,000 per confirmation as no exchanges or other miners would accept their blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:04:02
Miners cannot make a coin for themselves. They make a product (minted coins) which they need to sell to users. Just like Gazelle makes bikes.
If they create minted coins nobody wants, they are just wasting electricity. This is about as likely as Gazelle building a bike with square wheels.
Just like Gazelle, they *can* choose to mine blocks at a loss, and I would expect them to do so only if they believe a certain coin will improve their profit in the future.
In the end, miners are just maximizing profit like any business.

Whatever Ver may think, two dozen nodes is not realistic.
Let's say Bitcoin someday grows 20 fold, with ~80tx/sec, and 20mb blocks. A respectable player in the payment industry.
This would mean there would be 100,000s of businesses, analysts, statisticians, financial institutions, developers and enthusiasts eager to scrutinize the blockchain, *even if did would take some hardware investment* (which is unlikely).
The idea that larger blocks and more adoptions somehow leads to centralization is flawed.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:05:36
This seems incorrect. You are mixing up two distinct arguments. I will address them separately.
**1. Larger blocks lead to less nodes**
Nobody can predict the future but the opposite is much more likely. If we were to grow say 20x, with a respectable 80tx/sec we would be a notable player in the payment industry. There would likely be 100,000s of businesses, analysts, statisticians, financial institutions, developers, enthusiasts and freaks that would be eager scrutinize the blockchain, *even if this would take some serious hardware investment*.
The cost of 10 terabytes of storage plus additional resource costs, is orders of magnitudes smaller than the value of 10tb worth of blockchain data.
**2. For Bitcoin to be decentralized, every user must be able to cheaply run a full node**
I am not sure who came up with this requirement, but frankly it is rather silly. Not only does the idea of end-users running full nodes lacks a sense of realism, it also lacks understanding of how Bitcoin works.
Bitcoin uses a structure called a *merkle tree*, which allows anybody to verify the proof-of-work and a subset of the transactions. This means I can verify my own transactions without verifying yours. The decision for me not to verify your transactions *only* affects me. *It does not affect you, anybody else or the network in any way*. The idea that this somehow affects decentralization appeals to intuition, but not to reason.
@_date: 2015-12-22 04:21:40
This isn't correct. If you don't upgrade your node after a soft fork you are no longer validating.
As there is not really any point in running a full node if you are not validating, upgrading isn't voluntary.

This does make "libbitcoinconsensus" a misnomer. If I understand you correctly It is precisely these part of the rules, where everyone needs to follow what is decided in libbitcoinconsensus. 
Consensus would be for example, when every wallet can choose there own wallet format, but 95% settles on format X for interoperabilty.
I would personaly prefer that we use the same idea for the blockchain, where competing implementation can try out new protocol rules, but will only succeed if they reach majority.

I am afraid it doesn't work like this in practice. You cannot indicate your preference in a transaction; it will be mined anyway. 
You could as a node, choose not to relay blocks but these blocks will be relayed anyway.
I would say that by the very design of bitcoin, the ONLY ones that make this decision are the miners. The longest chain will be the most important as even it has different rules then most users like, it will have the most transactions and hence has the best view of reality.
The only ones maintaining the blockchain are the miners. To reverse an argument often heard here: bitcoin has very little meaning outside of the blockchain.

I understand. My plan is now to use bitcoin-js 3-times:
* The client (in browser) will calculate the bitcoin address using parent-to-child twice to give a 2^62 address space. In can monitor if a payments came through (for notification) on this bitcoin address using a generic bitcoin REST API
* The server can use the same formula independently (and bitcoin-js) to check if payments were made for a given file
* A server with the private keys will "scoop-up" the payments (again with bitcoin-js) for each file and transfer them to cold storage. 
I think it might work very nicely for my case. Thanks!

The idea of a decentralized network is that it is engineered such that everyone does what he wants; following only his own interests. It is purely incentive based.
There *are* incentives to adopts SegWit; ~30% less fees. At the cost of some development. The reduction in fees will probably outweigh the development cost, but as the current 9% adoption shows, the gains aren't large enough to hurry for most.
Naming and shaming businesses for their choice isn't an effective way to steer a decentralized network.

This was used during development, and can be used if you want to deploy your own server.

Me too. I am quite confident about the security, especially since there is no server-side code. 
But an extra set of eyes to confirm this would be very much appreciated. 
There is a brief explanation on how it works on [github](
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:29:04
What I was referring to was that it is easier to create a very secure system when you don't have to rely on securing your server-side application code.  
But you are absolutely right that as a user, you still have to trust me serving the right files. 
I was thinking about an easy way to provide a verification hash, linked to a Github commit, so that users can actually verify running the code as it is on Github; I have abandoned that for now as it is not very efficient to serve everything in a single file, and this doesn't work nicely with multiple files.

That is a strange approach to scaling. Scaling is about *growth*.
If we go back to mid-2016, before blocks were full, they were growing at an almost linear rate of 200kb/yr, or 100mb/500yr.
What do we do? Attempt to accelerate growth by improving usability? Maybe we can succeed in doubling it, or even quadrupling it to a whopping 100mb/125yr?
Or should we *stop* growth by allowing the limit to take effect, to introduce an auction where transactions only go through if you outbid others? A concept that destroys the most important properties of a medium of exchange: being cheap and reliable.
The idea of Bitcoin's growth out-pacing technology growth (HW &amp; SW) is simply nowhere in sight.

Also, they didn't split off their "own" coin. This is a decentalized network without ownership.
As there is no authority to decide on an upgrade, *anybody* can change the rules, which is what a group of developers did on August 1. 
The effect can be either:
1. If you change the rules for the worse (eg increase the supply), nobody will mine it, and if someone does, nobody will buy their minted coins. The effect is the same as not changing the rules at all
2. If you fix something trivial (eg fix the extra stack element bug), likely *everyone* will jump on the new chain and you have a clean "upgrade".
3. If you change something controversial, you split the chain in two.
Although raising the blocksize should have been a 2., it somehow became a 3., resulting in the current split. 
Some people endorsing a coin, doesn't make it theirs.

The mechanism I am referring to is verification of transactions and blocks. This *enforces* every implementation to follow to same set of rules. If bitcoin would be  *dependent* on every implementation being correct, it would obviously be too brittle.
This mechanism means that every implementation:
* MUST follow the rules. Otherwise the implementation won't work as transaction/blocks won't get through.
* CAN propose and implement new rules using a consensus threshold. 


But where does the consensus come from if you just say "everyone must follow the rules of libbitcoinconsensus"? 
By using the threshold mechanism, the rules will actually follow from consensus; otherwise "consensus" simply means conforming to the fixed set of rules.
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:14:42
Yes but currently the effect is temporary. During the attack transaction will be delayed.
Without cap, an attacker can create gigantic blocks that will need to be downloaded forever by all full nodes.

This is a tricky point. I am not aware of a good solution for this.

The point is that bitcoin has scrambled together lots of existing interesting technologies. It seems clear that the most important one, trustlessness through proof-of-work, is not relevant for banks.
However, things like scripted transactions, a public merkle tree for verification and public-key transactions with things like HD trees for partial trust are - albeit not new - still very innovative to archaic IT systems that banks are used to.
Using "blockchain technology" might as well mean, using "some of the technologies that bitcoin also uses."

I do state that transactions with a DIP may not be relayed. Furthermore, if I understand the code correctly, only miners can create OP_RETURN transactions with a 40&lt;length&lt;=80.
If the coinbase transaction would allow for multiple such DIPs it might be a better spot indeed.

I see; I need to use an index &lt;= 2^32. That's a bummer.
Using a larger "index" would be a very nice addition. My "orders" are SHA-512 keys of encrypted files and I would like to reference these files when making a payment. 
This seems to mean that with BIP32 I am not able to generate the bitcoin address directly on the client as I will need some centralized bookkeeping to map my SHA keys to indices.
It would have been neat, but I guess my use case is a bit exotic.
Maybe I can use the actual "tree" feature to create longer keys by "stepping" into the larger key. Interresting. I'll look into that..
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:45:02
One caveat is that it seems unfair to compare transactions per second.
Bitcoin can handle much more transactions. They just get pushed back until a more quiet moment which for many transactions isn't a problem.
This is in contrast to other payment methods where the limit is generally set by peak per second.
Transactions per day seems like a more reasonable comparison and target.
@_date: 2015-12-28 11:15:49


I am not convinced. The blockchain has an excellent and well defined consensus mechanism to counter this. 
If for example haskoin contains slightly different rules, then its blocks or transactions will simply be rejected forcing them to change it. If the majority were to use haskoin, then bitcoin-core's blocks/transacations might be rejected, forcing them to change. 
The beauty of this mechanism is that it not only forces developers to fix their bugs and users to upgrade, but it also allows for different implementation to try different rules by convincing the majority that they are better.
Where does this put users money at risk?

@_date: 2015-12-03 09:49:16


Although your wallet may ignore there chain, their modifications are not discarded. Modifications will simply be applied to both chains. 
If one chain will have a significant (&gt;75%) advantage, it is will be a more trustworthy view of the current ledger, and wallets and exchanges will have to adapt.
Conversely, there seems very little incentive for a miner to adapt to whatever your wallet chooses to display.

How do you run a node that doesn't upload?
Or are you referring to not allowing incoming connections? Because these nodes DO upload blocks and contribute to the network.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:28:29
No. You are still running a full node. You are downloading, verifying and uploading blocks.
The only difference is that you are not accepting new incoming connections.
As long as there is no problem in finding new connections which I don't think the network currently has, this is not a problem at all.
Saying that it's "part of the problem" is quite incorrect.

The real complexity issue is the design of LN. 
People seem to have a rather unrealistic view of technology where the underlying technology can be wrapped in a black box and the user can be presented with an optimal UX for payments.
Technology *leaks* through the black box. For example with on-chain bitcoin, if I have money scattered over many UTXO's, fees are higher. You can explain the underlying causes and technology to the user, or you can hide it as fees simply being "irregular" but you can't "simplify it away".
With Lightning Network, the same is true for technological fundamentals like: you must be online to receive money, your peer must be online to send money, you have money in different channels and money not yet in channels, you have to top up your channels. You can obscure these things with user friendly messages, but you can't remove them from the UX. They *leak* through the black box.

What concerns me the most is the incentive to hack.
Hacking (in the sense of breaking in to computer systems) is as old as computers themselves but has never been particularly profitable. Sure, if you're good you can find some sensitive company information, maybe even some credit-card numbers, but that stuff is very difficult to sell. Making a living from it seems to be extremely rare.
The fact that it is still so widespread seems to be because it's fun. Many kids just start doing it for the excitement.
Bitcoin changes this completely. Suddenly there is "hard cash" just laying around behind firewalls and this will ensure that hacking will become much more ubiquitous.
You could argue that in the end this is a good thing as it will change the way we think about security, but for now this thought is still pretty scary.

No. In practice for a brick n mortar shop, zero confirmations are sufficient, which makes the transaction almost instant. It is extremely difficult to undo/double spend the transaction; arguably more difficult then with other payment methods.
Only when very large amounts or for other reasons very high securityI is required,  confirmations are important.

Nope. Actually more nodes won't help speeding up confirmations. They always take on average a bit less then 10min.
This is because confirmations (ie block creations) are intentionally made computationally difficult. This ensures that after a couple of confirmations history can no longer be rewritten and the transaction becomes "certain"

The algorithm is asymmetric. The details of elliptic curves are not straightforward but asymmetric algorithms are very common in maths.
Consider two four-digit numbers A en B. Let B be the middle 4 digits of the seventh power of A. 
Now it is trivial to calculate B from A but very difficult to calculate A from B. 
Something similar is the case in an elliptic curve keypair, although it has the additional characteristic of asymmetric encryption.
Also note that calculating a private key directly from a public key is not *proven* to be impossible. It's just that it *seems* very hard and no known algorithm exists.

It's not a decentralized *git*. It's a decentralized *github*. Github provides a centralized home for open source repositories. 
The idea is, if I understand it correctly, to give open source projects a safe and secure home without the centralization. You could store projects in something comparable to the blockchain.
I can see some merits in this approach, as this would make it impossible to censor open source projects.

I believe a good anology is what biologist call an evolutionary stable strategy, (ESS). 
In comparing the market to darwinian evolution, we can consider product or companies that thrive as having a "high fitness" in the *current* environment, without necessarily thriving in any environment of the future. Companies have a non-zero chance of going broke every year, and hence have a limited life-span.

With the reference client's RPC interface, you can send a "raw" transaction. You would have to encode everything yourself, because you can't use the create-raw-transaction interface to create a transaction with an invalid address.
See:

The output address is not a valid bitcoin address. Instead it is an encoded text. 
It is only possible to encode a valid text of a few characters in a valid bitcoin address (a vanity address). 
It is however possible to transfer money to a longer arbitrarily encoded string, which was done here. However, because this is not the encoded public part of a key pair, the bitcoins transferred are lost forever.

No. Theoretically the confirmation speed can be changed in the protocol as some altcoins have done.
However, this would have no effect on the speed of securing a transaction. If the confirmation time would be changed to 5min, a transaction would be after 6 confirmations as secure as it is now after 3.

Your coins wouldn't be safe. They can simply create blocks without the one where you received these coins and outpace the chain. Again your node being full doesn't help you.  
Besides, even *if* users running a full node may make an attack slightly more expensive, such cryptocurrency could never scale because it would require everyone to validate all transactions.

BU are inferior coders. They "stole" core with minor addition. They use childish offensive macro names. They don't have a proper QA procedure. Their software splits the community. They are not allowed to be promoted here.
Yet *despite all this* they have gained significant market share *only* by adding a AD/EB configuration option.
The Core devs *could* conclude that *maybe* some users actually *like* that feature. They *could* add it to Core with its superior QA. If they think its a bad idea, they *could* just stick to the values core is now using as defaults. 
Instead, they keep playing guardian, trying to protect bitcoin from its own users. We should not be allowed to change these settings ourselves. 
That is not a sustainable way to work with your users.
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:20:08
The idea that you need to run a full node because otherwise nobody will and we wouldn't even *notice* an invalid block is rather absurd.
There are 1000s of companies, (block explorer, payment processors, analysis companies) that will *always* run full nodes, not for security but because they are interested in all transactions and the cost for them is trivial. 
The same way there will always be individuals (developers, enthiousast) that do it for the heck of it.
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:17:17
That is a weird inference. Of course companies support SegWit. What are they going to do? Stubbornly not show it on their  block explorer? Not accept it in their wallet?
For a business, implementing SegWit as first in your niche is a good idea, regardless of whether you think SegWit is a good idea, let alone whether you support Core.

Wouldn't an attacker be able to setup a miner and modify incoming transactions at will?
@_date: 2017-02-01 20:30:26
I think you are misunderstanding the concept of consensus. This is not something that software programs or developers have a say in. Only users.
Consider the block-reward parameter. Any user could increase it with whatever client he uses. However, he will immediately see that he gets no more valid blocks, and that his blocks are rejected. Hence everyone tends-to-agree automatically. 
This is why it is fittingly called a consensus parameter.
With the max_block_size parameter, the situation is a bit more complicated, because regardless of their client, users *can* increase it without much harm, albeit with some risk involved if they are mining. In fact, many users are using a higher max_block_size as we speak; there is currently no consensus on its value.
The only thing Unlimited adds, is the accept-depth feature. With Core, users can only set the max_block_size parameter *per direct*, but with Unlimited they have the option to allow larger blocks only after a certain depth. 
This seems like a reasonable feature as it gives some more wiggle room; many people like it and are happily using it. 
However, it does not fit the planning that the Core developers had in mind.
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:13:46
Except that you cannot actually use your bitcoin because anyone can change your transaction.
Even if it is still resource heavy to find the private key it will almost certainly be probabilistic so an attacker can just try on all transactions. 
Either way, bitcoin is fucked.

If what is valid is a concrete mathematical thing it must be either completely immutable or we need some authority to decide when there is "community consensus" on changing it.
I like neither, which is exactly why I fell in love with bitcoin and its decentralised consensus system.
The only way to deny that bitcoin works that way is to try to withhold options from users by calling them dangerous or even non-bitcoin.

Except that you *still* have to trust the mining majority to trust transactions.

I don't quite understand this. People pay fees to get there transactions through, but as the blocks aren't full yet, isn't currently exactly zero fee competition for space in a block?

@_date: 2017-02-10 23:30:10


No. An SPV node like multibit and a full node like Core  both can create both transactions and both publish them by relaying them to peers. Also, both receive their transactions from peers and verify them themselves. There is no difference there.


Yes. This is an important difference. Running an SPV node means people can easily link your IP address with your bitcoin address.


Not so much *enforcing* as *verifying*; it is not like other users or miners are somehow impacted by the fact that you verify it. This has very little implication in practice.

Sorry. You are right about that.

But there are always enough nodes to cover redundancy and relaying. Businesses have little reason to filter transactions.

You can't change the amount of power miners have. A miner is kept in check by other miners and the mining power majority can always collude to steal whatever they want or trivially destroy bitcoin's value.
Without trusting that the mining majority acts honest, no transaction is safe regardless of running a full node.

This is a misunderstanding. The merkle tree means that an SPV node only needs the blockheaders and a branch that contains its transaction to verify:
* that the transaction is in the block
* that enough proof-of-work was spent
* that enough blocks were mined on top
The only thing an SPV doesn't check is whether the scripts are correct and whether the rest of the block is correct, but that would require the majority mining power to cheat.
Hence, the *only* thing you need to trust is the majority mining power but you trust that also with a full node, as the majority mining power could  undo the transaction without even cheating, by  creating another branch.
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:47:55
So an spv node and a full node both *only* need to trust the majority mining power.

Block reward is defined by the INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD macro. If I change that value, my node would consider all other blocks invalid and if I create a block it is rejected by all others.
I can only make my node and/or miner functional again by putting it back to its original value. This why everyone tends to agree on its value and why it is fittingly called a "consensus parameter".
It is not kept in place because I cannot change my software because I *can* change my software, and the mechanism would work the same if it would be a runtime  slider instead of macro definition.


If I change the INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD value and mine a block it is also added to "the blockchain". But everyone except me ignores that chain. I don't see why people would ever want to accept a chain with a wrong block reward.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:51:03
You are misreading my comment. I *do* support users ability configure block_reward. 
Why and how would you want to withhold people the ability to configure this?
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:28:55


They *have* the ability to increase the total supply. It's derived from INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD which is a simple preprocessor macro. You can't make things like that immutable.
I would like to see this being changeable at runtime with a big slider. Everyone who changes it would notice that they are automatically cut off by other users. 
This would hopefully show people that it is *users* that determine the value of consensus parameters, and not developers, software or moderation policy.


The blocksize isn't fixed. As for the maximum blocksize, as a non-mining full node I would like accept larger blocks if the longest PoW chain contains them and I would like to indicate that to others. 
Both of these individual actions are beneficial to me and have no negative effect on the bitcoin network. 
We users are in control.

Although I am happy with the distribution model of bitcoins, whether it is fair is rather subjective. 
An early adopters advantage is fair, but quantitatively it depends on the decline in miners reward. If the protocol would have stated that the reward would go down 10% every 4 years instead of 50%, the early adopters advantage would have been smaller.
Would this be more fair? Less fair? Or are we just assuming the current formula has the maximum fairness?
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:18:01
But miners *can* trivially reverse every payment. You don't know for a fact you've been paid if you can't trust miners and therefore, the trust model for a full node is the same as for an spv node.
That is precisely the point I am trying to show.
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:01:36
I have no idea what you are talking about. Core has quite some features and fixes over BU but BU has a clear edge compared to Core in configurability and signalling of the max blocksize.

That is a decision purely on comparison of technical features.

The economy != full nodes. The economy is how we value the coins.

Your bitcoins are stored in transaction outputs, and transactions are secured by mining blocks on top of them (confirmations). This way transactions become immutable (and you become "owner" of these bitcoins), *with the assumption of the mining power majority being honest*.
Let's say you receive 1btc for something. You wait 10 confirmations before you send it. This is safe *if the majority mining power is honest*. The MPM could just do the payment, withhold blocks without the payment and after 10 blocks undo the payment by releasing a longer chain.
This way they can steal *anything* they want, or if they truly want to damage bitcoin, they can just keep undoing all transactions of the last hours/days. It doesn't require creating invalid blocks, and it doesn't even reduce their BTC mining income.
If you don't trust the MPM to be honest, you can't trust any bitcoin to be secure.
Or as the [paper]( reads:


cooperating group of attacker nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:09:38
Transactions are secured by confirmations *under the assumption of the mining majority is not colluding against bitcoin*.
From the paper:


cooperating group of attacker nodes.
Otherwise, if you sell something and wait N confirmations before trading, the mining majority can just withhold blocks while the honest miners mine the payment with N confirmations and then after the trade undo the payment by releasing a longer chain without payment. 
Similarly, they can undo *all* payments of the last hours/days by withholding and releasing, repeating constantly. This would make bitcoin utterly worthless. No full node is going to help you as they would be play by the rules.
Using invalid signatures or other invalid rules would be a very ineffective way to steal or do damage as it would cut off the honest minority.

It wouldn't be perfectly safe because 70% of the miners would be cut off by a single invalid-witness transaction.

A mining power majority can trivially steal coins by orphaning blocks. They can simply let transaction X gather enough transactions to be considered accepted, while mining blocks without X and then release their blocks, orphaning the block with X. Full nodes don't help because these miners are following the rules.
In the security model of bitcoin, transactions become exponentially more secured with confirmations *under the assumption that the mining majority does not act against bitcoin*.
If you don't trust the mining power majority, you don't trust bitcoin.

It is important because I would like bitcoin to continue growing at the slow pace it has been, until it bumped to the transaction ceiling a year ago.


You cannot run a sustainable decentralized network by withholding tools from participants. In fact, I strongly believe that giving users *more* tools to configure the behaviour and information advertisement of their clients is the only way for the network to evolve.


Everyone is free to run whatever software they like, with whatever parameters they like, including miners. The AD/EB feature doesn't change that.
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:33:54
As a fan of BU, I feel very misrepresentated by this argument. Decentralisation *is* the most precious trait of bitcoin but non-mining full nodes have no effect on this and therefore, neither does the blocksize.
This stems from the misunderstanding  that by checking all the world's transactions instead of just your  own you can somehow reduce the need to trust miners or even "keep miners in check".
This is nonsense.  For both SPV and full nodes, the security of your bitcoins relies on the majority mining  power being honest. The mining majority doesn't need to break any rules to steal what they want and therefore, only honest mining power can secure bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:45:38
So you are saying that the problem is that EB won't change in itself? 
You anti-BU guys cannot have it both ways ;)
On a serious note, we *could* expect some miners to use a higher EB because an attacker would pay the same amount  they would loose. 
Then again, miners have proven to be extremely conservative and rightfully so. It seems most likely that they *will* use off-chain coordination if only out of carefulness.

SegWit and Unlimited aren't too sides of the equation. One solves malleability, while the other provides extra configurability to users regarding the blocksize.
This is why I think BIP 140 is important to put on the table. This is SegWit "light" that fixed malleability and could easily be adapted by all parties, so that off-chain solutions can be developed regardless of the blocksize debate. 
If the protocol proves difficult to evolve, we must evolve in baby steps.

Exactly the same. Bitcoins are secured by *hashes*. How do  you think that non-mining nodes increase the security of the network?
Note that it *is* useful for many businesses to run a full nodes if they are interested in all transactions.
The security model for an SPV node *and* a full node is:
1. You don't need to trust your peer as you can verify the content it sends you.
2. You don't need to trust a miner as long as your transactions have enough confirmations.
3. You *do* need to trust the majority mining power as the security of your transactions relies on them being honest regardless of confirmations.

I'll try to explain: To give control back to the users.
The *only* thing BU changes is that it makes EB and AD configurable. Core uses a fixed infinite AD and a EB of 1mb defined in a macro. 
If you think that changing these values is not good you can recommend users against changing the values, but fighting against users' *ability to configure* this has no place in a decentralized network. It is *never* a bad thing.
A decentralized network *cannot* function by withholding options from users. This is also why the solution to the debate is quite simple: Just add AD and EB as optional parameters to Core and let users figure it out. The devs need to stop thinking as guardians and start thinking for their users; that's decentralized networking 101.


This makes no sense. The game theory of a decentralized network works with the assumption of rational selfish actors that choose a strategy of how their node behaves and how it advertises it behaves.
There is no game theoretical framework for decentralized networks based on the idea that actors should be prevented by their software from changing the behaviour of their nodes. That would no longer describe a decentralized network.
Actors either have an advantage in changing EB/AD or they don't. They can't have an advantage in not being able to change it.

Let's say I receive 1btc in exchange for X. I wait 10 confimation before sending X, because then my 1btc is safe and I can consider myself the owner.
But a mining majority, can just pay me the 1btc, and then mine and withhold blocks with a conflicting payment. They can then release their longer chain after the 10 confirmations from the honest minority. This doesn't cost them any mining income. 
My bitcoins are mine when their are enough confirmation, *only with the assumption that the mining majority is honest*. If I don't trust that, I don't trust bitcoin.

I believe the problem is precisely the meritocratic everyone-can-contribute model of development.
Sure, this means that people with technical merit are *de facto* in charge. But conversely, what constitutes technical merit is determined by those *de facto* in charge.
The result is a *meritocratic bubble*; the experts are constantly in happy agreement over technical issues (we constantly read how much technical consensus there is). And those not in agreement are outside  the bubble and considered "non-experts".
The meritocratic model sounds nice but I don't think any successful Open Source project relies on it as you need to have an environment with different technical opinions. Most have either a benevolent dictator, or a more conventional hierarchical structure.

You can set AD to a million to make your node behave the same as Core with a fixed max_block_size.
Personally, I rather set AD lower, because I want my node to follow the longest PoW regardless of the blocksize but that is really up to the user.
@_date: 2017-02-27 08:50:33
This makes sense. But the difficulty is, that the meritocratic everyone-can-contribute model of development of Core makes the assessment of expertise tricky.
The idea of this model is that people with technical merit are *de facto* in charge of Core. This is nice and working, but it also means that those *de facto* in charge determine what constitutes technical merit.
The result is a *meritocratic bubble*. Everyone outside the bubble is considered non-expert, and everyone inside the bubble is in constant happy agreement with each other.
Notice how often we hear that *all the experts agree*? Notice how people seem to believe no good developers disagree with Core's scaling plan?
There are not many (if any) Open Source projects with sustained success that employ this meritocratic model, for good reason. You need a proper organizational structure, or a benevolent dictator, to allow competing ideas to bloom.

Actually it's neither. It is just a local policy that doesn't change the rules.
However it costs miners quite a lot of money to run. The disadvantage of ignoring an incoming block is that if you find a block, you're not yet the longest chain and the chance of being orphaned is substantial.

They *have* control over everything. All these parameters are just macro definitions that can be changed by anyone. It is Open Source software.
The fact that many of these parameters are resistant to change is *not* because it is made difficult by the software but because of the selfish behaviour of individuals. If I change one of the things you just suggest I would no longer see valid blocks coming and the blocks I mine would not be considered valid by others.
Bitcoin has in common with other decentralized networks that it needs a game theoretical basis to function: it is designed such that things that shouldn't change are resistant to change because it is disadvantageous for an individual to do so.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:23:41
Invalid blocks are orphaned by other miners. Full nodes are irrelevant for that. 
If miners change the rules, how would they even *notice* which non mining full nodes accept it? It's irrelevant. 
They only notice the effect on the value we give to a bitcoin. In case of a split you exert influence by valuing each side differently, again irrespective of using a full node.
I understand it goes against intuition and common narrative but *none of these arguments* for full nodes hold.
SPV uses the *same* trust model.

I am not saying full nodes are not needed. I am saying it doesn't decrease trust compared to an SPV node.
There will always be enough full nodes because payment processors, block explorers and other businesses have little reason to filter blocks.
There is no benefit in rejecting a block that creates 100 btc because it will be orphaned.

For  I derive an HD address client side and display it to the user.
Given the choice to show a SegWit address that 90% of the wallets support or a non-SegWit address that 100% of the wallets support I am afraid I must choose the latter and wait for full adoption.

This is why users (miners/non-miners) have a strong incentive to follow the same rules. Some rules are part of consensus because of this everyone-tends-to-agree behaviour of nodes in the network, not because they are prescribed as such.
If you start to look in more detail, you will find that not all rules are the same. Try this with your (non-mining) full node: Recompile with a higher initial_block_reward; your node will stop functioning. But recompile with a higher max_block_size; your node will still function.
This doesn't mean increasing it is a good idea. It just shows the importance in  *describing* consensus instead of *defining* it.

Let's consider this without calling things lies, misinformation and trolling. That is not helping anyone.
Let's say 5% of the hashpower and almost all non-mining full nodes support SegWit and activate it.
Then a single rogue miner can add a SegWit transaction with invalid witness data. Its block will be accepted by the 95% of the miners not supporting SegWit, but not accepted by the 5% supporting SegWit and the full nodes. This is what people mean when they refer to the "anyonecanspent" line.
Because the chain of the 95% will not be outpaced by the 5% chain, we will have two chains one with and one without SegWit.
You can argue that it doesn't matter if all users follow the SegWit 5% chain, but it's definitely not a safe situation because if 95% of the miners allows itself to be cut off their income, they probably don't have good intentions. As 95% of the mining power can trivially take whatever they want for free, bitcoin cannot possibly survive that.

I don't really understand why this is needed. I could just put 1btc in escrow and offer to sell  1btcX for 0.9btcY after the fork.
You can then put 0.9btc in escrow and accept the bid.
After the fork, when coins are "doubled" to both chains, a transaction is posted to both chains such that I have   1.9btcY and no btcX, and you would have no btcY and 1.8 btcX.
The meaning of btcX and btcY can be defined beforehand using blockversion/version bits.
Although the inventory doesn't exist it is known before hand that everybody with x btc WILL own x btcX and x btcY.

A [softfork]( simply means that all blocks that are valid with the new rules are also valid with the old rules.
It is however trivial to create a block which is *invalid* with the new rules and *valid* with the old rules. You just need to include a SegWit transaction with invalid witness data. This is something the pre 0.13.1 miners would accept and the post 0.13.1 miners would reject.
Unless the post 0.13.1 have more mining power, the  result is a fork.

Because the biggest variable for the profit of miners is the bitcoin price. Hence they are expected to carefully do what is best for bitcoin.
We can ask exchanges because of their expertise, but they have no direct financial gain from a higher price. Actually they gain from high volatility. Their incentives are not directly aligned with the users. Same goes for wallets, merchants and developers.
This is actually one of the most clever parts of the bitcoin protocol: The participants of the ecosystem whose profits are very directly dependent on the price, are the ones that make the rules.

Sorry that is very much incorrect.
SPV nodes *verify* that their transactions are in the block. They *don't* need to trust the peers they connect to. This is why the Merkle tree is used. It allows you to verify a transaction without downloading the entire block.

Obviously this is possible. The threshold is set to a mining supermajority and this is not guaranteed to be the economic consensus.
However it is my prediction and at the root of bitcoin's consensus mechanism, that miners don't switch unless they are convinced that the new chain is carried by an economic majority. Otherwise they would lose income.
I see no reason to doubt this mechanism.

This is actually what BU improves over Core. With Core, changes to the max_block_size  are not signalled.
With BU nodes can easily signal their acceptance of larger blocks. This makes it much easier for miners to coordinate any change.
Miners will still have a very strong incentive to stay on the same chain. They aren't going to split the network just because you make the configuration easier.
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:32:54
I understand this, but this is clearly covered by mining incentives. They are the ones that will have a problem if nodes won't follow them.
They are the ones who have good reason to be very careful and try to measure economic consensus for every decision they make.
As far as I have seen so far, they are doing so pretty thoroughly; they don't need developers to decide "economic consensus" for them.

That is absolute nonsense. BU can be configured to behave *exactly* the same way as Core with EB=1,AD=inf. 
As such it doesn't give any more power to miners.

That is an odd way of looking at it. The *throughput* is the number of txs per second *not* the number of txs per mb. The tx/mb is an implementation detail.

This is absolutely true. Node count shouldn't matter much, just like it shouldn't matter with other (SegWit/BU) signalling. It does make sense for miners to take *some* note in the signalling; before changing X you need to have a number of active nodes supporting X. Currently ~90% are signalling (by omission of signal) eb=1,ad=inf, which does make it risky for miners to create larger blocks.


Miners *are* in control of the blocksize because they make the blocks. The only thing non-mining nodes (and other miners) can do is reject blocks. Whether users configure their node to do so is up to them.
This is not something the BU "model" changes. It *only* allows for a more fine-tuned configuration of the software.

The concept of "consensus" rules is quite well explained in the [original paper](


It is actually the first fully decentralization system of creating consensus rules and enforcing them.

Let me add to that, that I personally believe that we can take this trust much further.
Excellent arguments about mining incentives have been made regarding orphaning, maximizing fees, pushing out small miners and purposely difficult transactions. 
One look at the volatility of the price make me believe that for a miner, the gains from trickery would never be larger then their losses from the damage to the ecosystem.
As they are the only group with the incentives properly aligned, I believe that - as a hypothetical example - if we were to  set the block size limit to 50mb, no miner is going to immediately set their soft limit above 2mb, as they would be way to scared to damage the ecosystem and thereby their income.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:08:13


The thing is, we can't expect that to be very long. Although many users are vocal about technical issues, in the end the value of their coins counts the most.
This means that the graph of bitcoinA/bitcoinB ain't gonna be pretty: If bitcoinB is worth less then bitcoinA, nobody is going to exchange their own bitcoinA for bitcoinB, and the value of bitcoinB will drop to zero before you can blink your eyes.
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:39:56


This is very correct. By setting a limited AD, I basically indicate that I will follow the PoW regardless of the size. The expected effect of setting an EB is only that miners will tend to create blocks smaller then common EB values to prevent being orphanned. 
Personally I think that even better schemes are possible such as accepting larger blocks per depth, but that is of minor importance.




My point is that if a certain feature is good for individual participants then it will be used. We cannot design software for the greater good. We can design software that is optimal for individuals and *describe* the resulting network. This is the very nature of a decentralized system. I think AD/EB is beneficial for me.


I don't really understand your point here. I don't see an ambiguity in what we call bitcoin. Some changes to the software such as changing the initial_block_reward macro, will cut you off the network and make your software dysfunctional, while other changes, like increasing the max_block_size macro have no such direct effect. Whether you still call it bitcoin is irrelevant. We can call it "shells" for all I care. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 19:47:06
In my opinion, the threshold should not be prescribed by devs at all. It's purpose is for miners to be safe; if they would want they could also switch at 0%.
Hence, miners should vote for a change with their own threshold and the change should be triggered if at least n% votes with at most n% threshold.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:24:26


This is definitely possible. The quick-to-zero scenario seems especially likely in a accident scenario where a new implementation would accidentally fix a minor bug in validation, causing a fork.
However, I think that even with bigger issues, people will value the exchange rate more than the actual issues. People keeping their BitcoinA even if it's less  valuable then BitcoinB can only occur if BitcoinB has some very major flaws or BitcoinA has some very specialist use cases.
I can't imagine something like for instance blocksize will cause people to buy less valuable coins.

Do you realise that if *everyone* were to figure out the "correct" fee,  you wouldn't be able to suddenly fit more transactions in 1mb?
@_date: 2016-01-14 08:09:37
The point is that *miners* have a strong incentive not to use software which doesn't use a much larger threshold. This is for the same reason that they need to follow economic consensus. 
The incentive system guarantees that the system of miner's majority de facto means miner's consensus (supermajority). 
This is why we can use the simple definition of "consensus" as used in the original paper:


This definition *encompasses* both the requirement for economic consensus and the requirement for mining supermajority by means of the incentives.
@_date: 2017-02-28 08:55:38
If 100% of the miners (or 51% of the miners) are acting against bitcoin, the only way to continue is to change the PoW.

This concept is starting to be overused. There is no such thing as "technical consensus". For technical ideas, there are pros and cons, and different people with different ideas.
The reasons "consensus" is used in the bitcoin ecosystem are subtle. 
As for "mining consensus", it is expected that all miners follow the majority; hence the paper uses the term "consensus" to describe this unified view of miners.
The term "economic consensus" has been introduced to clarify that miners will follow the money, determined by the economic stakeholders. As individual stakeholders are *also* expected to follow the money, we can reasonably expect that any economic majority converges to an economic consensus; hence the term applies.
Applying this term for technical matters, reeks of the No true Scotsman fallacy, as it risks implying that people disagreeing are somehow not part of the "technical consensus". It is therefore best avoided. Technical matters should be discusses based on their content.

The problem is not that "blocks are full", the problem is that *some* blocks are hitting an artificial ceiling. As we don't seem to be running into any scaling issues any time soon at our current growth rate, this is an unnecessary bottleneck.
My cheap hosted nodes and home node can handle *a lot* more then they do now while half-sleeping and handling lots of other traffic.

I keep hearing that but I don't see any evidence of it.
1. We have grown from 0 to 0.8mb blocks in seven years. 
3. Optimizations such as thin blocks &amp; SegWit are being developed
3. Although not following Moore's Law, bandwidth and hardware still improves every year.
4. Most people agreed that somewhere between 2mb-4mb  is acceptable on the hardware/bandwidth, a year ago.
Even if the growth of bitcoin would suddenly go much faster (of which there is little evidence), I don't see how 1+2+3+4 indicates we will have a scaling problem. 
On contrary, if we ignore the 1mb hard-limit (or 1.6mb segwit limit), there seems to be a good indication that Bitcoin's growth is not going to outrun hardware improvements any time soon, exactly as predicted by in the original paper.

No. For all current plans, transactions are still real transactions, only they are not yet stored on the blockchain. 
This is also the problem because that you can only transact with each other what you have already "locked" in the blockchain. We can transfer back-and-forth off-chain, but then first we need to reserve some money with a real on-chain transaction, and we can only send back-and-forth that money.

It doesn't work like that. Bitcoin is an incentive based system. Miners are making huge amounts of money with as greatest variable, the price of bitcoin.
Any change that they implement they will carefully consider, how it will effect users and hence the price.
Bitcoin is not guarded by some Good Developers but by the incentives of a multi-million dollar industry.
Developers are there to provide advice and options.

Right. They can't steal your 25,000 confs coins but relying on 25,000 confs isn't particularly practical. 
But with less confs, they only need to *delay* their income, as they can withhold blocks and get paid when releasing their chain.
Try looking at it from the other way: Let's say you control a mining majority. 
Case 1: You want to steal. 
Why would you create invalid blocks? That would be quite a risky attack because of the minority forking off. Instead, you can just take whatever is available anonymously online for free by withholding and undoing! No full node can stop you, and it doesn't cost you btc mining income. It only costs you income because it would hurt the exchange rate as trust would plummet.
Case 2: You want to harm bitcoin
Why would you create invalid blocks? Again that would be much less effective. You can just withhold a few hours or days and then undo *all* transactions. This would make bitcoin completely unusable. Again, your only costs are in the exchange rate.
Either way, my full node is adding locks to the side door with the front door wide open. The only mitigation in these cases is changing the PoW.

No. Not at all. 
And if the majority of economic stakeholders agree with you (and communication between miners and stakeholders is unhindered), then miners will not make the change as they would devaluate their supply.
If the majority of economic stakeholders is however in favour of increasing the blocksize, the miners will go through with it.
By owning bitcoins, you have little choice of to go along with these rules as they are determined by the protocol.
Moderation rules have no effect on that, except that hindering the communication may hinder the mechanism of economic consensus determining mining consensus.

I am referring to the consensus mechanism as described in the  [original paper](


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**
Indeed it is hard to change the rules. This has to do with incentives:
* A minority minor cannot change the rules because its blocks would be rejected.
* The majority of miners have a strong incentive only to change the rules for the good of bitcoin (=their income).
* Miners have a strong incentive, to use a supermajority threshold, to reduce the risk.
Quite interesting that this seems to be [the only time]( Satoshi used the word "consensus". The concept took quite a ride from there!
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:30:50


That depends on what you call "compatible". Sure they *would* accept the blocks if they'd get them, but SegWit nodes do not connect to non-SegWit nodes, so the non-upgraded nodes will find themselves partitioned.
@_date: 2017-02-09 11:35:24


Good point. BU does use defaults but their value should be an extremely important point of discussion. What should the defaults be? What do we recommend? Can we provide even more control? Should AD even be a single value? 
Personally I am convinced that an even better strategy then a single valued AD could be offered, but instead of discussing this, the configurability is ridiculed and people continue trying to protect bitcoin from its own users.
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:35:27


Exactly. *And they don't need to create invalid blocks to do so*.
That is precisely my point. If an *attacker* controls the miners he can trivially destroy bitcoin by withholding and releasing valid block sequences, undoing every confirmed transaction, making bitcoin worthless.
No invalid blocks are involved, and thus full nodes offer no protection.

Personally, I would prefer to allow  the growth that took us from 0 to 1mb in seven years, to continue instead of stopping here or relying on SegWit only.

There cannot be unlimited growth as there are limited resources.

Or a development team that *at best* has no such incentives.
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:19:21
This is exactly what I (and the whitepaper) are saying. Miners define the rules through the consensus mechanism defined by the protocol, but they are expected to do for the benefit of the users (other full nodes).
Economic majority is a nice name to describe these incentives but this doesn't change the *mechanism* itself. There is no relevance in the majority of nodes, implementations, or developers.
Mining majority incentiviced by "economic majority" is the *only* mechanism available to determine rules.


If they would raise the limit, they would decrease the value of their own supply. That makes little sense. No miner would agree to that. "Being accepted by full nodes" in itself is not an incentive at all because it is relatively cheap to fire up &gt;50% of all full nodes.

I am not so sure how big of a problem that is. Of course it would be nice if it was geographically well distributed over the earth. It's also nice if it would have a better gender-distribution, and socio-economic distribution. These aren't prerequisites for decentralization though.
Obviously miners will find locations with cheap energy. This is strengthened with mining-pools having an advantage being relatively close to other mining-pools.

You don't trust a third party if you run an SPV node. This is a consequence of the Merkle tree. It allows you to check whether your transactions are buried under enough PoW without downloading the whole block. Effectively this shards validation.
The trust model for a full node is the same as for an SPV node: you trust that the majority mining power is honest but you don't need to trust any peer.
This mechanism is well described in the paper, and isn't really effected by the absence of fraud proofs.

These arguments fall apart by the fact that we're going to need a hardfork anyway. Why is a hardfork in August safer then a hardfork now?
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:32:03
A decentralized network cannot maintain consensus on X just because it is bad or dangerous *for the network* to change X. It can *only* maintain consensus on X if it is bad for *each individual participant* to change X.
This is why there is and will always be consensus on, for example, the block reward: Anybody changing it will find himself isolated.
This is clearly not the case for max_block_size: people *are* participating in the network using different values. These individual users do not want to reject blocks of the longest chain based on size alone, which does not seem an unreasonable choice.
Even if larger blocks would lead to less decentralization, the network simply cannot maintain a fixed max_block_size without giving up the core principle of decentralization: users are in control.

They do allow miners to change the consensus rules.
If the mining majority declares OP_NOP7 now means return true if X then all miners and all nodes *must* either check X or risk accepting invalid blocks, whether they like X or not.
This is what makes them coercive, and this is also why a high activation threshold is much more important then with a hard fork.

If I control the mining majority I can simply *withhold and release*. I can pay you; mine and withhold blocks with a conflicting payment to myself. After enough confirmations, release my branch to undo. This way, it doesn't cost me any mining reward in BTC. 
Also note that mining is anonymous.
Of course it would cost me in fiat, as the value of bitcoin would quickly plummet to zero, which is the point of the attack.


That is a much more risky attack as it would cut off the honest mining minority. Although this would hurt bitcoin,  it may allow them to regroup, manually force exchanges and spv nodes on the honest side and cut me off. This hurts me more then bitcoin. *Even if I am an attacker, I am much more successful by playing by the rules.*


I am not. People should defend themselves. This is why they should not rely on a thin client but run either a full node or an SPV node, with a preference to the latter as it allows bitcoin to scale as described in the paper. 
Both of them have the trust model:
1. I trust that the mining majority is honest
2. I don't need to trust a minority miner as long as I wait enough confirmations
3. I don't need to trust any peer as I can verify the PoW in the header the merkle branch of my transactions myself.

@_date: 2016-01-28 21:06:52


The thing is, this is hacky. It adds quite some complications as transaction data can now reside in two different places. Increasing the limit in a hardfork is much cleaner.
This doesn't really apply to SegWit, because nodes need to support SegWit and non-SegWit transactions anyway.
The only thing that makes SegWit hardfork a bit cleaner is that a different spot could be chosen, but this doesn't reduce complexity so it is not worth a hardfork.
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:04:08
Economic consensus is vague, and used with different meanings. 
I would say it is meant to clarify that the mining majority will always follow the value of bitcoin and hence, even though miners determine the rules, the economic stakeholders are in power. Miners cannot go against economic consensus, as other nodes would simply stick to the rules that they like, nullifying the miners' income.
Some people seem to believe that outside of the consensus mechanism of the protocol, we need to create " economic consensus" among all stakeholders. This seems both very unrealistic and vague, as there is no clear mechanism how such consensus could be reached.
Then there are people, who refer to economic consensus as the inclusion of wallets, developers, exchanges and merchants in the decision making process. Although their input is very welcome, the term "economic consensus" is rather odd for this, as these entities have no financial motivation aligned with the price.

A softfork threshold isn't a vote. It is required to ensure a safe upgrade.
Activating a softfork with less then 50% mining power will result in a disastrous fork in the chain and loss of funds. Therefore P2SH was not activated until more then 55% was  supporting it.
Actually 55% is widely considered too low which is why we use BIP 9 now with its 95% threshold.

The problem is, although the network enforces consensus over *most* block validation rules, it *is* easy to change max_block_size as is evident from the nodes that are using different values.  They are not isolated as they would be when changing say, the block reward or the merkle algorithm.
Whether we like it or not, there simply seems to be no viable decentralized method of maintaining consensus over max_block_size as there is with consensus rules. Evidently, "block validation rules" and "consensus rules" no longer refer to the same thing.
We can only concede to the observed fact, that max_block_size has *by definition* become a matter of local policy. A very important one, as it obviously a block validation rule, but local policy nonetheless.

You exert your economic influence in two ways: *a priori* because miners will always try to do what the economy wants.
And *posteriori*, when two groups of miners disagree on the rules and the chain is split, people can determine which side of the chain they value more. 
Neither involves running a full node.


So, how many full nodes do they need consent from? Should I just fire some up to give them "consent"? They need consent from the economy, but this is unrelated to full node counts.


An SPV node does not rely on a third party. You verify your own merkle branch and PoW. You simply accept the  chain with highest PoW by default, which seems like a reasonable thing to do. In case of an actual fork with two sustained chains, you can always force yourself on one side with *invalidateblock*.
In no way does a full node exert more economic infuence then an SPV node. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:51:51
Maybe you know more then me about this particular bug. I thought a block was created slightly bigger then 1mb? 
This would cause most miners (all Core miners) to ignore the block and continue mining on its valid parent block; as such the chain with the valid &lt;1mb blocks would outpace the chain with the invalid block and the invalid block would be orphaned. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:21:56
The basic premise of a decentralized network is that people can control what software they run with what parameters they want.
The  request that *some* people want to be able configure their software to accept blocks of the longest work chain that are larger 1mb is *not* unreasonable given that blocks are full. Quite some people - not all stupid - want this.
Even if *you* don't want to accept larger blocks yourself, the idea that we must withhold this configuration option from users to somehow protect the network from its own users, is orthogonal to the basic principles of decentralization.
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:53:10


Because they are already in the blockchain. You can't rewrite history.


True. That is essentially the softfork mechanism.
Softforks and hard forks are both nasty but on quite a different level:
* softfork. "F*ck economic consensus. We'll just assume miners still do what's best and force nodes to update to keep validating."
* hardfork. "I know I told you to store these bitcoins on wallet software on your unused laptop, but now you need *new* software to actually access your money. Those are the rules."
Personally, I think this is a no-brained. A hardfork essentially breaks a promise. Especially with client-centralization, locking people's funds behind a software update with whatever comes with it, is nasty.
In my opinion a hardfork should be used only for rare cases such as the current limit proposal.

Trust in bitcoin means trusting that the incentives of users and miners are well enough aligned. This is the very core of why bitcoin works.
Bitcoin miners *can* change the rules by running a different version (even if this currently limitied by bitcoin-core-centralization), but nodes cannot.
The reason that miners won't make rules that harm users is exactly the reason that bitcoin works.
This is why we should [allow]( miners a more flexible way to make breaking changes to the rules.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:20:49


This is quite the opposite of  what I am seeing. 
Given that quite some users evidently like it, Core *could* add EB/AD optional configuration .
Yet many people here seem to be supporting Core's reluctance to allow people to decide for themselves. Even to the point where they don't like *others* to decide EB/AD for themselves.
Many seem to  accept or even embrace the Core devs as guardians of the protocol. That is not sustainable.
Developers that want to protect the network from its own users may thrive at Apple or Microsoft but should stay away from decentralized networking, as it is orthogonal to the core principles of decentralization.
@_date: 2016-01-05 10:34:29


Opinions on this differ. In my opinion, bitcoin only works because the incentives of users and miners are aligned. I trust bitcoin because I trust this beautiful principle which I believe is the heart of bitcoin's design. If the incentives were too different, bitcoin could not function as it does.
Hence, I am very happy that the miners make the rules, although I would like to see a more [formal]( approach to this.
I am not a native English speaker but I am still quite baffled by the idea that the rules should be based on consensus. 


Really? Which group? All bitcoin users having the same opinion? All commiters to bitcoin-core? This seems like rather vague way of defining new rules.

valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on

BU is not bitcoin. Personally I think that one of the biggest problems of Core is its governance model.
Core uses a meritocratic anyone-can-contribute model. The idea is that the people with technical merit are *de facto* in charge. This is working nicely. But it *also* means that technical merit is defined  by those *de facto* in charge.
The result is a *meritocratic bubble*. Everyone inside the bubble is constantly in happy agreement with each other. Notice how often we hear that there is "technical consensus"? Everyone not agreeing is outside the bubble and is considered "non-expert". This results in hostility.
I don't think any serious Open Source project uses this model with sustained success; for good reasons. It is important to have an environment where competing ideas can bloom. Besides, it is difficult in this model to prioritize work to what users want.
I find it rather unsurprising that other implementation choose a more conventional model of governance.

@_date: 2017-03-31 15:26:55
You are still using terminology incompatible with decentralized network development. 
What you and I want doesn't matter, what these individual nodes want does.
The nodes all want to use the same value for the block reward because they don't want to be cut off.
Some nodes don't want to reject 1.5mb blocks of the longest chain because they have reasonable arguments to accept them.
This makes it impossible to maintain consensus on the max blocksize.

BIP 666 wouldn't work because miners would devaluate their own supply, not because it is censored. This is what "economic consensus" means.
The bitcoin-consensus mechanism that determines the rules works because the incentives of miners are aligned with those of the users.


There is really no reason to assume that bitcoin.org has invented a better decentralized consensus-mechanism then bitcoin. Them "allowing" hard-forks bears very little meaning. 
Hence they should use their medium to advertise those who are working to make bitcoin better, regardless of new rules that these entities may be suggesting.

1. The coins will still be bitcoin, and the transactions will still be "normal" bitcoin transactions; the only change is that most them won't need to be stored in the blockchain. Only some "settlement" transactions are going to be on chain.
2. Both LN and normal transactions can be used side-by-side, transparently. You can always "settle" your LN transactions on the blockchain and make old-school transactions from there. It is probable that wallets will do so transparent for the user.
3. You may have to rely on a 3rd party, but you won't have to trust them. They won't control your money or transactions. 
The thing is, you could simply transact directly with Alice and Bob over LN, but if you receive money from Alice, you can't spend it on Bob before settling with Alice on the blockchain. 
This is why intermediate "hubs" come in to play that can lock in some money for you (without trust needed). How to prevent these hubs from becoming centralized is still an unsolved problem as by design of LN, a centralized hub needs less money to be locked in and is more efficient then multiple small hubs.
Some argue that this is not going to be a problem because you won't need to trust this single large central hub anyway. Other argue that it is a an unsolvable problem. 
Only the future knows.

@_date: 2016-01-12 16:57:34


They won't because they would devaluate their own supply. Miners have a strong incentive to use rules that are best for the users, as the users determine the value of the miner's supply.
This concept is often called "economic consensus". It is used to clarify that the actual decentralized algorithm for rule determination used by the bitcoin protocol, though called "mining consensus", actually doesn't give miners that much power.

Sure it is, but what does that matter? Does that mean we should not give users control over their software?
Game theory can help teaching us and predicting how the network functions but it doesn't change the basic premise of a decentralized network: 
*Software serves users and users serve the network.*

A block is orphaned if another branch in the tree of blocks gathers more PoW. In code this is called a "reorg" as the block must be undone and the side chain must be promoted to the main chain.
This happens frequently because miners can find blocks at the same time.

The miners need to be sure that users want X before they choose X.
With SegWit, there are indications that part of the community prefers to lift the protocol-based block limit first with BU.  
As such, they are "on hold" until the community clearly picks one way or another.

I also find it a bit odd to find a wallet that is "ready" even though SegWit still isn't ready itself. How is that possible?
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:29:10


They can't. Miners always follow the money. This is why they are always conservative, and why they are not going to risk their multi-million dollar business with the changes unless they are certain  the economy wants it.
This is also why hash rate is the most reliable indicator of what the economic majority wants.

There is quite a difference between an SPV client and other light clients.
With most light clients, you rely on the central servers of that client.
With an SPV client (like multibit), you *do not* rely on a central authority, nor your peers. You verify yourself that your transaction is in the blockchain with enough proper PoW on top of it.
The only thing that you need to trust is that the mining majority is honest, (just like with a full node).

That is a weird way to look at it. Developers are there to provide the options that miners and users can choose to use.
If the users and miners together pick the 2MB options, there is absolutely no reason anymore for Core not to follow suit. If you don't you are effectively firing yourself.

I am not sure what you are trying to point out. You seem to claim that even if the network does not enforce consensus on X and even if people are participating on the network using different values of X, there can still be consensus on X.
Neither on that page, nor in my history of developing for decentralized networks I find support for such rather odd claim. What is then the criterion for consensus?
Consensus is the observed result of the free choice of users, because in a decentralized network *everything* is the observed result of the free choice of users. There simply  is no other way to  define things without resorting to authority.

valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**
or do you mean more like the dictionary definition:


Because Satoshi's use seems to be explicitly about reaching consensus through mining majority, while the dictionary one seems a bit, well, unrealistic to say the least.

1. The founders make no claims about datacenters and paypal.

Do you want to run Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 with or without support for 2MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:00:20
But we *have* to trust the mining majority because they can trivially steal anything without even creating invalid blocks. Even a dishonest miner is best served playing by the rules.
So what is the benefit of, for instance, checking signatures if don't mine? How does this decrease my or anybodies dependency on miners?
I only need to make sure I don't depend on  *peers* being honest which is what the Merkle tree and SPV solve.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:46:18
1. In a decentralised network, a single malicious block must be assumed. Relying on this not happening is not realistic.
2. For non SegWit, this block would not be corrupt but perfectly valid.
Thus, if I receive a SegWit transaction with less then 50% hash power supporting SegWit, there will be one chain with more hash power where my coins can be spent by anyone, and one chain with less hash power  where my coins are mine.

It would still be much better for the bitcoin ecosystem to make breaking changes [without hard-forks](
tldr; there is no reason to use hard-forks as a mechanism for breaking changes. We should simply agree on a consensus threshold, and ensure that implementations recognize the existence of rules they cannot handle.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:02:30
The mechanism under which a block is marked *invalid* is quite different from the mechanism by which a block is *orphaned*. 
The first happens if a block does not follow the consensus rules. The block is simply dropped, and - in most cases - the peer sending the block is marked with "banscore". 
The latter is part of normal operation to ensure nodes always follow the longest PoW.

@_date: 2017-03-31 12:03:06
The problem with this model is that people tend to consider each other more technically sound when they agree with them. It creates a meritocratic bubble.
This is why there is indeed very often "technical consensus" inside the bubble. And why people who do not agree, are often outside the bubble and considered "non-experts". 
I don't think there are many Open Source projects with sustained success that use this model, because an environment with hierarchical positions or a benevolent dictator, is a much more healthy environment for different opinions to bloom.

It *is* about me. The only way bitcoin can work is if everyone acts in their own interest.
There clearly is interest in accepting larger blocks and signalling this as people are willing to switch to buggy software because of Core's unwillingness to implement the EB/AD feature they want.
The idea that the developers need to guard the network is not sustainable; they should act in the interest of the users of their software. 
Developers serve users, and users serve the network.

But it is. The question of legitimacy of valid transactions doesn't work in a decentralized system. Let me give you an extreme example. 
What if I create two wallets and a computer program that constantly transfers money back-and-forth with a high fee. This will easily create much longer chains.
Is this spam? Is this illegitimate use of the blockchain? Of course not. It may be silly but the only one who can determine the legitimacy of my transactions is me. Who else can decide on that without a central committee?
There is no way you can "filter" out my back-and-forth transactions as being somehow less legitimate as someone else's "normal" transactions.

You are correct about the terms if used correctly: Both a hardfork and a softfork are backwards compatible. They differ in that a softfork is also partially forward compatible while a hardfork is not.
In practice, the term backwards compatibility is used for forward compatibility; although not entirely correct, its meaning is clear from the context.

That wouldn't work. A miner needs to validate incoming transactions, maintain the mempool and select transactions from it in order to be able to generate blocks. How else would they know what to put in?
If you are not mining, the mempool is actually rather meaningless (which is why there is now blockonly mode). What is the difference between my node accepting a transaction or rejecting a transaction? My full node acts as a checkpoint *on my own driveway*. Transactions will reach miners anyway due to the flooding method of distribution. Therefore, whether I accept or reject a transaction only effects *my own node*.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:46:41
Consensus rules of bitcoin are the rules that every node agrees on.
A good example is the value of the block reward that miners get when mining a block. This determines the total supply.
The *reason* that there is consensus is not because people cannot change it; they easily can. I am suggesting that we could even make it more easy by creating a setting for it in the preferences dialog.
There is consensus because changing it will make your node dysfunctional. Therefore nobody *wants* to change it.
We must embrace people's *ability* to change whatever they want as it is the prerequisite of the network being decentralised. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:56:08
Let me ask you a question. 
Do you believe bitcoin can retain its value if an attacker  gains control over 60% of the hash power?
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:39:42


That is quite a reversal of the concept of consensus. In a decentralized network everybody is free to use whatever rules they want, by the very fact it is decentralized. There is no "require" without authority.
In bitcoin, everybody *wants* to use the same set of block validation rules because anybody using different rules will find himself on his own little personal chain. That is why there is consensus over most block validation rules; it's the observed result of the free choices of the users. This doesn't change their freedom to change anything.
Evidently, this mechanism doesn't work for max_block_size, and there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain consensus on it in a decentralized way.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:11:17


That is exactly the opposite of what miners want. This is why we can trust miners to be very careful about doing only what users want.

Of course. But if you do not support SegWit, and you receive a block, you will not verify the signatures.
The block will be considered valid by the majority of miners even if it contains a SegWit transaction with an invalid signature. This is what will cause the split in the chain.

I agree we would lose the most important devs, but we would only be losing those who decide to quit.

If you set a high max blocksize you will simply follow the most worked chain. I wouldn't really call that isolated.

If the majority of miners switch to BU, there is no chain split. BU is just an implementation. As it stands, almost all BU miners are using the *same 1mb limit as Core's default*.

If the economy favours 1mb blocks then this would happen.
But I doubt that these ultra conservate miners will mine or accept a larger block unless they are convinced about the wishes of the economy.
They are not stupid.
In fact, mining support might be the best indicator of the wishes of the  economic majority available. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:13:04


This is correct, but not very relevant in practice. 
In the case of a split in the chain, the community will be upside down, and every SPV node, full node or online holder will have plenty opportunity to value both chains.
Sure, end-user Joe will not know and stick to the highest PoW chain by default, but isn't that a good thing? After all, that is most likely the chain with the most economic support. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:05:00


Triggering changes using a majority threshold of the PoW hashing power is political, and using a fixed date when someone decides that there is enough "consensus" in the community is *not* political ?
I understand that "politics" is what both ways use to describe what they don't like, but I find this phrasing highly reversed.

The chain split was a block that was orphaned by other miners. This happens every day during normal operations.
I find it hard to go along with a definition of "consensus" where we include a parameter for which:
* Not everyone *wants* the same value.
* Not every participant of the network is currently *using* the same value
* There is *no mechanism* to ensure everyone uses the same value.
If you still call this consensus, it is because you *want* it to be consensus, but it does not match any reasonable definition in the context of decentralized networking.

The mechanism of code-forking can be used to offer choice to the user. If the users then make a choice, there is really no good reason for core not to adept.

I don't "backtrack" from yesterday's discussion. 
I don't think that non-mining full nodes contribute to decentralization. 
Yesterdays the situation was hypothesized with only 20 full nodes (all mining), such that they are *all* compromised and we might not even *notice* an invalid block. 
Such a world without block-explorers, payment processors, analysis companies is not realistic and as such it should be clear that I am talking about the *marginal* effect of non-mining full nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:26:59


So you think that 75% of the miners will start accepting larger blocks if most of the industry doesn't? They would basically give up their huge income. That doesn't sound realistic.
Miners must always follow the money. If they make larger blocks, they will do so because they believe it is what the industry wants.
This is also why a split is very unlikely. Why would any miner mine on a less lucrative chain?
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:53:06

It is sybil attack resistant because it is not activated based on nodes but based on a fixed date. The number of nodes don't matter.
"User activated" in this case means that someone with the authority to do decides that there is "community consensus", and merge a fixed date into Core.

One of the (many) problems with (4) is *when*. If 75% is running BU, they will probably still be using the same 1mb blocksize limit as Core.
Are you then going to change the PoW, just because they are running a different implementation? We change the PoW because miners are using software that allows changing the blocksize without recompilation?
Or is the idea to somehow implement a PoW change that triggers only if the majority chain contains blocks larger then 1mb? That seems tricky.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:55:04
Sorry, but the idea that moving a parameter from a preprocessor macro to a configuration option is an "attack on hold", shows the ridiculousness of the situation.

I think we can conclude that the bitcoin incentive system is working.

They are the guardians of the protocol, exactly as originally envisioned.

You can also look at this from a different perspective :
* Miners do what's best for bitcoin because they have gigantic revenues of which the main variable is the bitcoin price. Decentralised or not, they have a multi-million dollar incentive aligned with users.
* Developers do what's best for bitcoin because they like bitcoin and tend to be nice guys.
I am happy that the miners are the guardians of the code, deciding what they run and what not.
Developers are there to provide options and advice.

Of course the network is way too centralized as it is. Nobody is arguing against that. People are arguing against full nodes and small blocks aiding in decentralization in a significant way.
The cost of mining itself is much bigger and grows much faster then the cost of processing and validating a block. As such, bigger blocks are unlikely to chase away miners.
The degree of decentralization can be quantified as the number of independent entities that need to be compromised for the network to be compromised. In the case of bitcoin, this is the number of miners in control of 51%, because if an attacker controls 51% the security of the network completely falls apart regardless of the number of full nodes.

I believe their plan is good. I also think a 2mb hardfork is good. It is besides the point.
If I look outside this sub, whether it's other forums, public announcements by companies, blogs by clever people, polls, panel discussions, I find that regardless of SegWit, a vast majority still wants to do a 2mb fork. The number of people disagreeing with this seems staggeringly low.
This makes it a very odd for Core to just stay on the "but we have a better plan" path, even if it *is* a better plan. They didn't convince the users, and they make software for the users. This doesn't add up to sticking to the plan.

Parallel validation does not effect initial sync time.
The idea of parallel validation is that you can validate an incoming block while validating another incoming block. 
This is means that nodes can no longer "bully" each other by creating expensive-to-validate blocks. The cost of expensive transaction (through quadratic hashing) or large blocks, becomes mostly inflicted on the creator of such block instead of the receiver. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:18:13
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:25:25
Nonsense. 
The weakest link of bitcoin's security is and will always be the mining majority. If they are compromised, bitcoin is no longer secure as you can no longer trust transactions, regardless of confirmations. Hence, more full nodes don't make bitcoin more secure.
And miners aren't much effected by bigger blocks, because the resource cost of block validation  grows much slower then the resource cost of mining, making the formal trivial in comparison.
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:22:18
Both SPV and full nodes can be forced off a chain by manually invalidating a block.
The difference is that by default an SPV node follows the longest chain with any ruleset, while a full node follows the longest chain with the current ruleset. 
This alone makes SPV more suitable for end-users. This would give us the bonus of having an actually scaleable cryptocurrency as originally planned.

If I have now X bitcoin, and after a fork have X bitcoinA and X bitcoinB, then people will  judge whichever is likely to be of long term value based on their relative value to each other (more then the underying tech).
If then after a day, it turns out bitcoinA is worth more, then you can expect this to accelerate bringing bitcoinB to zero, as there are two coins with similar tech, the same owners and history, one of which is judged more valuable by the bitcoin economy.

I don't really think this accurately describes the problem. The mining pools have build and run highly optimized Stratum servers with fast direct connections to bitcoin-core. I am pretty sure they are technically capable of changing a  before compiling to change the limit. 
It seems to me, that they are not doing this because they are putting their trust in the core-devs, and (part of ) the core-devs have been putting out big warnings for everyone using strategies that do not comform to bitcoin-core plans.

This is exactly the definition I've just given and exactly in line with the consensus mechanism described by Satoshi. 
Although he did not use the term, it seems rather odd to say he didn't "realise it" as it is at the very heart of the consensus system he describes. 
It should be noted that this term is purely *descriptive*. It describes why the miners are expected to do what is best for the economic stakeholders. It doesn't change anything to the actual *mechanism* to reach consensus.

You are missing the point. Miners are the *guardians* of the code. I cannot get them to run anything.
The reasons they demanded --disablerbf, and consider classic, is because they have indications that users don't like RBF and do like 2mb. They are simply trying to maximize profits by trying to pick what's best for the users.

@_date: 2016-01-13 20:13:23


The 21 million BTC is kept in place because any implementation that would change it would not be used. This is because mining-consensus is driven by economic-consensus; users determine the value of the miner's supply.
The 21 million BTC is NOT kept in place because you shout ALTCOIN at such implementation and courageously censor it from discussion.
Labeling things altcoin is not a functional mechanism of reaching consensus.


People consider bitcoin a good store of value because it has an excellent mechanism of reaching consensus baked in the protocol: Mining-consensus driven by economic consensus.

A bitcoin forum should serve the important role of aiding in consensus-forming.

@_date: 2017-03-02 12:15:56


I *do* understand the importance of decentralization and I am also not too happy with the current rate of decentralization but I don't agree that more full nodes make the system more decentralized.
Bitcoins are secured by Proof-Of-Work. If an attacker gains access to the majority hashing power, it can trivially undo every transaction even when buried under a bunch of confirmations. As such, we could no longer trust the security of transactions and bitcoin would be worthless. 
The minimum viable attack isn't mitigated by non-mining full nodes.
Therefore, the decentralization can be quantified as the number of distinct independent entities that combined control 50% of the hash power (a number that currently could be 20 or 1 for all we know).
Although it  cannot be easily measured as we don't know which entities are independent, it does explain why nodes with negligible or no hashing power do not contribute to the decentralization of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:17:33


That is *not* another story. That is exactly how the invalid block gets orphaned. You seem to mix up orphaning and invalid blocks.
Transactions get secured by confirmations. If a mining node creates an invalid block, this will be rejected by other mining nodes. As such the next blocks will not be mined upon the invalid block and the invalid block gets orphaned. As such it will never get enough confirmations.
Usually one confirmation is safe but orphan blocks happen, both because of rogue miners as in your example, and during normal operation because of the delayed consistency of the blockchain.
As long as you rely on multiple confirmations you are safe regardless of using an SPV node or a full node. 


That is highly irrelevant. How am I helped by you rejecting the invalid block? I am only helped by the invalid block being orphaned by honest miners.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:29:20
This article is such a misunderstanding. You can't say "full nodes verify transactions" without questioning what their actual impact is.
Look at it from the perspective of an attacker. If an attacker gains  control of 50% hashing power, *everything that is traded for bitcoin is up for grabs!*
This doesn't even cost the attacker any mining income as he can just undo his payments by withholding and releasing.
With the mining majority compromised, *invalid blocks would be the least of our problems*. Bitcoin transactions would no longer be secure even with a dozen confirmation and bitcoin would be worthless.
The logical conclusion is that non-miners validating signatures or coinbases is cute, but an utter waste of wattage.
I understand people are scared because of mining centralization and rightfully so. I also understand that people *want* full nodes to make a difference. Unfortunately, that is not how PoW security works.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:06:28
I could add a big slider that changes the block reward at runtime and there would still be consensus  on the block reward because anybody moving the slider would be isolated from network.
*That* is consensus. It is maintained by the network.
You seem to think that consensus rules are rules that must delicately be protected by the developers in order for the network to function. This is not the case at all.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:31:55

@_date: 2017-03-31 11:25:28
Bitcoin is a decentralised network which means every one is free to choose whatever they consider valid for themselves.
They are also free to change the money supply by changing the block reward. We could even give them a big slider to do so.
Nobody *wants* to move that slider as they would find themselves lonely on their own personal chain until they move it back.
That is the mechanism that keeps the consensus parameters in check.
A decentralised cannot maintain consensus on X just because it is bad for the network to change X.
 It can only maintain consensus on X if it is bad for each individual participant to change X.
That is why there is and will always consensus on the block reward and not on the max blocksize.
@_date: 2016-01-19 08:33:26
This is why other implementation use a code-fork. This ensures that implementations are and stay protocol-compatible.
From that point it is possible for every implementation to propose changes to the protocol, using the standard threshold-mechanism available. If such patch reaches the threshold it can be easily merged to the other implementations as they use the same codebase.
This seems like an easy and safe way to ensure that protocol changes are guarded by what users actually want; something that is not easily possible with a single implementation.
@_date: 2017-03-30 08:34:13
People are asking to configure their own node not to reject blocks from the longest chain just because they are say, 1.5mb.
This is quite a reasonable request. Currently people are switching to a buggy small team competitor, because Core refuses to include this feature.
It would be trivial to add, but somehow the Core developers keep trying to protect the network from its own users. 
We are running a decentralized network, where the main developers are desperately trying to prevent the users from controlling it.

Sorry throwaway. I wasn't thinking straight and was a bit blathering here about marginal effect.
Of course it doesn't matter. Consider the two situations:
A. There are only  20 independent equal miners and no full nodes
B. There are 20 independent equal miners and a million  non-mining nodes.
What is the simplest attack to the system? In *both* cases an attacker needs to compromise 10 entities to gain majority hashing power and to break the security of bitcoin. Therefore, in both cases the rate of decentralization is the same (quantified as 10).
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:43:24
It's not really about how high the fees are, but about how many transactions can be done. 
The number of transactions has been rising, and if we stick to the plan of capping it at 1mb, some legitimate transactions that are currently possible will no longer be possible.
Sure, these will be the least important as the ones dropping first are the ones that will not be prepared to pay the increased fee  even if it's still small, but I still don't see why this is what we want.
Shouldn't we happy with the growth of legitimate transactions if the collective burden is still well within the scope of a small computer? 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:48:38
If the majority mining power starts to steal coins, running a full node isn't going to help you.
The miners can take everything available for bitcoins for free with valid blocks only. It doesn't even cost them mining income.  
If miners turn against users, invalid blocks aren't going to be our problem.

The idea is that you can *replace* transactions before storing them on the blockchain. *Very* simplified, I pay you 1btc. You withhold storing the transaction. Tomorrow I pay you another btc by replacing the previous transaction with one with 2btc.


No. I have the transactions that I can always publish on the blockchain whenever I want. Hence I don't need to trust anyone.
*If* I want to use LN I rely on using the trustless services of a third party. 
Disclaimer: I don't think LN could ever work but not for the reasons you are suggesting.
Simple example: I rely on my ISP to send transactions. I don't need to trust them with my money as they can't mess with my transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:39:42


This is the part I don't understand.
If an attacker gains control over the mining majority, he can take *anything* available for bitcoin for free by undoing transactions. Heck, it doesn't even cost any mining income if he withholds and releases blocks to undo, and let the honest minority mine the payment confirmations.
How is this "hard to profit"? From the perspective of an attacker, neither the most simple, the most lucrative nor the most destructive attacks involve the creation of invalid blocks.
So in bitcoin the mining majority *must* be trusted.

@_date: 2017-03-19 18:01:16


How can you even call something a "consensus protocol" if you do *not* let users decide? 
There is consensus over the block-reward because *every user* is using the same value. This is not unexpected, because any user that changes the value is kicked of the network.
Different users are currently using different values of max_block_size. This is also not unexpected because people like the network to grow, and are *not* kicked of the network by increasing it.
The idea that you can somehow force consensus by calling it consensus anyway does indeed show that we have quite a different understanding of consensus protocols.
From my point of view, this is a bit similar to trying to create a democracy by calling your nation the Democratic Republic of Korea.
Personally, I am just trying to *interpret* the network and I would like to *give users* as much  tools as possible  to improve it.

It's not about sticking with core. It's about supporting a hardfork raise.
Obviously people much rather stick with the experts then switch to some lesser known newbies.

I think you are misunderstanding the difference between an SPV node and a full node.


Confirmations are blocks created by miners. I do not need to run a full node to verify myself the block-header, the PoW, the confirmations, the presence of my transaction. 
*This why we use a merkle tree.*
The only difference between a full node and an SPV node is whether or not I also verify *other people's transactions*. It does not increase my own security or reduce my trust as the security model for bitcoin full and SPV nodes is the same.

@_date: 2017-03-10 06:43:10
But why wouldn't an attacker follow the rules?
If you control the mining majority, you can undo any transaction even after many confirmations by simply releasing a different chain. This doesn't cost you anything and your full node doesn't help.
I understand that you do not *want* to trust the miners but it is the only way to trust transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:00:49
Personally, I would like to see SegWit merged into BU., but there are some arguments against SegWit that makes the BU team think different and clearly the blocksize limit is a much more relevant issue now.
Note that this goes both ways. Merging EB/AD configuration would be trivial for the Core devs. They could do it with all there proper QA, destroying all the "incompetence" arguments, and they could just use their current defaults EB=1,AD=inf, so that any deviation would be a voluntary action by the person running the software.
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:44:44

People may have different or new ideas that they believe are better.
Up until now, all of the changes proposed by the plethora of altcoins turn out either not improvements at all, or not important enough to counter the network-effect.

You make reasonable points, but I am not sure that the actual consensus threshold needs to be part of the moderation policy, or more general, should define what falls within the "scope" of bitcoin and what is an altcoin.

Everyone is using the same value for block reward.

I am really looking forward to compact blocks and want to believe it's superior, as it indeed looks awesome, but you're not really helping here.


Didn't we just conclude that they both gain 96% (including any filter overhead)? Didn't you just retort my statement with how xthin "changed a lot"? Are you now again saying that compact blocks will achieve better then 96% mean bandwidth savings?  
Let's try to keep this comparison fair.


I understand this, but that wasn't my question; I don't understand how this is related to block propagation. As far as I understand, both solutions could use opportunistic mode in the same way with the same guesses. In both solutions, this would drop a round trip with the same success rate.
Is this wrong? Is the reduction from 1.5 to 0.5 in these cases somehow only possible with compact blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:45:32
If your node receives blocks that are invalid from a peer it will be marked as misbehaving and it will disconnect and "ban" that peer. Who is it going to send its transaction to?
It might be possible by white listing peers, but you get no confirmation feedback.
Even if possible, I doubt it will be an acceptable UX.
@_date: 2016-06-06 16:23:25
I don't really know. I think the idea is that you can construct a tx that makes a large portion of the block false positive, but how this would be an attack vector isn't really clear to me. 
This is why I hope it gets addressed.
@_date: 2016-06-15 09:14:27
It may be overkill, but it does indicate manual fee calculation as it would be a bit odd to round the fee for software that calculates it from the last blocks.
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:06:27
3) I think that for many (B2B) transactions, speed isn't important at all. They are best send with the lowest fee that will still be eventually included. If they get dropped of the mempools before including, they can just try again a tiny bit higher fee.
@_date: 2016-06-06 21:21:48
When using bitcoin, you are usually presented with a QR code. You can scan it with your mobile phone or click it to use your desktop wallet. You then get the feedback "payment successful".
This doesn't mean that these services accept 0-conf,  (most of them don't) but these services need to monitor txs to show the user what is happening.
Similarly, when my buddy pays me something, my wallet immediately says "incoming tx, unconfirmed." Without that functionality,  it would be quite an awful user experience.

There is quite a difference between a hardfork and a softfork. 
A hardfork can occur at 1%. The threshold is merely a tool for miners to synchronize and play safe with their own income.
In a softfork, the non-upgrading clients will consider all new-style txs valid without actually validating them. The threshold is needed to protect the security of bitcoin.

I understand that, but that doesn't make it any different from xthin.
It is claimed that xthin and compact blocks differ in the latency, of respective 1.5 to 0.5.
I just clarified that this seems to be unrelated to the propagation method, as the 0.5 RT seems to rely on being lucky at once, which could work *exactly*  the same with xthin.
Am I wrong? Is 0.5 RT the reason compact blocks is superior?
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:13:17
Same for me. This is why I don't understand how this "fee market" solves anything. 
There are many more like us that will not suddenly stop paying bills if fees are too high. As soon as there are more then 3tx/sec of us before SegWit or hardfork, we will have an ever growing mempool.

The 96% saving this numbers show is *including* the bloom filter. Isn't this the same as compact blocks? 
Or, interpreting your "*and*" you are saying you expect compact blocks to be, exclude-bloom=half, minus 25% =&gt; 98.5% saving ?!?


This makes me curious, in compact blocks, how do you achieve 0.5 RT with 96% BW? How does the sender knows which txs to include?
Isn't this 0.5 RT only for those that already have all transactions? Isn't that the same with xthin? 
How does this handle blocks coming in from multiple sources?
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:09:57


Ok . Sorry, I was not completely sure whether you understood the 96% already includes the bloom filter,  but you're now very clear and unambiguous;  BIP152 will be 98% mean reduction.


I am happy to understand correctly that the 1.5 to 0.5 is not related to bloom vs compact.

Hmm. Frankly, I don't really see the use case. Bitcoin is trustless and you shouldn't trust peers more then a MITM.
This seems to move away from this idea, specifically for SPV clients who need some trusted peers for privacy reasons. Why don't just use VPN or Tor for these cases?
Do we really want to add this complications to the simple and elegant protocol?

This is a bit of an odd comparison.
I run a few nodes, and I am happily willing to allow for more transactions to keep the fees low.
I am "mad" about the fees not because of how they compare to other payment methods, but because of how they compare to how small they *could* be.

Lower bandwidth is clearly debunked by this artice as it shows xthin has the same 96% saving in production as core's solution in theory.
The latency claim stems from an idea presented in the bip that allows clients to signal that they want to retrieve blocks without asking for it, saving a round trip.
This is not really related to the propagation method as it could just well work with xthin.
I also doubt how much this will work in practice as the bip does not addresses the problem of retrieving a block from multiple sources in parallel.

I believe that the chain with the most work *is* the valid chain, because any other way to define what's valid and what's not requires an authority.

I fully agree that MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is more complicated then INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD. It must be treated with care.
Not just because it is a parameter related to how the system functions but also because the behaviour if users increase it is rather complicated.
This does not change the main point though: The users are in charge. We can *describe* the system with terms like "consensus", or *advice* the user, and *offer features*, but the user can decide what to do and which features he likes.
In my opinion, offering the accept-depth makes sense to allow some "breathing room" instead of just allowing to change the parameter *per direct* like Core. But I also understand that some people don't like it. 
Calling such feature "altcoin" or "non-consensus"  or moderating it out however, is a misunderstanding of how decentralized software works and is defined: by the users.

Frankly, the [paper]( is a bit messy to read but I am sceptical it solves  anything.
They propose a system where anyone can report blocks but you can't just count users because of the Sybil attack. The only words they spent solving this actual problem are:

I don't see how this could solve the problem. You simply move the 51% attack to those eligible to report a block.

Not at all. Whatsapp peers aren't trustless. You trust your friends.
Bitcoin is trustless, you can't trust peers any more then a MITM or your ISP, and you don't have to. 
The only use case is for when you want to move away from this and *do* a trust a peer. This seems to be the case for SPV clients wanting more privacy, and trusting for instance their wallet provider. 
Personally I think we should stick to VPN and Tor for these exceptions.
P2P encryption has no place in a trustless system.

What do you mean with the max blocksize being "secured"?
Various nodes (both mining and non-mining, both Core and BU) are currently using different values of MAX_BLOCKSIZE. Non-mining nodes that increase the MAX_BLOCKSIZE macro will see very little effect. They can just do this to ensure they go along once blocks gets bigger.
Miners have to be a little more careful that they don't end up losing money by mining on a chain that will be orphaned, but some are doing it nonetheless.
For both miners and non-miners, the accept-depth feature that unlimited offers seems like a nice additional configuration option.
Users determine the rules.

@_date: 2017-01-16 10:37:57


No. *Bitcoin* has an efficient synchronization mechanism.
Consider the INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD parameter. Quite important as it determines the total block reward. 
Currently this is a preprocessor macro and users can only change it by recompilation. To understand the mechanism, let us make this changeable at runtime by a slider in the Core wallet GUI.
Any user that actually moves the slider (or changes the macro) will quickly see that no more valid blocks are coming in, and - if mining - that its blocks are ignored. Its software will only function again by moving it back to the original position.
Hence all users naturally tend to agree on the same value. 
Parameters that exhibit this powerful behaviour are often  named "consensus parameters". 
@_date: 2017-01-16 10:19:54


The problem with this line of thinking, is that miners *do* control their own max blocksize because the system is decentralized and open source.
*Every* user can trivially choose the value of *any* parameter of bitcoin whether it's the INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD or MAX_BLOCK_SIZE. Changing the first won't really help anyone as it will make you ignore all blocks, and your blocks be ignored, but changing the latter may be a reasonable idea.
The thing that BU changes is not the mutability of MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, but an additional  feature that allows users to configure their software to allow larger blocks only after a certain depth.
Regardless of whether you thing this is a good feature, *some* users like it and would like to use it. A P2P network evolves by providing new features to users, not by withholding them.
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:37:22
I am not sure why it is fishy.
If the average demand for txs is less then ~3tx/sec the  mempool will be mostly empty; once it is a bit above 3tx/sec the mempool will grow indefinitely.
0.1tx/sec can make the difference between an empty mempool and an ever growing one.
As most wallets already use dynamic fees, there is little we can do about except waiting for SegWit or raising the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:16:29
I still do not understand this concept of a store-of-value system.
Does this entail a system where we use Bitcoin to store savings but $ for actual payments?
But in Bitcoin, the average non-miner *always* puts in more $ then he gets out. How is that a reasonable store of value? How does Bitcoin make sense if its not a payment system?

One interesting caveat is that the second one is also multisig with your peer. This means that in the scenario where your peer is down, you can publish the transaction but you can't change the fee.
With the rather volatile "fee market", this means you will probably use a much higher fee for it in order not to risk that you can't settle the channel.
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:57:49
Your arguments all hold for the [BIP 140]( as well. This also fixes malleability and makes LN simpler but comes with several additional advantages.
* It is much simpler.
* It doesn't effect the block limit so it can be equally applied to all clients regardless of their stance in this.
* It fixes only one thing.
SegWit is applauded for fixing many things at once, but I am not sure this is a good thing. It is it much easier to gain consensus if you fix one thing at a time. More importantly, if you look at the individual things SegWit is supposed to fix, it is questionable whether they need fixing and whether SegWit is the best solution for them.

I am not saying cheap transaction is *all* users want.

I do understand that different people have different preferences and values. Which is why I believe any formula for the blocksize that doesn't involve the cost of transactions at all is not "logically reasonable".
That said, I do *not* understand why lower values of X would fill up gigabyte blocks. The demand for transactions is completely inelastic. I am not going to pay more bills just because fees are lower.
The only thing that makes blocks grow is more users and by extension, more businesses, more miners, more pools, more full nodes and more decentralization.

I think decentralisation is the most important property of Bitcoin, and best improved by removing the limit.
More adoption yields bigger blocks, more miners, more pools, more chip builders, more businesses, more full nodes.
3tx/sec and 1mb blocks are *ridiculously* small for modern hardware. If we grow so fast that you need $10k hardware, Bitcoin will be so big that there will be 100,000s of businesses eager to invest this.
As for *end-users*, they shouldn't use full nodes as wallets. They can rely on PoW. Using the merkle tree and SPV, they can verify themselves if their transactions are secured under enough PoW.
Using a desktop full node as wallet is not only impractical, it is also much more secure to use a smartphone or HW wallet.

Sorry. I am assuming that our common goal is to have people using bitcoin for everyting.
People drink only so much coffee per day. People do not make more than a handful transactions per day on average, and this is normally with transactions that are already free.
With a sane fee of say 1 cent, people are not going to make *less* transactions than with a low fee of say 0.1 cent.
Obviously this doesn't extend to crazy fees like $5/tx.

I still don't quite understand this. I understand the idea of an SPV node from the paper, but how do non-mining full nodes help bitcoin?
Specifically, let X be an arbitrary participant of the network. Let Y be a participant to the ecosystem given the choice between: 
1. Verify all transactions in the world.
2. Verify his own transactions. 
How does 1 help bitcoin? It doesn't help Y because his most reasonable bet is the longest chain, and it doesn't seem to have any significant effect on X.
Wouldn't it be better to promote SPV nodes instead as originally envisioned?
@_date: 2016-06-06 21:37:14
I am sorry. It seems I misinterpreted your intentions.
I have no problem with your discouragement,  although I find the criterion of "peer-review" rather strict on both reddit and bitcoin matters in general.
These *seem* to be sound experiments confirming what we would expect in theory, and such treatment is rare in this area of research. 
Although "peer-review" sounds even better, I think in these type of blogs, it is sufficient that anyone can easily test and show these numbers to be incorrect if that is the case.
@_date: 2017-01-16 13:59:24
This is indeed where I disagree. 
Either the consensus rules can never change (which I believe is a broken concept), or the rules are determined *by the users*.
In my opinion, the concept of consensus is simply describing the behaviour of certain parameters. Any other definition is not decentralized.
As I explained in my other comments, bitcoin has proven that it is possible to have parameters determined by users, such as INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD that are incredible resistant to change. 
Even though each individual user can change it freely, the collective of users will *never* allow it to change.
Consensus parameters are *not* kept in place by code or by calling things altcoin; they are kept in place by users. 
In the same way that the collective of users will *always* agree on INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD, they can easily change MIN_RELAY_FEE. Hence the first is called a "consensus parameter" and the latter is called "policy". 
It turns out that they *could* change MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (although more tricky) as evident in the recent blocks being mined. 
The problem is that part of the community has reversed the argument. 
*INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD is called a consensus parameter because it is resistant to change, but currently some people are saying that you cannot change INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD because it is a consensus parameter.*
This reversal does not work in a decentralized protocol as it would require some other way of determining "consensus" and some other way of preventing users to change a macro definition.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:46:16
That is a misunderstanding. An attacker doesn't need to create invalid blocks in order to steal or destroy bitcoin. In fact, he would have to be rather stupid to use invalid blocks for his attacks.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:42:08
Of course they cannot unilaterally make changes. This is why the only changes in the rules we saw in first 7 years of the current most worked chain are few and widely embraced. 
That is *exactly* why defining Bitcoin as the chain with the most work is a perfectly reasonable definition.
Where as any attempt to define it as the most worked *valid* chain, only shifts the problem to an authority to define what's valid.
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:39:13
I think you are misinterpreting things. All parameters are in mutable in theory, and only made immutable by *users*.
For instance, every user is free to change the  21 million total supply by changing the initial_block_reward (macro) parameter. However, he will notice no more valid blocks coming in, and - if mining - his blocks will be ignored! The only way to make his client functional is to set the parameter back to the original value. It would only work if everyone changes it at the same time.
*Even though each user can change the total supply to his liking, the collective of users ensure it will never change.*
This everyone-tends-to-agree behaviour of the parameter is why we use the fitting name "consensus parameter" to describe this and some other parameters.
Some people have reversed the argument: They say that you are not *allowed* to change the total money supply because it is consensus. They say changing it is dangerous, scary, or even non-bitcoin or altcoin. 
In my opinion, such reversal shows a lack of understanding of the mechanisms which determine the value of the consensus parameters. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:03:50


It depends on how you quantify decentralization. I would quantify decentralization as the number of distinct entities that must be compromised for the security of the network to be breached. In bitcoin this is the number of miners controlling 51% and although this number is probably way too low, non-mining full nodes have no effect.
I understand that many here believe that non-mining full nodes somehow *do* improve decentralization. But clearly, the number of full nodes will also increase as adoption (and blocks) grows.
Using the *ratio* of full nodes/non-full nodes as quantification is hard to justify. This would mean that the network would be *less* decentralized if we add more SPV users to the network.

This is a simple softfork malleability fix (not more complicated then P2SH or CLTV), without all the other SegWit changes.

In real life we recognize several type of uses:
* Customer to merchant. This is the by far the most common. In this case the payment is instant, the merchant accepts the 0-conf risk as it is vastly more difficult to double spent then to just walk away. I still use it in restaurants/bars rather frequently despite the fees. 
* Friend to friend. This is just smartphone to smartphone scanning. I use it to settle bills. Probably much less common. Obviously 0-conf is fine here unless you have a weird taste in friends.
* Person 2 person trade. Localbitcoins. This is similar as friend to friend, except that it is of course advisable to wait 1 or 2 confirmations. Don't use it myself.

Let's look at the individual [benefits of segwit]( Please correct me where I am wrong:
**Malleability Fixes**
These are fixed in the same way but easier with BIP 140
**Linear scaling of sighash operations**
It is still possible to create non-segwit transactions and this will always be the case as there will always be existing pre-segwit outputs. This means any malicious actor can still create heavy-to-compute transactions.
This means it is only solved for good-actors, which is not very relevant.
**Signing of input values**
Hardware wallets support restoring existing keys so unless they are going to deprecate pre-2017 keys they will still need to support retrieving values from earlier transactions.
This means this isn't an advantage at all. Sure B is simpler then A, but "A and B" is obviously not simpler then B.  
People sometimes seem to forget how the immutable nature of the blockchain makes deprecation impossible: Every change increases complexity.
**Increased security for multisig via pay-to-script-hash (P2SH)**
This is an interesting design decision for SegWit, but not a consequence of SegWit. You don't need a softfork to support this increase in security as this is already supported by the current opcodes. 
**Script versioning**
Sure it sound nice, but it is  unclear which problem is being solved here. There *is* a nice extension mechanism with OP_NOP that can be extended indefinitely with an extension OP_NOP. 
Why do we need another versioning mechanism?
**Reducing UTXO growth / Efficiency gains when not verifying signatures**
These are client-side problems unrelated to the protocol, that can and should be solved by client implementations. 
**Block capacity/size increase**
Sure is nice, except that this is not the best way to increase the capacity as it does not include any future growth.

It's a frustrating question.
I believe that unrestricted growth of the blocks will only improve decentralization as it will lead to more users, more businesses, more miners, more full nodes and less fees.
Some people seem to think that those who advocate just removing/increasing the cap are "too simple" while the "clever" people come up with complicated sidechains/drivechains/LN.
*Just because a solution is simple doesn't mean it's less smart.*
Raising the block size *is* smart scaling.

That is a red herring. If the minority hashing power mines with a different reward it will be orphaned by the majority miners. 
If the *majority* hashing power mines a different reward, bitcoin will be worth zero, zilch, nothing, njente.
Why would me as full node not accepting these blocks help against that? If we can't trust the majority hashing power, why would anyone  trust the majority hashing power of the *remaining* miners? 
There are dozens of ways for the mining majority to destroy Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot exist with trusting the mining majority.

What also gives Bitcoin value is *users* actually being able to *use* it without paying exorbitant fees.
Something that can be trivially achieved by removing the block size limit. Which, contrary to popular opinion, would only *aid* decentralisation by increasing adoption.

You didn't misread. No attacker with a mind would use invalid blocks.
A withholding/releasing attack with valid blocks only:
* Can take anything available for bitcoin for free
* Doesn't cost any hashing power
* Cannot be stopped by patches or manual "invalidateblock".
* No full nodes are protected.
* Can be indefinitely repeated.

There are multiple ways to look at our rule-system.
A. We have a system of rules that is *defined* by the longest PoW. The longest PoW will *always* do as the economic majority wants by the economic principle of rational actors.
B. We have a system of rules that can *never* change at all unless the changes are making the rules more strict. (Aka 1mb is permanent)
C. We have a system of rules that can change only if "economic consensus" is reached by some social means outside of the blockchain.
You and the author (and the BIP 2 bip process) seem to prefer C.:


Frankly I don't understand this argument. What does "necessary" mean here? Does he mean the mechanism by which the PoW will follow the economic majority doesn't work in itself? Does it need guidance of the developers? How are we to reach consensus if it's not by the majority PoW?
I think A. is both the intended and the only feasible mechanism to reach consensus about rules in a decentralized way and I put my trust in the majority PoW.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:10:37

I am using the example to show that the distinction softfork/hardfork is not a suitable determinant for the mutability of rules.
*All* rules can be changed by the majority PoW which, by the economics of bitcoin, will follow the market demand of users.
The idea that some consensus rule changes like blacklisting addresses, P2SH or decreasing the blocksize are "allowed" and still bitcoin, whereas stop blacklisting or increasing the blocksize is "not allowed" and "altcoin" is not compatible with that basic premise.

This very much.
The cryptographers (and ^^ who believe to have found ways for bitcoin to survive a 51% attack by means of everyone running a full node seem to forget that the purchasing power of bitcoin is determined by trust.
If 51% of the mining power is going to move funds to themselves or increase the supply, no full node is going to prevent a total collapse of trust, and thereby of bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:30:48

That is unfortunately not possible. Due to miners taking a share, the amount of $ everyone puts in is always *more* than the amount of $ everyone gets out.
If it's not a currency, then on average, everyone loses from it.
@_date: 2017-01-16 11:15:04
That is only partially correct.
Every user is free to change any parameter. But for some parameters such as the initial block reward, changing it will make you ignore all blocks and your blocks be ignored.
*The immutability is determined by the users, not by the code.*
With something like the max blocksize things are a bit more complex which is why adding more complex configuration options is a good thing.

@_date: 2016-12-27 15:53:37


Unfortunately that doesn't solve the problem of how to determine which rules are valid.
Let us consider a concrete example of a breaking change of consensus rules: CLTV. At some specific block a year ago (height ~389100) certain transactions became invalid that were valid before. The exact moment that this new ruleset was enforced was determined by the mining supermajority as per BIP9. 
*That* defines when this new ruleset became active, not some kind of economic node threshold or *you* running a node. That would not be  a definable way to switch rulesets.
Of course, what the miners do is still *determined* by the economic majority; they would not have activated CLTV if it would be damaging the bitcoin economy as that would risk nodes forking off and their supply losing value.
@_date: 2016-12-20 06:28:42
Hm. So what if these two miners create 2mb blocks? Or if they use script with now deprecated OPs? Are they breaking the rules?
These rules are *changed* by a majority PoW.

This is a mistake. Consider two random users Alice and Bob. Alice can choose to verify her own transactions (SPV), or *all* transactions.
How does this decision effect Bob? Not at all. 
Running a full node is useful for oneself, but in no way helps "securing" the network.

That is incorrect. The payee generates the address and the payer needs to understand the address *type* to be able to pay to it. 
A payer paying to a "1" P2PKH address needs to generate a different output script then when it pays a "3" P2SH address.
With P2SH, the payee decides which script to use; this way the payee can use multisig or SegWit without the payer supporting it.
Currently P2PKH and P2SH are the only supported address types. Something like P2WPKH would require support for the *payer*, which is one of the reasons it is deferred for now.

If they implement opt-out replay protection and  they "win" because the legacy chain becomes unviable and worthless, then every time locked transaction will also be worthless and every wallet must update.
As such, to optimize for users, the decision for replay  protection must be weighed against the chance of success.
Given the amount of signers, the decision not to add opt-out replay protection is defendable.

The relation between larger blocks and orphan risk is *completely removed* by header first mining.
Even without this, with Compact Blocks, the transferred requirements for larger blocks are quite tiny.
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:06:58
It is true. 
The lightning network consists of many two-party payment channels, each of which initiated with an (on-chain) funding transaction.
To pay over multiple hops, for every hop the balance is adjusted with a new (off-chain) commitment transaction . This can only be done if the balance is available and on the "right side".
This is not a problem as long people understand that it is a *micropayment* network. This is why the initial maximum payment is ~35 usd, although I expect that this maximum  will have to be adjusted downwards a lot.
It is still awesome though. Think Internet of things, pay-per-view, pay-per-second. 
Regarding your edit. I am not sure what you are searching for in the paper. Did you read it? Part 5 describes how multiple hops work.
The easiest way to see this is to think of trouble: LN is designed such that nobody has to lose their money even if all LN connections break. Now how can A claim money from E if she has her funding and commitment transactions only with B?
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:30:50


I am not sure what you mean here. Softforks such as CLTV and P2SH cause transactions and blocks to be *invalid* which were *valid* before. 
Softforks could include decreasing the blocksize limit, or invaliding and zeroing out certain bitcoin addresses.
If these are just "selection and ordering of txs and blocks", isn't everything?

@_date: 2016-12-29 23:49:11
Yes. Nice.
Although that means you will actually have to do all tips on-chain.
I was thinking that you just do the withdrawals and deposits. Your balance is then your deposit (on-chain on your derived address)  plus what you've received in comments minus what you sent in comments.
That would mean a lot less transactions and very small amounts possible; but it does mean you can't use a shared private key.
@_date: 2016-11-28 07:02:51
That is quite an assumption. The thing is, that non upgraded wallets can not pay to such an address. 
This means that even if 97% of the wallets have upgraded, it is in the users advantage to use the "most compatible" address. See FAT.
I think it is reasonable to assume P2SH will become the prevalent standard.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:20:30
Sure. This is why miners set minimum fees and have done so long before blocks are full.
In no way does this require the blocks to be limited other than by miner's policy.

Can you explain this?
Are you saying Schnorr signatures can not be implemented by a new signature check opcode (softfork)? 
I thought that the only relation between SegWit and Schnorr is that SegWit changes the way new scripts can be implemented.
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:57:08
It might be nice if it were explained better, but it's the simple consequence of using two-party payment channels. The only additional thing that makes multi-hop possible is HTLC but that is only to ensure the payment goes through all the hops. It doesn't change the fact that individual hops need to be settled in their respective payment channels.
Maybe take a look at this example  




@_date: 2016-11-29 17:22:18
OP_CLTV and OP_CSV were introduced very smoothly.
Yes, they need a DROP, which is the design of the OP_NOP softforks.

Bitcoin is trustless. I can't trust a peer any more than I can trust a MITM.

What is the advantage of adding it to the protocol ? 
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:01:54
Your logic *could* work if bitcoin can be defined in terms of a static set of consensus rules, but it can't. The rules are regularly changed with softforks, and rightfully so.
Softforks and hardforks have several things in common:
* The change the consensus rules
* They require a majority PoW
* They need economic support
They *only* differ in method of transition, which is arguably a bit easier with a softfork. Why would for example the consensus rule change to limit the blocksize to 2mb create an altcoin, but the consensus rule change to limit the blocksize to 0.5mb *not* create an altcoin? That makes no sense.

Just out of curiosity. What if I:

* Setup a watching service
Then for any channel that

* has currently &gt; 80% of the balance to the peer
* has an earlier balance &gt; 80% to me
* has not been seen for N days
I take the funds. Sometimes I lose a little but usually I win. Wouldn't this make me money?
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:15:20


Are you saying that some miner could confiscate coins without any one finding out? This doesn't sound realistic. 
Non-mining full nodes are a thing because for block-explorers/payment processors/analysts/developers/etc it's not really useful to filter transactions. There are, and will always be thousands of them.
@_date: 2016-12-29 13:33:13
The problem is that if A wants to pay say 0.5 btc to E, then A, B and C all need to have 0.5 btc locked in their channels with B, C and E respectively. 
This is not a problem for micropayments for which LN is intended, but for ordinary bitcoin transactions this would not be efficient. 
I am not opposed to LN; it's awesome and there is definitely a future for micropayments and IoT, but some people seem to think that LN is going to be useful for ordinary payments even though direct on-chain transactions are much more efficient for that.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:40:11
Why wouldn't it be safe to mine without validating  your parent block? If you validate the PoW, the only risk is an attacker wasting $30k on mining an invalid block. A risk so tiny we can round it to zero.
This is why header first mining (empty blocks) exists.
With SegWit, miners even safely include fee paying transactions as they can verify which transactions are included without needing the signatures.
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:43:31


Yes. 
The reason miners don't confiscate money is because it would make their bitcoins worthless, not because it is on some curated list of immutable rules which contains "confiscating money" but doesn't contain "P2SH".
*Every* consensus rule can be changed: P2SH, SegWit, blocksize limit, total money supply.
What is actually changed is determined by the economics of miners following market demands.
@_date: 2016-11-20 08:23:28


Although I am not against SegWit, this is a *terrible* metric.
Core development is a meritocracy: those with technical know-how are de facto in charge. Unfortunately this also means that whatever constitutes technical know-how is determined by those in charge.
This creates a *meritocratic bubble*; the core developers inside the bubble tend to agree on most things, while different opinions only come from outside and are hence dismissed as coming from "non-experts." 
I believe the organizational model is flawed and am still hoping for the day that core adopts a more conventional and peaceful Open Source model.
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:15:14
There doesn't have to be a huge increase.
If blocks are full with 4 tx/sec then a slight increase to 4.1 tx/sec will cause an ever increasing backlog. This will eventually cause a decline in usage. Temporarily 3.9 tx/sec will cause the backlog to shrink again.
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:16:38


Hmm. You could argue that pools actually help *against* miner centralization: Pools allow people to mine even if the blocks get bigger and they don't have the resources to validate blocks.
Pools don't actually have much power because the cooperation between miners and pools is very asymmetric. Pools depend on miners for their income, but miners can switch pool with a click of the button.
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:24:18
Agreed. Once a day is enough.
Here is an interesting idea to do it *without signup*: Create a HD key; everyone has a deterministic deposit public address derived from this HD key + reddit username. 
Deposits can be made to this public address. Withdrawals can be done by messaging a withdrawal address to your bot; tips (transfers) can be done by comment replies.
Now your service only processes withdrawals once a day. 
The interesting part is, that all your data is in the blockchain + reddit messages/comments. You don't even need a db! (only maybe as a cache for balance requests). You just track all balances and perform withdrawals daily in a few big txs. Everything is public and transparant.
One issue is, that the space of reddit-usernames is too large, so you may require people to ping your bot when they have done a deposit; this would also be a nice way to ask for the deterministic deposit address.
@_date: 2016-11-28 09:07:33
In this case the competition is between P2SH supported everywhere, and P2WPKH supported by 97%.
P2SH can not "lose" in the sense that it is already in use and this must be supported in the future.
It doesn't matter whether it is businesses or users, it just seems unlikely that P2WPKH will be worth the few bytes it shaves off.

@_date: 2016-12-19 16:49:07
I understand these differences but I firmly believe that these technical differences do not determine what changes are "allowed". 
I believe in the rules determined by the majority hashing power regardless of how they came to be. I do so because I believe it is the best and only decentralized way to determine rules.
Consider this example: Address X is bad; people say it's a owned by ISIS or a pedo or both. Version 19.1 will contain a rule invalidates X and this is accepted by the majority hashing power and nodes through a simple BIP 9 softfork.
A year later, after much discussion it is realized that this was a mistake. We don't want to hurt fungibility, and address X wasn't ISIS after all. 
Now we are saying that the change allowing X again is impossible because that is somehow an "altcoin" because it is "contentious", a "dangerous" "hardfork" and a "split of the chain"?
This is nonsense.
I understand that changes that broaden the rules are different and involve more risk then softforks, but that doesn't mean that they cannot happen or are somehow not governed by the same  decentralized mechanism called PoW.
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:43:56


So softforks are not changing the protocol? The difference between HF and SF is only in the transition. A SF is somewhat easier by being only more restrictive.
The similarity between a soft and a hardfork is that they are changes of consensus rules.
For example,  if increasing the block limit is changing the rules, then surely so was decreasing it.

It only makes sense to encrypt traffic if I know a peer I already trust. 
It makes *no sense* to encrypt traffic to a peer I don't know.
For the cases where I do know a trusted peer (for instance when I own multiple computers in different locations), a VPN *between me and that peer* is the most logical solution. 
A VPN offers many advantages over BIP151:
* There already many battle-hardened tools out there.
* It encrypts not just bitcoin traffic, but *all* traffic between me and my peer
* It allows for additional goodies such as 2FA
* It is often already in place between high-security trusted peer environments
* It doesn't complicate bitcoin.
Of course "SSH-level" security is cool, but it has no place in the protocol itself.
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:48:11


This is a misconception. Sure, technically they could, but happily? No way.
No one would be giving a dime for bitcoin if the (ex-) majority hashpower has turned against it. 
Do you really expect users to simply switch to trusting the majority of the *remaining* miners, with more than the total hashing power lingering with the intention of destroying bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-12-17 20:54:17


What do you mean it can't be changed? It's a consensus rule  that can be changed just like other changes of consensus rules such as  P2SH, CLTV or SegWit.
There is no curated list of changes that are "allowed".
Heck even the the 21 million limit is a rule that can be changed. The only difference between the rule-change P2SH and rule-change that increases the limit is that a majority supported the first while no one  is ever going to support the latter as it would decimate the value of their supply.
The only thing that makes some rules more immutable than others is economics.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:59:02
(author here).
I agree that the risk is small.
However, please realize that the $120k goes both ways. The fact that blocks are so expensive also means it becomes increasingly unlikely that someone creates invalid block.
This is also why SPV is nowadays safe, even without fraud proofs. You only need to verify your own transactions and the Proof-of-work as no attacker in their right mind is going to spend $120k/block to defraud SPV with invalid blocks. 
For an attacker, defrauding with *valid* blocks by shapeshifting to another currency, then reorging the chain is more lucrative, less risky and unstoppable even by full nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:18:08
Good point.
I have read quite a lot about it since I learned about Bitcoin in late 2010 as I am a developer and nowadays working on Bitcoin full time.
I fully agree that an anti-scientific approach is not appropriate for such decisions and this is a very common theme in the criticism to Core's small block roadmap: *It is not backed by research at all*.
This is sheer contrast with the big block movement which is investing in and build around a lot of research with regards to block propagation, resource requirements, and big (1gb block!) networks.
I am certain that if you would dive deeper into the world outside Core's bubble you'd be surprised to find how much more professional the approach is of the technicians in the big block circles is compared to Core.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:34:13
Before blocks were full and the limit became effective, blocks were growing at an almost linear rate of 250 tx/day. 
This means it takes ~3 years before blocks are 2mb and 1000s of years before blocks are VISA level.
Decentralization harmed by growth is a non-risk and does not in any way merit completely blocking further growth.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:07:45
That depends on the vendor. It requires everyone who relies on full node software to update.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:24:17
Yes. it would work.
I do think it could be more efficient to do the full sorting to canonical ordering before accessing the UTXO db. This can be done because you want to move all txs from todo1 to todo2 that have an prev_tx_out that exists in todo1.
This is faster because it is more cache efficient; you don't intermix accessing all these transactions with access to the utxo. And you don't get unnecessary UTXO misses.
A simple implementation would indeed use `todos = std::vector&lt;std::set&gt;&gt;`. Then move the txs from todos[0] to todos[1] that have an output in todos[0].
Though we are touching too much details, I do not think that would be optimal. It would be faster to create todo1 as a sorted vector, mark everything that must be moved to todo2, then split todo1 in todo1 and todo2 based on that mark. This eliminates the need for tree operations used by std::set.

This is because most of the things written are very deceptive:
* He takes three random "proponents" and then claims these are the people "behind" Bitcoin Cash and "owners of the code". *They aren't even contributors!* They only happen to *like* Bitcoin Cash. How does it makes sense to criticize a project for the people that happen to like it?
* He claims their are no commits pointing to an unused Github repository.
* Claims their are no active developers when in fact there are lots of them working on it every day. I count 7 developers that are visibly contributing *in the very last day*.
* He makes completely bogus claims about testing out of the blue.
* He warns of a 51% controlled 3 pools, conveniently leaving out that this is only 4 pools with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-10 14:30:29
It's rather ironic, as for *me* as a developer, the strength of Bitcoin Cash is that it *doesn't* have leaders that are blindly followed by the community.
It has a diverse technical community which weighs all aspects in the decision process; engineering, cryptographic, decentralization and usability.
This is a sheer contrast with Bitcoin which is lead by a handful of cryptographers whose only improvements are finding new cryptographic tricks, judged by their cleverness without regard for the overall usability, scalability and decentralization of the network.

I don't think BIP 101 will trigger miners to facilitate for the maximum blocksize specified. Not only is the grow curve way high and costly, it will also in practice  be bound much lower by soft limits set by miners and by actual usage.
In this proposal, miners still have their "vote" on maximum block size by means of their soft limit, which not only bounds the block they create but also the hard limit. 
The theoretical growth rate of x4 every 70 days can only be reached if *all* miners remove their soft block limit, and demand keeps up. This doesn't seem realistic in practice.

What do you mean? 
Ever since februari 2016, Jihan has consistently written positively about SegWit, and consistently embraced it in combination with an base increase.
Of which "other" people  is he a part?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:00:36
I think you misunderstand what "replay protection" means.
If this were added, all existing time-locked transactions would become void. All existing wallets would stop functioning.
"Replay protection" makes sense if you want to fork off the main chain with a minority, not if you want to upgrade the protocol with a  capacity increase.

Well, yes. The Bitmain guy, who helped Bitcoin get big in China. The one who signed HK, SegWit + 2x base increase. And NYA SegWit + 2x base increase.

@_date: 2017-11-06 22:28:08
If some miners change the rules of the protocol, it is possible that two forks persist: one with the old rules and one with the new rules.
In this case, your coins will be split: If you own 1btc, you will afterwards own 1btcA and 1btcB.
But handling them isn't trivial. If you then spend 1btcA to someone, the same transaction could or could not be included on chain B, causing you to also spend 1btcB to the same person. This is known as "replay".
It is possible to ensure that when you change the rules, you also change the transaction format. This prevents the issue as transactions won't be compatible but also requires everyone to upgrade to the new format and would destroy existing transactions locked by time.
The segwit2x group decided not to change the format as they aim to upgrade everyone and they argue coins can be split by other means.
This has caused some bad reactions of people that say it is important.

The max 4mb was *before* block synchronization techniques IBLT, Compact Blocks, XThin. This means ~40mb blocks on hardware from several years ago.
The gigablock initiave has shown that *moderate* hardware can handle gigabyte blocks *today*.


It's a red herring. Yes it is possible to improve SPV (for instance see my [UTXO proposal]( ), but the argument is gone. With $100k blocks it is *much* more lucrarative for an attacker to use *valid* blocks than to use *invalid* blocks as the former costs zero while the latter costs $100k per block. SPV has never been defrauded and will never be defrauded.

Yes. This is obviously better than compact blocks, but I have said before that neither XThin, nor CompactBlocks nor IBLT make much sense to me.
All suffer from heavy computation requirements on mempool growth, and degradation on distinct mempools for the gain of a few bytes.
Just send a block as a list of tx-hashes! There is no universe where 32 bytes per transaction is too much; especially none where this means ~64kb blocks, and where the blocksize was growing (before full) almost linear at ~250tx/day.
IMO: All other optimizations are just unnecessary complications.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:27:05
1. You don't need to keep all that data and processing 2400 tx/sec takes about 600 kb/sec which is rather acceptable even today.
2. It will take a *long* time before we Bitcoin needs mastercard level transaction throughput. There has been no indication that bitcoin's growth outpaces technology.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:33:14
People in this thread are making a lot of claims of what Jihan said without actual links.
I am not aware of Jihan disliking SegWit, and I would find it rather strange that Bitmain would agree to SegWit + HF both in HK as in NY if Jihan would be opposed to SegWit. How does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:49:40


This is exactly what you get if you don't limit the blocksize.
Before blocks were full and the maximum block size took effect, the block size grew almost linear with ~250 transactions a day.
A pace at which it would have taken roughly 3 years to reach 2 mb, and 1000s of years to reach VISA level.
Unfortunately, instead of trying to speed up growth, it was halted by maintaining the limit using  repeatedly debunked arguments of "decentralization".
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:01:55


No. With the current usage pattern it would be ~1.8mb. When everyone is using LN for everything it could approach 3mb.

Technically the differences are minimal. Bitcoin Cash allows larger blocks and no SegWit.
Neither are owned or controlled which would defeat the purpose of a decentralized currency.

Yes. Because if everyone would use "replace by fee", then suddenly all these transactions *would* fit in a tiny block.

Why is it gibberish?
The total amount of $ people spend to buy Bitcoin is *exactly* the same as the amount of $ people get from selling Bitcoin. If you're not Fed, you can't create $ out of thin air.
As mining costs electricity, on average every Bitcoiners earns *(0$ - $electricity-cost)/users* which is negative.
The only way to make $ from Bitcoin is if somebody else loses $.
If Bitcoin is not used for payments, it makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:07:52


If there is no order, you can simply first add all the new UTXO's to the database and then start validating all the inputs and remove the UTXO's being spend. 


Steo 2 us still O( n2 ) and of course that would need investigating but:
* I think it's quite easy to find a better algorithm; for instance one that picks how far to push forward depending on where it is. This is just a crude example of how it would be posssible.
* Even with this one, I don't think reordering 10,000 transactions this way in O(n^2) is a reasonable DoS attack. Using a linked list, even the worst case with  100 million moves can likely be done in a few millieseconds.

I (and I think many with me)  am not convinced by BIP 100, BIP 101 or BIP 102 for reasons already endlessly discussed.
Let me propose another solution:
**New hard limit: no block is allowed to be larger then 4 times the average of the last 10000 blocks**
I believe this (BIP-tomtomtom) would solve the problem now and in the future with little drawbacks:
* It allows for fast exponential growth.
* It becomes practically impossible to harm or centralize bitcoin by creating artificially large blocks.
* It does not rely on miner voting (which kindof shifts the problem; what should they vote?) but on real-world usage.
* Miners can (and should) use soft-limits to encourage a fee market.
* The limit may become visible at peak shopping times, but only in a non-intrusive quantity that can be covered  by deferring transactions to later blocks. 
Anything wrong with this approach?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:34:01
The easiest way to survive this "attack", is to accept an increase to a meager 8mb block-weight, enjoy the reduced fees and unite behind a single Bitcoin.
There are several nonsense arguments brought up *against* such small increase but the most common are that is "untested", "buggy", "unreviewed", "rushed" non of which make any sense after the fact, even if they *would* make sense now. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:38:12

I really have a hard time understanding this. Since the start of the blocksize debate we went from. 
1. We obviously need to shift the limit.
2. We don't agree on *how* to shift the limit
3. We shouldn't shift the limit yet. We should do crypto-tricks first.
4. Maybe we shouldn't shift the limit at all?
5. A shifted limit is a *dirty, corpororate hostile takeover*.
How on earth did so many people in the sub arrive at 5?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:27:10
None of your arguments make sense.
* Centralisation. No. It's less centralized as it allows for more adoption, more users, more businesses, more miners, more pools, more full nodes.
* Few crappy devs. No. It has much *better* developers.
* Controlled. No. It is decentralized network which is controlled by everyone. Read the paper for an explanation.

I think that we both agree that Bitcoin ABC has yet to proof itself.
We also agree that *how* Core is developing fine and on par with other high profile Open Source projects.
I don't think this is the most important part though. Just like has hashpower follows money, development talent follows successful projects.
I also agree *what* they develop is a different discussion, but a much more relevant one.
In the early years of Bitcoin, the only cryptography used was some hashing and public keys for proof-of-ownership. Crypto 101. Engineers like Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen were doing great in improving the basis with building stuff that made Bitcoin even greater like payment channels, the payment protocol and SPV. They recognized the fixed block size problem and tried to solve this as well.
Nowadays the entire Core consists of cryptographers who work on stuff like:
* MAST (allowing contracts to be partially commited) (what contracts?)
* Sidechains to experiment with even more crypto tricks outside the main chain.
* CT (allowing you to hide the amount at 3x the size)
Meanwhile, the most important change Bitcoin needs is completely off the table. None of the 100 block size proposals since 2013 is even discussed or allowed to be discussed. Everyone even considering this is alienated.
Unfortunately the public tends to see more complicated solutions as more "clever" even though Bitcoin really only needs one simple upgrade.
Don't get me wrong, I think these cryptographers are extremely clever but from an engineering perspective I honestly get the impression Core is now a cryptographic playground of people showing off their latest tricks without *any* regard to what the ecosystem actually *needs*.

This is not trough substantial testing. Substantial testing is being done by other parties who have consistently shown that bigger blocks can easily be handled; most recently with the Gigabyte block initiative.
The only arguments are dogmatic to push through flawed off-chain solutions.
Unfortunately an open discussion about this has been cut off by the mods for years and developers that come to different conclusions have been driven out.
Luckily, we have some developers lead by Amaury Sechet who made the bold move in August, and hopefully the market finally starts to see how important that little change is for the future of Bitcoin.

But the fact didn't change significantly. 
The arguments against on-chain scaling are just as flawed as they were in 2010. 
The only thing changed is that the people that understand Bitcoin scaling and security model (from the beginning) were chased away, and the people that don't understand it and are pushing their own off-chain solutions (from the beginning) were embraced as "experts". 
Even today, when it has become obvious that their policy has made Bitcoin completely unusable, it seems that some still think it is *other people's fault*, calling this "attack";  which clearly contradicts the main principles of a decentralized network.

I agree I don't know if it works. But trustless outsourcing is limited as you will *have* to know who you are monitoring. So we can simply include:
* the peer is one that I am "monitoring" on another server.
It could well be that the right parameters can be found to make this profitable.
For another one,  I think that a decentralized network needs to be guarded against cheap attacks even if not profitable. What if I repeatedly:
* Start a server 
* Acquire lots of channels with lots of liquidity
* Go offline
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:03:52
I didn't say Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and I don't agree with that. 
Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin with a larger block size, and until it has more market value and hash power it won't be Bitcoin. After that it seems unlikely that the legacy fork survives, as it wouldn't have much benefit.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:56:21
I agree. 
Miners centralization and high barrier of entry may not be what we like to see, but miner's authority seems to an essential part of bitcoin.
They determine *all* the rules of the blockchain by means of properly aligned incentives.
Other "users" are either the ones using their services (and paying for it), or full nodes helping to pass stuff around without any say in the rules. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:33:56
I do know my shit. I am a full time bitcoin developer, but I don't normally contribute to Core as I think their roadmap is terrible. 
I am not the only one. Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik, Amaury Sechet, Tom Zandler, Andrea Suisani, Andrew Stone, Peter Tschipper, Tom Harding, Ryan Charles, Marek Kotewicz​, Dagur Johannsson are some of the many developers that work on bitcoin but do not agree with Gregory's roadmap and thus are not part of "Core".

@_date: 2015-07-30 12:26:02
Well said. But this change isn't about the blocksize.

It is not so much about "gotchas" (of which forgetting to round before serialization as shown ITT is one). It is about choosing the right type.
The concept of a float is that it can store both extremely large and extremely small numbers in a single representation. Hence the "floating" point.
There is absolutely no use of that in storing monetary values as you will want to be able to store everything with the same number of decimals regardless of the size. There is no point in supporting say 12 decimals up to X and 11 decimals up to Y.
What you want is "fixed" point number or a decimal, which normally implemented as a (large) integer with a fixed decimal division.

I don't think this is a process. The difference in viewpoint is there since 2010. People that believe Bitcoin can scale on chain, and people that don't.
Even in his [first email thread on the mailing list]( Satoshi has trouble explaining to people how the network can scale. Early developers like Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn understood, but others like Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd didn't. They claimed it didn't scale from the start and kept pushing for their cryptographic solutions like side chains, and later LN.  
But these solutions aren't likely to solve scaling. For starters [read this]( now ancient but excellent piece by Mike Hearn. Luckily, today, more and more people start to see, that Satoshi, Hearn and Andresen were right: Bitcoin *can* scale on-chain and it is much more powerful and decentralized than any off-chain solution.

I am not talking about compensating miners. I am talking about the situation where Bitcoin isn't used for payments, only dollars are and Bitcoin is only used to convert to/and from dollars.
This means that in dollars, *all bitcoiners together* (including miners), pay in total *x*$ on electricity bills and gain exactly 0$. They can only "gain" dollars from each other. 
*You can't increase your amount of dollars by buying and selling Bitcoin without somebody else losing dollars.*

Roger Ver is clearly fond of Bitcoin Cash but he wasn't involved in the creation at all.

If ECSDA is broken, it seems likely that such algorithm would either be fast, or consist of independent trials.

First of all, the idea of a "savings account" doesn't work. Let's say we spend money using $ or BCH, and only use BTC as savings, converting from/to $ as needed.
The amount of $ you convert to BTC is *on average* always *less* than the amount of $ you get out. You can't create dollars out of thin air. So as a "savings account" it is rather useless.
Second, Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin which only increases the blocksize. Something long overdue. If Bitcoin Cash is actually used, then the upgrade is succesful, and there is no point at all in keeping the legacy Bitcoin alive.

Bitcoin Cash didn't steal any brand. They just made a change to the block size, while accepting they are forking a minority and are not yet Bitcoin. Though it looks like the tide is changing.
Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is not a single implementation. I am developer of Bitcrust and my own roadmap is to first build this node software. As for the roadmap of Bitcoin Cash, I don't think there is a unified roadmap and I don't thing that is a good idea, but things like a malleability fix, L2 solutions, UTXO commitments and Schnorr are all being discussed and investigated. 
I know it's not what the people in this sub like to hear, but it's really a refreshing and professional Open Source environment compared to the incompetence and trolling in the Core team.

Of course this care against Dos but the  non-ending case is trivial to catch.
Also note that dependencies do not require linearity.
Transaction hashes already ensure the graph is acyclic so if my implementation does per block
1. Add all utxos in block
2. Remove all utxos in block.
It validates properly.
Linearity is *only* needed for the merkle tree which can be achieved with either:
* The simple canonical ordering described above
* A simple HF that makes the merkle tree construction use by-hash ordering.
You don't effect cpfp that way.

@_date: 2017-11-06 08:35:32
No. Sorry. My comments regarding first inserting into UTXO and than validating/removing were with regards to a an unordered set which would require a HF.
If we use a canonical order, there is not much benefit to do so.
We simply have:
1. Get the unordered transaction set via Graphene
2. Order them by hash to the set "todo"
3. Verify each transaction; If UTXO found: valdate, update UTXO accordingly, remove from set "todo", add hash to "merkle-set".
4. If "todo" is non-empty and iteration count &lt; MAX_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH, goto 3.
5. Verify merkle tree.
MAX_DEPENDENCT_DEPTH could be softforked in (if not already?).
Note that this is an implementation detail most similar to the current code; it may be more efficient to sort before  accessing the UTXO-db
1. Get the unordered transaction set via Graphene
2. Order them by hash to the set "todo"
3. For each output in the set, if this output exists as txhash in "todo" move to "todo2".
4. Repeat 3 upto MAX_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH
5. Procees as normal with the set

So by not giving users these optional controls, we are preventing these users from losing control? That makes absolutely no sense. If users don't want to accept larger blocks they can just leave the settings as is. It's optional.
*Some* users *want* to accept blocks of the most worked chain even if they are say 1.5mb. This is not an unreasonable request, and if Core shows no interest in providing  it or offering an alternative they like better, they lose market share, and we won't get consensus on other improvements.

That is way too simplistic. As miners are the  participants whose income is directly aligned with the economy, hashrate is also the best and only *quantification* of economic support (assuming perfect information flow). Furthermore, hashrate threshold is the only sensible way to trigger changes.
Some seem to mistakenly interpret the idea of economy being in charge as the idea that it is the economic users that decide *instead of* miners.
It is much more accurate to say that the economic users decide *via* miners.

This doesn't rhyme with what you are saying elsewhere.
You support a 2MB bump in 6 months; but if an upgrade using BIP109 is applied *successfully* in say 3 or 4 months, you suggest to reject this by changing the PoW? 
How is that not pure stubbornness?

I like what Blockstream is currently doing, but I do find this particularly worrying.
It is good that bitcoin is used for other - for profit - production use cases.
It is good that bitcoin's core codebase is adapted to allow for this.
It is NOT good that this is the same team doing so. This will inevitably lead to decisions regarding prioritization and direction  that are in conflict with the public utility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:01:42


That seems a bit unfair. Trusting Core is one thing, but blaming people for discussing the technology on forums, because it "distracts developers" is not a very reasonable approach


I don't see why Core wouldn't be able continue their plans after merging the 2mb code. Although an increase is scheduled on their roadmap much later then Classic proposes, I don't think any of the Core developers have fundamental objections against 2mb. This doesn't need to cause any delays in their plans.

Besides the 2-4 times being incorrect, this is a bit of a symmetric argument.

Several reasons why torrents don't have such centralisation pressure.
- torrents are more efficiently downloaded from multiple nodes.
- there are no gains from running a big torrent server.
- you don't need to lock money to act as hub.
This is in stark contrast with LN where:
- Each additional used node adds costs to transactions.
- everyone acting as hub needs to lock funds in a hot wallet.
- every time someone doesn't have enough funds to lock new routes need to be found.
As it is stands now it is simply most efficient and cheap with a single big hub.
You could argue that this is not bad because OneBigHubCorp doesn't need to be trusted, but there are currently no known methods to prevent this centralisation .
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:30:50
Hardware wallets asking for this has absolutely nothing to do with SPV.
Hardware wallets asking for it, is because currently they need to process all the input transactions to verify the amount of a transaction.
With SegWit this is not needed which saves processing time.

The 21 million coin is quite the opposite of the max_block_size.
Everybody uses the same value for  the 21 million coins. No individual user *wants* to change this because they would find themselves on their own chain. That is why there is consensus.
Different users *are* using different max_block_size values. It *can be* in  the individual non-miners interest to increase it. People are not kicked of the network by changing it. That is why there is currently  no consensus in the network. 
Consensus cannot be maintained just because it important to maintain it. It needs a mechanism as there is for things like the 21 million limit and other block validation rules, but which does not exist for the max_block_size.

BitcoinCore doesn't *have* a blockchain either. Both Classic and Core are built upon the same software continued by different developers.
I don't think authority matters here, but Classic is lead by the lead developer assigned by Satoshi, whereas Core is lead by the lead developer assigned by  the lead developer assigned by Satoshi.
Assigning some special significance to Core as the "owner" of bitcoin makes very little sense.

This makes no sense. 0.11.2 and 0.12.0 are compatible on protocol level. They can simply merge 2mb support to 0.12.0. Why would they want to throw stuff away? This is not a second HF, but simply following the HF in progress.


This doesn't sound realistic at all. 
A hardfork is dangerous. It is extremely difficult to get enough miners and nodes to agree.
You seriously believe that if 75% of the miners have switched 2mb, they will drop back because Core makes a promise to do it six month later? I think them popping the champagne is more realistic. Besides, some people actually *want* Classic; these miners will not switch back, so going back would be a major split in the community. Miners are not going to do that.
If 75% is triggered, no profit seeking miner is going to stay on the minority branch. The only outcomes, is either that Core releases 0.12.1 with the 2mb and happily follows its roadmap, or they change the PoW and try to boot their own chain.

I [am]( making it myself. This is just advice. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 19:00:53


Simply withholding/releasing doesn't reduce mining income. If the minority chain would be worth more than the majority chain, it would actually cost money *not* to attack it. This makes this rather unlikely.

All rules are voluntary self imposed. This doesn't mean they aren't rules. If everyone is following the rule it's not a good idea not to follow suit.
For instance the introduction of the 1mb limit was a soft fork. Reducing to 750kb would also be a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-02-07 11:00:46
Pools "control" the hashpower only in a very limited way. 
Miners can switch pool with a push of the button. This gives them much more control then the pools itself. Pools simply cannot decide on changes that the miners don't like.
Miners are much better distributed then pools although actual numbers here are hard to find.

If it is something trivial like raising the block-limit which I plan to do later anyway, of course. I make software for users.


Fair enough, my claim about containing the freedom of choice was bit far fetched.


A developer considering Core  with a 2MB limit instead of 1MB to be "a project that no longer shares his ideals", is not a normal a reaction *especially* since raising the hard-limit is planned anyway. It seems like a "my way or the highway" mentality that has no place in a decentralized protocol.
Obviously that is just an opinion.
@_date: 2017-04-16 14:34:29


In case you run a full node,
How do you know those coins didn't just come from a block that will be orphaned after a day by an attacker withholding/releasing ?
With both an SPV and a full node, you must trust that 51% doesn't collude. 


@_date: 2016-02-26 13:04:35
This is true. Then again, *relative* hashrate is also quite important. 
If the hashrate would drop by 50%, this might not be an inherently insecure low hashrate. 
 
It would mean though that half of the world's ASICs would be turned off, or sold cheaply, which would make an attack more feasible, because they would be reusable for an attack.
@_date: 2016-02-14 10:38:45
It should be notes that this only certain if the difference between the to rule sets is trivial (such as 1mb vs 2mb limit).
If the changes are more severe then users might disagree with the miners and prefer the less secure coin. This would cause miners to quickly switch back to the more profitable chain.
@_date: 2017-04-25 08:48:08

Core development practices certainly aren't bad, but their priorities are way off in my opinion. 
I agree that Bitcoin Cash is young and still has to prove itself. However:


I don't really think this was "catastophic". The EDA was needed to get things started; neither the old nor the new algorithm would have worked. I am not aware of any better solutions, but even if there are on hindsight, the dynamics for an EDA are very hard to predict beforehand.
In my opinion the Bitcoin Cash developers already shined in implementing the second fork to a better DAA. Thorough discussion, simulations, code reviews and testing in a (in this case necessary) short time frame, which has resulted in very smooth upgrade.
But again, you are right that more time is needed to make a more objective assessment.

A single miner changing the difficulty would find himself on a lonely chain.
If say 75% of the miners would collude to change the difficulty they would find their coins to be worthless. Nobody would give a dime for their bitcoins.
Contrary to popular believe, non-mining full nodes have little effect on this. Sure they can continue on the  25% chain with existing rules, but this chain would also be worthless as the attacking 75% can easily obliterate that chain by withholding/releasing attacks.
PoW security cannot exist with the mining majority acting against it.


The primary principle of a decentralized network is that anyone can do whatever they want. Consensus simply means that people choose the same rules, which happens because of the incentive to do so.
There is no way to force people to use certain rules.
@_date: 2016-02-06 09:25:59


I think this is a misconception. From what I have gathered, *everybody* believes that we eventually need to HF to at least 2mb. 
The difference is that some developers believe it is safer to postpone it to much later.
This argument is no longer applicable when the change is triggered, in which case it is obviously safest to go along.
Hence we can expect everyone to quickly join after the trigger.
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:42:23


I am not saying that they have an obligation, but I don't see why their open governance model should so drastically change their role in the ecosystem.
If they don't fight for market share, they are bound to lose it and we won't get enough for things like SegWit.


If the network cannot function with users given the controls they like, it cannot sustainably function at all. Users being in control is a prerequisite for a decentralized network.
I believe bitcoin *can* function. Even if you give users all the controls they ask for, the incentives are aligned to keep things in place.
But this doesn't apply to the max blocksize, for if you would give everyone the controls, it wouldn't hold.
As such it can not be considered or maintained as a consensus parameter.

I am not fully convinced that all the signatures would be there if it would include "not increasing the blocksize by HF even if a majority of miners and users demand it."

Why is the difficulty propagated over the network in each block as target "bits" field?

You are somehow reading Jihan as the guy blocking SegWit. 
BU was gaining ground long before Jihan joined signalling and many smart people were questioning Greg's roadmap long before BU was gaining ground.
The problem here, is that Core doesn't treat these users as customers. Even if you want X, we only give you Y and if you don't use our software you are blocking Y and are evil.
Antpool is just being selfish as they should. The only party not acting selfish is Core who do not seem interested in requests from potential clients.
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:23:20
Regardless of that, they are now planning a hardfork with a threshold of at least 95%.
A one year grace period after 95% of the miners have switched in the name of "safety" makes no sense at all.

What are we going to do that year? Download one byte per day to of new code?

I am fully with this; but I can not understand why anyone in their right mind would consider BIP109 to be "betraying the first principles". 
As most seem to agree that a hardfork needs to happen at some moment, the only counter-arguments are that it is too soon and dangerous.
How can people still be against it if the fork has been successful? 
The only remaining arguments seem to be about politics and loyalty. How does this translate to "betraying the first principles?".
@_date: 2016-02-12 15:31:12
There is a 75% threshold. This means that if one 20% miner switches, nothing happens until another 55% joins him.
This makes an actual hardfork very unlikely because once 75% has joined, the remaining 25% can choose to join or face 4x less blocks until adjustment. If say half of these 25% joins by this incentive, staying for the remaining 12.5% will be even more expensive.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:12:49
I am not frantic. I am happy with the changes to the roadmap that Core made.
I just don't really understand this part. It seems mostly like an overreaction/sneer to Gavin's 4 weeks.
We are talking about the situation, at some point, that:
* people running peer-to-peer networking software
* 95% of the miners have already switched
* users have been constantly nagged by alerts (since 50%) that they need to urgently update their software
* Every bitcoin (and non-bitcoin) news outlet has published shitloads of warnings.
* The software has been thoroughly tested.
* The actual update takes a couple minutes.
I just can't imagine how clever people have gotten together, deciding that a one year "waiting period" is needed for safety. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 14:31:47
Yes. 
From my perspective, one of the great insights of Satoshi was the realization transaction data is simply not that large.
I would think most nodes are running on dedicated machines either by businesses that rely on it, or by bitcoin enthousiasts/developers.
For me, and I don't think I am alone, these numbers are very acceptable even if they are several factors larger.
Do you really think that heavier requirements would result in only a handful of nodes? If I look at virtual or dedicated machines in the cloud, I find very cheap machines are adequate to handle a multitude of what bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2017-04-20 09:03:22


Aren't miners supposed to use your software? If 38% of the mining power is asking for something, wouldn't it best to try to make them happy either by providing them what they want or offering them an alternative they like better?
How else are you planning to get new features like SegWit through?


Sorry, this might be the words of Core developers, but I get the idea that miners are "blocking SegWit" is a common narrative in the community.


I understand this, but I think it would help the network if each software team would try to gather as much market share as possible by providing the potential users of their software what they want.
I get the impression that you don't want to provide part of your users with what they are asking for, because you believe this would be bad for other users.
I don't think that is a sustainable way to develop a decentralized network.
@_date: 2017-04-20 07:09:29
You can trivially disable SegWit with another softfork but this never changes the rules for existing blocks. 
Therefore, existing SegWit outputs would still require SegWit to spent.
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:55:52
Fighting for market share  simply means trying to fulfill the needs of potential users.
A decentralized network can function if users work in their own interest and they can do so if development teams build the features they ask for or offer a alternative features they like even better.
Core does neither. Core just repeats what people *should* want. Therefore it is losing market share, especially among the miners. 
They don't seem to care at all about miners switching software and seem to make no attempt to gain them back. 
That is not going to result in consensus on things like SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:31:16


Of course it does!


Of course I believe *everything* should be up to the user! How else do you think a decentralized network can function? How do you intent to *prevent* people from making there own decision without authority?
Note that this doesn't mean every control makes sense; nobody would want to change the block reward as this only gets you isolate from the network, so providing this as configuration would improve nothing. 


BU *only* adds control to users of the software. The idea that developers can mess with the delicate balance of power by providing controls to users asking for it completely misses their role. Nobody can prevent people from acting in their interest, and all developers can do, is maximize their market share by giving people what they want.

Yes. This is their financial incentive to do good for bitcoin. If they don't, either the price will go down and/or nodes will not follow them.

Well technically, a split only occurs if enough *miners* are willing to mine on a minority chain (unlikely), and if the majority *miners* do not destroy the minority chain (also unlikely).

Well, if the miners support it, it will take at least a week, probably  two weeks  to reach 75% majority, and another 4 weeks before the trigger. 
As I don't think it's likely that any miners will mine the side with the least value, I would guess that the less valued side will be dysfunctional immediately after these four weeks ( as in confirmation time &gt; several hours ).
I would estimate that everybody actively using their node (eg businesses) will update within two days after that. Everyone not actively using their node (eg holders) will update whenever they need to use it.
Every bitcoind instances on the planet? Probably at least five years if you count the ones that aren't used. Not sure how that is relevant though.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:31:24
You don't marry a project. If Core provides their own download with 2MB support, I am sure many people will agree that it is better choice, (even though it would be actually the same code).
As Classic uses the same code as Core, there will be no problem upgrading to the next version of Core after the hardfork. This of course assuming that the Core developers will follow consensus, but they have been very vocal about the importance of doing so, which makes this a safe assumption.
Even if they don't, there are lots of great C++ developers with a thorough understanding of bitcoin. Although I think that the current Core maintainers are awesome, they are not the only people in the world that can maintain and improve the bitcoin software.
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:28:17
If  51% colludes, they don't need invalid blocks to do so.
They can simply take anything they want by simply making the payment, letting the honest minority confirm, and then undo the payment.
They don't do so because of this ruins their investment, not because of altruism.
Trusting a transaction *implies* trusting the mining majority.
@_date: 2017-04-30 11:40:09


I am very aware of ASICboost, but the goal of a structural, permanent blocksize solution is much older. In fact, discussions about this started not long after the limit was first introduced! 


There is no way a minority chain can survive as it cannot be secure. You cannot securely and irreversibly transact on a minority chain because of withholding/releasing attacks, which will ensure it is worthless. The idea of a minority chain being worth *more* is even more of a paradox as in that case, attackers would actually *gain mining income* from attacking it.
I am convinced that a structural solution to the blocksize is beneficial to everyone, so i don't see much merit in splitting the community. We'll just have to wait until the main Core members stand behind one of the existing proposals, or a new one, which I am sure they will in time.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:54:43
I don't think it is realistic to expect a solution to maintain consensus on max blocksize.
Many things have been tried. Most notable is consensus-by-calling-things-consensus. A bit more controversy is caused by the consensus-by-calling-things-altcoin.
Very popular is the consensus-by-not-providing-the-tools-for-changing-it-and-shaming-those-that-do. Or popular among the less articulate is consensus-by-calling-people-morons.
Fact is, there is only one known decentralised consensus mechanism which is based on the incentives of indivudual users and used by  bitcoin for its consensus rules. Unfortunately, this one clearly cannot work for max blocksize.
The sooner people realise this, the sooner we can integrate the local policy tools that users need to configure their node in their own best interest.
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:17:29
These issues are trivially addressed by limiting the transaction size (which BU does).
I understand why Core contributors are rejecting the blocksize increase but I disagree as I believe it stems from misunderstanding of Bitcoin's scaling and security model, most notably the fallacy that SPV requires fraud proofs to be secure.
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:52:09
The primary variation in a miners' revenue is the price of bitcoin, which they can optimize by doing what users want.
If 80% of the miners would be pushing for something that users *don't* want, then their incentive is clearly no longer financial gain; they are compromised and out for destruction, which they could easily achieve *without* invalid blocks.
There is no way bitcoin can survive 80% of the miners acting against it, as the security of transactions relies on them not doing that.

I am afraid I am not understanding you at all. Your terminology doesn't really match the LN paper or the Torrent spec.
A channel as referred to in the LN paper is the bi-directional payment channel between two nodes.
A node in the LN paper keeps these channels open for as long as possible and can act as an intermediate (hub) using two channels to different nodes.
Is this what you mean with "connections between channels"? 
In torrent, peers connect to peers. You can't connect to a file. 
What is the "location of a channel connection"?
How does a node "route the connection"? A (tcp/udp) connection is something between two nodes in both LN and Torrent.
Can you try to explain yourself better with the actual terminology used in the torrent-spec and LN paper?
@_date: 2017-04-16 08:18:33


It is not about whether we *can* trust them. We simply *have to*. The mining majority can trivially reduce bitcoin's value to zero with random withholding/releasing. This would make it impossible to trust a transaction.


These things are not particularly relevant because it is not in a miner's interest to change this; even an attacker can cause much  more mayhem or theft by valid blocks only.
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:26:44
Although I fully agree with you that complication can be hidden to the user and as such will not be a disadvantage, complications can still reduce use cases.
I am quite an active bitcoin user, so let us consider Average Bitcoin Joe instead. Joe found bitcoin via a poker site, got enthusiast and is now, a few times a year, happily transferring $100 from coinbase to his local wallet and from his local wallet to his poker site.
I am rather skeptical of Joe's use for *active channel micropayment technology*. Is Joe going to maintain and monitor (or have monitored) channels to multiple peers? Are the coins transferred over multiple hops (in Joe's case in uni-directional), each monitoring the $100 channels in hot wallets?
Even if LN is fully transparent, this seems like a mismatch of solution and Joe's requirements.
I would think that LN is beautiful for extending bitcoin's use case to micropayments, but I don't really see how it helps us to scale Joes, which seems to be a more pressing challenge.
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:25:27
Only marginally so.
When using bitcoin, you must trust that the mining majority does not act against it, because they can trivially take *anything* they want by simple withholding/releasing.
This is the same for SPV and for full nodes.
When using bitcoin, you do not need to trust any peers as you can verify the PoW and the inclusion of your transaction yourself.
This is the same for SPV and for full nodes.
When using bitcoin, you do not need to trust any indivudual miner as long as you wait for enough confirmations.
This is the same for SPV and for full nodes.
The security model for an SPV node and a full node is the same, except for some minor edge cases.
@_date: 2016-02-01 10:04:25
You make it sound like it is a choice.
The only way to limit that trust in miners, is to somehow force or convince everyone to run the same centrally planned codebase, so we can move some of our trust to a fixed group of developers.
Once you step away from this idea, and you realize that miners and users can choose whatever patches they like to run, you see that miner's incentive guarded by economic majority is actually the *only* thing we have to trust.
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:00:26
It is the same solution better explained [here]( under "Preventing SPV Mining", although that article argues SPV mining isn't a problem at all.

With that I can only agree. 
Though I doubt that killing or making overt ASICboost will change their stance with SegWit.
Their "stated" position and that of other miners has always been: We want a solution to the blocksize before we accept SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-25 08:20:16
You could also add "Permanent solution to the blocksize": "V V X"
@_date: 2017-04-30 08:46:16
I can't speak for others, but I don't really think it is about *blocking* SegWit, but more about priorities.
I like solving malleability and SegWit, but I can't imagine any engineer would even *think* about these low prio things without the structural solution to the blocksize which I believe *almost everybody* wants and has been wanting for 5 years.
As for now, some of the Core team *still* seem in pushing for the low prio SegWit stuff, even though a structural block size fix would give us SegWit and a reunited community in the progress.


That is absolutely impossible. I am not sure of anybody actually advocating that, but you can't solve scaling without solving the blocksize issue.
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:23:42
Not directly.
If 750 out of the last 1000 blocks that are mined are using this software, the change will be triggered and the hardfork will happen 4 weeks later.

Their block is also rejected by other miners. The idea that the *mining majority* would create and accept invalid blocks and the full nodes would happily ignore them and continue on the smaller valid chain seems rather naive.
The mining majority could trivially obliterate the smaller chain, or could destroy bitcoin without invalid blocks by simple withholding/releasing.
Bitcoin transactions are worthless if the mining majority acts against bitcoin.
There *is* no PoW security without reliance on the financial incentives of the mining majority, no matter how centralized they are.
@_date: 2016-02-10 15:59:59
It uses a 75% threshold. 
If some miners would like to join only with a 90% threshold, they can relatively easy use "offline" methods to check for it.

Is this problem solved by Gavin's [ValidationCostTracker](
If so, is this something worth considering for Core?
@_date: 2016-02-05 23:31:47
With a softfork, there is no mechanism for the economic majority to veto the change. Miners are expected to do as users want but if they don't there is a big difference between a softfork and a hardfork which causes the different percentages.
A softfork: Once the change is activated by miners, users will no longer be fully validating until they update. They have very little options but to upgrade (except that they could convince some miners to hardfork "away from the softfork" but this is not very realistic). In practice it is assumed that if X% of the miners agree, then so do the users. Hence X is set high.
A hardfork: If users would choose not to upgrade, then the value of the coin on the "new" chain will be worth less then the value of the "old" chain. Hence miners will be forced to follow the users. There is little reason to set X high except for keeping the process as smooth as possible. By setting X considerably more then 50, the risk of creating two chains in parallel is diminished. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:33:42
I find this a rather dubious claim. The only effect of not checking max blocksize is that you will follow the most worked chain even if these blocks are bigger.
From the perspective of the individual user this is a good idea because given the financial incentives of miners, the chance of a minority chain persisting and being more valuable then the most worked chain if they only differ in block size, seems to a about as big as Walmart changing all their prices to zero. Miners aren't just going to leave millions on the table like that.
That is why the network is not maintining consensus over max blocksize as it does with other block validation rules.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:24:20


I am not firing anyone and I am not rejecting any plan or work. I am simply running a patch over which there is considerable technical disagreement. This is the freedom that users and miners have and this freedom is essential for an Open Source decentralized system.
If it is to gain majority, then not going along with it seems to reach some level of stubbornness that I cannot imagine many developers will pursue. Those who do quit, are doing so from their own - rather childish - choice.
@_date: 2016-02-05 19:09:14
Really? Though I find most arguments against doing a hardfork now rather peculiar, this one must be the oddest.

I don't really understand this. Don't most Core developers agree there will have to be a hardfork blocklimit increase at some point? Aren't the main argument against BIP109 that it is too soon and dangerous?
If Classic succeeds and the "upgrade" goes smoothly, what arguments are there left not to join them except for stubbornness?
Why would you want to create a separate coin?
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:12:36
This doesn't really apply to this case.
The wallet can estimate the needed fee for inclusion in the next block based on the last several blocks. In this case it either didn't make such calculation or it did so wrongly.
With RBF after you post a transaction and it is not included in a block, it could recalculate the needed fee using one more block to make its estimation and replace the transaction. 
This would still be an estimation and the cases where this would actually change the fee are very limited.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:04:01
You are making a strange comparison. Why do they have more power or control now then with SegWit?
This way of thinking doesn't work in a decentralized network. Everybody should work for themselves. 
Some miners believe it is in their interest to increase the blocksize , as this may increase bitcoin's usage and value.
It is in some non-miners interest to configure their node to ensure they do not reject the most worked chain if it only differs on size.
It is in developer's interest to offer these features to gain market share.
Even if the fixed limit *would* be somehow important to bitcoin (which I and many others disagree with), there is no decentralized way of keeping it.
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:13:48


It doesn't. Developers can offer features to users. Users don't have to invent them.
It only assumes that users can and will always choose the software and features they believe is in their best interest.


Please stay polite.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:42:44
The fee in this case was not correctly estimated by the wallet software. If the wallet is not programmed to estimate the fee correctly it will also not magically find the right fee with RBF. 
To make a case for RBF you need an example where:
- Required fee X is calculated based on previous blocks.
- TX is send with fee X
- TX is not included in block (because mempool is more busy then usual)
- New fee is calculated to be Y. TX is RBF'd with new fee Y.
- TX is included in next block with fee Y, but wouldn't have been with fee X.
That is the  case where RBF applies.

This is actually very easy. The measurement is the exchange rate.
Let's start with the hypothetical situation that there is a hardfork with a minor technical difference. The side of the fork worth most is the side that users want and is expected to have the highest utility. No need to calculate percentages.
In reality this intra-bitcoin-trade isn't even needed. 
Miners are the group involved whose profit primarily depends on the exchange rate. In the example above, they will all mine the most valuable side. Hence they are given the power to determine and enforce the rules. They will make their decisions to maximize the utility of bitcoin for the users.
The question remains, how do miners know what users want before a hardfork? This seems to be your question of percentages, and the nature of some long posts and discussions about politics and democracy.
I don't think it is too relevant as I trust that the market forces of a multi-million dollar industry will lead to the right decisions (this trust is essentially the trust in the bitcoin protocol). What I have seen so far confirms this: They seem to be making conservative and reasonable decisions based on the opinion of users and experts.
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:48:08


I don't think this is a problem of SegWit but more of a design choice to bootstrap it, by motivating wallets to use it.
I think it is trivial to incorporate SegWit data-size in priority/fee calculation later.

The fact that new Electrum doesn't create *new* seeds with manual input shouldn't matter at all for existing seeds.

An attacker does not need to change consensus rules.
If I control 51%, I can take *anything* available for bitcoin by making the payment, let the honest minority mine the payment and confirmations, meanwhile mine a counterpayment with confirmations, and then release to undo the payment.
If I only want to destruct bitcoin's value, I can simply start undoing the last N days of payments this way. Repeat indefinitely or randomly to make bitcoin completely worthless.
Neither cost me any mining income and no full node helps. 
Neither the most lucrative nor the most destructive attacks involve the creation of invalid blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-16 08:14:09
After how many confirmation do you consider your coins yours?
Because if an attacker controls 51% they could undo it after as many confirmations they want without even reducing their mining income.

The size of the blocks is determined by the block size local policy.
The max_block_size validation rule only determines when to reject blocks. Currently people are using different values for this on the network. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:54:39


Then why not do *only* that with BIP 140? I would think that it much easier to find consensus for it.
More generally, trying to fix multiple things at once is - as it turns out - tricky in a consensus network. The more you try to fix, the harder it is to find consensus.
This is also why  I don't understand the current discussion of a hardfork on the dev list. People seem to want to include as many fixes as possible. It seems much safer to do a hardfork with as little change as possible. Two hardforks (if really needed) are only marginally more risky then one, but a hardfork fixing two things is much more risky then a hardfork fixing one thing.
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:18:13
BIP 140 does exactly one thing: Fix malleability in a simple softfork. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 10:03:28


If 99% of miners moved, then until the next difficulty adjustment (~100 weeks), the 1% remaining miners will find 100x as few blocks. 
As I don't think they are going to voluntarily reduce their income by a factor 100, we can safely assume their would be no hardfork as their would be no blocks mined on the small side. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 14:27:21
They cannot take your coins burried deep in the chain.

I think this long story is a bit to short here. Maybe someone can elaborate what he means, because I would think that the requiring bandwidth equal to the transaction volume means that the bandwidth scales in O(n) with the transaction volume.
I understand that this is a simplification and not the whole story, but I am not sure why he concludes O(n^2 ) scaling. 
Or is he suggesting the number of transactions scales in O(n^2 ) to the number of users?
@_date: 2017-04-24 05:34:54
I think a true fee based market  system should be based on how much fee users are willing to pay *less* for bigger blocks. 
You could do this with transaction pairs (high fee &amp; low fee). A miner can create a double block if it can be filled with low fee transactions and the fee is more then 90% of the high-fee equivalent.
This reduces the incentive of transaction stuffing by miners, as they would need to kick out fee paying transactions.
You could then double the block size after enough consecutive double blocks. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 00:11:38
It is not only not useful for miners, but for most usecases. It makes no sense for:
* wallets
* any service that want to provide feedback to the user for transactions
* explorers/analysers/apis
* nodes that are just up to help the network relaying
It is nice but I don't think it is going to help too many nodes.

Reasonable up until 5. 
Users are very vocal about principles but very eager to drop these principles when money is at stake.
If 75% of the mining power has switched, and multiple exchanges have vouched support, it will also become clear that that side of the chain will become the most valuable.
I doubt much users will be talking principles at that point.

I am not convinced this is "holding the network hostage. " 
I can still pay for my coffee which doesn't require confirmations.
High value transactions still come through due to prioritisation by fee.
Does such "attack" achieve anything more then getting miners/nodes to hastily adjust their parameters?
@_date: 2017-04-16 14:25:08


Of course they can. And that is a big risk, but it isn't solved by  running full nodes because an attack doesn't need to involve invalid blocks. 


It is not a matter of brushing the issue. The security of the network hinges on the economic incentives of miners. This is how bitcoin is designed, and there is currently no viable decentralized alternative to PoW security.
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:34:31
Yes. There are essentially two ways to do this.
The fork itself could offer what is called *replay protection*; essentially this means making the transaction incompatible. The wallet could use this to spent coins on either side separately.
However, this seems unlikely to be implemented as it would give one side of the fork a disadvantage over the other.
An alternative is *dust mixing*. If a wallet constructs a transaction, it can  include some minor amount that is only valid on one chain because it originates from newly minted coins of one chain. 
This would work, but does require some minted "dust", so a wallet could then only make a "dual" transaction if these are not available. It might be available from a 3rd party though, especially since it doesn't need to be actually spent; just included in the transaction.

Although emergent consensus is a terrible term, I think AD/EB configuration are useful tools for users to configure their node and should definitely be merged to Core.
There is really nothing experimental about letting users configure the working of their own node.

It is not related, but I would suggest not to throw in the word "consensus" everywhere.
Consensus means everyone agrees which doesn't happen. You can't have a "community consensus". The word simply doesn't apply.
The word "consensus" was used in the bitcoin paper specifically because miners are "forced" to follow the the same rules. Hence you could say there is a "consensus" mechanism.
Outside this mechanism, there cannot be such thing as "consensus" with such a large group of stakeholders.

I am not against RBF but it is not very reasonable to suggest it as answer to OPs problem.
The transaction did not came through because the wallet did not calculate the right fee.
You suggest that if the wallet would allow RBF it would solve the problem. Sure, but if the wallet would simply fix its fee calculation it would *also* solve the problem.
I don't think it makes sense for a wallet to implement automated RBF if it isn't even properly calculating the fees in the first place.

Your calculation is off.
Before blocks were full and the limit took effect, blocks grew almost linear with about 250 tx/day. If it wouldn't have been limited, we could expect 2mb blocks in ~3 years. 8GB blocks would take about 24,000 years.
Now of course we would hope growth would be faster, but 8GB in 10 to 15 years is not realistic. 
The main ledger *does* scale. Before blocks were full, people *were* buying coffee with it, and we could have simply continued this growth path.
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:10:52
Many people consider a structural solution to the block size (A) to be much more important and urgent then a malleability fix (B).
If a developers team offers software with B, these users choose not to run the software because they are unsure if A will ever be provided. Hence they switch to software that does provide A even if this reduces the quality of the software they use.
This is rational selfish behavior. The only party that is not behaving in selfish rational way is the Core team, who seem to be very reluctant to provide what users are asking for and regaining market share. They only keep accusing potential users who don't choose to run their software for above reasons of "blocking B".

Sorry but no. No matter how much you believe in micropayments as the future, do you  seriously believe that bitcoin can scale without changing max blocks size/weight?


EC is a bad term. Some people want to accept larger blocks. Miners want to create bigger blocks. AB/ED just provides the tools to do so. 
Because people are not rewarded for keeping it in place, it is not possible to maintain consensus on the max blocksize.

I don't really see how your ideas rhyme with a decentralised network.
If miners would want to postpone the halving (which would be very stupid), how are you preventing them from applying such a simple patch?
You cannot design the network as a whole, as everybody will and should work in their own interest.
Developers can only offer software. If miners want X then devs can either provide X, offer Y which miners also like, or lose market share among miners. It's not a complicated market.
Developers serve users and users serve the network. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 12:24:47

I am afraid you are misinformed. The only difference in having port 8333 open is whether you accept new connections.
All connected peers are treated the same whether incoming or outgoing.
This also means that the only disadvantages of not opening port 8333 is that you don't help people finding new connections and you use only a limited number of connections.
You can verify this by following net.cpp:RelayTransaction(), or check [the wiki](
I should also clarify, that although you are relaying if you don't have incoming connections, this is arguably not very useful. 
Two nodes that only do outgoing connections can never connect to each other. This means that if you were to draw a full graph, these nodes will be on the "edges" and probably rarely create routes that wouldn't exist without them.

I don't really think that that is likely. The thing is, I don't use Tor. 
If I want to use LN, then by design of LN, the fastest and cheapest way will be to use a wallet that simply routes all payments through a channel with OneBigHubCorp.
Any other form of routing will be more decentralized and anonymous, but less efficient and not necessary if I don't care about these things.
Hence I predict, the masses will all route through OneBigHubCorp.

Working in the interest of users doesn't mean starting to code for every fart a user makes. But if there is such a clear request by a large portion of the miners and other users, I don't think ignoring it makes sense.

The bi-directional payment channel itself seems a quite workable and secure solution.

I understand there can be consequences. From my perspective, the alleged consequences, threatening to quit or to change the PoW, are much more severe then the change itself. 
A hardfork is actually on the Core's roadmap so if they were actually to follow the users demands instead of alienating them, we wouldn't need another client.
These threats try to contain the freedom of choice of users and miners and thereby severely damage the consensus system as it is designed.
The sooner we break through that, the better.

Actually, relaying and mining RBF transactions is opt-out. With an options these txs will be dropped instead of replacing, just like before.
Actually creating RBF capable transactions is opt-in. By default txs are not replaceable. However, creating these txs is not yet implemented in the wallet anyway.

It will *not* be cheaper for existing dust, because the output being spent is not a SegWit P2SH output.
SegWit requires one "iteration": Spent an existing output to a SegWit output (=non-segwit transaction). *Then* spent the SegWit P2SH output using a SegWit transaction.

If, in 2084 we are using 1MB blocks and the price has remained constant for 60 years, that is true. 
If you make odd assumptions you get odd results.
On the other hand if in 2084, in the bitcoin's value would be $12.43, with a max blocksize of 247kb, and the price of electricity would be $121.14/kWh, the outcome would be different.

I am afraid I have to disagree. 
There is already an excellent alert system in the protocol. If the change is a small unambiguous improvement, then everyone that actively uses the software can be expected to update their software within days. Why would this be dangerous?
This is why the idea of using the hard fork to apply many changes at once isn't very good engineering.
There is a very small risk in a small iterative breaking change, but doing it twice isn't particularly more dangerous. It would be much better to set the precedent to do it semi-regularly in small iterative steps.
Making many changes at once is MUCH more dangerous as it both increases the risk of bugs and the risk that some people might not want to update.
To add to this, the idea of calling a small breaking change in the protocol a "hard fork" is misleading. If the change is an unambiguous improvement, it seems extremely unlikely that enough miner pools are going to completely ignore the update for the grace period (even if that's just a week) to actually mine a block. This means an actual hard fork is very unlikely to occur.
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:56:31

My point is that running a full node instead of an SPV doesn't  significantly reduce the reliance on miners.
The security model of an SPV node and a full node both assume no attacker controls 51% because the most effective attacks do not involve invalid blocks.

@_date: 2017-04-03 13:17:27
The empty blocks would be the most trivial but there are also trivial attacks by 51% that you cannot defended against, simply because transactions are secured by PoW .
For instance, *anything* that is available for bitcoin can be taken by an attacker by simply paying, withholding blocks, and after enough confirmations undoing the payment by releasing. 
Even more damaging would be an attacker that would simply  undo transactions at random over the last few days by withholding/releasing. This can be repeated again and again; not even mining income is lost for the attacker.
As the most lucrative and the most destructive attacks do not involve "invalid" blocks at all, full nodes offer no protection against this. 
Bitcoin's security falls apart if an attacker controls 51%, and therefore a minority chain can not securely exist with the same PoW.
Or as the paper reads:


cooperating group of attacker nodes.

I think a SF to disable covert ASICBoost makes sense, but I fail to see what such SF, ASICBoost or SegWit have to do with the problem at hand, which is the fixed  blocksize/blockweight limit.


In a consensus system it is important to stay flexible. As everybody agrees we will need a structural blocksize solution at some point, and as SegWit is not supported by enough hashpower without a permanent blocksize solution first, maybe we should focus on that instead.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:42:53


Sure, but by ordering transactions they actually become secure.
By simple withholding and releaseing, miners can take anything they want for free, or undo all transactions of the last days over and over again. This doesn't even cost mining income and full nodes offer no protection.
If you can't trust "order" you can't trust transactions at all, and bitcoin is worthless.

I think you are looking at EB/AD from the wrong way possibly mislead by the terrible term "emergent consensus".
The max_block_size was a rather crude way to prevent spam blocks. If we *remove* the max_block_size as a consensus parameter, we need some alternative to prevent spam blocks.
The user requirements for such a solution are:
* Nodes should block be able to reject huge spam blocks unless buried in the chain.
* Nodes should be able to signal their preference on what they consider too big blocks
* Miners should be able conservatively  increase their block_size local policy, observing nodes preference. 
* Miners should be able to - as good as possible - synchronize their settings for rejection of huge spam blocks.
EB/AD seems to be a reasonable solution to these requirements, as it makes the inclusion of a huge block infeasible.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:18:49


Core can *still use the same default*. Why do you just ignore that? It should be up to users, just like *everything* should be up to users. This is supposed to be a decentralized network


I don't think SegWit and BU are antithetical at all. They are solving completely unrelated problems. SegWit fixes malleability and some other issues, and BU provides users with more control over their node with regards to blocksize.
But the reasoning I make here doesn't even depend on EB/AD being a good idea. 
Fact is that people are asking for it. I am just hoping that Core either fulfills their request or provides an alternative they like more, because otherwise the chance of SegWit reaching the threshold seems very small to me.

Classical "DDoS", yes.
But if your node has only one or two connections, it is very cheap and easy to lock out your money. 
1. Create a node and initiate a new channel to target, self funded. 
2. Move funds through the target to another well connected node I own
3. Stop answering on the new channel.
This will require the target to forcefully close and wait to access its money. 
As this cost an attacker nothing, it can easily do this to hundreds of small nodes.
Larger nodes are more resilient to this.
Note that "not answering" can be worsened by only: 
* Not responding to close channel
* Not forwarding htlcs

The 21M coin limit is in place, because no one is interested in running software which changes it. Their blocks would be rejected, and if miners would collaborate to create the longest chain that way, their coins would be worthless.


That is indeed the nature of a protocol which punishes making changes. 
This doesn't mean that the 21M coin limit or anything else is prescribed by authority of the maintainers of a software project. 
It seems you do not seem to understand the nature of this invention: The first decentralized P2P cash system that does *not* rely on the authority you are describing.

Core seems to be confused about their role in the ecosystem as provider of software for users as they seem to be reluctant to fight for their market share. If they would see this we wouldn't be in this mess.
If 38% from the miners and quite some users - not all stupid - are asking for EB/AD, why not provide it or offer an alternative they like even better? Don't they want these people to  use their software? Just reiterating what they *should* like is not fruitful.
I would think that any serious development team would work *nightshifts* to fulfill the requirements of such important potential customers, and attempt to gain them back.
I fail to see how we can get new features like SegWit if Core doesn't start to think for its users and by extension its market share instead of trying to design the network themselves.
Developers serve users, users serve the network. Core is leaving out the user part of that equation.

That is the *opposite* of a decentralized system. In a decentralized network, any software can use whatever rules they want. Otherwise you would need an authority and it wouldn't be decentralized.

This is incorrect. 
A listening node accepts incoming connections. The *only* difference between an incoming connection and an outgoing connection is the way the connection is established. Once established, there is no technical difference.
*Statistically* there is an important difference. New nodes aren't yet known so they will only establish outgoing connections. This means that a node will serve much more Initial Block Download, historical blocks, to incoming connections than it does to outgoing connections.
With regards to node count; it makes more sense to only count listening connections simply because you can never get a reliable number for non-listening connections.

This isn't millions. And worldwide, people don't have the money to average to 10 transactions per day. More like 2.
Also, this conveniently leaves out the concept of *growth*. So the question becomes:
* Over what timeframe do you see Bitcoin replacing *every* transaction in the world? 
* Over what timeframe do you think 200,000tx/sec * 250B/tx = 50MB/sec is cheap?
Personally I would estimate the latter to occur earlier in time than the first.
Before blocks were full, they were growing almost linear at a rate of about 200kb/block/year. The problem we need to solve is adoption so growth can accelerate. Not what would happen if we'd grow 50,000 fold overnight.

Sorry. It really isn't clear to me. Even today these numbers are doable with a few $1000s in hardware. By the time we will reach this size, this will probably be standard hardware.
And even if we grow so fast, that it does cost some hardware investment to verify all the world's transactions, why is that a problem? Isn't it obvious that it costs hardware to do that? Certainly you don't expect end-users to run full nodes? That is not needed; that is why we have a merkle tree with which they can verify their own transactions.


So you are saying that even if grow 1000x the current size, there will be *less* full nodes because it requires some hardware? That doesn't make any sense. I think every financial business in the world would run a few of these nodes.

In that same document he describes why you can't measure support by node count.
Bitcoin is a free market. Miners can use whatever rules they want for the coins they mint. The only power users have is whether they want to buy these coins or not.
Miners are akin to say car manufacturers. Customers don't get to vote or decide on BMW's manufacturing. They just have the power to buy or not to buy.
In this case,  they believe a 2x change will increase the value of their coins. Not a strange assessment, given that even in this sub the primary argument against is that it's "rushed" and "dangerous" both of which no longer hold after the update.
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:31:43
It's reasonable to reject very low fee transactions to prevent flooding. This is why miners were using minimum fees long before blocks were full.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:47:28
The size of the transactions is bigger because of both transaction batching and transactions reconciliating many small outputs made possible by low fees.
A good measure of "actual" transactions is tricky but I think you would need to find per block
    [number of outputs] - (k * [number of transactions])

The problem with this argument is that "multi-gigabyte" blocks are not particularly relevant.
Before blocks were full, bitcoin was growing almost linear at a rate of about [250 transactions per day]( Simple extrapolation suggests it would take 1000s of years to reach multi-gigabyte blocks, and even in the most crazy optimistic exponential growth scenario decades. Reality is somewhere in between.
With a growth of 250/day the problem we should be solving is "how to get more people to transact bitcoin" instead of "how censor-resistant are multi-gigabyte blocks".
For a usable currency to limit usage and introducing an *auction* for transactions with all the uncertainty and fee fluctuations at this stage (&lt; 100tx/s) is bonkers.

Bitcoin currently (since mid-2016) uses a full block model where transactions are selected by an auction. A model advocated since the early days by Gregory Maxwell.
This makes it really cheap to attack and drive up the fees.
As seen in this thread, the general reaction is to guess and scold the attacker which unfortunately won't solve the problems inherent to this model.

Ok. Without averages. There are ~4000 blocks between 475k and 500k and ~2000 blocks between 500k and 525k. How does this translate to blocks "near instantly" filling up? How come these 2000 blocks (or the 2000 between 525k and 550k) aren't 750k?
Of course the default values for soft limits has let to some miners being slow to adapt but as this has always been only *some* miners *this has never let to an effective limiting of transacation rate*. There was no "transaction auction" before blocks were full. You *always* knew a transaction with $0.005 fee went through. It was a usable currency yet blocks didn't just fill up. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:27:45
Blockspace is a scarce resource with *very* inelastic demand. Would you change your frequency of bank payments, if your bank changes their fees?
With unlimited (or a very large) block space, most miners still set a minimum fee to prevent flooding.
Effectively this ties demand (and blocksize growth) to user adoption. People are not going to pay more bills or buy more coffee because fees are $0.001 instead of $0.005.

Ok. Let's say Bitcoin is not used for spending, and $ is. 
Now the only wealth I have is in terms of spendable money, USD. My Bitcoin only has value for being convertable to USD.
But I can't gain USD by exchanging USD=&gt;BTC, and later BTC=&gt;USD. At least not on average. The only way for me to increase my USDs that way is if someone else *decreases* his USDs this way. It purely becomes a game of selling to the greater fool.

Right. Personally I am not investor and I don't care about the price as much as I do about [usage](

@_date: 2017-09-05 15:06:57
I don't understand the problem. Just look at [this graph](
Until mid 2016, though there was a  block limit, it didn't effectively limit the size of blocks. Instead, the size of blocks grew with increasing demand.
If we wouldn't limit the block size (as we effectively didn't until mid 2016), we can expect this upwards trend to continue with adoption. Instead we are now *limiting the amount of Bitcoin transactions people can make!* 
Just take step back, to see how terribly silly that is.

Gaming a fee based dynamic size is easily fixed by requiring leaving 50% of the fees to the next miner in an anyone can spend output.
That said, miners have no interest in "gaming" the blocksize. A max blocksize ~100x the median of the last 100 blocks would already prevent creating a node crashing block and would yield slow growth with demand as it did for the first 7 years.
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:14:11
This is also prunable as it is spendable and miners can simply swoop it up.
I think the advantage is that people can create without advance transaction creation.

@_date: 2017-10-30 15:57:43
The original code can be found [here](
It doesn't contain RBF functionality. It [does seem to hint]( at using a miner's chosen minimum fee as flood control instead of limiting the block size and the transaction auction model.
It does contain a replacement mechanism based on nSequence found [here]( which was later removed.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:43:28
I disagree with the notion that you can't have unlimited blockspace.
In fact I think the notion of limiting block space to anywhere except *far* above demand for transactions is *bonkers*. How is it reasonable for *any* payment system to limit transactions? Even for  just a "settlement layer" it's ridiculous. The more the better! 
Where is the  the evidence that blocks would just "fill up" despite the fact that it didn't happen until slow growth brought us to 1mb and despite the fact it doesn't happen on any other coin or fiat payment system? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:32:00

Unlimited blockspace doesn't mean unlimited blocks. 
It simply means we allow as much transactions as there is demand for, with small fees set by miners. 
Just like about every other payment system that exists on our planet. How does it make sense  to have a currency with limited transactions?
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:36:38
To add to that, personally I think the "full block fee market" model is economically unreasonable.
The concept of having to bid in an *auction* for transaction space in order to get your transaction through is frankly rather *bonkers* for a currency. Being able to *reliably* transact seems quite an important requirement.

Block size would still grow with Bitcoin's user adoption: slowly and steady. Much slower than technological growth.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:31:56
It doesn't work like that. For anyone who supports updating the block size limit, obviously opt-out replay protection is a terrible choice as it would invalidate everyone's existing time locked transactions. This is clearly a worse user experience than without opt-out replay protection.
This has nothing to do with ramming something down anyone's throat. This is a decentralized network: everyone is free to run whatever they want. You *cannot* be forced by anyone.

This is exactly how miners now work. They have thousands of "nodes" that are just mining chips and a single (or a few) "nodes" that are connected to the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:18:51
This is a good thing and a fee market as it used to, and should work.
Miners choose a minimum fee. If you want your transaction to confirm the next block you use the fee of the most expensive miner. If you don't care about delays, you use the fee of the cheapest miner.
Such a market prevents flooding without the need for blocks being full, and without unpredictable swings in fees and reliability of transactions which will always persist in the full block model.

The terms LAN/WAN is completely unrelated to the protocol suite being used. He described a LAN. It *is* a LAN. And you are trying to say that he was wrong because you somehow believe he *meant* some very specific protocol suite?
What do you mean "hardware level"? ASICs have a network interface just like non-specialized computers.


He described specialized hardware being used for mining and these being connected over a LAN to a single WAN node.
This is *exactly* correct.

The never-full-block model doesn't imply allowing gigablocks. It simpy means ensuring that the maximum block size is always much bigger than demand, as it was before 2016, and as it is with Bitcoin Cash, (or a 100mb limit for that matter).
It also doesn't mean no fees or no prioritization. It just means that if an attacker wants to force others to use high fees (&gt; X) than you have to fill blocks with transactions that pay fee X.
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:50:54


This is absolutely incorrect. 
SPV wallets verify the proof-of-work, and follow the chain with the highest proof-of-work.


Sorry but that makes no sense. The fact that a rule change is forward compatible doesn't mean it's not a rule change. It just means the update is somewhat easier. For instance reducing the block size limit to 1mb changed the consensus rules just like increasing the block size limit would.

Thanks trilli0nn! Let reddit be our witness, and good luck.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:02:01
This is simply incorrect. The soft limit is the size the miner choses for its blocks. It has never limited transaction throughput. Blocks have grown gradually with increasing demand.
Just look at [this]( and tell me when blocks were "near instantly full". 
Not only does this idea lack an understanding of economics, in particularly the concept of elasticity of demand, there is *zero* evidence that blocks just fill up, either in any altcoin as well in Bitcoin before mid-2016.

Opt-out replay protection means that any transaction that is valid on the legacy chain is not valid on the new chain.
Thus if I now own a transaction that I can only publish in January, I won't be able to publish it.
Frankly, opt-out replay protection would be a terrible choice for a simple fix like updating the blocksize limit.

If I have a transaction that is only valid from after a certain height, than the transaction is still made after the fork.
There is an easy solution though: Make replay protection opt-in, which is exactly what btc1 is doing.
Somehow many people in this are still interpreting a small and safe increase with opt-in replay protection as some kind of corporate attack.

I don't really understand how orphaning solve this.
If there is no limit at all for accepting blocks in the code used by the miners, one rogue miner that can create a 1TB block, and other miners will automatically incorporate this block into the blockchain.
Orphaning by propagation time makes this block less likely to succeed then a small block, but definitely not impossible as some blocks take more then an hour to be found.
Maybe the miners don't want to accept the 1TB block by means of their economic incentives but this is computer code; they cannot really say on hindsight "let's orphan that block manually".
Hence at least some blocksize limit is necessary albeit I do believe that it can be very large (e.g. BIP101) as the only dangers are very exceptional situations, and having one or two big blocks isn't a problem.
@_date: 2015-09-27 09:26:47
I agree that this is a problem, but I think it's a different problem altogether. Of course bitcoin and/or bitcoin wallets should support recurring payments with nice overviews and start/stop/pause options.

In my opinion, increasing the base block size is long overdue, and the agreement is what is making both SegWit and the increase possible.
1. Core 0.15 added code to explicitly ban btc1 nodes *even while they are still fully complient*. This makes the option not to signal btc1 a trivial improvement for the users of the software.
2. Increasing the blocksize with opt-out replay protection would be really silly. This would destroy any existing time locked transactions  and require every wallet to update. There is no advantage, unless you prefer two coins.
I don't see how someone can support increasing the blocksize but while adding replay protection as this effectively destroys a lot of money.
@_date: 2015-11-10 09:56:59

I am curious though. If the world knows who is "in charge" for the current block, wouldn't it be tempting to directly send transactions to it? This might result in an unfair race and reduce security.

We want to give power to miners because miners are the entities whose financial incentives are most directly aligned with bitcoin.
This is for me the essence of bitcoin and why the highest PoW is always right.
Not trusting miners is not trusting bitcoin and there is no purpose of running a full node apart from added privacy or needing all blockchain information.
As a user, why would I choose not to follow the mining majority and just stop accepting blocks? Does that help me?

I believe that information is rather tainted by the fact that developers and experts that do not agree with that, are unlikely to become Core contributers. The Core contributers are loosely united by this common vision, and as such I don't think you can extrapolate "the vast majority of Core" to "the vast majority in the space".

Of course. You can do a hardfork with 1% of the hashpower.
You cannot do a softfork without an overwhelming majority because the non joining miners and nodes won't be validating.
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:42:17
Yes, a hardfork creates new coins, but that doesn't necessarily mean a new name.
You can not just claim 100% consensus is needed to use the old name, because people can choose whatever name they like.
If 30% wants to fork and calls their coin bitcoin, that's up to them.
The problem with your habitable land analogy is that it applies to softforks equally as to hardforks. For instance, the introduction of the 1mb was a softfork. This is just as much a change of rules as it's removal. The fact that softforks might be easier to push through does not mean it's not a change of rules forced by the majority.
Either we never change anything, or we must find a way in which we can come to agreement on how rules are determined in a decentralized matter. 
Luckily this is exactly the problem that was solved in the original paper.

This is very true. Miners follow the market.
This is why it's so important how the market reacts when miners make moves (ViaBTC) or use words like "unlimited" or "big block" in a conference. 
So far there seems to be little indication that the market will choose the small block side.
@_date: 2016-10-15 22:53:59


This isn't possible with SPV but also not necessary for most use cases.
The general idea is that a tx that moves money to an address of which I have the private key is buried in the chain.
This is enough for most use cases (aka end users) and exactly what SPV can prove.


This seems to be a misunderstanding of the merkle-tree. SPV clients *do* verify that a tx is included in a block, its validity, and the PoW of the block.

I don't think that is what undervalued means. A product is undervalued if its price is lower then its value.
For something like bitcoin, the value is solely determined by its exchange rate as its only value is in exchanging it for goods or other currencies.
Price discovery by market participants can shift the value, but the concepts of undervalued and overvalued simply do not apply.

That is nonsense. All softforks in the past were done with the support of miners.
In *very* early softforks, miner support was simply implied by releasing a new version.
In later softforks such as P2SH, miner support was manually measured.
Nowadays, we have BIP9 to automate that, and make softforks safe.

That is incorrect unless UASF has a majority hashing power.
 Non-UASF SegWit  miners will not reject and therefore follow the longest chain.
There will be one chain with UASF miners (currently 0%) and one chain with SegWit and non-SegWit non-UASF miners (currently 100%)

You cannot just use a backward compatible change because if this rule is not enforced by the mining majority, your coins are not secured.


How do you do this in a decentralized way? That is, without some off-chain poll and html tables collecting quotes? 
You do so by following those that generate and must sell newly minted coins to users. The rules they use for these coins, will always be the ones users appreciate. They cannot make wrong rules as they would not be able to sell their coins. Their coins would be rejected.


There can not be an "established set of rules" in a decentralized network as everyone is free to use the rules they want.
The clever part of bitcoin is that the rules chosen by those that generate coins, (aka the rules that follow the economy's wishes) are *also* the rules that are used to govern the most-worked chain.


Miners *can* change everything as *everybody* can choose the rules they want. They don't do so because coins generated with a bad ruleset would be worthless as their blocks would be rejected. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:49:00
Also, I believe that by using a different Service flag, partitioning is prevented because the BIP141 nodes will simply consider the SEGWIT2X nodes as non-segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:41:02
That is not how SPV works. An SPV node *verifies* that a transaction is in the block using the Merkle tree. And it *verifies* the PoW using the headers.
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:01:09
So let us say 95% of the economy wants X. What decentralized mechanism to you propose to determine this and trigger X?
That is *exactly* the problem Bitcoin solves with miners. Those that generate coins depend directly on the value that users give to those coins, and the rules *they* use are also the ones that govern the longest chain. That is not a coincidence.
Sure users can stick with the old rules and reject this, which is why miners won't do so unless they are convinced users value the change. If they didn't and users would stick to the minority chain not only miners lose their money, but users can no longer securely transact as they would be using a minority chain.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:07:48


I surely hope so. 


This really depends on who you ask. Although I like SegWit, as a developer, I don't see near-universal support among my co-developers, miners or businesses alike. In fact, I see much more support for a structural solution to the max_block_size problem. Apart from Luke and Greg, I am not sure who actually *opposes* solving this. In fact, the only argument for people seems to be "sticking with Greg's roadmap" which is clearly not working.

What you are missing is SPV. 
The notion that everybody needs to download and verify all the world's transactions for "decentralization" is  frankly a rather ridiculous concept.  This would not make a scalable cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is designed such that everyone can verify *their own transactions* through the merkle tree and the proof-of-work through the headers without having to download the entire blocks.
SPV scaling and security works (even without alerts), has never and will never be defrauded.

Does Joe need *active channel micropayment* technology? With monitored connections to multiple peers and all these peers having these $100s in hot wallets? It is an obvious mismatch between problem and solution. 
Sure LN can *extend the usecase* of bitcoin, but it's not going to *extend the user base* of bitcoin which is far more urgent problem, only held back because of the "full nodes = decentralization" fallacy.

@_date: 2016-10-10 20:42:30
I would say it is the other way around.
The thresholds serve a totally different purpose. With a hardfork, every participant can choose sides; the threshold only serves miners to "test the waters" before splitting. Miners are always free to split of at a lower threshold.
With a softfork, the threshold is needed to keep the network safe, because after activation, non participating nodes won't be validating. There is no choice for non-mining nodes. Everyone who wants to validate must join.

You are not wrong at all.
They will only need to temporarily redirect all their hashing power to reorg the ledger, and undo payments. They just mine and withhold the blocks, and then release in a bunch. They can essentially take everything for sale for bitcoin for free, regardless of confirmation.

This is not the only misconception. 
A more general criticism of UASF is that it seems to ignore the question of support altogether. 
The way bitcoin solved counting support is by counting minted coins, because those that mint coins need to sell these for a maximum. Using the dual role of minting and securing, we can simply count hash rate as quantifying support.
With this measure, SegWit is utterly lacking. Should we then fall back to reddit and twitter to measure support instead? Or should we acknowledge that SegWit simply isn't good enough to gain consensus and maybe consider alternatives such as BIP140?
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:47:20

This doesn't work. The transaction you create will be equally valid on the other chain.
As there is no replay protection, the only way to split coins is to mix transaction with some dust that is only valid on one chain, the best candidate being newly minted coins.
This minted dust doesn't need to be spent; it can be returned to the owner in the same transaction, so we could expect some services (or exchanges) to  provide help in creating such transactions.
That said, this all depends on BIP148 being mined which currently  isn't happening at all and as BitFury has backed out in favor of the agreement, seems unlikely to happen.
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:45:11


This is absolutely true. 
This is why miners will never mint their coins with ruleset X if users don't want it as they won't be able to sell their coins.
This is also why hashpower is the best quantification of economic support and the only suitable decentralized way to trigger changes.
Users are in charge *via* miner's incentives.

Much more effective is withholding/releasing. They would make and publish any payment; start mining and withholding blocks with a counter payment. Then after N confirmations, release the chain to undo the payment.
With a minority mining power, everything for sale for bitcoin is up for grabs. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:06:44
This is an often abused terminology.
BIP109 is a change in the consensus rules. For this to result in an actual hard fork you will need a large amount of hash power, enough to mine a block, to continue mining on the old rules.
If no considerable amount of mining power is left mining with the old rules, there will be no fork in the chain. This also means no money on one side of the chain, and no split of coins.
The term hardfork therefore only applies if enough miners are staying with the old rules to mine a block.

The fact that Craig didn't release public proof at the same time or within 24 hours is odd, but there can be many reasons for this to which we can only guess.
It makes sense to give it some time before drawing any conclusions.
Even though only guessing, some explanations with IMHO decreasing order of likelyness
1. The generic verify-tutorial is a puzzle that points to the proof in the early blockchain. Many things in the post scream puzzle, and it seems very likely that he hid proof in the blockchain. Craig is waiting for us to solve.
2. Craig is behind held up to deliver his proof by some external pressure (tax/government)
3. Craig is awaiting/pushing others who went to the procedure and agreed to publish and somehow backed-out.
4. Craig is testing the waters.
5. Craig is a con-man who somehow managed to trick Gavin,Jon,BBC,Economist with fake evidence, after which he tries to con the rest of the world with something he calls general instructions on the verify-procedure, without any text-to-sign and with bogus data, hoping that nobody would notice all data is bogus.

You seem to forget that miners *also* generate coins.
Everyone can choose the rules they want. How do you know which rules the economy wants?
By following the rules used for newly minted coins that need to be sold to users. These rules can never be "bad" because then nobody would buy these coins. The rules used for newly minted coins always follow the economy.
Bitcoin is powerful because the rules driven by the economy (the rules used for minted coins) are the same as the rules that drive the most worked chain.

Maxwell has pointed out that he is working on a superior solution. But there are some reasons that this is still interesting.
* Maxwell's solution is currently just an idea; xthin is working and is actually been in use for quite a while.
* Maxwell's solution could in theory achieve a saving in bandwidth which seems to be the about the same as xthin
* It is hard to see before hand whether Maxwell's solution will actually be superior; it is tricky to take Maxwell's word for it, given that he can be a bit condescending towards other people's solutions especially from non-core implementations.
That being said, it seems that - in theory - Maxwell's solution has a better protection against DOS attack, which is a weak spot of xthin and bloom filters in general. It is interesting to see if BU will be addressing that.

That is not UASF. That is just a normal Softfork with a lower threshold. I fully agree this can be done.
The high threshold sounds safe, but *any* threshold &gt;50% will be safe as long as there is an activation delay, because it will force other miners to switch.

Sure, the 6 orphaned blocks were bad, but also very costly for the miners.
Since, we rarely see empty blocks; no more then a few per 1000 and never in long sequences.
It is in the miners interest to start SPV mine, but to verify the transactions as fast as possible which is what they do.
Sure SPV mining increases the possibility of orphaning after a few confirmations but only slightly so. And these blocks *are* adequately orphaned.

A new P2P message is not a new network. Adding "feefilter" did not create a new P2P network.
SegWit does not even add a message; only new inv types for GetData transfer (MSG_WITNESS_TX and MSG_WITNESS_BLOCK).
Yes, these are already in use by BIP141 signalling nodes even before activation (which seems to be the cause of the confusion), but *only* between two of these nodes (with service flag NODE_WITNESS).
With SEGWIT2X, these GetData transfers will only be used between SEGWIT2X nodes. 
SegWit to non-segwit or segwit to segwit2x will simply use to non-witness GetData transfers (MSG_TX/MSG_BLOCK).
There is no "new P2P network".

Because it is highly irrelevant. 
The one change the bitcoin protocol needs, is solving the fixed blocksize.
The arguments for maintaining a 1mb limit or 4mb weight limit in the name of "decentralization" are flawed, repeatedly debunked, and are blocking the scaling of bitcoin as originally intended.
Decentralisation can be quantified as the number of distinct independent entities that can breach the security of the network. 
Full node counts have no effect on this.

Indeed, a SegWit transaction would be valid but non standard on the legacy chain, and therefore not likely mined.
But UASF only forces *signalling* SegWit. Activating will take 1-2 difficulty periods (depending on August 1 alignment), and a difficulty period will take 2 weeks * the fraction of UASF miners. With BitFury only, you talk about 20-40 weeks, so I think you want to be able to trade before that.

Both SPV nodes and Full nodes must trust the mining majority to trust transactions. Neither SPV nor full nodes need to trust peers.
There is no good reason to abandon the original plan for scaling.

Do you really believe this is all Jihan? The movement to allow bigger blocks far precedes him. Engineers like Gavin and Mike warned long before he came into picture, that not increasing it is stupid. SPV scaling and security works and has *never* been breached.
As founder of Bitcrust I talk and discuss with developers every day who think not increasing the blocksize is stupid. The only opposition we find is from a small group surrounding Gregory and this subreddit. The vast majority of developers acknowledges the stupidity of maintaining a committee based size/weight limit.

EDIT 
Let me try myself:
The profit of a miner can be simplified as reward (in btc) minus electricity (in fiat). If the price goes up, so does the profit margin which will allow more miners to participate. Hence, the hashrate goes up.
Again, this applies to me as well as to other miners. If the profit margin goes up, it allows me to invest in more mining power, in the same way as others. There is no reason to assume that my *share* of the hashrate decreases.

I think it would be possible if you remove the "padlock" restriction.
If you use two of these sets you have 2 of 6 if you can somehow enforce that opening one lock disables the corresponding lock of the other set.
I imagine doing this with bolt locks where opening one lock moves the bolt in a position such that the corresponding bolt lock of the other set becomes obstructed.
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:54:50
This is misleading. Every softfork in bitcoin's history required support from miners. 
A softfork with a mining minority is risky as a bitcoin transaction on a minority chain is not secure.
In the early days, support was simply implied by publishing a newer version. 
Later with for example P2SH, miner support was carefully but "manually" measured.
Since BIP 9 miner support is automatically measured and used as trigger.

In a decentralised network, consensus is the result of free choice of users.
The incentives ensures that everyone uses the same block reward and meaning of Opcode 17.
Clearly, it is not in any individual non-miners interest to reject larger blocks of the most worked chain as there is no chance a minority can exist and be worth more if the only difference is block size.
Hence, a patch that fixes this is strictly an improvement for the user.
You cannot design a decentralised network like you would design appletalk or netbios. You can only serve the interest of indivudual participants.

A block size increase allows for equally cheap coinjoin operations.

Of course nodes can enforce their ruleset. Everyone can enforce the ruleset they want by virtue of the network being decentralised. 
My point is that the ruleset used by miners best indicates what users want as they need to sell their coins.
The ruleset of my full node could very well use a 100 btc reward. No one would notice. The ruleset of the mining majority is never going to contain such reward because nobody would give a dime for such coins.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:08:14
I don't think it works that way. 
The reward is defined to be rounded to zero after a certain block. This is not dependent on the precision which can and will be increased without problem.
Of course, miners could theoratically lengthen the reward, just as they could theoratically change everything,  but they have no majority incentive to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:53:52


Why would it reduce the acceptability of their blocks? There is no incentive to reject such block. The reason they would use it is because it allows them to SPV mine without hurting the security of SPV nodes.


This only levels the playing field. The idea that miners should *not* SPV-mine for the greater good doesn't sound realistic. I get that "SPV-mining" sounds filthy, but with this proposal and a proper implementation, there is nothing wrong with SPV-mining until verification is complete.


Proper SPV mining will only result in an SPV block once every few hundred blocks. This makes such an attack unfeasible.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:23:45
True. But that doesn't change the fact that your transactions are secured by economic principles and incentives. Not by cryptography.

Weak blocks are an awesome idea but they are not about latency, but about reducing the peak bandwidth of block propagation. This will mean bandwidth be used more effectively as it will be better averaged out, and final block propagation can be really fast. 
I don't understand why you say they need to be part of the same solution though; they can use xthin (or Gregory's variant) in the same way normal blocks do.
@_date: 2016-05-26 07:20:53
Can you clarify? 
SegWit will use P2SH addresses, such that the receiver can have an output sent such that he can spent these using SegWit. This only works if the output is already a P2SH-address for SegWit.

It doesn't cost them any money. It gains them money.
They can simply decide on a height. At this height start mining on the minority chain but not publishing blocks except to each other. After some 100s blocks release the chain , orphaning 100s blocks.
This doesn't reduce their btc mining income. 
During the withholding they can buy anything on openbazaar/poloniex/wherever, which will be undone 100 blocks later.

Except that any attack only takes some blocks. The fact that the majority can always direct their hashing power to the minority chain for a few hours to withhold/release means that we can no longer rely on transactions being secure and irreversible after enough confirmations.

It is a common misconception that you can reduce trust on miners by means of of cryptographic verification of transactions. This is not the case.
Let me say I receive a transaction from X, and I send my compensation after 6 confirmations. This means I must assume that either X does not control the mining majority, which would be stupid to assume. So I must assume that X will not undo the payment with withholding releasing (which doesn't reduce his BTC income), because he does not want to hurt the value of Bitcoin. 
More accurately, I can only  ever trust a payment if its value  is less then the cost induced on the mining majority of reducing bitcoin's utility. 
Although I normally can, *that* is the weak spot of PoW security. It assumes miners act in their own interest. For this reason, verifying signatures or coinbases is cute but highly irrelevant. 
This is why the SPV scaling and security model works and should not have been abandoned.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:02:46
I understand that. But my point is that if tomorrow is August 1, as it stands no miners are using BIP148 so no miner would be rejecting non-SegWit blocks.
This means that BIP148 nodes will reject *all* blocks, as they consider the BitFury or F2Pool SegWit blocks invalid as well as they will be build on non-segwit blocks.
For BIP148 to work, you don't just need SegWit miners, you need BIP148 miners, and as all SegWit miners have signed NY, you will need miners to back out of that and switch to BIP148.

I am one those but I feel misrepresented.
I agree it is a trade off, but I believe the view is only unpopular because some notable cryptographers have pushed the narrative that full nodes are somehow protected against the mining majority attacking, which is obviously not the case. You cannot protect against the mining majority attacking with PoW security. There is no PoW security without reliance on  their financial incentives.


Once you see that there is no protection against the mining majority this argument falls apart.
Decentralization can be quantified as the number of distinct independent entities that must be compromised in order to breach the security of the network. With Bitcoin this is 51% of the miners.
Obviously this number is *way* too low (&lt;15?), but uneffected by the block size.


That is a good argument, though possible to address in different ways then just running full nodes.

That is not how it works. If they signal SegWit support through BIP 9, but do not validate witness data after activation they put themselves at risk.

Maybe someone can better explain UASF to me?
I don't understand why the majority hash power would not attack the minority chain by withholding/releasing. This would be only gains for them because it prevents the minority chain from having value.
It seems silly for them *not* to do that.
They could simply coordinate with an off-chain protocol a target height in which they temporarily redirect their hash power to the minority chain, and withhold the blocks for a coordinate amount of blocks. Because they would themselves know the target height, they can make any "purchase" for free at the start of the withholding, making the minority chain worthless.
This doesn't even cost anything: if the minority chain has little value, there would be no need, and if the minority chain has value they only mint these coins instead for some (say ~3%) of the time.
How can flag day activation ever work?
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:50:19
Note that non-uasf SegWit miners will not follow the UASF chain unless this is the longest.

@_date: 2015-10-01 09:51:38
I am not convinced.
We may *want* the users to be in charge, but I think the core of bitcoin, the blockchain, relies almost solely on the on the miners. They are the sole guardians of what is stored there and what is rejected. It's the miner's incentives that matter the most.
One of the big strengths of bitcoin, is that the incentives for the miners are such that they won't work against bitcoin, and there incentives are more or less aligned with what benefit users.
Now the big question is, if we give them more control of the blocksize limit (BIP 100), then they have now (patch, hardfork, pray everyone goes along), would the miners incentives still be aligned with the users?
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:32:26
Well, I was around and am aware of orphaned invalid blocks but I wonder where "94" comes from?
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:34:28
Yes. But miners following BIP 148 will also signal their support in their coinbase as BitFury did earlier. 
Currently no miner is doing that. I don't see any point in "covert" UASF use, so it is safe to assume that no miner is using BIP148 rules.

And why is this "Satoshi's vision"? Any source on that? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:43:06


It does. Compare the situations:
With this solution, everyone can choose between "SegWit only" or "SegWit + HF".
if a miner wants "SegWit only" it could "trick" by creating a fork which uses this new SegWit2X signaling and triggering, but then strip off the HF logic, redefining bit 4 as SegWit only. Though possible this would clearly expose malicious intent, violation of the agreement, run consensus code without spec and would be hard to coordinate causing mostly self-harm. 
Compare this to BIP91.
A miner preferring SegWit only, can then "trick" by just temporarily setting bit 4 without any extra logic. All miners that only want to support "SegWit +HF" would then *involuntarily* support regular "SegWit-only" deployment. 
It would make it rather impossible to signal "SegWit+HF" only. Effectively you create the situation where 70% signalling "SegWit+HF"  and 25% signalling "SegWit only" would incorrectly legitimize and trigger "SegWit only".
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:46:18
No. This is actually reversed. Those that are in support are (almost all) also listed as "ready" under [segwit adoption](
This is an obvious move to make for any business.
Only those that have also explicitly stated support are listed as "Support".

Yes. This is what I mean with "1 byte in the normal block space is counted as 4."


Yes, but *via* the coinbase transaction. The merkle root of the all the witness data is stored there, which effects the txid of the coinbase, which effects the merkle root.
This is often quoted as the one difference between SF SegWit and HF SegWit because with a HF you would probably just change the rules of the merkle tree to include the witness hashes.
Personally, I don't think it matters much.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:44:52
Please explain what you mean. As far as I understand, if I can send a few bits from one of the addresses that the 0.4498 BTC arrive from it can mean one of the three things:
* I am the owner of the private wallet that send the 0.4498
* I am the owner of the service with the web/shared wallet that was used to send the 0.4498
* I use the same web/shared wallet as the one who send the 0.4498 and I was lucky enough  that the service used the exact same address in my transfer (which I don't think webwallets normally do).
Of course, the third case is possible and this doesn't make the proof perfect, but I would think that in combination with a good explanation, it could suffice. 
At least it is something "indicating" it's the same person.

I don't think this is really true. The reasoning in Keynes main work is primarily about savings. He argues that in an economy with a fixed amount of money, every dollar saved is subtracted from the amount of work available. 
Although I wouldn't be into bitcoin if I would be happy with the central bank *solution* that came out of Keynes' work, the *problem* he describes is well argued and shouldn't be dismissed so easily.
Even if advocating anarcho-capitalism, it is important to take the counter-arguments seriously, and I can only recommend Keynes' work as a well thought out reasoning of the hurdles of such economy, especially with regards to saving.

SegWit replaces the 1mb block *size* limit with a 4mb block *weight* limit.
1 byte in the new, separate witness space is counted as 1. 1 byte in the normal block space is counted as 4.
The effect is that normal, non-segwit transactions are limited in the the same way as before. We just count each byte as 4 and use max of 4mb instead 1mb.
When using SegWit transactions, more data can be stored because the signature-bytes are counted as 1. 
Note that this means that when including SegWit transaction the maximum size of the "normal" block as seen by old nodes will actually be less then 1mb. For example an 800kb block with 800k of separate witness data is "full" as it has a weight of 800kb*4 + 800kb = 4mb
The idea is two-fold: To allow for more space and to ensure that witness data induces less fee as it is less costly to process (it does not need to be accessed again after verification and can be pruned).
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:30:53
It does change the fact because if some N% decides to mine without signatures  (made possible by SegWit) an attacker only needs (51-N)%.

It isn't too expensive to fire up enough nodes to get a good picture. 
To mitigate this there is Tor and things like confidential transactions are planned, which actually reduce trust in peers instead of elevating their trust to above-attacker level.
The benefits of this are minimal.

Everyone can choose the rules they enforce.
For instance, those that generate coins and depend on the value users give to those coins, can choose rules.
Those that generate blocks and the most-worked chain can choose rules.
The trick of bitcoin is that these two are the same. The rules driven by the value of coins and the rules that drive  the most-worked chain are the same!
This is the mechanism to determine rules based on the economy in a fully decentralized matter.
That is why "hash power = law".

I would think that miners are the ones that make the final decision on what is allowed and who owns what. Their centralization is a problem.
Apart from the selfish incentive to maintain and verify all data (which is necessary for some solutions), the only function of nodes is to pass transactions and blocks around. As long as it is very easy to find nodes to connect to, why would we want more nodes? 
What does bitcoin gain from more nodes then needed to easily find a node to connect to?

I believe I have just shown why this is unlikely. You cannot just say they don't follow the economy because they don't follow your wishes, or because of some twitter poll.
Many people, including me as [I argued here]( , believe that structurally solving (or removing) the blocksize limit is much more urgent then SegWit.
The most reasonable explanation for there not being enough mining support for SegWit, is that there is doubt among the economic users, not because they are no longer following their financial incentives.

There is no "splitting" because a minority chain will never have significant value.

Have you read any other paper from Craig? In my opinion these are of a similar style and quality as the paper. 
The Sartre post is extremely odd, which makes very likely that it is a puzzle. 
* It seems logical that Satoshi has hidden his proof in the early blockchain.
* Why  would he use a keypair from a specific spot in the chain?
* Why would he emphasize yet obfuscate the message "Wright, it is not the same as if I sign Craig Wright, Satoshi.

"?
* Why would he uses completely bogus and non-functional examples?

Isn't this advantage completely nullified by proper SPV mining? (aka with a mark)
I would think that the only  variable in efficiency would then be the latency difference which is not effected by blocksize.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:08:11
Probably not. The thing is that although most transactions would end up on both chains, *some* transactions might not end up in one chain or later. 
Over time the differences would increase as txs build upon "half"-mined txs get included.

Can you clarify? I know Schnorr only from the [wiki]( but there a simple multiplicative group is used and no elliptic curve at all. 
My question arose because the combining of signatures is  result of group operations that also seem applicable to an Elliptic Curve group. 
Are you saying that the planned implementation will use Schnorr signatures using an Elliptic Curve group?

I don't think it adds any security to verify the signature on a new machine (without an existing keyring) when you download both the EXE and the ASC from the same origin over HTTPS.
In both cases an attacker needs access to the Electrum servers or the electrum HTTPS certificate. 
An attacker replacing the EXE, can also simply create a signature file for it with a fake name.

* Monero =&gt; Privacy
* Litecoin =&gt; different params

However, most of these do not seem to provide enough innovation to beat the network effect of bitcoin.

That is not what I am saying. I am saying that if there is some entity X that mints coins and must sell them to users, the rules X uses for their minted  coins are most likely to follow whatever users want. Otherwise they can't sell these coins as they would be rejected.
They will not mint coins with SegWit rules or big block rules as long as they are not convinced this increases the price with which they sell their coins.
The rules used for minted coins are the best *indication* of economic support (much better then twitter polls), and hence hash power is an excellent way to *trigger* proposed changes. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:06:27
I fail to see how this is still the case with a different service flag. 
`GetFetchFlags` won't return MSG_WITNESS_FLAG
This means GetData uses MSG_TX and MSG_BLOCK instead of MSG_WITNESS_TX and MSG_WITNESS_BLOCK.
This means all TxIn::scriptWitness will be null.
This means block.vtx[i]-&gt;HasWitness() will return false.
This means the ban will not be triggered.
NODE_WITNESS and NODE_WITNESS2X nodes simply treat each other as pre-witness nodes. What am I missing?
@_date: 2016-05-25 22:05:53


All existing outputs are non-segwit. That means that even if all wallets and users switch today, the first transactions will not be using the extra space. Only the txs built upon those will use the witness space.
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:44:02
Yes, but it will not function very well without a malleability fix. Another malleability fix such as for example [BIP140]( would do just as well.
The problem (as I understand it) is, currently the only way to make it secure without malleability fix would require twice the amount of channels as they need to be unidirectional. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:22:27


There is no hardfork SegWit as far as I know. I am just postulating how it would be designed if it would be done with a hardfork.
I think it would make more sense to just use a left branch for witnesses and a right branch for txids.
But as said, I don't think it matters much as the coinbase is reasonable spot.


SoftFork SegWit only blocks *covert* AsicBoost as an accidental side effect, but it is trivial softfork to do this without SegWit.

@_date: 2017-05-19 10:03:14
The wallets I know and use all allow using existing keys. Restricting this to post SegWit would be a serious limitation.
More generally, I think it does not make bitcoin simpler because the complexity of a protocol can be roughly quantified as the size of the (would be) spec.
With bitcoin thinks like SegWit increase this because you can never deprecate older outputs.

There *is* an entity called "Bitcoin Core", which is a computer program. 
The fact that the development model is "decentralized" simply means that the authority/responsibility/influence of individuals is determined by the community and not by their title. It  doesn't mean at all that people have no influence or authority.
I would really like to see Bitcoin Core to "grow up" and take on a more conventional approach to development structure that most Open Source projects opt for. The reason is not only that people dodge their responsibility, but more importantly the harsh communication that result from it. Though a bit off-topic, allow me to explain by example.
Let us say that Janice has done lots of commits, and has had lots bright ideas. This way she has gained respect from the community and a lot of influence on the technical consensus. She is what in a conventional model might be called "lead developer" because of her technical skills.
So far we have a happy little technocracy.
But now Mary comes along who has done very little for the project and is not well known in the community; in conventional structure she would be a "Junior Developer". Mary has some ideas that are orthogonal to Janice's, but presents them with strong arguments.
In a conventional model, Janice could well be convinced of Mary's ideas even though they counter her own. In fact it would show good leadership skills to do so. In the "decentralized" model things are different. As Janice only has her position by being right on technical matters, she cannot easily allow herself to be convinced by Mary without a penalty on her community status.
Even though Alice might be a good leader on top of a good technician, the decentralized model forces her to take on narrow-minded and stubborn viewpoints.
I believe that it is time to reconsider the decentralized "idols" development model and take on a structure more suitable for serious Open Source development.

@_date: 2017-07-05 15:04:05
Well the hash is not a random number because it is what you get when you hash the blockheader. Miners adjust the blockheader until they have a hash which is low enough.
So the hash *is* what makes the PoW of the block valid.
The blockchain is a chain of headers. Each with verifyable proof that a lot of work spent creating it.
One of the fields is the merkle root, which can be used to verify whether a certain transaction was tied to the block (aka whether the miner included the transaction in the block). Because these transactions are hashed as a tree, you don't need *all* transactions of the block in order to verify if a specific transaction is part of the set that hashes to the merkle root.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:40:57
I am not using an argument against SegWit. I like SegWit. I am simply correcting with his claim that it is simpler for wallet developers which is obviously nonsense as no sane dev is going to release a new version of his wallet which does not allow importing from the previous one. Or bring a new wallet to market which does not allow importing from any other wallets.
Hence, they must all support both SegWit and non-segwit.

btc1 is an implementation which implements Segwit2X. SegWit2X consists of several specifications:
* BIP91: Signal bit 4, which on activation starts enforcing bit 1.
* SegWit (BIP141): Signaled by bit 1 after activation of BIP91.
* Blocksize X2: Locked in to activate 90 days after SegWit activates.
So BIP91 signaling (bit 4) is just the first phase of the SegWit2X changeset implemented by btc1.

This doesn't sound near zero risk at all:
First of all, currently only 10% of the hashrate supports UASF. This means the other 25% would follow the longest chain.
A 10% chain will initially be 10x as slow and small and very hard deal with.
Furthermore, if the UASF chain &lt; 50% there seems to be a big incentive for the majority to spend a few percent [attacking it]( make ik it impossible to trade with.

I have been a bitcoiner since the early days and I *always* understood mining to be eventually dominated by a few huge farms. This is also what Satoshi immediately made clear in his early writings. How could you expect differently?
Bitcoin isn't controlled by democracy, it's controlled by the market. *Of course* a few huge players get all the power. That is how the market works. Bitcoin functions because the financial incentives of these big players are aligned with users as they must sell their minted coins to users.
You seem to believe this is a problem. I believe that the idea that users must run full nodes to "check miners"  is the problem. This doesn't scale at all.
I want the entire world to use bitcoin. *That* would be decentralization. So I will pop the champagne when usage grows to 10mb blocks, pop two bottles when it grows to 100mb blocks, and throw a gigantic party when blocks are 1gb.
The entire narrative that this growth is somehow bad is completely backwards.

The quadratic hashing problem is not related to scaling.
It is bounded by transaction size, not block size. As such, the problem will only get smaller in time as technology improves. (If it is even possible to get smaller than it has been since 2009).

Here are two options:
* We measure economic support by Twitter Polls and web tables that gather quotes from businesses.
* We measure economic support by following the rules used for newly minted coins that are sold to users.
The rules that are used for minted coins must always follow the economy, because if users are not happy with the rules of the minted coins, these coins cannot be sold and will be rejected.
People seem to mistake "hash power is law" with following the rules of those that "only" order transactions.  We  follow the rules used for newly minted coins as these rules *always* follow the economy. 
In bitcoin, these rules happen to be determined by the ones that also order transactions.

In case of any dispute between rules X and rules Y, the rules used for minted coins will follow demand. 
I believe this mechanism is superior to any off-chain polling. We simply propose a change of rules X to Y, and it will only ever be used for the most-worked chain if coins minted with rules Y are expected to be more valuable then coins minted with rules X.
What's not to like about that mechanism?

The idea that a full node is somehow more protected than a light client is easily debunked by simple adversarial reasoning.
Let's say I am an attacker and own 51%.
Now if I would attack using an invalid block, the attack would be very high risk and extremely expensive.
Even if everyone would be running light clients, except for big businesses and miners, the internet would immediately be turned upside down. Trades would be halted. Patches would be rolled out to force wallets on the honest minority. PSAs would be spreaded to manually "invalidateblock" wallets to the honest chain.
There is an almost certain risk of me losing all my minted and stolen coins. Sure I might be able to make some bucks in the process but compare this to a valid block attack.
This is extremely simple with withholding/releasing. It doesn't reduce my minted coins income. I can scoop up every altcoin or everything else available for bitcoin for free, and there is *nothing anyone can do*. I can just repeat it over and over again. No trade stops. No manual "invalidateblock". No patches. No fixes. No banning. Not more confirmation. Not a gazillion full nodes.
Yes, we are dependent on the mining majority, but full nodes don't help. Why would an attacker want to create an invalid block?

Because proper SPV mining increases there profit without hurting the economy.


I agree that the assumption relies on perfect information flow, which clearly doesn't exist. 
Still it is in my opinion the *best* indicator. Outside of this sub there seems to be much more criticism on SegWit.
The idea of the "entire economy" standing behind it, seems to be based on businesses implementing it, which they probably want to do regardless of whether they like it.
Either way, miners are conservative which is why the only changes to the bitcoin protocol until now have been *unambiguous improvements*, and why SegWit is having a hard time.
@_date: 2016-05-26 20:18:36
Ok. You make good points.
I can't say I am in favour though, not only because I think you need VERY good reasons to add features to Core (was this on the roadmap?), but also because  there you have put much better privacy protecting features in the pipeline that actually reduce trust in peers instead of embracing it.
Regardless of the minor advantages, I would strive to keep P2P encryption out of the trustless network.


This is not the case in practice, because you have to assume peers *are*  attackers. For an attacker it is much easier to fire up a bunch of nodes then to find a MITM position.
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:52:15
I am biased on this one but let me try.
When block size is lower then demand (such as now), there is clearly a *market* for transactions competing on fee. This ensures that the minimum fee for quick inclusion is based nicely on demand.
Some fear that such fee market cannot function if the block size would only be limited by individual miner's policies. This is because as long as there is *some* miner including all &gt;X fee transactions, there is little reason for users to pay more then X.
Personally I think this is flawed concept: The current "market" is rather simple and follows known economic model, and the fee market would be rather tricky to understand, predict and model without a fixed blocksize limit. But it would clearly still be a market as there are costs for a miner to process each transaction.
The idea that we need to "help" miners by fixing the limit is plan-economy way of thinking that does not really match with bitcoin as laissez-faire free market system.

Miners have a financial incentive to do whatever the economy wants. Developers have no such build in incentive.
For the decentralized network to function, developers should build for miners what miners want and build for other users what other users want.
The idea that developers just add an activation date to something not enough miners support is very risky.

How? Let us say 95% of the economic users want to change X. How do you determine and trigger this in a decentralized way resistant to Sybil?
That is *exactly* the problem Bitcoin solves with miners. Those that generate coins depend directly on the value that users give to those coins, and the rules *they* use are also the ones that govern the longest chain. That is not a coincidence.

@_date: 2017-05-08 17:40:10
Because they, and I, believe PoW security cannot exist with the mining majority acting against their financial incentives. It is simply impossible for a "valid" minority chain to maintain security if the longest chain is invalid as every transaction would become a gamble.
Therefore, the only thing that is relevant for a user, is whether his transaction is embedded in a block (checked via the merkle branch) and whether it is buried under enough proof-of-work (checked via the headers).
Therefore, the SPV scaling model ([with]( or without Fraud proofs) as originally envisioned is extremely powerful and the best way forward.
The idea that everyone must validate all transactions in order to maintain "decentralization" is flawed and a rather unscalable concept for a cryptocurrency.

If I control 51% I would not create an invalid transaction. I would create a *valid* transaction, then mine and withhold a counter payment, let the honest minority mine and confirm the payment and confirmations, and then release 7 blocks to undo . This doesn't even reduce my mining income.
There is no point for an attacker to create invalid transactions.
I can ship the product *only* if I trust that the mining majority follows their financial incentive not to hurt bitcoin.

Because miners don't want to mine an invalid block, the *risk* for a miner to mine on a block without validating it is tiny. 
If there is a gain to be made, currently with header-first, but with SegWit by not downloading the signatures, then this can outweigh  the risk.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:51:01
True. In that sense it *does* contribute to the security.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:01:56
99% of the users rely on PoW security with light clients. They verify PoW but rely on 51% of the mining power acting rationally. 
This is the root of bitcoin security, not every user running a full node. 
If these 99% must rely on *more* than 51% acting rationally we're doing something wrong. Especially if it is an unnecessary side effect.

You seem to suggest that I should trust my peers more then I do a MITM. This defies the principles of a trustless system.


This is a problem in itself, but won't this be mitigated by your thin blocks proposal?


This is cool, and the idea is cool, but we have to weight the cost-benefit and watch out for feature bloat.
This is difficult in a everyone-can-contribute model because the features are judged as presented, but in this case, is this really worth adding the extra code, new protocol messages and added complexity for? 
I for one really like that I can read and understand the simplicity of bitcoin and the fact that I can dream the WireShark dumps.  I am not sure whether this is a feature that users have been waiting for.

I have a few questions.
Do I understand correctly that the blinding here only refers to the state? So if I am assuming the role both the peer of X and the only observer of X, I can still steal his funds?


But wouldn't observing *every* channel, still require you to receive every state update on every channel? Even if this data compact and blinded, is that realistic?

I understand both inequalities hold. But explains with:


that an attacker is better of creating one n sized transaction than two (n/2) sized transactions.
This is obviously correct but irrelevant, because either way it can't create a transactions larger than 1mb. *With* this commit it can create one  1mb transaction. Without it it can create 2. 
Hence this commit makes an attack (slightly) less effective as:
n^2 &lt; 2 n^2

This isn't really supported by evidence of the first 7 years of bitcoin.

This is how I envision a consensus network gets upgraded.
1. An change is proposed.
2. It is implemented
3. If a supermajority hashing power opts-in, adopt, otherwise not.
No matter how you like SegWit, there has been some minor criticism from different corners, causing it to only reach about 30%. And no, this is not just "Jihan".
Bummer. Let's try something else such as BIP 140. 
Lesson learned, is that it is hard to gain supermajority support if you try to change too many things at once.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:09:52
An important amendment is that the 30% signalling SegWit is not currently signalling UASF. That means that August 1 they will still mine upon non-segwit blocks and their blocks will be rejected by UASF nodes as well.
Currently 0% is mining UASF which means that UASF nodes will simply reject all blocks.

ASICboost could block some progress. Which is well accepted, and which is why Bitmain immediately clarified they would accept any fix.
ASICboost is not why SegWit had a hard time. There was and is a lot of technical criticism on SegWit and Bitmain was one of the later miners to pick sides.
Of course it is one cpu = one vote. That is the very heart of PoW security. The economy decides with the mechanism that those that mint coins and must sell those coins to users will always mine these coins with rules that make them most valuable.

@_date: 2017-07-16 15:57:38
Miners employ a strategy called header first mining.
This means that as soon as they have received the header they start mining on top. They can't include any transaction until they have received every byte of the block as they don't know yet which can be included. Once everything is in they can start including transactions and collect fees.
It is rather harmless as if they wouldn't do it, the block would simply be orphaned as it would still have to be on the previous block.
One of the primary concerns with SegWit is that [miners can continue this practice without downloading signatures]( This could mean that in the future we can expect blocks with transactions but that just like these empty blocks, didn't validate the previous one.
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:16:52
That's silly.
Being accessible means being able to use. Thus being able transact securely and privately  and verify the PoW of your transactions.
Verifying every transaction in the world obviously isn't cheap unless we want to limit adoption to a handful of people.

Can someone explain the rationale? 
I thought deanomization simply works by *being a peer* and see what transactions some ip sends (first).
Why would you need man-in-the-middle position and why would you want to mitigate against that?
Is this only directed towards users that somehow know by other means, which peers can be trusted?
The more I think about this the less I understand it. Isn't bitcoin supposed to be a trustless P2P system? Why would you encrypt data to someone you don't trust anyway? Are the authors somehow suggesting we should deviate from this idea and move towards trusted peers?
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:19:02
That is nonsense. 
Proper validationless mining for the first seconds only is a blessing not a curse.
The 6 block orphaning in BIP66 was caused by their own buggy implementation of this. No money was lost except for miners losing a lot.
Not eventually validating is expensive for miners with no gain.
I fail to see why this issue should make us switch the model to a completely unscaleable one.
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:15:59
This is a strange derailing of the argument.
Bitcoin's transaction gossip model at 20k/sec is *not* related to scaling, not currently a problem, not hard to solve with the payment protocol and not related to limiting the blocksize at all.
LN's flooding model is also fine. Nobody is having a hard time making P2P work.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:16:22
You can't make Schnorr mandatory because that would both require all wallets to upgrade and would invalidate all existing time-locked transactions.
Hence it won't effect "spam".
The current softfork upgrade mechanism is what gave us p2sh, CLTV and CSV and would work fine for schnorr. It would be a softfork and optional.
The only "dependency" is that it happens to be on the roadmap *after* SegWit changes the upgrade mechanism with script versioning. 
Understandably, if changes to the upgrade mechanism are pending, you postpone upgrades till after the change, but there is no technical dependency of Schnorr on SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:41:05

My point is that the attacker does not need to create an invalid transaction.
It can just send you a *valid* transaction, mine and withhold a conflicting payment and 30 blocks, let the honest minority mine 30 blocks confirming your payment, and then release to undo.
Attacks involving invalid transactions would be rather silly because it would cut off the honest minority allowing them to react as you suggest.
An attacker is *also* best served playing by the rules.

It may be a matter of semantics, but I think it is important nonetheless to clarify that this is very much wrong.

One of the key innovations of Bitcoin is the often forgotten *dual role* of miners.
They not only secure with PoW but they also mint. We do not measure support for a feature by following PoW, we measure support by following those that need to sell minted coins to users. 
The rules they choose for their minted coins will always be the rules users deem most valuable. 
The fact that those that mint coins, also provide the PoW is no coincidence. It means that hash power is an excellent way to measure economic support.
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:38:02
I understand that. Although we don't know the activation details yet, hopefully every node will have enough time to switch to a SEGWIT2X implementation in time, or consciously stick to the 19%.
Consider the alternative (correct me if I am wrong) of using BIP91. If then 70% signals SEGWIT2X and 25% signals BIP141, BIP141 would activate, even though the 70% did not agree to SegWit only. That would not implement the agreement as written. 
Now  you may not agree with the agreement, but the repo we're talking about is an attempt to implement it.

Whether it is economical is not so easy to say.
The biggest variance in the revenue of a miner is the price of bitcoin.
If a miner uses "highest-fee" policy for 90% and "highest-fee but bumping with age" for the other 10%, the loss in fee is minimal but the added utility to bitcoin is quite big as it prevents stuck transactions.
The added value to bitcoin and its effect on price might actually outweight these minor fees.

I have a question regarding this.
I thought that because of the use of P2SH for SegWit, *existing* outputs cannot be spent using SegWit; only txs on top those txs.
This would mean that even with 100% adoption tomorrow we would have to cycle each output  before we reap the  SegWit benefits.
Is this correct? Or is it possible to spent an ordinary P2PKH output directly with SegWit?

That is not what this change proposes. There is already a rule that limits transactions to 1mb. This just ensures there is only one. And


That said; I don't think it is a good idea. As the possible damage from two 1mb transactions isn't significantly bigger than from one.

Yes. I think I also made clear they can. 
But they would have to strip off the HF logic, and use the SEGWIT2X-bit and NODE_WITNESS2X service flag mechanism defined as SegWit+HF, *despite not supporting it*. They would have to say "fuck you" to the written specification, create their own unspecified consensus rules, blatantly and openly cheat, and break bitcoin in half.
That is a big difference with simply signaling "SegWit only" as specified in BIP141 and then see it activate exactly as specified at 95% *even though there would not be 95% wanting to support it*.

Sorry, I meant to say I don't suggest a change in the "changing mechanism". I believe UASF is stupidly insecure, and we should just develop changes, and let miners choose to adopt if they believe it increases the value of their coins.


Yes. The mining majority has never (and I believe will never) make changes without enough user support.


By lack of a better mechanism, it is really up to miners to "guess"  or poll what the economy wants. They have shown to do so in an extremely conservative way which is a good thing.
In fact, the only changes accepted by the majority were rather unambiguously improvements such as P2SH and CLTV. Things that have *some* resistance such as SegWit are having a hard time.
The best we can do is ensure the changes we propose are as small as possible as the less you change, the less chance of resistance. That is why I like for example BIP 140 as a malleability fix. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:36:19

Let's say I am an attacker and own 51%.
Now if I would attack using an invalid block, the attack would be very high risk and extremely expensive.
Even if everyone would be running light clients, except for big businesses and miners, the internet would immediately be turned upside down. Trades would be halted. Patches would be rolled out to force wallets on the honest minority. PSAs would be spreaded to manually "invalidateblock" wallets to the honest chain.
There is an almost certain risk of me losing all my minted and stolen coins. Sure I might be able to make some bucks in the process but compare this to a valid block attack.
This is extremely simple with withholding/releasing. I just make a payment to something, let the honest miners mine and confirm it, meanwhile withhold my blocks and after the goodies are in release my blcoks. It doesn't reduce my minted coins income. I can scoop up every altcoin or everything else available for bitcoin for free, and there is *nothing anyone can do*. I can just repeat it over and over again. No trade stops. No manual "invalidateblock". No patches. No fixes. No banning. Not more confirmation. Not a gazillion full nodes.

An SPV client *by design* and *by intention* relies on PoW security and follows the most worked chain.
The idea that SPV can somehow rely on following the "current" ruleset is flawed because no miner has an obligation to advertise the rules it uses. There is no authorative "current" ruleset other than the rules of the most worked chain. 
Hence, contrary to Peter's claims, using a version bit would *break* the assumptions made by SPV clients.

Among developers the situation is worse. Of course Core contributors agree as they are Core developers because they agree with Core's roadmap.
But as founder of bitcrust I work and talk with many developers that do not agree with the roadmap and therefore do not contribute to Core but to other projects instead (XT, Iguana, BU, bcoin, bitcrust, classic).

Full nodes are *not protected against 51%*. 51% can take anything available for Bitcoin for free. A double spent attack *does not use invalid blocks*.

SPV has *never* been defrauded and the risk of this happening reduces with the price of bitcoin.
The idea to exchange an excellent scalable cryptocurrency for an unscalable one is utterly stupid.

Bitcoin's security model is based on economic incentives.

No Big Blockers disagree that people checking *each other's* transactions somehow aids decentralization.

Time locked transactions is simply one of the reasons why you can't just deprecate any existing scripts.
Currently scripts are updated by redefining an "empty" Opcode.  Script versioning allows you to change the working of an existing Opcode. 
This has an advantage in that you can change the effect on the stack of the Opcode making it somewhat cleaner.
It also has a disadvantage in that you have multiple different script versions that must be supported indefinitely due to the immutable nature of the blockchain.

If bip148 has 33%, the legacy miners have large incentive to divert 1% to attack it, by diverting 100% to an attack every few days for an hour or two.
This costs them only 1% and will make the minority chain unusable.

@_date: 2017-05-08 11:31:01
I am not suggesting any change. I believe we are doing fine. 
We propose SegWit and the mining majority is not yet convinced it will increase the value of their coins.  Rightfully so.
We propose removing the max_block_size as consensus rule and the mining majority is not yet convinced it will increase the value of their coins.
All that rests is convincing.
As for the latter, I believe that the mechanism described which ensures minted coins follow demand is so powerful (and never shown wrong), that the arguments for maintaining a fixed size/weight limit fall apart. SPV without fraud proofs [(or with as I suggest here)]( is secure for users because of this mechanism, and the arguments that max_block_size is needed for "decentralization" are flawed (as I explain in the same link).
Hence I hope that more people will embrace Bitcoin's security and scaling model and stand behind removing the limit to let Bitcoin grow.

Of course it can. It is trivial.
The only thing withholding is the strange yet persistent fallacy that every Joe must be able to verify every transaction in the world in order for the network to be "decentralized."
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:10:12
SPV nodes *by design* rely on PoW security and follow the longest chain regardless of blocksize or any other rule. PoW works by economic incentives and this is perfectly safe, never breached, and the primary scaling model introduced by Satoshi.
claims that SPV nodes *cannot* do this because they could be sybiled into following a minority chain. If an attacker controls all your peers and wants to spend $20k per block, it could trick you into following a minority chain for a couple of blocks. 
I explain that this is *everyone's risk* including full nodes. This is not SPV specific.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:51:12
If you receive a transaction with 10 confirmations, you trust that the mining majority isn't withholding 11 blocks and undoing your payment after.
The idea that a non miner can remove trust by verifying blocks is flawed because an attacker can much more easily and cheaply defraud with valid blocks than with invalid blocks.
Defrauding with valid blocks is free while defrauding with invalid blocks costs $25k per block.
Bitcoin isn't trustless. It trusts the market. It trusts that miners will always do whatever makes their minted coins most valuable.
If Bitcoin would require people to check entire blocks in order to be secure, it would be rather crappy unscalable currency instead of the currency of the future.

BIP 148 will not initiate SegWit at Aug 1. It will only force  signalling, and split the chain. At first both chains will be much slower.
Currently 10% votes UASF. The other 25% that signals SegWit will still follow the longest chain. This means the UASF chain will be 10x slower.
If it is still 10% August 1, it will take 20 more weeks for the next difficulty adjustment and start of SegWit.

Even after 3., users will not use SegWit for existing outputs. Witness space will only be used when spending from an address created with a SegWit wallet.

This is a deecentralized network. Nobody is "making the rules".

As they are not stupid, they get together and agree on what software they want beforehand. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 14:55:28
Let me try again.
Bitcoin uses proof-of-work security. This means (as well explained in the paper) it is secure as long as honest miners control more mining power than an attacker.
If an attacker controls 51%, the security is breached as the attacker can take *anything available for bitcoin for free* by simple withholding/releasing. Every transaction would be a gamble, and nothing would help. No confirmations, not a million full nodes, no patches, nothing. Bitcoin would be worthless.
An attacker would certainly not want to create an invalid block as such an attack is much more risky and expensive.
But luckily this doesn't happen because bitcoin is build on sound economical foundation: miners don't want to hurt their investment. Proof-of-Work security works.
This also means, that *users* can verify transactions by verifying the proof-of-work. As also described in the paper, they do not need to download full blocks to do so. This is why transactions are hashed in a merkle tree; everyone can verify the proof-of-work for *their own* transasactions.
The idea that you must download and verify entire blocks in order to be secure, or to "check miners" is frankly rather ridiculous. Such a system wouldn't scale and would lead to strange paradoxical reasoning that we need *less adoption* in order for it to remain "decentralized".
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:03:40
Maybe not long after but you cannot use the witness space from an existing output.
If you have a SegWit wallet the first transaction from each output will still be non-segwit. 
Essentially every utxo must be "rolled over" once before SegWit is in full effect.

OK.  I didn't know Jeff's position, but personally I think it is a reasonable argument.

@_date: 2017-05-16 16:20:19
So, here is an idea.
Why don't measure support by *those that mint and need to sell minted coins*? After all, those will always do whatever they believe result in most value for these coins.
Coincidently, the majority of those will *also* be the creators of the most worked chain, so we just follow need to follow them to follow the economy!

No it doesn't. Why would *me* checking *your* transactions somehow effect "decentralization?"

I don't like it either, but:
1. This is payment system that *uses bitcoin*. It doesn't change bitcoin in any way and everyone is free to build whatever they want on top of bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin isn't tiny anymore. The risk of this effecting fungibilty is rather small, as enabling bitcoin for a merchant without allowing other non-bip75 payments  (with old-fashioned proof of identity if needed) isn't very useful. It is much more likely to be used as an option.
3. Many sales require identity regardless of the payment being in bitcoin. This could simply be used as added convenience.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:03:15

Looking at the [code]( more carefully, BIP91 most certainly uses a LOCKED_IN period.

True. In bitcoin, users rely in some extend to *miners* liking the feature which is why they are an important target demograph of the software.
Users probably have little reason not to update to the latest version, but miners must be very careful especially with consensus changes as these could change the value of their minted coins. This is why they tend to be more conservative.

Come on. These are not objecive measures.
For one: on quadratic hashing he writes:


This is utter nonsense. First of all,  SegWit doesn't solve quadratic hashing for an attacker as an attacker could always use existing outputs. Second of all, every blocksize increase proposal limits the tx size to 1mb, which means the problem doesn't increase at all. It only gets smaller due to technology improvements.
He writes on hardware wallets: 


If you are going to develop a hardware wallet which doesn't support BIP32 wallets sure but nobody would buy such device. Any wallet supporting existing, standardized keys would be developed to support *both old style and new style* transactions which certainly isn't easier to develop.


There is absolutely no relationship between adding Schnorr and script versioning, except that those who like Schnorr would like to use script versioning. It can be equally developed with the current script update mechanism like any other pending upgrade.
All in all, is clueless. Certainly there are reasons to support SegWit (and reasons not to), but quoting this as "objective measures" makes no sense.

No matter how open, every open source project has a shared vision. In the case of Core this is codified as Maxwell's "SegWit first" approach.
The fact that engineers like Gavin, Hearn and Garzik left, and the fact that projects like XT, Classic, bcoin, bitcrust and BU pop up, is not because "all the experts are Core" but because experts with different viewpoints tend to do different things.
People tend to jump on the same ship if they are heading in the same direction, which means blindly following one ship because they are "open", gives a rather distorted view of expertise.

@_date: 2017-06-19 12:43:26
Not exactly. BIP91 specifies that on activation, blocks not signaling bit 1 (SegWit) must be orphaned. That is how 80% is achieved. This in itself retains compatibility with SegWit-only miners.
The fact that everyone not signaling bit 4 is *also* orphaned is a simple corollary of BIP91 using the BIP9 softfork mechanism.

It actually shows the opposite. It is the reference implementation. The only full implementation promoted here and on bitcoin.org. 
The fact that there are multiple developer teams, lots of mining power, lots of nodes, filled conferences, and filled forums full of people who are unhappy about Core, might tells me that they are doing something wrong.

@_date: 2017-06-20 14:03:59
I don't really understand why replay protection makes sense here.
The softfork already orphans non bit 4 signalling blocks on activation, so 100% of the miners will mine SegWit2x.
The only way for the chain to be split is if *another* client is released and used by miners which would signal bit 4 but rejects the HF.

The most important tax (and maybe the only tax of the future) is income tax. This tax is rather independent of the currency and is rather resistant to the currency being "difficult to tax".
This is because most people want to pay taxes on their income for a plethora of reasons:
* You can get a loan
* You can buy a house
* You are insured
* You can rent a house with a minimum income requirement
* You don't have to worry about the IRS.
* You don't have to worry about labour inspection
* You get juridical protection against unreasonable treatment or discharge from you employer
* You pay for the government services you use
* You pay for the government services less fortunate people use.
* You are not doing something illegal
* You can employ someone or work for someone who insists on registration for any of the above reasons.
Actually the most important reason why some people don't pay tax over their income is because they are not allowed to, either because they are dealing with illegal substances, or because they are illegal immigrants.

BIP148 isn't safe by any means as it has no activation threshold. This means it activates even if the mining support is too small, risking big losses.

BIP148 is no hardfork.

True; LN doesn't require both participants of the channel to include funds in the funding transaction. That is not what I said though. It does require the funding transaction to be on-chain though.


You will need to broadcast on-chain each time you open a channel, add funds to it or move funds from one channel to another.
Again, this is why it is likely that ordinary users will just rely on a single channel to their exchange to make all payments.
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:55:11


I don't think scheduling compatibility   with BIP 148 is realistic  because BIP91 only orphans non-BIP141 when it is ACTIVE.
This means you will need a full difficulty period with 80% signalling BIP91 plus one difficulty period BIP91 LOCKED_IN.
Assuming 80% would test and run on production within 1 week after release, you still need 5 weeks before August 1.

A channel is between two parties and must be opened with a *funding transaction* on-chain, which is a 2-2 multisig transaction. 
For this transaction (and the closing transaction) mining fees must be paid.
If a wallet opens channels to multiple peers, *each* of these is opened with a 2-2 multisig funding transaction on chain. 
The wallet cannot move funds from one channel to another, because the amount of funds in a channel is always equal to the outputs of the on-chain funding transaction.
This is why it seems likely that most new people will just have *one* channel open to the exchange they get their funds from.

Who is claiming that? Miners have been at the forefront fighting for bigger blocks. It is the developers that have been reluctant with their "my way or the highway" SegWit solution.

I don't think this is really relevant in funding. The idea is to always leave some on both sides but when funding this simply means add *more* funds then you are paying.
So if I am a first time user withdrawing $37 dollar from an exchange (the maximum in LN), the exchange could fund the channel with $40, committing to $37 to me and $3 to itself.
Then both me and the exchange have something at stake when misbehaving...

There are certainly things that can't be done with OP_NOP redefinition as it requires you to reuse the same stack "action".
I don't think this applies to Schnorr or any other pending update.
"Infintely easier" certainly isn't the case as there are advantages and disadvantages in using versioning instead of extension.
For one, versioning doesn't allow deprecation as older versions always exist due to the chain  being immutable. This is I guess why "extension only" was originally envisioned.
Either way, for Schnorr it isn't really relevant. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:50:23


They will not release the HF chain unless it is needed to protect against the reorg from BIP148. I think it is pretty clear.

Miners were using a minimum fee long before blocks were full as they should. A minimum fee prevents spamming and inefficient use cases of the blockchain (e.g. satoshidice).
This is why even without blocksize limit, with a reasonable minimum fee, the blocks  grows  only slowly with adoption as the demand for financial transactions is highly inelastic. People don't start doing a lot more if transaction fees go down; they do the financial transaction they need to do.

You can't top an LN channel without  on-chain transactions. Also, you can't move funds from one LN channel to another without on-chain transactions.

Satoshi already predicted in [his first answers]( that mining would be dominated by big businesses.
This in itself is no problem. Market principles don't stop when businesses are bigger.

ASICBOOST can be trivially disabled by a minor softfork. 
Coupling issues is generally a bad idea *especially* in a consensus network where the difficulty doesn't lie in development or testing but in convincing people to run your changes.

Development. In a decentralised network this entails:
* propose X
* implement X
* gain enough support for X
*Clearly* SegWit is nice but not nice enough because  otherwise not only 30% of those that mint and need to sell coins to users would be signalling this. If it increases value it increases their profit.
I don't think SegWit is all that bad myself but I understand its drawbacks and why this is happening. 
The logical follow up is to rinse-and-repeat with different proposals. BIP140 for malleability; increasing the Base block size; et al. 
The logical follow up is *not* "SegWit now; everyone who doesn't agree is a shill; miners don't matter; UASF!"

@_date: 2017-06-09 12:20:07
No. The BIP 148 nodes and miners would also reject the S blocks because they are mined upon what they consider invalid blocks. You can't have a chain with blocks from the middle.
So there will be one chain with non-segwit (70%) and SegWit-non-BIP148 (29.75%) blocks and another chain with BIP148 (0.25%) blocks.

I was explaining that miners were using a minimum fee long before blocks were full.

There has been criticism on SegWit from the start especially regarding its priority relative to a hardfork. Many of the original engineers (Gavin, Hearn, Garzik) argued  for doing a hardfork increase first.
It is up to developers to offer solutions and up to users to use them. If only 30% of the mining users (a rather important target demograph of the Core software) is willing to update, they are not *blocking it* and the logical course of action is to offer something else that they do like. Just insisting on what they *should* want isn't fruitful.
Imagine a new Firefox update with a new feature which causes only 30% of the users to download it. Can you image the CEO claiming users are *blocking* the feature?

 *Bitcoin* relies on rational economic behaviour for security.
Regardless of the full node narrative, miners can take everything for free. They can just:
* buy some stuff
* let the honest miners mine the payment and confirmations.
* meanwhile withhold the blocks with a counter payment. 
* after the goodies are in, release to undo the payment.
There is no protection against this. The attacker does not mint less coins. Not a billion full nodes can prevent it. No patches or fixes. Not more confirmations. Nothing.
The *only* thing that makes bitcoin payments secure is rational economic behaviour: miners don't want to hurt the value of the coins they mint.
This is also why the "full nodes check miners" narrative is flawed. Why on earth would an attacker benefit from creating an invalid block? Any invalid block attack is  high risk and extremely expensive. 
SPV has less privacy but it is not less secure.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:00:47
Yes. I don't think it is mandatory that both parties add to the channel.
So if I am a noob, and go to an exchange, we could open a channel with 2-2 multisig, *only* funded by the exchange. I would then have a transaction on chain shared by me and the exchange and managed by the LN channel.
However, this is also means that I can only pay others using LN *via* the exchange, as I cannot extract the funds from the channel without closing it; only send them back to the exchange. This is trustless though (using HTLC), so not really a breaking point.

Replay protection is only relevant if there is no super majority. If Gregory and Luke would never have been part of the dev team, a simple hardfork increase or a dynamic blocksize would never have been a blocked as it had wide support and would just be adopted by 100% like the 2010 HF's.


The Bitcoin Core software is intended to be used by - among others - miners. If miners are not their target audience, they don't need to listen to user requirements of miners. 


Nobody is demanding anything. As an Open Source bitcoin developer myself, I would kindly advice the Core team, to try to have a more user-oriented attitude towards producing software, as it tends to be more fruitful.

Everyone could freely choose between SegWit+HF (bit 4) or SegWit-Only (bit 1), and either one could be triggered.

The problem of quadratic scaling is that it scales with the size of the transaction. Hashing scales linearly with more transaction which is not a problem.

The reason pure greed makes bitcoin secure is because of the dual role of miners. Those that mint coins will always mint these coins with  rules that make them most valuable (=greed).

I don't think replay protection makes much sense here because the softfork will already orphan non bit 4 signalling blocks on activation.
This ensures 100% mining power is on board.

Replay protection would be kind of their problem.

This is why the limit was there. Simple spam block protection. 
Because this hurts miners the most, they can trivially solve that with a growing limit they agree upon far above usage rate.

You do realize that the only difference between a "patent" and a "defensive patent" is marketing?

I would suggest you keep the money in one of the larger exchanges.
It is very difficult to secure your own computer. Online wallets and exchanges tend to put in a lot expertise and effort in securing their systems.
I am quite knowledgeable of systems security myself, but I am not going to trust my own computer simply because I use it for too many things to be secure.
I would go for an exchange because the bigger ones (bitstamp, bitcoin.de, mtgox) have a good reputation regarding security.

Try to replace "bitcoin" with "cash" in your comment. 
Because of untaxed transactions are simply done in cash, the goverments needs to verify that *work* is taxed.
It is true that without bitcoin, we could head for a society where cash is increasingly less usable and therefore the bank accounts will become a more important machine for controlling taxes. This can is and is being used as an argument against Bitcoin.
But currently, the existence of cash  proves that the goverment doesn't need to follow the money to effectively chase tax evasion. They can follow the work.

One lesson learned for Silk Road 2.0 is to separate the vendor data from the escrow service.

@_date: 2017-06-14 09:17:30


I think you misunderstand how a decentralized network functions. Everyone should act in their own interest. There is no such thing as coercion as everyone can run whatever rules they like.
"The Bitcoin project" cannot go along with random rule changes, but everyone should make whatever random rule changes they deem interesting and use their hashpower for whatever they think gives them most profit. 
The fact that there is consensus about many rules (block validation rules) is the result of the free choice of individual users, not of "the Bitcoin project" protecting it.

Sure. But microeconomics also has this concept called "elasticity". Cash payments, and in my country, card payments, are free.
Yet I don't make more than a few a day.
Financial transactions have an extremely inelastic demand. Few people *want* to make them.
I'd say it's hard to find anything more inelastic. Even the traditional example "gasoline" seems to be more elastic.
Minimum fees are useful to price out inefficient use cases (eg satoshidice), but a "market" to keep low paying users out, is kind of odd.

There is really not much point in encrypting the password. If you want passwordless access, it has to store "something" in the application data, to provide it. 
No matter how well encrypted your password is in the appdata, if another app can somehow circumvent application sandboxing, and clone the appdata of your wallet, this will provide passwordless access. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:57:52
I see. Wouldn't it be possible to restrict public keys to a set with some strong contraints?

I am not sure I understand what you mean. If the majority of miners would reject these transactions, wouldn't that be a big incentive for other miners to also exclude these transactions?

It doesn't matter. Whatever is stored will provide passwordless access, no matter how strong it is encrypted. The application can only rely on proper sandboxing to prevent stealing access.

I already live in a social democracy (the Netherlands) with relatively high wealth redistribution, and I am not sure why Bitcoin could not become a/the main currency. 
Why would the government need total control to ensure taxes are payed?
People pay taxes because it is made difficult to work without the proper paperwork, not because bank balances are continously monitored.
Banks were supposed to be an improvement over cash. Bitcoins are a huge improvement over both, regardless of the polical system.

I understand the relation, but Bitcoin is still very interresting for those of us who lean towards more socialist or social democratic principles (like me).

I don't really buy this one-to-one relation between bitcoin and not paying taxes. Where I am from people work legally and pay their taxes for lots of reason:
- You can get a loan
- You can buy a house
- You are insured
- You can rent a house with a minimum income requirement
- You don't have to worry about the IRS. 
- You don't have to worry about labour inspection
- You get juridical protection against unreasonable treatment or discharge from you employer
- You pay for the government services you use
- You pay for the government services less fortunate people use.
- You are not doing something illegal
- You can employ someone or work for someone who insists on registration for any of the above reasons.
Of course bitcoin makes tax evasion slighly easier but most people would still prefer to earn their money properly registered.
And from the governments perspective here in the Netherlands, the banking system might help to follow the money trail but the most important vehicle against tax evasion is still labour inspection: If you are employing someone, you must have the proper paperwork. 
Bitcoin isn't going to change that.

For most things you purchase, you need to provide an address to send it to, or an identification to register it on.
If the method of theft reveals a person, and the purchases lead to the same person, there could be enough legal evidence against the thief.
There are scenarios in which the theft cannot be proven, but there are also scenarios in which it can.

My point is that the "we" will adopt smaller denominations as "we" see fit. This is not something you can decide for people. No mBTC-day or discussion is going to change it. Whatever is used is decided by those who use it.

An important point about the risk is that these are *virtual* shares. They have no official status. 
If ASICMINER decides that you don't have any shares even though you bought them, there is probably little you can do.
The shares mainly get there value from trust in ASICMINER based on past performance.
I guess that as a major risk factor in addition to the risk of the volatility of BTC itself.

I think you are to strongly making us choose a camp. Economy is not an exact science. 
Personally, I've just read Keynes main work and I find his reasoning on employment and regulation much more convincing then what I have read from Hayek and Rothbard. This does not mean at all that I think a deflationary currency is doomed; economy is way to complex to draw such conclusions.
Bitcoin is a great experiment that can teach us much more about economics then that austrian or keynesian economists have speculated about. That is why I want to be part of it.
