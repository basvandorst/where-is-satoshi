I can't wait for this to happen.

Like any honest person does.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:14:52
I wonder how much would BTC price increase if we started using Satoshis denomination instead of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:53:57
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:28:43
Just go for satoshis, eventually they’ll be worth as much as a yen. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:31:13
Not instantly, of course. But eventually, if BTC is generally used, we'd easily have hundreds of million of users, so even assuming lightning network allows nearly free and instant transactions, we still have to at least do one transaction per person on the blockchain just to open a channel.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:28:55
Yeah, but to use the Lightning Network first you need to open a channel, and that involves one transaction on the main blockchain. Now consider hundreds of million of people wanting to open channels, each of them doing at least one blockchain transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:16:31
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:33:06
In that case, it gets even worse, as if generally used we'd have billions of transactions on the blockchain per year just Lightning Network channel opening and closing related.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:10:49
I bet they will use futures instead of "real" BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:10:22
Would they or would they hold BTC futures instead?
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:47:37
And that’s one of the reasons why you have to pay attention to money supply changes, not prices changes.

So what did those 500 startups from 2014 do?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:14:44
100% is not sustainable, but USD interest rates have been high for months on Bitfinex. 
Expecting more than 100% annual returns investing in BTC isn't realistic. I hope it happens, though.
This would be a small investment, I'm not putting all my money in an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:55:12
I have been buying there for a long time, assuming the reference price (Bitstamp) was constantly updated. I can't believe such an obvious mistake is going on in one of the biggest exchanges. I must have lost so much because of this.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:33:51
Nobody knows. Don't believe those that say they do. But long term it's reasonable to expect a much higher price.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:53:02
I’m very bullish on BTC (not as much as to expect higher returns than lending USD at these rates, though), I’d just be diversifying, I’m not investing everything on BTC.
More than on returns I’m worried about risk, the Tether stuff seems so shady.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:54:47
And this is how BTC keep flowing to those that can afford holding them, the strong hands. Those that already pay their expenses with other income sources and understand BTC will still give high returns.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:11:52
Well, the price difference is about 20%, even with fees and opportunity costs of fiat flying around for some days, it's extremely profitable. Even if it takes 1 month per transaction, it's an enormous annual return. I'm more worried about whether it's actually possible or banks would close your account. I'd even consider moving to South Korea just to do this.
How would it work using altcoins? You'd need LTC (or any other cryptocurrency) to be much cheaper in one exchange than another to make it worthwhile. It doesn't make sense to sell BTC high at Bithumb if you then have to buy LTC high too to transfer them to another exchange (Litecoins are also about 20% higher at Bithumb).
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:09:46
Eventually I think people will just call "mbtc" "bitcoins". Just like lots of people call "kcal" "calories". Very long term it may make sense to talk in satoshis.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:06:48
I'm optimistic about BTC long term, but these extrapolations from past returns are just ridiculous. I hope your wishful thinking becomes reality, but I hope you aren't doing any stupid financial decisions that depend on sustained and gigantic BTC returns.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:39:19
Better for us, they keep wasting resources on shitcoins while we keep accumulating. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:16:33
But fiat would have to be sent around, as it's in fiat that there's a price difference. And then you'd need to have accounts in banks that don't mind if you are doing this activity.
Say I buy BTC for $14500 and you sell them at $18000. After that you'd send me $18000 (or say $16250 if we split the profits), and I'd send you 1 BTC. Then we do the same, I deposit $16250 and buy 1.12 BTC, while you get $18000 again, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:04:02
Not Bulgaria, but the looters that keep those BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:00:49
Just got another offer accepted. I'm offering a 0.6% premium and I'm being charged a 3.6% premium because the Bitstamp price is dropping but it isn't being updated on Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:58:23
Why would they have to buy real ones when ETF are released? The ETF could just hold futures, as it happens with other ETF.

Bitcoin is pure antifragility.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:55:25
I'm not in the US. Returns are fantastic, but I'm worried about that Tethers stuff, I don't fully understand what's going on there and whether I could end up losing my lent money because of Tethers ending up bad.
@_date: 2019-03-09 03:48:06
I wish I was “late” too instead of having bought in 2017...

It's just a matter of time. I'd expect the next "bubble" to be around the next halving. There will be lots of articles about the halving, that will make people interested in BTC again.

Printing money is already a slow and subtle default.

Leverage options? I mean investing BTC to get more BTC, not anything to do with the BTC/whatever ratio. For example, lending BTC in exchange of an interest. Investing in a company where I expect to get dividends (or profits) in BTC, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:37:34
10% discount?! What kind of fees are you charging for that currency conversion then?

No that I don't agree with him, but he keeps making extreme predictions. Non stop. For years. So sometimes he's right and therefore he seems like a guru. If he was that smart, he'd be ultra rich instead of wasting time appearing on the media.

@_date: 2018-02-12 19:59:36
Some day we'll be able to invest in the stock market with BTC. That's going to be amazing.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:29:44
Holding both Bitcoin and scam forks doesn't make much sense. Some people may be doing that, but it must be a minority. Getting say 10% extra real BTC just by moving them is too tempting.
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:18:16
"Only" 19%, such a tax haven...
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:30:36
I'd hold them in a different address, after cashing out the Bcash "gift".
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:44:19
Using satoshis is becoming increasingly necessary. Too many people don't understand BTC are divisible.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:27:48
Most of those in the 18+ months periods must be lost. Who wouldn't had moved them in exchange of free Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:36:04
That’s a Keynesian fallacy. Do you stop yourself from buying electronics because you know they will be cheaper in the future? A non (or very low) inflationary currency does encourage saving, which is fantastic. Saving is needed to invest, which ultimately increases productivity, which is what makes societies prosper.
For reference, the second half of 19th Century was one of the periods in history where productivity increased the most, while all major countries were under the gold standard.
I recommend reading Bitcoin Standard, my favourite bitcoin book.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:30:52
The main problem I think is refunds in such a volatile (for now) currency. They’d have to give refunds in fiat or if in BTC, adjusted to the current rate instead of just what was originally paid. Imagine lots of people refunding items after BTC rises a lot in the short term like recently...
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:49:04
You should had done your homework and bought BTC sooner. At $10,000 like me.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:22:19
I run Amazon businesses. So I receive fiat, and suppliers don’t accept BTC either (for now...).

And governments.
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:50:41
I did something similar, but mainly in BTC. My average buy price is around $10000. And the assets I sold to buy BTC are worth about 125% more now. It sucks but I'm still very optimistic about BTC and will buy a bit more if I can.

It will keep getting better. Lightning network, sidechains. Meanwhile, we keep getting more and more examples of how much banks, governments and fiat money suck.
