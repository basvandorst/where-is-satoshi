The new domain is wex.nz. You can search around this sub to catch up on the drama around it. Short story, they robbed mtgox, their supposed owner got arrested in Greece, some funds got seized. They returned with new domain, supposedly new owners and ~30% haircut on all balances converted to internal tokens witch you can trade for real coins currently at around 55-60%.
If you had 100ltc you got ~60ltc + ~40ltc tokens worth ~25ltc.
Prior to all that a lot of people complained that their accounts were locked after not accessing them for more than year, so expect that.
Good luck

That's cool but they also say the usual bullshit about Bitcoin needing their authoritative recognition to be considered legit.
But while ICE believes it can be the one to take bitcoin mainstream, it also says that that reality likely will not resemble the crypto-anarchist vision harbored by many early cryptocurrency adopters.
“Bitcoin can’t survive as a rogue idea,” Sprecher said in the Fortune profile. “To evolve, the cryptocurrencies need to run on established infrastructure. They need the trust and rules that have been built into our financial system for many years. They need the kind of trust that the Big Board represents.”

There is another small spike from the last hour.Can you start keeping a log.This might continue.
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:26:48
Here is my somewhat optimistic reading on the situation after rereading several times the last two documents:
Rehab program would have meant a direct restart with the same owners or at least the decision to sell and to whom would have been in their hands.That's why it was impossible before end of investigation and it was dismissed.
Liquidation still doesn't exclusively mean selling the bitcoins as many people assume.Selling the exchange business to a sponsor which will be completely different entity is also considered liquidation of assets and is not considered a rehabilitation.
The one thing i don't understand is why Sunlot Holdings assumed that we should be in rehabilitation procedure for them to buy gox.It looks like bankruptcy was in fact a needed step for that to happen.
For now the most pressing thing is to pressure the trustee to seek our opinion before discarding any offer for takeover.And i am not sure if the whole creditor meeting thing doesn't mean he is planning to do exactly that
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:29:48
I am in the same position.I spent last 2 years thinking about projects and trying to get developer friends to look deeper into crypto, when bitcoin took off it made them possible to execute so i started prepairig for responsibilities like that and now my wings are cut and don't know what to do.It is gut-wrenching and i can't believe how can people just say things like "digital darwinism", "you deserved it cause you were there only for speculating","new better era after gox".For f***s sake it was the only exchange for most of the time we were into bitcoin,it was just a habit to use them as a wallet,it was difficult to care for your coins alone and it was the most reputable place in the industry for years.Looks like there is no interest whatsoever from the notable people in the community to try and help us understand what happened.They just want to erase that from the history and move on promoting their businesses.

I agree 100% with what you said about Oliver.
But Sunlot has clarified their offer and it includes distribution of the remaining bitcoins as soon as possible on top of the % of profits.This was not apparent the first time it surfaced and i even believe that there are people with vested interests (again possibly Oliver) who were leading us to believe trough GoxDox site that Sunlot just wants to keep them.
Distributing remaining bitcoin + share of 50% of future income is the only win-win outcome.Ofcourse nobody will want to take huge risk (500mln) and i don't want them to,just trying is an option.It looks like at least they will cover the audit expenses and we will have more communication what is happening,while the trustee needs months just to put a claiming form and we have less clarity even than before,when Karpeles was in charge.

Another 85k spike in 800 transactions broadcasted by gox api,2 hours ago.At bottom of this post links to archives for whoever can follow them
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:38:37
I hear you man.The two reasons i never did anything are that i have heard many more stories of people cutting themselves out of their cold wallets,many of people who's blockchain.info wallets was drained(you still have to worry for millions of way your pc could be compromised) and none of a person losing anything in gox.
It was assumable that they can care better for a cold storage than me and it still is beyond belief how can they loose more than a hot wallet.That's way i would like to see the community more involved in investigating it.If we just assume you should not keep anything on an exchange there will be no liquidity on the market.
I understand everything you are saying,it was just escape from responsibility and i never got around to making myself comfortable doing this myself.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:37:11
This is a great idea,I'm in and willing to give my 100% working time if it can be of any help.I don't understand why this letter is not receiving enough attention.There are hundreds of thousands longterm bitcoin peole who lost everything they were working for in the last 3 years.I guess the new crowd and the big VC's are only interested in the fresh money.They are not interested in this happening because it will create a business with a million people behind it which will be a massive force hard to compete with.
Gox will still have a lot of value as a brand after a positive story like this and customer acquisition which value will be lost if we just settle for the crumbs left in the bank accounts.
I hope someone who knows how this can happen is really making steps for this to be put in front of Mark and the notable people in the community.Maybe we need a website for coordinating this effort and promoting it within the interested parties
Thank you for your efforts.

Maybe you are right about the liquidation word but i don't think bankruptcy,which is the current status,menas that
@_date: 2014-04-24 13:13:02
Solvency can be formally achieved if creditors agree to take shares for their holdings.And Sunlot has said that they could even offer some form of total compensation for the people who want to get out,just not before they have audited everything.
Avoiding selling the remaining coins is on the cards even according to the people who were pushing for liquidation and burying of everything (anarchystar).

There is another small spike in the graph from the last hour,~1k coins.Is there someone tracking gox api in continuously cause apparently there is no log.

Can someone comment on this development

Yes,established people from the community should get more involved in this situation and not just throw him under the bus.Now after everything is official there is no risk of association with criminal activity which might have been their fear till now.There might be some things he can say only in person.

So this is the most interesting part for me: 
"Assets:(2) BTC account
This is considered as property by considering the value of the bitcoins. At the time of this statement, approximately 901 million JPY worth of bitcoins."
"Liabilities:(2) BTC temporary receipt - 901,952,870 yenr
In the same amount of money, a there is a current assets account
(3) Deposits 5,502,576,538 yen"
What are these "BTC temporary receipt" that are equal to their btc assets and amount to only 9mln$
The depostits sum is close to what they were reporting as fiat liabilities.

From what i understood gmaxwell said the big transaction is not still pending because it is already in the blockchain.
It's all discussed in

Yes,but one of the possible outcomes.Bankruptcy is just a formal status.Full tilt was also in bankruptcy.
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:57:28
I was looking at it everyday and the graphs never stopped changing,but only with 1-2 small transactions/day.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:19:59
You are wrong, the vast majority of people wanted the remaining bitcoins distributed as is. 
There was an official poll by the trustee just a couple of months after bankruptcy commencement. 
There was also motion to prevent them from selling anything. 
There was two rehabilitation plans at the very beginning, backed by big percentage of creditors, which aimed to do exactly that (distribution of remaining coins) but were not approved by court. 
Nobody was going to receive more by converting to USD at anytime since selling such amount would always be at below market prices, no matter at 200 ot 20 000. Only recently (september) the trustee has expressed intention to sell coins which prompted ~1000 creditors to chip in and start legal action - mtgoxlegal.com
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:43:15
No, he's selling coins owned by 20 000 old-timer creditors, some of them even core devs, to a handful of finex insiders who know when big amounts of fresh coins or money enter or exit the exchange.

Why are so many bagholders reading r/bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:16:45
What you probably are looking at are the breadcrumbs of the February transactions, after they were transferred out of the consolidated address. Buyers can do whatever they like with their coins.
The current 16k are sitting consolidated in the same address where the previous big chunk of 24k was, before transferred out in different chunks.

@_date: 2017-07-11 11:13:03
I just want to point out that "Willy" is just a buzzword used by the people who push this version of the events for easier digestion by the masses, not an official name and none of the information in the so called "Willy report" is discussed in that trial. The trial is about $4m Karpeles withdrew from customers funds.
Time has passed and i'm a bit removed from this matter but from my research on the Gox database at the time the most probable purpose of those famous bots was conversion between the different fiat currencies the site supported. Sums and times of trades correlated in different currencies on different accounts. 
 
Another fact to ponder on is that two of the founding members of the organisation pushing this explanation (WizSec) are Daniel Kelman and Emil Oldenburg who both are [working for Roger Ver]( The third one, J. Maurice was the guy who helped him [when he got hacked]( Nowadays Roger's fishiness escapes only people with aligning to his agenda. But back in the day he was the bitcoin Jesus and made  [that famous video reading from a script](
Seven months later he made [another video]( in which he makes sure to throw Karpeles under the bus (something all the parties with things to hide in Gox really really want), mentions his bigblocker buddy Barry Silbert's new exchange and as a true visionary even pushes a line about Ethereum, the favourite pumping toy of the the big blockers.
You might also remember the same people campaigning with dirty rumours against the Brock Pierce's effort to rehabilitate the exchange and shortly after coming up with their own takeover idea led by OKCoin - another entity who is currently in the big block camp. *last statement corrected in the replies 
Consider also the possibility that the so called "MtGox protest" did not help us in any way but could have been the public culmination of an attack against Gox by competing parties or people with dealings that need to be buried with Gox.
Another possible angle of misinformation is fiat holders against btc holders.
TL;DR: Please have some critical thinking, check history, check facts, check connections between people, don't let yourselves be led by the nose. There is a lot of history buried in Gox. The whole first 3-4 years of Bitcoin pricing was happening there. Fortunes were made and maybe some of the history needs to be rewritten. There are a lot of people pushing their agendas from the moment Gox got bankrupt. Check how they tie in to each other and you will find interesting connections.

I stand corrected. It was an impression i got from something i read a few weeks ago but i'm not sure exactly what it was. 
Searching now about their stance i find those relevant articles:
[they are supporting segwit2x] (
[they and Huobi are the only two of the big exchanges who are ready to support a Jihan coin parralel to a Core one] (
But i was under the impression that i read about a tighter connection between them and the /btc crowd.
Then again they severed their ties with Ver a couple of years ago so maybe they are cool now.

I've seen those but nothing shows they are seized. I would expect the authorities would move them or lose them to an accomplice. For a moment thought there is new official information.
