In my opinion bitstamp is the best.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:05:08
Yea, I suppose so.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:37:11
Why would it fall because of that? Regulation is good
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:31:25
They dont, but there are bots that do it for them, it is call arbitrage.

I sometime imagine some guy eating his Chinese food and move over mouse cursor to selloff button, then he press it, all the hell got loose and price drops, and he just continue to eat :)

Well, it seems somebody wanted price to stay low, and when someone buy that wall, the other side is left without ammunition
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:48:07
Agreed, but somebody is behind the bots and telling them what to do.

To me it looks like bulls are trying to buy as many btc at this low price. I think it is a good sign. There is a good support level, and they stir it up every now and then so that you would get FOMO and buy it back at higher price :)
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:28:30
Ok, and we have passed it :)

400 btc sell wall on bitstamp...this will be interesting...
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:44:56
to be frankly, I did not expect that :(
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:26:29
I know there is no reason to FUD...
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:15:38
If anything, past has showed that when media say buy, you sell, and vice versa :) So this is a good sign :)

I think 10k i well defended on bitstamp
Current 10153;
bid wall: 32 at -53(10100)/total 150 BTC;
bid wall: 41 at -65(10088)/total 224 BTC;
bid wall: 49 at -87(10066)/total 332 BTC;
bid wall: 38 at -87(10066)/total 370 BTC

This is definitely coordinated attack on price of bitcoin. You see a price below certain point and just as it drops a sell wall shows up with 50 btc. Somebody wants a price down.
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:00:58
This will be interesting, on Bitstamp there is a sell wall with 159BTC
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:49:11
Yea, I am also afraid to trade, because it could go high every second, and you would be left in dust :) but when I see sell orders of 10-15 btc, it reminds me of last 1 month, so maybe I overreacted :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:16:44
I know :(
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:09:44
What is the FUD today? Seems like a selloff :(
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:41:10
same is on bitstamp
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:11:18
So, it was a bull trap :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:14:10
Does anyone know when today futures settles? What is the final score, how much did they bet it will bi higher or lower? 
Thank you

Why do you think it is a scam? I looked it up, and it seems legit.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:07:30
I suppose last Friday of the month is near :(
