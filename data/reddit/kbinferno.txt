So here's my game plan:
1. Save bitaddress.org as a file
2. Transfer that file to a computer that doesn't go online
3. Run to get private key
4. Connect to printer and print paper wallet
Is step 2 necessary?

Or they could convert all its BTC to fiat, then crash Litecoin with a 51% attack, people will freak out and leave BTC, then buy back in. Same result, but I think Bitcoin could recover in the public eye if LTC was attacked. Otherwise, by crashing BTC, you lose a lot of the folks who aren't tech savvy (those who say "what if it happens again?" even though it may be fixed in the future, they are prob out for good)

As far as I understand it, think of it like a post-office mail sorter. Bitcoin comes through the system and gets sorted in different boxes (public keys).. your private key is what opens the other side and lets you retrieve.

Would anybody be willing to talk me through the creation of a paper wallet? I'm sure there are really secure ways of doing it (new computer not connected, booting Electrum from a CD) but I'm looking for a method that is secure and I could explain to family members. I'd consider myself savvy to a point but paper wallets are ridiculously over my head.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:24:06
How do you create a secure paper wallet with those? Does that still require the live boot CD/etc? I've been procrastinating making a paper wallet for months.. it might be a few mBTC but it's about time I get over the confusion of making a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:03:39

Thank you, I'll tinker with this as soon as I finish moving.
I plan to buy Bitcoins in regular intervals. Would keeping a seperate paper wallet per purchase be a better way to store the Bitcoins, or would it not matter vs one or two paper wallets with 1btc or so each?

I remember having issues with the Coinbase wallet. Two come to mind. First, when sending Bitcoin, sometimes the transaction would not show up on the blockchain for awhile after, and sometimes Blockchain would show the transaction as verified when Coinbase would list it pending for longer. Second, when receiving Bitcoin, Coinbase would not show the additional amount, or a log entry for the transaction, while Blockchain showed verified. I'm on mobile so I cannot experiment, but do you (or anyone else) know if these issues has been fixed? These killed using Coinbase as a wallet, for me.
And anyways, wouldn't a Blockchain.info wallet be better to use, since I have to confirm with an email before logging in, then type in a text to my phone, *then* type in a second password when I try to send BTC?
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:57:43
So the seed and such that I just created are "useless" right now in terms of security?

I like to make fun investments, and Bitcoin caught my eye. Your argument here was the biggest barrier to buying in for me, but Henry Ford's "If I had asked my consumer's what they wanted..." quote keeps me believing that there is going to be a more technological future, and systems today aren't the final step. I decided to invest into a savvy problem-solving community that continues to innovate. My bet was that the consumer's experience with Bitcoin will improve before the community gives up on it.

Seals shouldn't be used as a wallet. Just use their deposit address to put money onto it. Withdraw to your own Blockchain or Bitcoin-qt wallet and do your transactions from there.
The QR code they give you doesn't "access your wallet". It's probably very confusing to think of it as a wallet.

@_date: 2013-04-24 23:30:32
I personally have never had a bad experience with Coinbase. Actually today I was talking about Bitcoins in person and said how I usually chime into Coinbase threads telling people to put their pitchforks down or at least step back and evaluate. I don't think Fred is cherrypicking transactions to reverse for personal gain. But I'm naive, who knows really. 
Now I'm beginning to think everyone should use Coinbase knowing that there's a chance that your transaction will be reverted. I still stand by Coinbase with multiple deposits, and withdraws, with no problems yet. But srsly wtf. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:30:16
You could send without a transaction fee, that's about it. I think I tried that with SatoshiCircle and was able to play with my funds before the confirmation. But idk.
Transaction fees are not necessary, your transaction just gets higher priority to be processed. Sending without is fine, as over time your transaction will gain priority. However, I don't have a source for that info.

So your inadequate servers turned a small sell-off into a big panic? Ridiculous. I'm upvoting this because it's a statement that people should see but I personally will not be using your site.
Think of the damage this event will cause to Bitcoin's reputation. It was easy to argue that the "20% drop due to hackers" last week was nothing since at the end of the day, Bitcoin traded higher.
But this is completely different. The media has "bubble" written everywhere, which has spooked many holders. Your servers caused a lot of people to pull the trigger and we as a community have to put our foot in our mouths before we even think of trying to tell anyone that this wasn't a crash.

Hey, you and I together have a 1Gh/s hash rate. I have 55% while you have 45% of our total. Let's agree that if one of us strikes it rich, we will split it depending on our contribution. I'll get 13.75btc and you will get 11.25btc regardless of who actually solves the block.

@_date: 2013-04-29 20:47:27
No but with more Bitcoin exposure, and more transactions happening, there will be more fees to claim. Not to mention with more transactions, you may want to include a larger fee in the future.

There are so many unrealistically small threats to your person and health every day when you trust in cars and such that if you are afraid of getting an owned Bitcoin key then you should never ever step foot in a vehicle again.

You've made too assumptions in your post. Who said he has put money in it? He's actively seeking to understand something, I wouldn't hate on him for that. Also, this is less "putting money" into something and more supporting an idea. There is no problem owning it while still understanding it.

I feel as if the odds are partitioned a little bit.. "sloppy". We have 100% to work with, and a 1.5625% of an instant "loss", even though the gem resets and we still make something back because somebody will buy it after it resets. But for this I'll consider that to be an absolute loss. I feel as if it should be:
    (0.984375 - Prob_NoBuyer)*1.1x - .015625x + [Prob_NoBuyer*0]

1. Enable two-factor authentication. This will send you a confirmation code each time you want to log in to your account. Pretty good security. In Blockchain's settings, you can mess around with the auto-log off features to make it less inconvenient (by default you are locked out of your wallet after 10 minutes of inactivity, that means a new text/email with a confirmation code each 10 minutes).
2. Enable a second password. This is decent security as well, which forces you to type in a different password when sending funds out of your wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-08 16:50:11
I'm thinking that before I fully trust it running while I'm AFK, I'll have it run while I'm studying.. I ran a test program once, that spit out your hashes and average BTC/day, but I was too ignorant to understand the data, although right away the fans did kick on. I'd have no problem replacing anything that would end up broken, if I knew how to replace stuff.

I just can't get behind comp sci.. writing simple programs for class was easy to me but I do not understand how do to anything with the Raspberry Pi. A few weeks ago someone posted a Bitcoin ticker that ran off of Pi with a slight outline on how to do it, but by the time I was finished googling key words and directions, then searching for more definitions in the definitions, I was lost. I wish I was more interested in comp sci so that projects like this would be more "This looks fun! I can't wait to learn how to do this!" and less overwhelming and stressful.
tl;dr: It's more about my lack of interest, not lack of motivation.

I don't know if you'll find any even-money gamble sites. Here's a few that I know of, with a brief word:
Very user-friendly and simplistic. Each line of betting has the same EV, aka in the long run it won't matter which odds you bet. You send BTC to your preferred address, and you receive a transaction back: either your winnings or a small fraction of your bet, signaling a loss.
Fairly new, recently posted here on The webpage has a deposit address, you simply send funds to it and gamble away. Each time you spin, the wheel lands on a multiplier, and it pays out exactly how you'd expect it to. 
If you have Minecraft, you could try this out. Click "Multiplayer" and connect to the server "mc.bitvegas.net", without the quotes of course. Every 15 minutes, you receive for free **1 mBTC**. Linked above is simply a referral link from me, where I receive 5 mBTC if you decide to play :P
At BitVegas there is Roulette, Blackjack, Pig Racing, and a game called Minefield, where there are 25 blocks and you win BTC as you break safe blocks. The game ends when you either cash out or hit one of three TnT.
Has most of your standard casino games: Blackjack, Roulette, Craps, Slots, Video Poker. Nothing too much to say about this one, but the website is clean and organized. I'll probably throw a few mBTC on here and check it out if a rainy day comes.
Think Full Tilt poker, but with Bitcoins. I haven't played it *yet*, but as a past FTP reg and a Bitcoin junkie, you'll find me there shortly. Because of that though, I can't comment on the client or anything about it, except for I know there are a handful of tables running constantly. No HUD support, but I think PokerTracker will jump on board if Bitcoins gain some "legitimacy" [(source + Admin reply on Page 2 dated 3/28/2013)](
The unit used is 1 SC, which equals out to be 1mBTC. So with a 1 BTC deposit, you'll receive 1000 SC. The games start at 1/2 and you can find NLHE &amp; Omaha along with your Sit n' Go's and various tourneys.
Also, on the (promotion page)[ there are details involving Rakeback and freerolls. There seems to be an hourly freeroll that can be useful to check if the client is to your liking before your deposit.

Thanks for the demo! And this actually brings me to another question I had but didn't know I had it until know. If I receive bitcoins on my computer, and then do a transaction in person using an App or something else, does that mean I have two different wallets? Is there a way to have all of my wallets viewable from one program? Before I start to get my feet wet with Bitcoins, would I have to decide whether or not to use the Bitcoin client or the Blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:08:22

Short: Transaction fees.
In-person: There are a lot of transactions happening at once, and to get yours processed you would send a transaction fee, to mark it as a priority. If you don't, it'll take awhile and cause inconvenience, especially if you were trying to, say, pay for a meal. Even now it takes hours for a transaction to go through without a fee. Something something current trend continues, more transactions, more fees for miners to scoop.

Also, if I put in my Coinbase Private Key for it to deposit to if I get anything, but I make another transaction with Coinbase using that key and it gives me a new one, and I don't change it in any miners, what would happen if it tried to send it to the old private key?

Some other questions I had but not sure if it's effective to edit into the OP:
When people tip other people bitcoins in reddit posts, what is actually happening? I see it most of the time in and I do notice on the sidebar some NSFW tipping subreddits. How does it go from kbinferno to my wallet to keys and such to your wallet which is linked to your reddit account? And how does the bitcointip bot get into the mix?
I ran a Java thing that tested my computer settings to see what I would net a day mining, and it came out to be roughly 22 cents a day. What is a way to understand the mining process, as someone who doesn't use Bitcoins? For the miners who have computers made for these kinds of things, what do they net?
How are Bitcoins said to have $X value? What's determining their trade rate? This might be a question answerable by general investing principles, or something specific to Bitcoins, but I'm not sure.

A function is defined mathematically as a mapping of points from one set ("Domain") to another ("Range"). So, f:D-&gt;R is a function if
* All x in the domain map to no more than one y in the range
This is just definition of function, bro. There's not really a proof unless you wanted to do a counter-example:
    Suppose the graph is a function. Then for each x in the domain, there must be no more than one corresponding y in the range. So take the 1st of May, which is an element of the domain. This maps to two y. But we said the graph was a function. This is a counterexample. Hence the graph is not a function.

He just doesn't see it as anything bigger than a payment system, which is fine. That means he is just doing his job as a moderator to the best of his knowledge. How about we educate him instead of being aggressive? Then he would see out point of view: Bitcoin is a _technology_.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:36:50
Unfortunately no. Functions are limited to zero or one outputs for the input. For example, ln(-1) will return zero outputs. There is not a function in R^2 that will return two values.
If you look at your example of y^2 = x, remember that we need to actually look at y = (+/-)sqrt(x), and although each + and - are functions of y, both together at once is not a function.

Yes, well kinda. You could "redeem" them all for 1btc each, but these are the 1st edition ones created by Casascius and are worth more if sold on eBay or Bitmit. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:17:23
I know that no matter what pool you're in, you'll receive the same BTC in the long run. It'll just depend if you receive dust every week or strike rich once a year. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:52:43
How long until you could get Bitcoins with that cash? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 16:41:45
I definitely agree with you. I don't know what I'd do if the value went back down to $35 by the time Coinbase verifies my account.. I think I'd just buy a bitcoin a week.
@_date: 2013-06-24 01:57:35
I made a few bitcoins on Seals and instead of cashing them out, I'd rather have fun mining, even though I know the breakeven period would be months and months. If ASIC will only sell these in bulk, where would I go to buy singles? What are some of the precautions I would need to take for plugging a bunch of these into a hub?
Either way I'll probably wait until they come down in price a bit, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask now!

I used Bitfloor on Friday, had no problems, funds were available by the time I got home. Just make sure to fill out everything correctly.

I learn so many neat things from this subreddit. I wish more interpretations were posted, or maybe somebody could do a daily/weekly post or something on trends.
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:57:35
I think having the bounty in the title is a definite. No one values the answer quite like the person who found it, and it'll be up to them if it's worth the bounty.

Did you really get off so much at flaunting to others how much you think you know about security that you made a link post to your comments? Holy shit.

Ohhh right, I didn't enable it on this account. Forgot about that. Poop.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:36:51
Nah, try to send with custom without a fee, it'll ask if that's what you want to do, click "continue without fee".

I always was a supporter of that symbol. I don't care if some devices don't support it, or it's hard to use. Bitcoin suffers from the same problem! I feel like it embodies it well.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:48:20
I had trouble using Coinbase because their servers need to do stuff before it confirms, taking a bit of time. It would probably just be better to withdraw the coins to Bitcoin-qt or Blockchain imo.
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:21:19
Probably because it's the official (?) client, and having fees hard-coded in is a way to feed the nodes. It's been .0005 forever, it's only now that such a fraction is worth something we can comprehend as value (pennies).
I wish it was like Blockchain, where you can specify the fee amount. I've been sending transactions with .0001 fee hoping that it becomes the new fee standard.

Every time I hear about first bits, I check the website and it is always down. How can I find the firstbits of an address?
@_date: 2013-07-28 17:58:36
So how do these work? You just plug them into a hub and do what?
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:44:28
I personally think we'll get a lot more users with a subreddit theme and some flair. Make it a little more like a subreddit that homes a quarter-thousand people.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:15:50
Right, you'd only tax the profits, but I didn't know you could do something with losses. How does that work out?

I went to Bank of America today at 1pm EST, deposited ~1k, it showed up in my account before I got home. Can verify (somehow) if needed.

Thank you. I'm not sure why I got some downvotes but I'm not rustled, I'm glad you appreciated my feedback. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 10:15:09
Don't be so narrow-minded. BTC price is not the only indicator of it's success.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:30:50
How thick are they? Do you use them as a key chain or to keep in your wallet? How do I know if my device is NFC compatible?

Misspelled, not even the context of the meme, decided not to go with a bottom caption.
All-in-all a pretty poor post to this subreddit.

I speculate that if "End Times" were to come, Bitcoin would still be popular although to a niche crowd. It will be just like it was in 2009-2011; holders will use BTC for Silkroad and gambling sites.
But perhaps there is a darker future, one where laws against crypto-currencies are passed. If outlawed, then it may just be gg.

I like it, but I'm pro-choice. You may lose pro-life interest.

Ugh, this makes me sick just reading.. I'm so sorry to hear this happened to you dude..
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:46:36
eh, I'll be alright. I have no need for addresses which have public private keys broadcasted.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:30:21
I have a hard time understanding paper wallets (but understand private and public keys)..
So would I just buy this paper and trust that you don't have a list of all of private keys, then fund the wallet with the public key? Then whenever I want the funds, I can import the private key?
Is this a product where I am given a template of sorts, and print my own paper wallet?
What happens when you import a private key? What happens to their balances and such? I guess this is another concept I don't quite understand either..

It would be pretty neat if the loop was changed to be a mobius strip.

Isn't this a little complex for the average Bitcoin user?
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:50:18
Have you checked the percentages recently? BTCGuild handled it. Also it's only bad if BTCGuild and all of it's nodes perform a malicious attack. Just because they have 51% doesn't mean it's instantly GG.
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:39:32
Same issue unfortunately as the other guy.

In a triangle ABC, the greater angle lies opposite the greater side and the greater side lies opposite the greater angle; i.e., AB &gt; BC if and only if angleC &gt; angleA.
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:18:27
But then wouldn't I know those coins went to that blockchain account, and hold them responsible?

Mmmm I want a gold and a silver one now.

From what other people have talked about, I think you only report it when it becomes cash back to you. Then it would be capital gains the way you described.

If I have X bitcoins in Blockchain, does it matter if I have them all under one address or (X/10) coins spread over ten addresses?

Full Tilt Poker said the same thing.

I thought that too, don't worry. It clicked for me when ListenToBitcoin had to connect to MtGox to get it's transaction data for sounds.

I never had a problem with Coinbase. Except sometimes you can't buy cause they're all out of stock.
