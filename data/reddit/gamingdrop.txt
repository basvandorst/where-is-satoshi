This is the percentage based on the number of of respondents based on their country. In other words.... this survey and the results mean nothing.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:20:42
But where were these respondents from? If they were off the street there still could be extreme bias, let alone a crypto forum.

Not when 1 sat = 1 in USD

I used ATM to circumvent KYC. If you are willing to enter your data, it’s not worth using ATMs. There’s a few with lower fees (my best is $1 fixed and 5.2% on top) but seeing nearly $10 gone instantly just feels like a setback. Wouldn’t recommend if you have another way to buy.

Why is this a thing

Only way to find out if Twitter is from the future is to wait I suppose.

You’re asking a bitcoin sub. I think there’s some bias.
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:08:31
Or at least the people that are buying are being very vocal about it on reddit.

*awhile* in the crypto space means every 5 minutes right...?

Funny thing is if he actually succeeded (he won’t), the coin would become completely worthless. He would be the only holder... forever... Everyone would lose their money, but he would too. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:31:56
That’s a golden cross if I’ve ever seen one.
@_date: 2019-02-05 01:22:01
Hey I work there too! Don’t work that many hours but definitely hodl friend. Making these subs isn’t a lifestyle.

+1. Never share how much you are buying and how much you have. If you want to talk about investing speak in terms of percents. 100% bitcoin could be any amount of it.
@_date: 2019-02-17 01:40:46
You said it was exponential. Now I understand.
@_date: 2019-10-16 19:29:46
You can use your losses against your gains in the US. So it makes sense to report every transaction.

It’s because the creator announced MW (MimbleWimble)is probably coming to the coin... which made everyone go crazy as that would (could) make LTC the highest cap privacy coin.

*parabolically x^2 =/= 2^x. Either your quote is wrong or you are. ��

I just leave CMC open on my phone and computer *at all times*.
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:52:14
I laughed so hard. This could be thing in the future.

KYC stops fiat at least in the US. Depending on your laws you may have to resort to using a parent’s identity.

Crypto ATM. Google it.

*sells bitcoin for wow gold* then *sells wow gold for usd*... if only tax evasion was this easy

They can update the code to include micro satoshis. Sure the fees wouldn’t make it worthwhile but the *can* do it.
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:17:13
That’s a possible unit. Micro in general means smaller.
@_date: 2019-09-07 15:44:55
Or even smaller than that
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:54:46
The big question here. Will WWlll start because of bitcoin?

That’s a really long Ethernet cord

@_date: 2018-12-14 02:21:47
*the fees*

I got one of those too. Except I stopped losing Coinbase over a year ago... I was very happy and surprised :)
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:12:50
Depends on the size
