ye HLOD until the time you have to admit that you could have diversified some btc into altcoins with more promising prospect. HLOD does not apply to BTC right now at all, with obvious pitfall of high txn fee, sociability issue and much more. Of course it WAS consider the gold standard in cryto currencies, but with it being on the future exchange, its not at more. I'd rather choose XMR or ETH as my main stake for HLODing.

It's the sensational and baseless propaganda such as this turns general bitcoin advocates into a group of ignorant imbeciles in the eyes of anyone with basic understanding of economy.

Just reading the title, I don't see anything wrong with calling Bitcoin an experiment. It's neither a positive nor negative remark.

If there is a global currency it will not be decentralized like bitcoin in any way. The financial giants will want some control over it. Humans are greedy by nature, the rich and political entities will not want to lose their financial gain by giving control to people. 
For example, why was Euro created ? One reason is to make trades among EU members more fluid and the other is said to counter balance the powerful US dollar influence in the global currency market.  While the European Central Bank is immune to politics from individual countries, there are downsides to Euro as well. If there is a globally recognized and traded currency, it will be regulated and monitored by a neutral entity. Decentralized currency in a modern world just doesn't offer much promises in the long-term. The most successful and sustainable decentralized currencies I could really think of are from ancient times when sea shells, gold and silver nuggets are traded for life essentials.

They probably have given a lot thought about solar flare, somehow they are still stuck on routing problems for large scale adaptation of bitcoin.

If all electronics are fried, the society will go backward a couple decades (to be optimistic) would you run to nearest supermarket to grab milk and bread to survive or try to convince people to sell their life essentials in exchange for your overly-valued bitcoin ?

Well, I keep some. And I know people who keep their asset in cash some if them just don't trust banks and others just prefer that way. If the bank goes dark, at least some people end up with some cash and the government will go back to gold standard to stave off inflation. 
The people with bitcoin simply end up with nothing, since all your fancy ledgers are stored digitally.

We don't tolerate reasonable discussion here sorry. \s

Exposure and the hype created the btc rall and that's it.

Bitcoins daily volume is nothing when compared to currency trading.

It's funny when you worded it out like that, but not so much when you realize it's the hodlers that are drunk on their crypto dream while the sober manipulator laughing all the way to the bank.

Isn't btc a decentralized currency ? How come it seems more volatile relative to stock market ? It's not like BTC's performance is heavily tied to the trade deal ?
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:12:24
Why ? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:01:58
Any Poloniex staff here ?

    lol
"sell out and leave" seriously ? 
all you could do is make BTC crowd seem more of a cult and less of a friendly community. Yeah even at 500USD per coin it is still considered valuable, but the volatility is what prevents BTC from becoming mainstream and useful to the general public, yeah but who gives a fuck.
