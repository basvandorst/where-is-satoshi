You should probably read some guides about buying and storing bitcoin. If you make a mistake you could lose your money.

Right, except he can and he is. You're just subjectively dismissing his contribution because of a standard that you created.
Your standard is flawed because it ignores the fact that someone with a lot of experience could have either just created a Reddit account, or has had an account for years, and created a new account because he doesn't want people who associate his other account with his identity to know that he's been hodling for years.
Another reason that your standard is flawed is that it would give someone credibility because of the age of their account even though they don't deserve it. For example, a user whose account is 6 years old, but who's almost exclusively posted in video game subreddits. I guess that user has more credibility when discussing currency and technology because their account is older?

Not sure, lower than coinbase to buy. Transferring is a whole other issue related to how bitcoin works.

It's "safe" in the sense that you will get your bitcoin at the price quoted, but it's not a great option for various reasons. The fees are high compared to other exchanges, and they have system outages when there is a lot of activity. 
I've been using gemeni and I'm pretty happy with it. It took about a week to get verified.
There's always the risk that an exchange will have some kind of problem or get hacked, so it would be best to get a wallet to store your bitcoin after you buy it.

He could have had Reddit for years, and decided to make an account dedicated for a specific purpose only 3 days ago. I don't see how the age of his Reddit account has any bearing whatsoever on his credibility
