Microsoft and other companies just need to  Integrate other crypto payment solutions with quicker confirmation times. VTC BCash Just to name a few. But the fluctuating price will be continue to be a challenge

very good play right before CME. He can buy back cheaper after it’s shorted. �� Isn’t it convenient that JP Morgan is now saying that Bitcoin is a good Store of wealth aka the new gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:21:57
Happy for you! Buy back after CME shorts BTC 
Anyone who is butt hurt doesn’t understand that this is a legit possibility 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:25:42
It’s the only way the current system can control bitcoin and they want to make money off it. 
Short it so they trade futures make money then buy it low then pump it. 
Making money both ways ��

Can anyone tell me why BCH is moving up 75% ...Is it just new money making it go up? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:51:56

Thanks for explaining the mempool but when a transaction is made for goods it is made on chain and limited to a certain number? 
Also, since central banks can essentially print money then wouldn't the expensive gamble not apply to them?
Appreciate the input

If there is money to be made JP Morgan and other big banks will be there. It doesn't matter if it's bitcoin or drug money from cartels. At the end of the day all that matters is the profit.
