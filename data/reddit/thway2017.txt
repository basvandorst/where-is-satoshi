So I recently got on the bandwagon and bought Bitcoins via Coinbase. After buying them, I transferred my coins into the wallet on my phone. I mainly bought Bitcoins to use more as a form of investment rather than to buy and sell things. In order to get a possible return on investment, would I have to just buy Bitcoins and hold them for a long time?

That too, I agree.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:47:04
Wow.... OK. That place is interesting....
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:43:33
I see.

Speaking of all this, what's the beef between here and r/BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:24:10
If you buy Bitcoins using your bank account, it'll take 5-6 days. However, if you use your debit or credit card, the transaction is instantaneous and will appear in your Coinbase account immediately. 
That's what happened to me. I bought some using my bank account and the transaction said it would take 6 days to process, whereas with my card, it showed up immediately, and I was able to transfer them to my offline wallet afterwards.

I'm new too. 
You may buy, but because you're still in school, limit yourself to small amounts like $10, $20, $50, $100, etc. The fundamental advice is to not spend more than what you're willing to lose (i.e If you feel uncomfortable losing $1,000, then DO NOT invest 1,000). Money could be used for things that directly affect your schooling or lifestyle on/off campus, so be wary.
Other than that, read up on cryptocurrencies in general and read everything here as well.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:14:29
Yeah, pretty much.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:24:30
I'm fairly new as well.
Just google the different forms of crypto. There's a handful of them. I believe the subreddit r/Cryptocurrency is for general discussion on the different currency types.  However, for Bitcoin, I'd start here: 
The short version of tips I can give is:
1.) Choose a wallet - It's highly recommended to secure your coins in a wallet. There's different types of wallets; paper wallets, hardware wallets, mobile phone wallets, etc. As soon as you get Bitcoins stashed into them, BACK UP YOUR WALLET. Keep the addresses in a safe place.
2.) Buying Bitcoins - There's likely different exchanges to buy them from, but the most common one is Coinbase ( . If you link your bank account and financial cards, you can get started in buying BTC. Buying with your cards will process transactions faster than buying with a checking account.
But yeah, I'd still do a lot of reading on the aforementioned links I posted.

I see, thanks.

I see, thanks.

Don't know the exact profit as I've been continually buying more over these past few months, but back then, I had a little over $200 worth of coins. Now they're worth over $800.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:46:45
Don't have a ridiculous amount, content with just one though.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:49:37
I see....
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:34:43
Interesting, such a feature would make me lean towards a Ledger. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:26:12
Oh you sly person you....

I'm the token black dude.... :/

1.) Sign up for an account on an exchange. Coinbase, Bitrex, Kraken. Add debit or credit card.
2.)Get a wallet. Desktop wallets stored on your computer (Exodus, etc.) have a recovery seed. **Keep that seed on paper and store it in a safe place.** Other alternative, get a hardware wallet. Trezor, Ledger Nano, etc.
3.) As soon as you buy Bitcoin off of the exchanges, **move them to the aforementioned wallets**. It's safer than keeping in on the exchange due to possible hacking, security breaches, etc.
4.) Profit.

I'd have to look for myself.
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:22:26
It simply means to hold on to your coins. In other words, don't sell them, exchange them, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:07:12
Agreed. Not perfect, but I like Shopify.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:44:20
My mistake guys, I've never seen this as a payment option until now. I'd been using Paypal and Shopify's payment system to accept payments.
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:32:20
It is, for us on the site!
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:00:19
You don't, just keep holding.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:46:42
Cool, your welcome!

My coins were worth $100 a couple of days ago. Now, thanks to the run, it's at 108.69.

Same, I'm 25. Paid off my student loans back in August after 2 years. Have both a 401k and a Roth IRA. Only difference is that crypto is roughly 2% of my total portfolio. Maybe I'll increase my exposure.
Like you though, I too am excited for Bitcoin's growth. For once, I feel like an early bird investing in something like this.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:46:31
I'm now finding out that it is, but for me this is the first time seeing this so I thought it was new. Like others here, it was pointed out. My mistake for being so late.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:44:36
I see, my mistake then.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:49:33
There's a common saying when it comes to investing in general:
"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second best time is today"
Same thing applies. I bought Bitcoin back in August after hearing about it and learning what it is. The best time should've been 2009-2013. I got in now.
Point is, if you're serious about investing and the long-term, buy now. Don't wait any longer.

@_date: 2017-10-19 13:45:24
Yeah, I'm just now realizing. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:42:57
Exodus has been a pretty good desktop wallet for me. Has storage for the Big 3 (Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum) as well as other altcoins. However, everyone here would probably recommend a hardware wallet instead for added security.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:05:11
I see, good to know.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:06:43
I actually didn't know about Bitpay. For all the times that I signed into my account, I never saw that option. For now, I'm using my Coinbase account I generated an API key for it.
