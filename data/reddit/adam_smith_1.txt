well done... continue to make money if you can...i have seen too many bubbles and 99% of speculators lose out. once the price stabilizes there will no space for speculation and a lot of people will need to move onto something else.

that is right NOW..look at the current economic climate, most people are trying to make a quick buck. Making money takes skill and industry, not bitcoins! they are are means to facilitate trade and hold store of value...When other exchanges come up we will see the price stabilize. how do we know if mtgox is manipulating the price as 80% of the market means you are in full control of the price. MTgox is the only problem with bitcoin right now.

It is misconceptions and the fact that all other investments are not doing well, people want something to make money from. City traders who have a couple of grand to play with think they will double their money in a weeks time, is causing the crazy volatility.

Why the scorn! did you lose money on something you knew nothing about, and thought you were going to get rich quick....RULE no.1 = don't invest more than you can afford to lose. why did people think bitcoins as an investment like shares when there is nothing intrinsic behind it, not even government backing? You need to see the merits for what it is, and stop making it into another pre credit crunch get rich quick scheme.

hopefully exchanges that are in development come up quicker so mtgox loses it's monopoly. the nature of bit coins is against any monopoly. This is why there is so much price volatility. It will get better.......bitcoins haven't crashed. not long ago i was buying them for $13 and they crashed to $50.

Hit the Nail on the Head! these noobs need to lose money to understand that bitcoins isn't some get rich ponzi scheme, where they can double their money overnight. once the cattle see their peers get slaughtered they will run away and disperse. I know this "crash" got rid of alot of speculators who bought at high prices who are now pissed and saying bitcoin is bullshit.lol

Paul krugman is merely stating his opinion.
I think Adam smith would have loved Bitcoins, Once he saw the internet compared the resources involved
in mining gold and silver and mining bitcoins.
Many of Krugman's peers don't think he even deserved his noble prize, and he was getting facts to prove
his hypothesis.

of course it is a currency...and internet currency that can facilitate internet trade like no fiat currency can do. Paypal doesn't ship to half of the world and then you have charge back issues. It's a no brainier... but these speculators who don't know anything will only lose money...good riddance i say

+ People need to stop comparing the bitcoin price to financial bubbles of the past. 
The financial bubbles of the Stock markets are based on misinformation and lying i.e. enron etc 
Where as everyone knows right now that there isn't anything intrinsic behind bit coins. The bitcoin bubble is created by the fact there is only one dominant exchange in the world and in 2013 alot of, what you would term, "investors" have stated buying and selling coins purely to make a profit...on a hype
