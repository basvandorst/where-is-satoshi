114 satoshis.
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:48:35
It is known.
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:30:27
A week of red.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:58:13
Bitcoin trying to peek through your window at night.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:16:45
8k is a ridiculous price point. I'm thinking 3k again.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:58:16


Yikes. There's a lot to unpack about you, huh?
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:11:56
No thank you, Mark Fuckerberg.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:19:02
 SAID HODL
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:00:40
 THE MOON
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:25:08
You had me at lightning, then you said Libra and I knew you were a retard.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:50:08
An what exactly makes this 'look' dodgy?
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:22:55
Too many police raids on legal dispensaries. This way we can give them the middle finger as they yell 'hands up'.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:44:08
Why does the loser have bags too?
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:39:06
There's no civil disobedience if the government fails.
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:54:43
Lol so they'll scratch your coin and steal your PKs!?
@_date: 2019-03-31 20:47:30
Dump eet.
@_date: 2019-03-28 07:31:16
Dont scratch it, lol!
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:59:36
Your argument doesn't make sense because you don't need to dump $100,000+ on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:00:44
Hail Mary, boys. We're going 100% into alts today!
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:39:53
Go back to buttcoin
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:04:35
It was at 6k for the longest time. Your fault.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:08:30
Hey, I get it. You can buy back in at 20k.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:21:47
Unlike Bitcoin, some are forced to use fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:39:35
So buy 1 gallon at a time, I dont see your point?
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:13:37
Let's put this gas man into poverty.
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:34:49
Math doesnt check out.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:24:06
Hahah, retards amirite?
I still only hold IBM stock
@_date: 2019-04-29 03:34:13
When 1 sat/ 10 bytes?
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:05:33
You could perhaps only store what you might need during the day. Pre-load it with $50 and have whatever businesses you frequent scan the QR.
@_date: 2019-01-01 17:59:16
With such high fees, how is coinbase any different from banks and credit card systems?
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:48:05
Implying that it isn't.
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:21:06
Watch out if the bears read this, it'll turn into 100 days of dumping on you.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:17:47
So you want another 90% crash based on speculation and hype?
@_date: 2019-05-02 05:40:03
Some crypto are worth less.
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:40:29
Bitcoin, monero, a dApp/ICO farmland, and 2 shitforks.
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:59:00
Do you hodl USD? When moon?
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:12:01
What if you used a vacuum to scoop them up really efficient?
