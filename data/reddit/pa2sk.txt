What about the unemployed or low income?  How can they get a job to pay taxes if they can't even use the roads?  And you're going to keep kids out of school because their parents can't pay, is that fair?  What happens to those kids?  Seems like a very poorly thought out system which would quickly take us back to the middle ages where some wealthy lords own everything and peasants are scrounging to scrape by.
 
The problem with this kind of system is people will make decision that benefit themselves, at the expense of everyone else.  This is just human nature.  Of course I don't want to pay for someone else's kids to go to school, but the fact is we're all better off if every child has the opportunity to get an education.  Same thing with public transportation and infrastructure; if you want to have a well functioning economy you need to have these things and everyone needs to be able to use them.

You're confusing a fractional reserve savings account with currency.  You can hold currency if you want, hard currency, treasury securities. It is not leant out, it's backed by the full faith of the US government.

But you just said the taxes are voluntary.  If I don't feel like paying a gas tax then I shouldn't have to, otherwise we're just getting back to forced taxation.
 
Programs to assist low income kids.  Ok and who is paying for this?  Are the wealthy going to out of the kindness of their hearts?  Not likely.  If the government is paying for it then it is being funded by whoever is paying taxes, which goes against what you just said.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:53:34

Lol, and I don't believe you're just posting this chart here for the good of the community.  You clearly have a bias for the reasons I gave and likely have some kind of agenda.
Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset with no fundamental value to form a basis from. I would look to other speculative bubbles - tulip bulbs is a good one because tulips are fundamentally worth very little.  You could look at other bubbles like real estate or gold and silver, the thing is those assets have practical uses that form a baseline value. Even if gold is worth zero people will still buy it to use in industry or jewelry, etc. People need houses to live in. No one needs bitcoin. It's only worth something to the extent you can convince people it's worth something. If it's price goes to zero people will quickly forget about it and move on. It will be nothing more than a bubble, an economic oddity. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:33:08
Sorry but what does that accomplish?  I haven't seen anything where using bitcoin to buy stuff will benefit you.  Generally it seems like it will probably end up costing you a little bit compared to just using USD.  I guess if you like the technology and it's just for fun/experimentation then more power to you.
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:54:03
Bitcoin is almost 10 years old.  That's a lifetime in the tech world.  It's not really "new" at this point.  
Tether is entitled to the same protections as every other company.
 
Even if you want to argue they should keep some of their business private (which I don't believe), hiding their reserve USD is absurd.  It really makes no sense.  Believe what you want though.

It's usage as jewelry was practical.  Say that gold was as common as iron is, people could find chunks of it laying around pretty regularly.  It's value as a currency would be limited since it's not rare, but it would still be used as jewelry, as plating, gold leaf, gold teeth, etc.

Right, just like those people sitting on their worthless beanie babies because they value their utility. Let's get real, bitcoin has virtually no utility at present, you can't do anything with it. The only reason people are holding it is in the hopes it will go up in future and they can sell for usd.

It has no value as a currency at present because no one uses it as a currency.
Fiat currencies can and do go to zero, however you are backed by a nation state that gives you much greater security and stability than you get with bitcoin.  That said I wouldn't recommend anyone hold fiat either as it tends to be inflationary.

Yes if the funds are held in fractional reserve it presents a serious risk if there is a run on tethers or if the bank fails.


You have no idea what you're talking about.  This means the lawyer is "auditing" a bank he is personally involved with.  You don't "audit" yourself.

At $130 that would represent almost 8 million coins, which could have thrown the market completely out of whack.  Regardless, investing isn't about always making the correct decision, that's impossible, it's about a strategy you implement over time, across many trades, that gets you to a certain place.  Buffets strategy does not include speculative investments in highly unstable assets, and that strategy has worked pretty well for him.  If he did invest in such assets he probably wouldn't be worth $80 billion and wouldn't have been in a position to put $1 billion into crypto to begin with.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:13:00
Highly speculative investments like bitcoin should be a small part of your overall portfolio, or none at all, and you shouldn't be investing at all until high interest debt and other priorities are taken care of.
Order of priority would be
 
-&gt; pay off high interest debt
-&gt; save up 3-6 month cash emergency fund
-&gt;start putting at least 15% of your pretax income into retirement accounts. More if you are behind on your retirement savings or want to retire early.
-&gt; start investing elsewhere. This is where you could start investing in bitcoin but again I would keep it a small part of your portfolio.
What you are doing is basically using credit card debt to gamble with.  Sell your coins. Pay your debt off.  Start rebuilding your finances the safe way. You have a family to think about.  Don't buy any more crypto until everything else is covered. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:36:55

The problem is you can't prove a negative.  I can't prove with 100&amp; certainty that no one uses bitcoin, what I can say is the amount of commerce being conducted with bitcoin is by all appearance small to non existent.  On the other hand if you are claiming bitcoin is used as currency it should be easy for you to prove it.

@_date: 2018-06-07 16:57:12
It's difficult to prove a negative first off, much easier for a merchant to prove it was shipped then for you to prove you never got it. 
A single lost or screwed up shipment is hardly going to put a merchant out of business.  These are companies shipping probably hundreds or thousands of items a day. Mistakes happen.  Your one negative amazon review won't even dent them. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:24:29
But a chargeback is also useful to reduce fraud on the part of merchants.  What happens if you order something online and it never arrives?  With a credit card you can do a chargeback, with bitcoin you're screwed because they already have your money and there's no way to get it back.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:40:18
Pretty much yea. There is a system of checks and balances that either side could potentially take advantage of but overall works pretty well.

There is quantum cryptography, the question is how would you update bitcoin with quantum cryptography?  Patching your browser is easy, patching a bitcoin is probably more difficult.  Maybe you could have a system where people could redeem their bitcoins for more secure ones, but I'm not sure how that would work.
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:28:03
All that means is they're using a fractional reserve.  That works fine as long as the amount of transactions is small, but if there is a run on tether and everyone wants to cash out they would be fucked.
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:49:21
From I can see it's not delivering on its promises. I have done research and I don't see it. I can't prove a negative though. If you're going to claim I'm wrong you need to show sources. You say you don't have time yet you keep responding.
The number 1 promise was bitcoin is the future of money. It's had ten years to deliver on that promise and failed. No one uses it as money. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:09:47
Banks can upgrade their security without affecting their underlying balances pretty easily.  Bitcoin being upgraded to be quantum secure is likely a much bigger headache, if it's even possible.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:31:52
No it wouldn't.  Something only has value when it can be traded for something else of value.  If I have dollars that cannot be used to buy anything at all because no one accepts them, and can only be traded for other dollars, the value of those dollars is zero.
You can stockpile bitcoins all you want, if their value is zero, or something close to it, and the only thing you can do with them is trade them for other bitcoins then it's worthless and pointless.  If something is a store of value at some point you need to be able to trade it for something else of value \- goods and services.  If you can never do that then it has no value.

For most people it's probably both.  Whenever you invest it starts by believing in the product, but you later buy in hoping to make money. No investor buys in to a product not hoping to make money.  The thing is bitcoin proponents are now trying to convince people this isn't true. They're saying if you believe in the tech that's enough and it's ok if you're losing money.  It's not, that's not how investing works.

And there's over 32,000 conventional ATMs in Australia.  At this rate bitcoin will be caught up in about 700 years.

If bitcoin stayed the same price, $2,478, that would be a 0% increase right? If it doubled in price, to $4,956, that would be a 100% increase...right?  Now, follow me... If a 100% increase means it doubles in price, then a 200% increase means it tripled in price, to $7,434.  That's more than it's current price, which means there's no way bitcoin went up 255%.
To figure out percent increase you take the *difference* in price and divide by the original.
(6327-2478)/2478 = 1.55 = 155%
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:06:29
It's value started from zero.  It's always going to show a rise if you go back far enough in time.  That's little solace to the people who bought in within the last 8 months or so and it doesn't mean we're not currently witnessing a collapse.
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:01:59

We can agree to disagree.  If bitcoin is a currency its a pretty terrible one.
 
If bitcoin is broken, like by quantum computing, its value goes to zero.  It's worth as much as the bits that make up this sentence - nothing.

Are the backing funds held in a fractional reserve by the bank?  Meaning the bank doesn't actually have $2.55 billion in cash on hand but are in fact investing the money and earning a return on it, and probably paying Tether interest in the process?  What happens if the bank goes out of business?  Are the funds insured? 
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:47:35

You can't do a chargeback just because you feel like it.  You have to have proof of actual fraud, and the merchant can contest it.  If they can produce a signed receipt or other proof that you agreed to the charges then you're out of luck.  Chargebacks are a good thing, they give more power to buyers.  If you buy something with bitcoin and it never arrives what exactly are you going to do?  As far as I understand the system you have essentially no recourse but to ask the seller nicely if they can return your money to you.

You shouldn't be investing until you're debt free.  Pay down high interest debt first (mortgages and student loans are ok to pay the minimums on) --&gt; save up a 6 month cash emergency fund --&gt; start contributing 15&amp; of your pretax income to retirement savings (401k/roth/hsa), more if you are behind or want to retire early  --&gt; Then you can start investing additional cash elsewhere, but even then highly speculative/volatile investments should be a small part of your portfolio, like maybe 5&amp; or something.

It's amazing how often I have to correct people on this sub about how percentage increase works.
$2,478 -&gt; $6,327 amounts to a 155&amp; return.

Cardano is separate from bitcoin though right?  It's just a quantum computing proof cryptocurrency.  That has nothing to do with quantum computers breaking bitcoin though.
 


 
We can agree to disagree.  I actually work in this field and don't see the temperature thing as an issue.  At worst you would be limited to room scale computers but as I already explained that doesn't prevent someone investing in a quantum computer to break bitcoin, it just won't be a home user.  Sound I don't know about, I would have to do some more research, but if they've already made 72 qubit computers I wouldn't be putting my trust in sound preventing them from going any further with it.  Sound can be dealt with, it's really an issue of how much money you have to throw at a problem.

It doesn't really prove anything though.  Lawyers are paid to lie, that's what they do.  On top of that one of the lawyers sits on the board of a bank that Tether uses.  That's a huge conflict of interest.  On top of that it's full of caveats - they didn't adhere to normal accounting standards, they only checked the account balances on a single day, they relied on information provided by Tether, etc.  This is basically just another smokescreen thrown up by Tether to fool people into believing they're being transparent.

Yes there are problems but the technology has already made significant advancements.  I don't know if it can overcome everything or not, I was simply pointing out the temperature thing is a non-issue as we already have established technology to maintain those temperatures.  It's possible quantum computers could be large machines limited to governments and corporations, the way supercomputers are today, but that doesn't really matter - if the technology is there to break bitcoin then bitcoin is dead.  It doesn't matter if you need a $2 million computer to break it, for something that's supposed to be the future of money with trillions in value $2 million is a tiny drop in the bucket.  Some government somewhere or a big bank can simply turn their attention to bitcoin and kill it pretty quickly.

The number of people that use bitcoin as an actual currency is slim to none. Zero is an accurate representation.
I never said bitcoin has gone to zero, I said it could.
No investments in precious metals, no interest. Precious metals do have practical uses though, beyond being simply stores of value.  This sets them apart from crypto.
I never said nation state = value.  Currencies have no fundamental value either, their value is based on the country that backs them.  An unstable country could collapse and go to zero. A stable country it's much less likely, like I said though I still wouldn't hold currency.  Bitcoin is backed by the stability of the tech, but that could collapse any time. Or it could simply be superseded by something better.

Not really, no.  If people can manipulate the price of bitcoin then they will almost certainly manipulate it to their advantage.

The whole idea of bitcoin was it would be immune to these sorts of things and it's clearly not.

You don't understand fractional reserve banking then.  The risk of fractional reserve banking is that if there is a run on the bank they won't have the funds on hand to pay depositors.
 
Tether can produce an account statement saying they have $2.55 billion at XX bank, but THAT bank won't actually have that much cash on hand, because it's a fractional reserve.  If there is a run on Tether there will be a run on the bank and you could have a situation where the bank cannot actually provide the USD to Tether and Tether therefore cannot provide the USD to their customers.
 
The usual solution for this is to have insurance on the account.  Usually governments will be the backer of last resort.  In the US it would be FDIC for example.  Even if there is a run on a bank and they exhaust their cash reserves FDIC will step in to reimburse customers.  FDIC though only insures accounts up to $250,000.  When you are talking billions of dollars in cash it's a whole different ball game.

Point is there is no direct evidence.  This really doesn't need to be that complicated, put the reserve USD in a holding account, make bank statements publicly available.  Bank can confirm it's valid.  If Tether is actually holding the USD they would want to show it, the fact that they keep delaying and delaying is by itself very concerning.  It indicates they're hiding something, which is probably that their Tether coins are not fully backed by USD.

It's not quite that simple.  Even if you are successful with the charge backs the merchant can still send you to collections and/or sue you.  This would affect your credit and if they get a judgement against you they could do things like garnish your wages or seize assets.  A lot of people don't realize this and think a successful charge back means you are free and clear and don't owe the money anymore.  That's not the case.  Every single time you do a charge back you are taking a risk that the merchant could come after you in other ways.  Yes in many cases they won't bother, but they can.


Checks are much less secure than credit cards, that's for sure.  There are adequate protections in our current payment system though if you use the right tools.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:36:06
That's not actual fraud though.  All you're alleging is the service you received was not adequate.  That's more of a he said she said between the customer and service provider.  If you don't do charge backs often and are using them to address genuine complaints you probably won't have too many issues.  If you use charge backs frequently and often try to rip off merchants you're going to have more problems.  I spend a lot of time on the personal finance sub and there are plenty of people there complaining about disputes being decided in favor of the merchant.

@_date: 2018-06-07 15:39:50
Maybe you aren't familiar with the charge back process.  If you dispute a charge on your account the card company will investigate.  This includes contacting the merchant.  The merchant can and often will contest the charge back.  In these cases the card company basically acts as an arbiter in deciding the dispute.  They will look at whatever evidence is available \- receipts, delivery confirmation, etc. in deciding the dispute.  The card company will often decide in favor of the merchant if they have evidence.
Additionally, even if your charge back is successful and you get your money back the merchant still has the option to send you to collections and/or sue you.  They probably won't do this if it's $50 or something but for a large enough amount of money they will.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:55:11
Theoretically it can.  If quantum computing breaks bitcoin its value could go to zero.
 
Everything you're listing about bitcoins value is still based on it's value as a currency, which is entirely consensus based.  That doesn't change anything I've said.  Again, if quantum computing breaks bitcoin and it's value drops to zero no one will be using it to store transactions, prove worth, protect from theft, etc.  There is no fundamental value and it has no practical uses without value.  And the quantum computing thing is just an example, there are plenty of other ways bitcoin could be broken and rendered worthless.

Intermediaries aren't people typically, they're for profit companies with reputations to protect.  I may spend years working with them to build a trusted relationship.

And my point is if Bitcoin is going to overtake the traditional payment system they need to present a better alternative, not just an equal alternative, otherwise what's the point?
 
How is a merchant going to sue you using camera footage?  That's not going to give them your name and address.  They could ask for ID but at that point they're no different from credit cards, except a credit card makes it easier for me, the customer, to dispute transactions and gives me some cash back in the process.

Yes the renter would have a lease.  That lease would protect the renter if HE has any problems with the landlord.  However if the landlord has a problem he would be screwed, because he isn't reporting the income or paying taxes on it.  Yes the landlord is supposed to be paying taxes but if he intends to do that why would he prefer receiving rent in bitcoin?  You have to recalculate the rent every month, plus your taxes have to be paid in USD so it's likely you would need to cash out some of that bitcoin anyway.
This seems like the most likely explanation to me, maybe the landlord just really likes bitcoin though.

That's not true at all.  With fractional reserve banking the bank does not actually have the dollars available, they have a small fraction of them.  This bank can say there is $2.55 billion in your account, but they might only have $100 million in actual cash on hand.  If there is a run on the bank they will not be able to pay depositors.
If these funds are held in fractional reserve and there is a run on Tether there would be a run on the bank and they could run out of cash.

Whether fiat is around or not doesn't matter and the point remains the same \- if your bitcoins cannot be traded for anything else of value, whether it's hard currency, goods, services, or something else, then the value of those coins is zero and they cannot be a store of value.
Maybe you're operating under the assumption that bitcoin will eventually rise in value at some point in the future, or will at least stop going down.  If that's the case then sure, it's a store of value.  You can stockpile bitcoins and at some point in the future trade them for a house or something.

No, you do need proof, or at the very least the merchant can contest the charge back and if they have proof it will be reversed.  Example, you do a charge back on a $200 bar bill.  Chase Bank will initiate an investigation and may conditionally credit the money back to you.  Bar provides a signed receipt showing you agreed to the charges.  Charge back is reversed, you lose.  This is not an uncommon scenario.  A charge back is not a get out of jail free card any time you want your money back.  It's also possible that if you use this feature a lot your card provider could cancel your account for abuse.

I didn't say you can't report it, my point is if you want to avoid paying taxes bitcoin is probably a better way to go.  If you have regular check deposits into your bank account with no explanation it could cause suspicion, especially if you're audited.  You could ask your tenant to pay you cash and use that for your spending, most people probably wouldn't be comfortable paying in that form though, it's a little sketchy handling that much money, plus there's no paper trail.  That leaves something like bitcoin, which gives people the comfort of digital payments but is totally opaque to the IRS and isn't going to result in questions.

The later rate will likely be lower.  When you contribute to a 401k the taxes are deferred at your marginal rate.  In retirement your income will be taxed at your effective tax rate.  Your effective tax rate will almost certainly be lower than your marginal tax rate now unless your income increases by several times.
Secondly, even though you have to pay some taxes eventually, deferring it for many decades is a huge benefit.  It's like getting a 30 year interest free loan from the government.  In the meantime you can take that money and invest it and get a higher return.

Tether is almost certainly a scam.  They claim they're audited but have never actually been audited.  They released a statement from their own banks lawyer attesting to their bank balance.  That doesn't even matter though because it's pretty clear they have no intention of ever reimbursing the tethers they have put into circulation.  That money is as good as gone and if the price of tethers ever collapses I guarantee you they will be heading for the exits pronto.
The US government can and does print money, but that's part of an economic policy put into place by an elected government.  It's meant to control inflation, growth, interest rates, etc.  Tether is a very secretive, for profit company that is essentially printing money for their benefit at the expense of everyone else.  They're essentially siphoning cash off the bitcoin economy that will never be returned.  In the short term it can help to pump up the price of bitcoin, but in the long term there is substantial risk of a collapse.

Any decent travel credit card doesn't charge a foreign transaction fee.  If you're going to be traveling regularly or making overseas purchases they're worth having. Not only is there no fee I get at least 1.5% cash back on those foreign purchases.

It depends.  If you keep the money in your 401k you're limited to whatever investment options they make available.  Sometimes these are really good, sometimes they're really bad.  However if you ever switch jobs you can roll your 401k over to an IRA.  Once the money is in an IRA you have full control over it and can invest it in anything you want.  Also, after 5 years you can withdraw the money from your IRA penalty free.
Taxes can always change, but that affects everything, including your crypto gains.

It is outside scrutiny:


Compare this to tether who had a lawyer from their own bank provide a statement, that wasn't even a legal audit, attesting their bank account balance.
The financial reports, both audited and unaudited are freely available on their website.  It's pretty transparent.

Keep telling yourself that. Tether is a black hole so far. If their business is so simple it should be trivial to do a full audit yet they keep delaying.  That doesn't even matter though because whatever cash they do have it's clear they have no intention of ever reimbursing to people for their scam tokens.

If you roll it over to a traditional IRA there's no tax liability, but you cannot do an early withdrawal without penalty.  If you roll it over to a Roth IRA you have to pay ordinary income taxes on the roll over out of pocket.  After that though you can withdraw the roll over amount tax and penalty free after 5 years.  If you wait until age 59.5 you can withdraw earnings with no taxes due.
