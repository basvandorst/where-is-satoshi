Odd. I've bought bitcoins 3 times this year, with transfers of money via CBA. Only once did they even ask me about it (did it over the counter) and it was more a "Oh, it's for bitcoin? Cool" comment. No more questions, transfer goes through.
Maybe things have changed recently?

Last I heard, they didn't really need money, they needed supplies and mainly more educated workers (nurses/doctors etc.). You can't just get Amazon to deliver to these African towns and villages. Doctors aren't bought at a shop. 
I'm not saying that donations aren't accepted, but it's not their biggest concern. Even million-dollar payments from governments are refused (see below), because money just cannot buy the sorts of supplies they need. Or at least, the "money" required to buy the supplies far outweighs their actual costs and worth due to the remote location and "undesirable workplace conditions" for actual helpers.

Be nice once we can start spending it at a few more places. I realise some exist, but not many so far.

Universities "should" also accept peer reviewed scientific journals, and those are becoming more and more open-access. 


These sorts of things should be chased up, imho. If you're at a high school or similar level, then I still think a parent or someone else you trust should do it. I haven't done it often, but I have chased up teachers for being wrong once or twice (politely, and not in front of students) and I'm yet to have any sort of bad results.

I know the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has promised guidelines, but I wish they'd hurry up and work them out/release them. Original promise was for 30th June, now they're saying "before the tax deadline" which is 31st October.

EXIF tags are meta tags, but one of the possible tags is "thumbnail", which yes does store a thumbnail copy of the image. No idea on imgur though, sorry.

Yeah, but that won't change people. It's not like it's the same people who do it every time. It could be some new person who just stumbled onto saw someone has posted some "neat" image of a bitcoin QR code and got some donations, and tried to do the same. It's a relatively low-effort post that can get people to give you money; if it's allowed people will post them.

IP addresses might not be the unique entities they are revealing. With people like these you often have to analyse their wording very carefully.

Nope, that's not possible. When you think about it, Reddit doesn't want users to be able to completely change where a link points to. That could get really messy.
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:31:49
Adding np. is an indicator that you were led there from another place on reddit, a so-called no-participation link. The idea is that smaller reddits could otherwise have larger reddits control their content.
As for the link you submitted, when you add "np." make sure you also remove the " part. That's why people are seeing the security issue. This is something that reddit could fix themselves as well, but it is something you can also fix.

Possibly because it encourages more people to post images with QR codes and statements like "Look where I put my QR code" just for the sake of getting donations. People might not explicitly state that they want donations, but anyone who wants donations would be posting those sorts of pictures.

While I see what you are worried about, I don't see how that is relevant to the "ownership" of the software issue. If they make crypto they specify illegal to distribute, the legal distinction between "license" and "sell" software doesn't seem to be relevant.
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:56:01
Yeah the weasel words are annoying, it takes practice to find the hole in what people say. And yeah, you're right, they could potentially do that.

Read his wording carefully. He never says he won't discriminate based on IP addresses. Just that they won't reveal them. I personally would guess that IP addresses will form a significant part of their system to identify users. They are only saying that they won't "reveal" the IP addresses.

Let's pretend that did happen. The difference is that Apple can force changes to the encryption system onto users, probably without it being known. I don't know if Apple can do background updates without approval per se, but they could bundle it into an iOS update so users are either left on "legacy" versions or they get the encryption back door.
Many (most? all?) open source projects cannot force such changes onto users. Any such changes pushed would be noticed and then "removed" in forks. This means that users do have a way of knowing that something has changed, and they can choose to remove the backdoor without losing access to any new features or updates.

Any chance of actually **showing** that this is true, rather than stating it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:45:59
I think it comes down to how precise you have to be when getting the private key. Since you have to line up the two images exactly, it's not something that can easily happen "by chance".  On the contrary, with a paper wallet if it slips open even for a few seconds while someone with a decent camera is around, they could snap a shot.

I think this might be worth pointing out in the article. My first thought was "Oh, great, here come a bunch of spam commits" seeing as it specifically says "to anyone who commits to our repository"
I think better wording might be
Distributes the Bitcoin donations from that pool to anyone whose commits are pulled into our repositories.
I feel like that makes it more obvious that this is a sensible scheme. Up to you guys though.

I hated working with Dells. Everything was proprietary, but close enough to regular standards to possible cause issues.

Actually, maybe I am talking about Packard Bell. I do remember having riser-card issues with some large brand name.

Curious, did you buy anything locally (either within your home town, or within Australia)?  I'm wanting to spend some bitcoins, but I want to spend them locally and that seems hard.
