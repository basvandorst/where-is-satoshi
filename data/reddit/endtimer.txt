No one can cash in those coins for a quadrillion.  There would need to be a quadrillion worth of buys.  After the first few thousand coins, the market would start tanking hard.  Once people realized that address was active, there would be a dramatic re-evaluation of bitcoin.

I just googled and the murder rate per 100k people, without regards to guns, is about 5x higher in the USA than UK.
Texas is right in line with that 5x rate, and it's 11x in Louisiana, which is the most murderous state.  DC, not technically a state, smokes any state at roughly 23x.
I'm not even hating on guns.  I'm just surprised.  I may have done the math wrong or I may be a tard for using statistics from wikipedia.  Anyone is welcome to correct me, those figures seem insane.

Bitcoin isn't regulated, but the futures trading business is.  This will have price feedback into Bitcoin, but claiming this increases regulation when there weren't unregulated, cash-settled futures before is like claiming corn is more regulated when corn futures exist.

I definitely have no idea how the finance industry works, but I don't imagine it could work in a "Bitcoin economy".  I'll lend you a Bitcoin if you pay me back 1.1 Bitcoin.  That can't last long, whereas with the dollar, thanks to inflation, more can be brought into existence, which isn't really a bad thing as long as more goods and services are created that compete for that money to roughly maintain its value.
Of course, if the dollar ever goes so inflationary that most loans on the books are being made worthless, we're screwed because deflationary crypto probably can't offer much in the way of protecting loans with interest, right?
I don't see a world without fiat being *possible* as long as borrowing money is a thing.  And I think it's pretty critical to society.  But it wouldn't be the first time I was wrong.

A little bit too fast of a rise, in my subjective personal non-professional opinion, so maybe expect some minor pull back in the near future?  I'm not an oracle, feel free to buy now, just don't freak out if it drops 20%.  Every market will have dips, you hold through them because you expect they will go back up again.  So far this has rung true for BTC, LTC, ETH, VTC, and even BCasH can hope to beat its ATH in 2018, it's on the slow rise.

1. Storing crypto currency on any exchange for a long time is risky.  It could get hacked, it could collapse, the exchange could be raided by a government if said government doesn't like the exchange, an executive at the exchange company could run off with the everything, etc.  Obviously this doesn't happen often, but if anything does happen, and you don't control the private keys, your crypto currency is gone.
2. Lots of alts are traded primarily through Bitcoin.  People pull money out to fiat when they are scared of crypto falling.  People trying to exit alts push down the alt price.  People exiting Bitcoin during a fall are mostly selling out to fiat, other cryptos drop until they hit an exchange rate someone with Bitcoin is attracted to buy.  This will be less of a problem when other crypto trades mostly for fiat, but the effect won't go away as long as people are paranoid that Bitcoin going down means a loss of faith in crypto currency as a whole. 
3. I heard the UN has used Ethereum to distribute money to areas needing aid.
4. None that I know of, and it's doubtful you should trust any of them beyond dollar cost averaging and PERHAPS taking out your principle investment at some point.

So there's this thing called the blockchain.  It's a ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever.  It is updated by nodes called "miners".  In the beginning, they didn't just update the blockchain, they created the bitcoins.  Nowadays, these nodes are paid for their work maintaining the blockchain through transfer fees.
By design, the rate at which coins could be churned out dropped and dropped, and people have been buying from miners and trading amongst themselves for increasing amounts of money, year after year.  This has brought incredible amount of network power to bitcoin, as both mining the rare coin and collecting worthwhile fees has attracted LOTS of these nodes.  At this point, it's impractical to manipulate the network.
Every person who has bitcoin has a "wallet".  This wallet is really a public encryption key on the blockchain, and a private key held only by you (or by the web service you use to store your coins...).  It is trivial for any modern computer to create a private key, and then to create a mathematically-linked public key.  But it is, in practice, impossible for computers today (and any future computer, except a quantum computer capable of performing Shor's Algorithm -- none have been created so far) to reverse this math and figure out the private key from the public key.  The private key is what allows you to **send** bitcoins.
The private key is required to sign all transfers of coins on the blockchain.  The signature can be checked against the public key of the origin wallet.  If they don't make mathematical sense, the network rejects the transaction.  So when someone sends you a bitcoin, they are moving a bit of the balance they hold to your public key on the blockchain, and signing this transaction authoritatively with a signature that could only be generated by their private key, and this transaction distributes rapidly through all (legitimate) miners.  It gets added to the blockchain.
Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, for all practical purposes, it can *never* be removed.  All transactions are final in bitcoin, the only way to reverse would be if the receiver sent the amount back to you, signed with their own private key.
SO, that's how bitcoin *works*, in a nutshell.
As to how you use it?  You can buy virtually any fraction of bitcoin on websites like coinbase or an exchange like gdax or bitstamp.  Regardless, expect to turn over some personal information.  These large exchanges and fiat-to-cryptomoney trading websites are often required to collect this information by law, to prevent money laundering and the like.  So far these websites aren't known for data breaches, and so far most first world governments haven't gone after them.
On these websites, the provider may keep a ledger separate from the blockchain.  You may share a wallet with with sally and dave, or you may have a singular wallet allocated to you, but either way, the *website holds the private key*, with very few exceptions you would have to go out of your way to use.
This is why many people will transfer their bitcoins (or fractions thereof) to their home computers or phones, to avoid any possibilities ranging from the site getting hacked (huge target), to an FBI raid shutting down the service, to the owners running off with your BTC in the night.  
But computers and phones have proven susceptible to malware, hacking, snooping, etc.  To avoid malware stealing their private keys (and associated bitcoin),  many people use a paper wallet (literally writing down private key or information that allows its recreation) or hardware wallet (trezor, ledger nano s, etc).
It is possible, since a private key is just a text string, to effectively keep a wallet anywhere from a USB stick to your brain, though I wouldn't recommend it.
So how does all of this benefit you?
The blockchain is secure.  Or at least as secure as you are.  It can't be social-engineered into giving up money like your bank.  There will never be a "run" on it (though in theory the network could be overloaded, in practice it's not practical).
The blockchain is immutable and transparent.  There's no withdrawals that will be lost to time.  If bitcoin is ever used more widely as currency, this may be a blessing or curse, but if you know all your public keys, you can track all of your expenditures and deposits without relying on a central authority.
Your bitcoin cannot be taken from you without the private keys.  There is no court order, no confiscation, no conservatorship, nothing that can take bitcoins from you without your private key.  No fees for storage, upfront transaction fees for use.  Unlike a third party with your bank information, a wire cannot be initiated by anyone except the holder of the private keys.
Bitcoin is currently a commodity.  The value is what people are willing to pay for it.  If its performance remain consistent, it will handily beat a savings account at a bank, where inflation slowly leeches the value of inflationary money.
There are no third parties that can effectively block transactions.  No sanctions apply.  If Venezuela outlaws money being sent in from the EU (I dunno why, go with it), and you have family there, you can definitely send bitcoin to their wallet, and unless the internet is totally blocked there, they can probably turn it over and use it, either directly or by converting to fiat.
It's monetary freedom and responsibility, currency, cool technology, and a skyrocketing commodity all in one.
I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but there you go.  Thanks for reading if anyone made it this far.

CME opens a cash-settled BTC futures market like CBOE did this past weekend.  CME future contracts will be for 5x BTC instead of 1x.  This has some people spooked, they think CBOE was used to give everyone a false sense of security, and now big money is going to use CME to short the ever-loving shit out of BTC.  
However all these cash-settled futures have big money on both ends.  The person/company selling the future contract hopes BTC will be worth less on the day the contract comes due.  They get to pocket the difference if BTC is cheaper than the contract price.  They have an interest in trying to push the price of BTC down.
The contract buyer is the exact opposite.  Also well-endowed in the wallet, the buyer hopes that Bitcoin will be more expensive than the contract value.  They get the coins at lower than market value, and could sell them instantly for profit.  Except, these are all cash settled futures, meaning actual BTC is never traded.  They get paid the difference,  in cash, by the seller if BTC is worth more than specified in the contract.  They have a vested interest in pumping the price of BTC sky high, using other money to buy actual bitcoin.
So could be volatile, but if we've learned anything from CBOE, the new market will be *careful*.  BTC futures are trading more than ten times less than other futures right now.
I don't think we'll see much wild activity on the 18th.  But I could be wrong and it goes to 400 pesos.  Investing in crypto is betting on horse races, and even if you know some horse is juiced and being fed meth, its heart may explode and then it just drops dead right there on the track instead of finishing even in the first half.

Huh?  Totally feasible to buy and hold less than 1k worth, especially if you believe it will double again, or do even better.  
If you're buying it to day trade, though, it's not enough to flip end over end multiple times a day without getting ate by network fees.  Plus, day trading will lose many people money, anyways.

Going by memory here, haven't used Nicehash since last year:
Nicehash is, for lack of a better explanation, a mining pool.  It does not pay out instantaneously, you have to reach certain reasonable minimums (I was able to hit 2x the minimum when I tried off and on for 4 days on a GTX 1080, shits and giggles) that are then paid out every week.  There's a smaller minimum that pays out once a month so that people mining with a piece of bread can get in on the action.
If you specify a wallet address, it gets sent there on time, every time.
This attack probably hit earlier today or late yesterday.  If I recall, they pay out on Friday.  The wallet that got grabbed was probably the nicehash pool for this week, more or less, with a ton of leftover satoshis that have been waiting in hell on a million abandoned accounts.  And whatever the Nicehash "take" was.
Ouch.  But for the individual miners, this probably isn't a mtgox level event.  Point being, this isn't exactly a "people left their coins on a website zomg!!!" type of thing.  It's more a "damn most of this week's electricity went to waste!" for most people in Nicehash, I'd bet.

This is correct.  This is why many people just buy and hold.  Selling is seen as risky because you may not be able to re-buy as much btc as you had before.  
Some people think they see a dip or crash starting, and sell most or all of their btc, only to have an instant buy frenzy that sends bitcoin higher.  "Buying the dip" means you get to add more btc than you would at the all time high, and is seen as the safe position.

The further tangible incentive is millions of dollars in bitcoin, and the next step is to start beating you with a wrench until you change your mind.
Kidnapping is already a hella serious crime, it's not like they're going to politely ask, and when you refuse, say "oh well, guess I'm better off empty-handed and only risking 10 years in prison".
Kidnapping insurance and the like exists so that the ransom actually gets *paid* before the ransomers start doing shit like removing eyeballs.  Anyone into millions worth of bitcoin should consider finding some no-doubt expensive fiat insurance so they can buy back in after being forced to give up their coins.

This isn't science.  My personal feelings have no more weight than any other internet rando, but I think if you look at the charts and see that something has doubled in less than a month, and it's been nothing but daily upswing, **it's fair to assume eventually everything dips.**  That's what normal trading charts do.  The trend over time is what is important.  
You ever seen a trading chart in existence that's a green slope straight up till the end of time?  There was always going to be another "correction". There have been many. And it recovers and keeps going.  Human nature is such that people worry about losing what they have, so any time a coin goes up too many %, some whale is going to sell, people are going to try to short, etc.  So far, this year, recoveries have been fast.  BTC dropped nearly two thousand dollars two months ago, then rockets to a new ATH, then "crashes" to what it was a few days ago.
Seems to be the trend.  Hence, "hodl".  We aren't experts though, don't risk what you can afford to lose.  None of this is financial advice.
The market is almost right where you got in after this "crash".  Considering how many times it's swung up, in my personal opinion you're not in a bad position.

The Bitfinex exchange is widely speculated to be on the verge of collapse, either due to general insolvency or for their bizarre support for tether.
They have been abandoned by all fiat banks, so the only way to get money out is to send cryptocurrency to a different service.  They have pushed out all Americans, warning them their accounts and any leftover cryptocurrency will be forfeit after a "grace period" of an unspecified length.
They are the shadiest exchange, and unlike Bitstamp or Coinbase, there is zero way to get fiat money bank wired into or out of their service.  No one will be shocked, to say the least, if their "fiat" ledgers vanish, along with all exchange wallets one morning.

You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin, or even a tenth of one to get back 2 times (or more) what you put in.  If it keeps going up and doesn't crash, you effectively can turn it around for free fiat money.  Someday, when you feel it has peaked out.

I won't be shocked if the dip ends near 4000 five minutes from now, and I won't be shocked if it takes 3 months and sinks to 2000 and stalls for 6 months after that.
I know some of the dip is just people who saw the financial forecasts and are part of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Some of it is people dumping 30 coins at a time to propel a sell off so that they can buy them back lower.  Some of it is panic among people who put in 500 bucks just the other day and see that they now have 400 bucks in BTC vs fiat.
Then there's China, there's bound to be some people who were part of the ICOs, or who feel wary of the Chinese govt, and are getting out before they can't anymore.
Part of it is the super fast climb these past couple months.  If there wasn't a correction now, it would have happened at 6000 or 7000 or whatever, just the way of the world.  There's not really anything that has happened to justify bitcoins being worth 2x as much as they were 2 months ago, apart from the speculation.  The show goes on, though, and bitcoin will once again go up.  In my armchair nonprofessional opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:37:22
Well, were you prepared to be invested in bitcoin for *years*?  If so, there's no problem here.  I spent a long, long time actively hating bitcoin, but after every crash the damn thing never stayed down.  The long term trend is ALWAYS up.  If it dips to 2000, it will still go back up and eventually hit 8000, because that is what this shit does.  Consistently.  For over seven years now.
Eventually it will stabilize somewhere, but do you believe bitcoin has reached its maximum saturation in the general public?  Its maximum usage by businesses?  Do you believe the bitcoin name, synonymous with cryptocurrency, is about to lose its notoriety and media focus?
As someone waiting for THE crash since BTC were measured against single fiat dollars, my opinion, not to be misconstrued as financial advice, is that BTC will go back up and everyone who sells out entirely is gonna have some deep regret down the line.

I think it's a fair question.  I know this subreddit is mostly people who already have their bitcoins.  I imagine, though I have no proof, most of them are investors, who already have lump quantities of bitcoins and don't mind waiting days or weeks to add to their investment *most of the time*.  Unfortunately, from the outside, trying to use bitcoins as *a currency*, and not an investment, looks to be a frustrating experience.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:46:36
See, the context of my statement was that you have be able to convert btc to fiat for it to have appreciable value.  Using it to buy gas cards, preloaded with fiat, doesn't really go against what I said.


If BTC goes back to being worth 20 cents per 1 coin in some nightmare scenario, you will still have to pay whatever the fiat-versus-btc exchange rate is to buy those gas cards.  In all likelihood, the person buying the gas cards would stop once he'd turned all his btc into gas by proxy, and the person selling the cards would stop when they no longer thought they could expect to turn those traded btc into a profit, or at least break even.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:20:32
Well, realistically, if BTC can't be converted to fiat en masse anywhere, it will lose nearly all its value.  I'm just calling it like I see it.  The people who run the silk road, and the others that are investing, if they cannot one day turn those BTC into the currency they buy gas with, they will stop using it.  Likely they'll try to sell out of it if they perceive that day approaching, and kill the value even while the exchanges still exist.
That's a potential alternative.

I can exchange whatever currencies are relevant to a place I'm visiting at the airport, typically, with almost zero overhead cost, and instantly once I'm there.  But then these are national fiat currencies that are practically irrelevant outside their countries.  I don't have a use for dinars here, I reckon if there were wide use for them here I could withdraw them from the ATM, but that's about as irrelevant as the question.  Further, Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, even debit can be used to pay for items that have prices in Euros, with the conversion built in, making the need to purchase "e-euros" irrelevant.  That conversion is instant, also entirely electronic, and markedly easier and faster than attempting to purchase bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-12-20 23:17:50
I'm feeling pretty calm.  It is remarked here and on various other forums that if the price of bitcoins climbs, you can sooner expect coinbase to cancel your transaction than eat a loss (compared to selling at the new price).  You're not out any money, but you probably won't get your coins unless you're losing out or the price remains static.  I imagine it is very frustrating to not receive quoted coins due to artificial delays and market fluctuations.  I'd certainly rather not expose myself to that, if you can understand.
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:10:56
You've obviously validated, have a Visa credit card, and have waited 30 days after completing a transaction to get access to that.
For people looking to use BTC as a currency, and not an investment, this is not what many would find acceptable.
