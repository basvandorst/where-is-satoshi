You didn't lose anything.

You might not be wrong, but your arguments are naive (or dumb) as shit.

The only reason you can associate that address with a person is because of the story. It's no different to seeing a celebrity's wealth in a magazine. 
Lower profile addresses won't have hundreds of news stories written about them, and will be more private.

Sorry &amp; you're welcome
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:12:21
Maybe the real scam is making this up on reddit, and waiting for greedy people to ask for the address to try it themselves

It will confirm. If you want fast confirmations, include a higher fee than the default 0.0001.

I haven't lost anything, thanks.

I transferred at about 7pm GMT Monday night. It was confirmed about 10am Tuesday. It does seem like they're having a lot more trouble with the site now though. 
I paid a bit more with my bank to have the money sent as an "urgent transfer". Maybe that's why mine went through...

Well, I used that deposit to buy at 645. Then it promptly crashed to 370.
So swings &amp; roundabouts I suppose ;)

Higher fee = higher priority.

Dear sir,
You are full of shit.

How much research have you done for yourself?

The pens should be chained to the counters.

That sucks. Hope you get it sorted.

What status is the first withdrawal on 
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:11:26
i almost panicked when i thought i wouldn't be able to send money to the guy who photoshopped a bitcoin logo onto a flag. but then i saw your address in three places on that page. phew!
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:36:11
In the UK, company accounts are made public. Probably true in most countries.
With unlimited addresses and wallets, it could be argued that bitcoin hides data from the public more than fiat does.

Looks nice. Would be useful to switch between exchanges though.

Both of my deposits were processed within 12 hours. Maybe the hold up is at your bank's end?
