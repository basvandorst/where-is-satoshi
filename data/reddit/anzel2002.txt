So, if you buy crypto from coin base, will they just tax you on the price you bought it at, or the price it is when and if they track you down?
How would they or anyone know that the address it was sent to maybe 2 or 3 times etc after you bought it, was not you selling it, or giving it someone else?

Lets say 7 million in the other 194 countries combined  then

luckily a few days earlier I exported the private keys so I have them in a file
and I will now try to import keys into bitcoin-qt one by one
the timing is a bit weird tho, that a few days after I export my private keys to a file viewer on my computer, that this happens, this weird error,  but suppose it is just a coincidence, 
was just trying to find out if there was a way to import that single mutibit wallet file as a whole into some other wallet and have it show up as is the same way it shows up in the multibit wallet etc, if that makes sense,

thanks n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3 , but I had moved all my bitcoins out of the trezor before experimenting with the recovery seed, as I am getting ready to put a larger amount in the trezor

@_date: 2016-05-12 06:30:49
Just the pin, and no password, but I did notice that the notoriously bad trezor cable is finally acting up today too, could that be part of the problem or not really?, and also I see that I wrote down the word,  horror, twice, 
do seeds have the same words more than once in the seed?
@_date: 2016-05-12 15:38:47
Ok thanks exmachinalibertas 
and, also, I knew last night, the word, done, was not the correct word because it did not show up in the list of choices, while I was doing the recovery process,
but, I didn't see dose after I typed, do, or even, d, for that matter
I saw door, dawn, etc but did not see dose show up,
how did you find the word dose?
also, I didn't think having the word horror show up twice was right either,
so I thought I had 2 errors, 
but apparently  having 2 of the same words in the seed is a possibility in some recovery seeds?

Yeah ok you got it exmachinalibertas , 
the word, done, was spelled wrong was supposed to be, dose
you are right
and thanks for the explanation/info
now, once I reset the trezor with a new seed, its safe to use again
and you wont have access to it? right? lol
@_date: 2016-05-12 23:05:26
Ok thanks exmachinalibertas
I have a few more questions if you are someone here can answer them too
If I had posted the 24 words in the wrong order, would it have been possible or impossible to recover the trezor seed
And how did you do it, did you have a spare trezor and tried to restore the seed, or is there some other wallet that takes the 24 word seed of trezor too and lets you restore it,  and how did you know which word was wrong, and how did you find the correct one,
did you do it manually, and look at the list by eye, and try to find it
or run a computer program or what?
And does 24!, mean there are 6 with 23 zeros ways to try and get the seed in the correct order for it to work?
that's all I can think of for now
