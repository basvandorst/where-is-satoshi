*on our platform. We're already developing our own internal buffer to send less transactions (min 1 per block).

It costs 0.0001 BTC (3 cents). We cover it on the web version. For the API, you'll need to deposit a few satoshis in your account.

Thanks for your suggestion. We're using OP_RETURN. We might think of other ways to do it in the future. At the moment, blockchain "spam" isn't a problem.

What do you mean by abuse-free?
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:35:21
Exactly. By hashing a document and sending us this hash (we allow data in hex format up to 40 bytes), you get a timestamped proof of integrity. Our library is pretty basic right now, it only lets you send a hash in the blockchain. In the future, it'll let you sign this hash with your private key so you can also prove who certified what.

Lol you got my point. I should have said "I discovered Bitcoin before the banking system" :)

**If you upload a file**: everything is done client side.
**If you connect a cloud app**: for technical reasons, we process your hash server side - but private/public keys used to sign the transaction are still generated client side.

Actually I spent my first dollar 9 months ago. Before I was spending euros.
I think Bitcoin is really competitive with fiat currencies for "digital" transactions (credit cards &amp; bank transfers), so I wanted to focus on this. And yes, I didn't have the need for credit cards or bank transfers 1 year ago. I purchased my first Bitcoin with cash (gave it to my parents), never had to deal with banks before.

Hey Sorry for the inconvenience, it was a server side issue. I just fixed it. You can just re-upload your file.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:55:10
Yes I thought about it! I'll research the Dropbox API to see if it's possible to process files without any user action. Thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2015-03-21 00:36:51
What do you mean? There's a list of commands on the left.

Hi BitTheCoin, I really appreciate your feedback! You rock!
I will fix those issues asap.
I'm now going to answer all the security questions:
- we store your files (encrypted client-side with your password) because we want to make the process of certifying as easy as possible. We want to bring the power of the blockchain to everyone, not only geeks. It's hard for a "non-geek" user to understand that his files are certified but that he must still keep a copy. We want to make it as easy as registering a domain name: I just give my file, press the button, and here we are, it's certified, I can forget about it. We'll create a checkbox letting the user disable the upload function.
- if you go to Certificates &gt; then click on your file, you can see a button "Certificate" on the right, this contains all the "geek informations" needed to prove the ownership without Bitproof. This part is still not very user friendly, it's gonna be easier in the future. It contains a "TX" part (TXID you can check on blockr.io (blockchain.info doesn't index OP_RETURN transactions), you'll be able to see the OP_RETURN in the raw tx after 1 confirmation) and all the private/public key stuff used in the signature. (We basically send sha256(signature(sha256(file))) in the blockchain.
We also developed our own "super user friendly Blockchain proofs explorer", it's currently indexing, coming soon.
- you need to create an account to certify something because all the private keys and stuff used in the certification process are encrypted and stored in our servers. It's a kind of Blockchain.info JS wallet, you need to create a wallet before creating transactions, because they let you access your wallet at any time and from anywhere with only your password.
We will also enable a function that lets geeks keep all the private keys and stuff on their own computer without the need to create an account. We wanted to make it simple to begin with a MVP as fast as possible.
I posted this today on Reddit because we are looking for a strong use case we could focus on. We believe creating an API or something for OP_RETURN in the blockchain isn't something very interesting: chain.com or blockcypher could do it pretty easily. The idea now is to ask as many people as possible what they would do with Bitproof, understand their needs and see what we could build. :)
Thanks again for your feedback!

As many times as you want :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:24:08
We are inserting a hash of the signature of the file's hash, which lets you prove existence + ownership.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:34:46
We store a copy of the file for the safety of our users (in case they lose the file or in case they didn't know they had to keep a copy).
You can download all your proofs at any time:
- click on the decrypt button and save the file on your computer (it fetches the encrypted content from the server then decrypts all the stuff client side).
- click on "Certificate" (green button on the right) and download it (be sure to keep it in a safe place, it's safe on Bitproof as long as your password is good enough, on your computer you should use an encrypted container).
@_date: 2015-02-25 11:16:45
Awesome! Of course we can :) We'll create one in the next few days/weeks.
We would love to know what you are using Bitproof for so we can provide you with the best user experience! (Only if you want to tell us, haha).

Dude, this is awesome! :D
