Rich people reallocating money in Hong Kong. Perhaps some US binance traders consolidating their holdings to BTC as they undergo policy changes. 
It's important bitcoin outperforms in cases like now in hong kong because this is what bitcoin was meant for - a non-sovereign and highly mobile asset.
The best environment for bitcoin is not a recession but a \*fear\* of a recession. That way not wealth is lost but investors look to reallocate.
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:27:32

This is nowhere near like December 2017. Back then it was a national story, a incredible spectacle. There was FOMO from your friends and family. None of that is present now. If history is any guide we won’t see that until it reaches well past new all time highs.

Sup dude, glad to have you on board!
@_date: 2019-06-14 01:23:51
It’s probably more complicated than that. OTC is where the mega money first goes to make trades. It may becoming more
competitive but certainly not a dying business. Margins are probably really good as volume increases too.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:06:37
We’re not in a mania yet. Bitcoin didn’t make business news today and it’s gunning for $10k. That means it isn’t drawing national attention. Bitcoin is growing quietly. Probably rich people and institutions buying big orders. We haven’t broke new highs yet so enjoy the ride.

I think we’re still in accumulation phase, maybe some actual use too considering some turmoil around the globe. I wouldn’t worry about this question until it’s passing all time highs and it feels like people are gambling.
@_date: 2019-06-11 06:16:18
Haha the way you speak sounds like you’re asking a genie. 
Bitcoin investors have to make very big assumptions on end market sizes, network effect growth, confidence/psychology, and economic climate. For example we don’t really know if bitcoin will do well or badly if a major recession hits. You should be thinking about risk much longer then the potential reward. The reward is a matter of arithmetic.
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:40:06
Well, ask him why he thinks Litecoin would be it? And then if he says low fees explain how a blockchain works and why it’s no better than bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-06-16 03:37:31
Nope because I'm not greedy and realize bitcoin was the only coin with an obviously great risk-reward. Altcoiners think achieving critical mass in networking effects is easy, and that brand name/trust are fluid.

I agree! The further it surpasses ATH the more it seems like a "granny shot" for free money to normies, and then it eventually goes vertical. I recommend holding and not trying to call the top, if you have the time to wait patiently for years. It's the only sure way to be handsomely rewarded.
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:31:30
Huge wealth transfer, mainly to young white/asian males. Mass adoption by retailers. Huge investments made into blockchain technology, cryptocurrency funds, and better services. Serious regulatory response to accomodate a newly legitimized asset (ETF approved, IRS releases rules, legislature passes laws). Crackdowns by autocratic governments and central banks.

Agreed. There actually isn’t ANY conflict of interest for his position. Usually you want an executive to own “stock” so he performs with your interest at heart. Charlie Lee is not just a sell out but...kind of an bastard for pretending he’s not one.
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:55:49
That’s true, but only so far as you’re betting against other traders or reallllly unsophisticated investors. 
It may not work all the time. If the trading is dominated by say institutions it also won’t work.

In the US it's $5k. But if you consistently transact just under that amount then that gets flagged too.

@_date: 2019-06-18 12:01:00
Yeah I think that makes sense in mature and regulated markets like stocks but crypto is different.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:24:05
It’s grinding higher. It gets smacked down but always revisits resistance. That means it’s absorbing sells and looking to go higher

I wouldn’t be worried about them lying about that. They probably don’t want to deal with the liability of facilitating illegal activity with bad actors. They just want to collect trading fees.

Just to be clear, bitcoin isn’t a substitute for debt, just like bitcoin isn’t a substitute for banks. The idea is that there is just SO much leverage (debt/income) that perhaps investors will hide away in safe havens and possibly bitcoin. 
However with interest rates so low and expected to remain low, having high leverage is a natural consequence. This just is the new normal.
@_date: 2019-12-27 17:33:45
It’s important to note the sources of demand. Last time it was asian retail speculators. This next time will have to be institutions betting on bitcoin replacing gold.

I wonder how much information the exchanges report to the government.
@_date: 2019-12-11 00:58:36
This is the correct answer

The Libra CEO of that project really stumbled in admitting how they plan to profit from it on CNBC today.
But regardless, I own the stock too. Between them and Google they are dominating the ad market with no competition in sight.

It’s very possible, and trends suggest it will

Inflation is high so even if real volume is flat it should always be reaching “new highs”

Did CSW ever have billions in bitcoin?

At 33 minutes Dalio says bitcoin is challenged by volatility and acceptance, but he thinks some digital currencies may succeed (but possibly not). He thinks it’ll take a long time.
@_date: 2019-12-02 05:03:25
I do not think growth is being stifled

This will never reverse. Amazing investors don’t care.

I really admire him. He’s respects crypto for what it’s supposed to be (minimal interference), implements important Bitcoin updates (Segwit), and the exchange isn’t great (and young!). I really don’t have anything to complain about.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:24:10
I think the manipulation mostly has been to take advantage of leveraged traders.

It can’t be priced in because it’s impossible to caulcate that.

I am curious to learn more about how crypto (or crypto companies such as binance) is finding interest in Africa. Africa is probably the best market for switching to crypto. 
Also begs the questions how Lightning development is going and when we can expect a *practical* product. It seems 2019 saw a lot of cool progress, hopefully 2020 sees some releases of these features. 
I wonder how crypto adoption is going among people worldwide.

@_date: 2019-12-30 17:24:53
Well 2018 and 2019 sucked balls. People and institutions don't like cryptocurrencies, but to be fair, I wouldn't touch their corporate or sovereign debt with a ten foot poll. They're morons for buying that.
I still think Bitcoin *has* to win out against gold due to superiority and what has probably been a critical mass of adoption, but it's going to take a long time... like most of this decade.
Then again, these markets are rarely predictable
@_date: 2019-12-25 18:43:53
The halving seems so far away but it’s sorely needed now, because while bitcoin rapidly shoots up it USUALLY trends down. This means the growth in supply is too high for the price. A supply reduction by half should do some decent alleviation. 
Also, if congress passes the 2020 crypto bill that’ll be really good for legitimization. It’ll show the US probably won’t suddenly ban it. 
Tech wise, lightning network is moving slow but hopefully this year we get a reliable and easy to use product, and crypto services implement it on their side. 
I do think there’s a good probability that Bitcoin will start appearing as a competitor to Ethereum, which will be really important.
Economically, Bitcoin probably isn’t ready for show time if a recession comes. It needs more time to develop and be integrated in our regulatory system.

Can’t wait to see what end of 2020 or 2021 will bring. It’s gonna be interesting.
@_date: 2019-12-09 12:07:32
I agree with this. Major new technology tends to bring with it paradigm shifts.

Ugh that sucks. All the major crypto news sites are taking big hits. Definitely a very important source for crypto enthusiasts and investors.
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:17:15
It lost most of its gains and is still trending down
Institutional demand continues to be lukewarm at best
Bitcoin or anything relying on a network needs to be clear growth otherwise it’s value implodes.

3.5 years sounds about right for another bull run. 2021!

It's just manipulators playing around. Think of the real demand steady at 10-10.5k

Pretend everyone is expecting a run up to that date because of Bakkt, what would you expect now?

Let's be real who has predicted any movements accurately with Bitcoin. It could gallop straight up without notice

Because if you didn't believe altcoins were worth their valuation, or you were concerned the space was all spec money, than this shows some rational return to the mean. Good time to invest.
