How about some e-coin cash popping up too!

So loads of people here should have got some free bcash right? Just sell it and buy more btc instead of getting salty. I'm hoping coinBase eventually gets bitcoin gold going so I have some free money to buy more btc and eth

The whole time bitcoin was rising meteorically, there were several in here warning of an impending down turn and not to panic and hodl. Enough with this conspiracy rubbish

You mean the financial year right?

True, so this move by coinBase is an even better opportunity to do so!

I have already done this, before I looked into crypto. Some has gone into an isa, some into stocks, and the rest was initially spending money but went to btc and eth. It was exciting to see it climb in value, and nerve wracking to see it drop, even though it doesn't affect my day to day or my future

Am I allowed to be excited when we head for the moon?

Do you do the mycelium transfer from Gdax directly or via coin base?
