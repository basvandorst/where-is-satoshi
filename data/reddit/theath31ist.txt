He may have changed it, but as of 2 days ago when you download the wallet, it defaults to a BCH wallet and any BTC you send to it may be lost.

The meme went 2 decimal places too far. Need to eliminate 2 zeros for it to make any sense.

Why wouldn’t I want to spend my money in a country or to people who need it most? After reading the comments about the dangers and such I am not as interested any longer. But to say that spending money on who needs it most is not good because of guilt is ridiculous. Adding money into the economy and spending on the people who need it most would only help, granted not much but it at least puts it in the hands of those in need. Otherwise you are saying the only moral way to spend my money is in places that are better off than myself, in other words giving it to rich people.

Am planning a trip around the world very soon, South America was on the list but it seems Columbia (previously the most dangerous country in SA) is now the safest. If an American travelled and stayed for like a month to Venezuela , would it be worth it? I have heard “stories” of 5 star hotels for like $10 a day. Is this true? Can one “live like a king” for $1k a month? And would it even be safe enough for an American to be there? (My fear is if it is really that bad, anyone who could afford the best accommodations there would be seen as a huge target). Thanks in advance for answering and good luck, we all wish you the best. (Also, make an edit and list your wallet address so anyone wanting to donate BTC can).

Forgive me, but why wouldn't you just do a paper wallet, transfer all BTC to it... wait... then transfer back to a coin base or similar wallet after a couple weeks when it all settles down.. that way you are guaranteed it's safe, have all alt coins if it forks, and still can transfer back at any time if needed?
