The harsh reality is , nobody knows. Nobody EVER knew. It could go either way, try to figure out if the worst happen if you would be financially impacted and how much, and decide if HODLing it's worth the risk. 
Everyone telling you to definitely do one thing or the other is clueless and just trying to convince himself first.

But if I can't buy a cup of coffee with BTC, I'd need to do it with USD or any other currency. Which, to keep safe, and have convenient access to, I need to store in... a bank.
How can we undermine the banks if they keep most of their functions for the large public?

I totally agree with you - my reply was geared towards OP and his idea that being unable to do minor transactions doesn't really matter. To me it does, you need to have all the basics in place if you want to change the economic system and its fundamentals. Otherwise BTC might work for some use cases (moving large amounts of money, storage of value, anonymity...) but won't change the daily life of most people

Oh, I totally am. I wanted to point out that, unlike OP, I don't see the current economical system and the powers behind them being threatened anytime soon if the most basic use case for a currency (buying something small reasonably fast and with reasonable fees) does not work flawlessly.

Once Tether gets exposed, we will see the real crypto prices. Until then, it's foolish to try to link actual news to any price change, upwards or downwards.

Distributed databases have been invented more than 30 years ago. Blockchain is just an implementation of a well-known concept.

Step 1 : Write "Bitcoin accepted" on something nobody would buy with BTC anyway.
Step 2 : Sign is posted everywhere in the internet with your company logo
Step 3 : Free, enthusiastic advertising from the picture being shared at no cost for you
Step 4 : Profit (in USD)

Is this basically free advertising?
"We started accepting Bitcoin - nobody used it in 4 years but I'm sure it would have been great if they did"

It would also help to be able to discuss legitimate criticism without shouting SHILL! FUD! HODL! and refusing to listen. Some arguments ARE fake and/or petty, but they are all treated the same.

I have to agree. Hopefully it's just a small (vocal) subset of people, and others will be able to reason. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:08:36
Damn fake news! 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:04:40
Good for you! The rest of the planet though, won't agree to that. And they are a lot more people!

I'm just pointing out there's a bunch of useless articles from self-proclaimed experts on the sub.
Half of these sites post on Monday "Bitcoin going to 100K $ within three months. says monkey with a funny hat" and on Tuesday "7 reasons why Bitcoin is going to die within a week" just to steal some clicks.
These guys are clueless like everyone else, and just picking numbers out of a hat:
Let's talk about the technology, the blockchain apps and leave fortune tellers to the circus.

"Person who lost a bunch of money hopes to get it back". In other news, water still wet.
Further updates at 5.

Nobody with half a brain would ask for their salary to be in BTC.
You have a family to maintain, rent/mortgage, bills... You need to be able to plan your finances. Getting paid a totally different amount each month would be a) maddening b) a great way to get permanent anxiety.

As a business owner, your first concern should be to stay open and pay your employees. People can HODL all the way with their extra money, but a business needs cash to function. Blaming them is extremely superficial.
At the same time, accepting Bitcoin spreads the word and doesn't hurt anyone. It's a perfectly legitimate choice, and if you want mainstream adoption, that's where it starts.
