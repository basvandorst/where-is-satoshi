Please forgive me if I am being redundant here, I don’t have time to review prior comments...
This campaign is not only immensely generous but also a perfect opportunity to drive proliferation. I hope this is apparent to all of you... If an outstanding organization is not yet set up to accept btc, make them aware of this campaign and be sure to provide some instruction as well. The greatest potential benefit here is not in the bitcoins given but in the cascade of organizational interest and adoption that may be brought about with a somewhat concerted effort on the part of a few redditors.
The Multidiciplinary Association For Psychadellic Studies is a worthy cause. See their efforts in and around PTSD therapy utilizing MDMA. Rick Doblin is the CEO.

Faulty logic. They cannot prohibit crypto because they do not have global prohibition reach. They would have long ago banned the barbarous relic (having soaked up 7 trillion dollars in value and largely insulating its owners from vampiric Inflationary practices) but the Empire understands that they must remain somewhat competitive and relevant lest countless other countries will out compete them in the free market that is the world regulatory landscape. Outside of what this “representative” is paid to “think” as of late by the regulatory capture set, it is widely understood within the deep state that a country prohibits at its own risk, less that country watch capital, talent, innovation and numerous other forms of advantage flow to those political jurisdictions that respect and welcome it.
Multipolar world Gentleman. If US steps up BTC demonization rhetoric it becomes all the more appealing to the burgeoning global powers presently vying to trade outside the petrodollar paradigm. Game theory brought us the blockchain. Game theory demonstrates its continued viability and resilience in a world of competing global interests.
TLDR in Cliches: Cat is out of the bag, genie not going back in the bottle.
“You wanna stay alive, stay with me! ((BTC)
Any group that would bury their head in the sand will see undue advantage flow to their adversaries.

Have you considered different names for the service? BitPatron  etc.  Imagine people repeating the name of your product endlessly on TV. Satsbacer makes sense but it could be more catchy...
