Doesn't it remove signatures from the transaction itself?  
Also thanks for the downvotes, wasn't even a controversial statement.  Just because something has benefits doesn't mean it has zero downsides

I paid for dinner and drinks last night with BCH, a haircut last week with BCH, and cover for a Jazz bar in BCH.  
All this week.  What do you mean it can't be used for anything?

Why is the interview insulting him?  Seems reasonable.  Interview sometime, insult them a bunch, splice the interview, and lost just the favorable bits?  
Why does our community think this makes btc look any better?
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:21:33
That shows the benefits, it doesn't mean there aren't sound reasons not to like it as well.

Only BTC is accepted?  Sounds like San Diego isn't very crypto friendly :/ .  Sorry to hear that

How does this break YouTubes TOS?

Without RBF the miners will work on the first attempt in the mempool, not the one with the higher fee... that's what RBF is.

I wasn't there, but from the photos I've seen there was a BCH booth, and it looked to be at least partly a BCH event
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:42:12
Yes, you don't seem to know much about BCH yet insult that whole camp.  Look into it more and you'll likely be pleasantly surprised by what you learn, it's not just a fork trying to "steal" the bitcoin name. 
In 2 weeks the block size is being increased to 32MB which should give it enough scalability for the foreseeable future immediately, keeping fees at 1 satoshi/byte for a long time.
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:13:27
I think 0 satoshi transactions can go through, but that's up to the miners...  
It's also $450 per 10 minutes, and once the blocks fill it could be 2 satoshi's/byte, or 3 etc, until the miners block the attack.  
Could happen, but I don't see why someone would spend thousands of dollars per hour to do longer than a proof of concept.  
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:54:49
It requires an incredible amount of transactions to fully fill up 32MB block consistently every 10 minutes to hold down the network, and eventually it fills up, the fees will increase (just slower than BTC), making the cost of the attack cost more and more.  
So, to do this type of attack you'd need to be a whale with deep pockets, and miners can choose not to include these obvious spam transactions.

My understanding is that they both are from the original Bitcoin genesis chain.  I do agree that there needs to be a clearer separation between the two, but they are both versions of Bitcoin.  
Thanks for giving an answer to this.

When will it not be?

BCH is getting them ready
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:37:10
It sounds like he is using RBF to do the double spend in that article
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:05:10
I was given an ad for the event a few days earlier at a Tokyo Bitcoin meetup.  
On that ad it said Roger would be showing up and giving a talk, it also had BCH featured...  
Sure it wasn't a BCH focused event, but he didn't randomly show up to shill

For things like cars, wait the 10 minutes for a confirmation.  
Large purchases have lots of paperwork to process anyways, and can be repo'd in the case of bad actors.   0conf is great for everyday transactions
@_date: 2018-04-30 01:51:41
Lol, they never doubled it so much.
1MB -&gt; 8MB -&gt; 32MB
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:44:41
It only uses the space used in the block.  
If there is 100KB of transaction in a block, then the block is 100KB.  If it is 1500KB, then it uses 1500KB, etc.  
32MB is the maximum block size.  
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:36:33
Double spending isn't easy without RBF, requires collusion with miners to do it, no one will risk their reputation on a coffee / something that is not majorly expensive.  And if it's expensive, can wait for a block, same as BTC
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:20:11
Just trying won't make a double spend happen.  Sure it's free, but it won't work.  
If you think it is that easy, then please demonstrate it and watch BCH tank.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:53:07
Where's the fraud?
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:08:45
Is that just for the transaction fee?
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:29:03
I'm not a newcomer, I like Bitcoin Cash.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:05:25
Why will it be deleted?   These are legitimate questions.
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:18:15
"special guest Roger Verr", and it had a poorly placed Bitcoin Cash logo on the ad paper.  
I only got the invitation from the Bitcoin meetup the day earlier, it didn't look very professional
