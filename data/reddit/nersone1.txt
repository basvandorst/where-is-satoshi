I really don't have any more info of the purchase.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:21:30
The town is called Požega, it is located in the mainland region called Slavonia.

Yeah actually I went around the campus asking people what do they think where the price will aim at.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:37:51
What a steady climb... feels magnificent just to look at it
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:42:40
They owe you an apology.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:25:07
Yes, that's correct. It's a small village near the city of Požega.

Here we go boys, I hope that we will break that lil resistance at around 9330
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:35:50
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:37:35
Tell us more!
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:33:49
Požega je u pitanju :)
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:23:16
The amount of people that are scared and that legitimately think this is going lower towards the 8-9k is too damn high!
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:34:30
Nope, but I sure will! Can't wait for the moment when I will try to explain to my grandma that I paid for cottage cheese with a currency you can't hold in your hands. :D

I expected a big pump right now but this sudden movement shocked me
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:57:56
What do you think when will we see some mayor correction?
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:59:33
Touch of 10k then pullback to 9350 seems reasonable
@_date: 2019-06-05 10:05:49
We might get past 8100 today, fingers crossed!
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:31:14
Congrats my dear friend, people like you are real heroes!
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:44:37
Don't be scared
@_date: 2019-04-12 15:40:07
That's how you spot the Sopranos fan!
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:59:29
Obvious troll
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:27:57
Give it a couple of hours and it will get pumped up to 8300 hahah this is plain crazy
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:16:47
Now back to reality...
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:28:37
Don't you worry, don't you worry child!
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:11:21
You really can't know for sure, I thoughr that two days ago we would start using the 8000 as support
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:53:09
Market seems to be pretty weird these days, or is it just me that thinks like that?
