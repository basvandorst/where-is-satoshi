This guy... hes funny.
@_date: 2013-10-04 06:33:42
We have at least as much to judge him on as any elected official.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:37:06
Different guy =p I have a 100% confirmed with instant coins account.  Back when I bought the first few times (and sadly spent them all...) they always came on time.
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:46:25
Ouch... right in the hope and change.
@_date: 2013-10-18 07:47:19
If you aren't prepared to make fun of the current financial systems, you aren't ready to understand the true benefits of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:12:38
Obviously this is far outside the norm/average size, but I am curious, what would happen if some particular block did exceed the current 1MB cap?
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:08:08
I like how they declared it not &lt;thing&gt; without properly defining &lt;thing&gt;...  I'm pretty sure "ability to buy drugs with it" is close to a damn solid definition of "money".
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:25:42
50 was hit!
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:33:25
Their sample is the set of people who take surveys.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:34:01
Point is, you can't avoid the banks
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:58:12
Thats just being smart about your expenses =P
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:36:09


Bullshit, these people already do massive and effective tax dodges, regulations are about making criminals of the up and comers who might threaten the status quo.
@_date: 2013-05-07 22:43:01
Bitcoins are scarce, intrinsic value!
You can declare anything an "intrinsic" value, however, it only derives value from subjective desires, your ability to hit someone with a gold bar is of no value without a desire or necessity to.
I figured if anywhere people would understand that objective value is dead it would be around here... but I guess people just want to play the same word game as everyone else and stick their fingers in their ears and pretend it isn't so.
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:13:07
And it was a good thing.  The reason it shot up afterward isn't because "silk road is evil, and now its gone", its because "maybe silk road is the ONLY thing that makes bitcoin valuable" then it wasn't.
@_date: 2013-07-06 00:38:26
Well, credit unions exist, its not the markets fault if people are too stupid to choose the best deal.
@_date: 2013-06-05 05:13:15
Why do you think they make kids say the pledge every day?
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:49:00
They're back up, but my incoming bitcoins are still "pending" =/
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:17:27


Unless you have a lease...
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:50:30
Stably increasing at ~12% a day!
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:36:46
They can if they print more of the money, and the enforcers believe it has value...
@_date: 2013-03-22 07:14:05
~2 weeks (adjusts to target rate of 10 min per block), however if there is a massive increase in hash rate, it would seem these will be generated faster
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:41:44
I just figured that was the joke...
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:38:10
GUIZE WE NEED TO GO TO WAR WITH THE WORLD, FOR THE ECONOMY!
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:18:31
So what you're saying is, I should look for the next thing they start making fun of and invest in it!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:25:51
If by "vanished without a trace" you mean "gave 2 weeks notice of shutting down, then shut down" sure...
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:46:41
I know at least in WA, everyone makes the &gt;$9 min wage, even tipped positions.  Not sure how many states it is, but I know at least a few others have the standard/local minimum for everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:27:27
Because USA BTC ban is incoming, you know, to PROTECT DA CHILDRENZ
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:59:48
Obviously because you're secretly a corrupted greed monger who wants a slice of the future pie.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:33:03
Where you pretended macro counts =p
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:14:40
... woosh?
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:13:33
Sustainabubble just sounds so smooth though.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:05:28
To fix the problems, the owners would have to consider them problems.  We're gonna get fucked before we get fixed.

Sheep is gone, when did BMR close?

The only way to stop the global integration is a global authority, we certainly don't need one, but don't fool yourself into thinking they aren't trying.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:10:09
They might fall apart in the process, and nothing of value will be lost.
@_date: 2013-10-05 05:45:28
Knowing the answer and thinking it is a crazy joke is pretty much being half way there.  Hope yet rings.
Damn now I sound crazy.
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:02:33
6 min late, so its already going back down apparently.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:57:59
I don't think thats unreasonable to say, however I doubt any single legal outlet will surpass silk road for at the very least a loooong time.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:13:14
I like the idea, but "you are told" opens up a ton of further questions.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:05:27
Hope so... need moar.

An optimist calls the pessimist a realist.

And if they get any bigger, they get fucked. See: liberty dollar

"Well the news told me the economy is getting better!"

Being apolitical is a very powerful political stance.
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:07:01
I'm glad you are willing to use violence to cover for being a shitty parent.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:59:59
So far you seem like the sure loser!
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:55:54
Hey now, they still get to kill tons of people, thousands more than they would be able to otherwise, yay military!
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:20:36
Just like his recommendation of creating a housing bubble right?  Or comparing the internet to the fax!
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:05:08
Less than every other transfer company (read: credit cards, paypal, etc)
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:44:11
You forgot the 
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:15:01
You didn't hyperbolicize doom and gloom.  Don't you know anything about presentation?
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:16:50
Well yeah, how would they seem relevant if they weren't associating violence with drugs by forcing in person illegal transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:15:57
Well, if you don't the cops will shoot you, and if you shoot them you get SWAT teamed.  Then the government has all them "liberty terrorists".  Its like you're forgetting the nature of government.
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:11:09
Choose one

Governments destroy many, many more lives under the guise of "protecting people" by 


Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:36:17
Calling violent defense of others freedom "murder", stay classy statists.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:46:13
Good, lets crash it, people who actually understand what the fuck it is will get yet another go around.
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:51:49
Ohh, do you want to sell me lead coated solid gold too?
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:51:21
"we couldn't figure out the source of the money" = automatically criminal sex traffickers, horrah US government!
(spoiler: it was probably drugs and tax dodgers, or people sending unfriendly letters to their competition that has powerful friends)
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:32:22
So, what lie are they telling us to convince people this one is in their benefit?
@_date: 2013-10-07 21:21:25
Less than what you pay off/buy the government with.
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:34:40
The only favorable legislation that could happen is no legislation.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:28:23
Well, part of the instant transaction confirmation is completing a prior purchase so, my guess as to your questions would be, respectively, no and yes.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:51:42
It lost its whole day worth of gains! (for like, 20 minutes)
@_date: 2013-10-21 00:48:58
If the government isn't in on your crime profits, it will charge you.  Never refuse to give the mob its cut.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:56:52
Surely it is also completely up to date!
