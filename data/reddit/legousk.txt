I don't have a computer that has never been online and I can use to create the wallet and I don't have a printer but I have an old smartphone.  That's pretty much the reason why I asked this.

No hassle with the public and private keys, I mean, look at them, they are ugly, nobody can remember them and I bet a lot of people begin to tremble only by seeing those things (my mom would). Of course the public and private key will always be part of bitcoin, but just make them invisible and only use the QR-code or something, make them work behind everything you see.

Here it says they have a web-interface that can be used on all popular mobile products, including Android, Iphone and Ipad. (Dutch)
So it's just a web based wallet i think

I saw a glimpse of "iOS support" in the beginning of the video. Apparently Blockchain got their wallet back on the Apple systems.

I think "simply issue colored coins" is something you can say in 1 to 3 years, not at the moment.

My guess is that they need a big player to come on board with their system to get going. Every service they provide is free, which is impossible if you think about it. Somebody her said that they would charge the businesses a fee for using their users, but to achieve that they need a big player (or multiple) to actually get those fees. They can't keep going on VC forever.

Their estimation is even higher, miners gonna have a bad time.

To be fair I don't think this is a problem, most of people don't care at all about what happens with their personal information (facebook would have been gone a long time ago if people actually really cared). And I guess someone like you can get their Bitcoins by other manners without having to deal with these ATMs.
This is great exposure, and makes bitcoin more accessible for a LOT of people.

Thanks for your answer, I get it now. 
How secure is it to store bitcoins via Mycelium as storage? I understand that it's not cold storage but I would like to know how safe it is if I made a backup and have the password written down on a secure place and deleted the private key of my phone.

I know it's not 100% proof, but I have been keeping track of this site for some time and it does a pretty good job at predicting next difficulty, next mining difficulty jump is predicted to be 3B+.

Why don't they just show their bitcoin adress? I would love to donate but $50 is a little bit to much for my cheap college student ass.

That's what I was thinking, if there is war, I guess investing in mining power to overcome your opponents could be a problem. 
Do you think that people could invest as much power as a government could do?

I think this conference is more for businesses, even if I agree they could have made it cheaper.
If you wanna pay with bitcoin, you have to click on the "Bitcoin 2014 Building the digital economy Purchase regular ticket" thingy between the "Pay with bitcoin" and the "pay with iDeal Amex Mastercard VISA". That will redirect you to BitPay (if you pay with bitcoin, there are no fees, like it should be).

They are talking about the fact that bitcoin is not good as medium of exchange, worse as a store of value and not useful as a unit of account.
Then they talk about the security risks for users, in the Netherlands, savers deposits are secured to up to €100.000,-.
And their last point is that in 2030, the majority of coins will be mined, which means transaction costs will have to rise to maintain the system.

They seem trustworthy to me:
The only thing I'm not sure about is importation costs, as they ship from Australia.

That bitcoin donation doesn't work really well for me, on the donation page the 50 is not next to the rest of the sentence.
"Amount in $
And when clicking on the donation button the text input box you are talking about is also really weird with some kind of square around the first 0 of the bitcoin amount...

Hi Jim,

I have Mycelium wallet installed on my phone, and I made a backup of my bitcoins, and verified it. But now Mycelium is saying that "Back-up is missing" again (4 days later). Do you have to backup your wallet like very few days? Or what is the reason for this message?
