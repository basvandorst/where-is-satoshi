This is a shitpost
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:02:02
Wasnt the founder the guy from mtgox?
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:47:19
This is me. I use shitty mycelium. What can i use instead? Bonus if it lets me see my bch so i can sell that crap
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:18:12
I think as soon as LN starts to become mainstream we should increase the blocksize. These two things in combo could kill off a lot of the alts
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:53:16
Bcash is a better name
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:18:54
Fucked Up beyond Definition
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:45:38
Wow! Whoever came up with that reason should be ashamed of themselves
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:52:08


You take that back!!
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:16:38
Pretty much everything. If you're knowledgeable in any topic they talk about you quickly realise how corrupt they are and how bad their experts are
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:35:55
lmfao this guy has never been to a party
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:46:27
This is my humble opinion. Duplicate posts don't bother me. I'm fine with it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:50:55
Clever microsoft

I was definitely tipped in the past but I change accounts quite often so can't remember my old account names :(
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:18:57
I think it's just a misunderstanding
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:08:43
Lmao u got him
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:02:29
Hahaha that is one way to put it
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:34:07
Yeah but it doesn't really matter. People misuse euro all the time by saying euros
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:12:06
Wrong. When did you get into bitcoin? It's a currency
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:30:42
The first iphone was shit. No app store either.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:13
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:24:22
If LN doesn't work, it's bye bye for btc
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:14:01
I'm not a bch shill and I think bitcoin needs a lot of work. It's not in a good place tech wise right now
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:59:10
You've misunderstood my comment. It was to enlighten you about an alternative way of thinking, not to tell you about me specifically.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:25:17
Will the bank let you use bitcoin profits?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:45:49
Well to be honest some of us have no desire to change it back to fiat. We invested in our ideas and principals.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:45:50
Thoughts on cardano project?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:06:07
Feed the man!!
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:22:48
Step away from your internet enabled device, please.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:06:36
Disclaimer: i want bitcoin to be the future.
How can you use bitcoin in a shop if the confirmation takes over 5 seconds and the tx fee is higher than nearly 0?
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:18:16
What can you use instead?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:02:19
Hahaha that is one way to put it
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:25:17
Social learning is a method of learning. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:38
Agreed. Fuck someone for asking a question online? Let people ask what they want
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:02:03
Hahaha that is one way to put it
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:21:20
Dude prepare for PMs
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:47:35
I get these ads too. Wonder if they're targetting people during dips?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:27:16
No holidays either
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:23:47
I'm also not using the majority of the euro/dollars/pounds I have. They're in savings.
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:21:46
If it doesn't matter then why would new terms be invented and catch on?
By the way, # is now both pound and hashtag. Dial in to a conference call.. it won't tell you to press hashtag after your participant ID - LOL
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:02:11
Yes you can. If a few govs banned it a lot of people would get out
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:08
Turn your phone around
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:29:20
Refreshing stack choices!
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:07:16
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:04:57
I came here for comments about this. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:18:35


what? links?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:17:00
You sign up to an exchange (coinbase for example). You prove your identity using your ID documents (passport, driving license) and webcam/phone camera.
Then you use a credit or debit card to buy some bitcoins. You don't have to buy a full bitcoin. You can buy 0.2, 0.002, 0.00123123 if you want.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:45:21
No worries. On coinbase you can also buy LTC and ETH but not other currencies like LISK or RXP
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:45:21
Yeah how can this be known?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:19:12
Hey, "one true Bitcoin" is my fork's name
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:57:03
haha thanks I was thinking wallet.bat
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:14:35
But what will a bit be worth in the future?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:15:25
I agree with you. I have bitcoin and couldn't tell you the value I have in bits
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:18:41
I'd buy that
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:02:44
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:20:14
choo choo the internet comes to a stop
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:02:01
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:17:28
I'll buy one of your coins for 50 euro
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:15:52
For me, I would use it to pay off my house. If I didn't need to do that and I was already rich.. then I would use it to fund some really early stage startups. 10k a pop for 10%
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:52:25
U got played son
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:54:37
Nice quote but still not true
@_date: 2018-07-01 08:02:19


which country?
@_date: 2018-07-01 08:01:03
ok, so you don't know
@_date: 2018-07-01 08:31:52
has he confirmed?
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:59:00
does anyone else still love bitcoin? it's not about the price (I've never sold and stopped buying a long time ago). it's about freedom from 3rd parties for digital transactions. that's really important in my opinion. I'll start buying again when the price is better and we can start using it.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:25:36
congrats
