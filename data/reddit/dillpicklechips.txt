Bitcoin enables a global, decentralized, economy and culture to emerge.  The currency of the "decentralized citizen". The pillers of such society will be designed and run by crypto and computers, designed to resist tampering and manipulation.... maybe.

@_date: 2014-10-08 10:34:32
I think they are just using the public part of the seeds and the servers quickly starts scanning from the beginning addresses that the seed creates. Who knows what kind of logs they keep though. If you are worried about privacy you will have to wait for the software wallets to be updated for the trezor and use tor if you are really paranoid.

@_date: 2014-10-27 00:09:44
Probably not. A lot of alt coins are speculative instruments expecting to do see future gains. By pegging they lose that. For features people actually want I predict a sidechain will be made for all of them.

Isn't keeping records of identities very dangerous? Won't the databases eventually be leaked? Since bitcoin is a ledger all privacy could be at risk. Not only would your wealth be public but everything you bought as all dots are connected for who everyone is on the blockchain. It's nothing like credit card hacks since you also lose your privacy.

LOL, or blockchain: lied once when young?
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:38:04
All you have to do is hash the document. Use that hash as the password for a "brainwallet". Send BTC to the address associated with that private key and then empty the address back to yourself. That address is now part of the blockchain and you can show that the hash of your document does lead to an address and you don't have to use a third party website.

That is correct, currently. As it grows though, the ability to do your buy/dump attack would be unfeasible. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:17:15
Once a compatible Electrum comes out you would use addresses that are associated with the device. It doesn't protect other addresses but uses it's own and never reveals the private keys. Hot/Cold wallets aren't needed with Trezor. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:24:59
Once sidechains are implemented there will be a few anonymous sidechains each using different techniques. Each sidechain can be created without a fork. I guess it could take years but I'm certain it will happen and will provide a quick easy way to anonymize your bitcoins without losing any with exchange rates by converting back and forth between different alt coins. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 04:28:12
Unplanned. Forks are sometimes good though. I'm speculating that the hardest part about releasing bitcoin updates is the extra care required to make sure an unplanned fork does not occur. I'm sure the stress of knowing how much money is on the line doesn't help either.

Imagine I have 0.0001 BTC that is marked "IPOStock". When I move that 0.0001 BTC to someone else I may pay a fee and it may be higher than the actual cost of the BTC I'm moving. That's ok because what that 0.0001 represents will likely be worth more than that because of what it can be redeemed for. You could even mark 1 BTC as the token or colored coin and if the company fails you would still have 1 BTC. This enables people to also BACK assets with Bitcoin.

I just sent you $0.25 without even knowing who you are or what your banking information is. Try doing that with a credit card. I don't have to worry that the information I just sent you exposing sensitive information that could be used to steel the rest. I also don't have to worry about whether the transaction will be approved by someone else.  
Unlike credit cards I authorize the transaction. I don't give anyone a whole bunch of information so they can authorize it for me. That's why people are always at risk of stolen credit cards or store database leaks. Bitcoin is designed for the Internet and works well.

You could price things in BTC but as you know the value goes up and down a lot so people will price in local currency and pay equivalent. 
It's always in flux. So far, on the long run it's going up! I typically save mine and give away a bit to introduce it to others and when I really want to buy something I get it. It encourages saving instead of spending.

For the password pick: "Joe Bitcoin loves Michelle and wants to spend eternity with her! Married 2012-01-01! Any other random love messages..." and create an address for it.

I've always wondered about turning garbage phones into hardware wallets. You disable all the networks and it only communicates with chirp. The app only signs transactions and will never give up the private key. Add a feature where all keys come from a seed like trezor in case the phone dies and you have a secure wallet that would require theft of the phone to steal. 
Using a garbage phone for long term storage while you unlock small amounts on your main phone would be pretty cool!
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:40:09

My favorite quote of the day by Marc Andreessen:
“Bitcoin is a classic venture capital endeavor: It will either work or it won’t. And if it doesn’t work, we will lose all our money. But if it does work, it will work in a spectacular way. Our investments will pay off 1,000 to 1 or 10,000 to 1 or some other crazy extreme, because these markets are so big.’’
‘‘There are serious conversations going on at every single large financial institution. They’re all trying to figure it out. The technology folks who work for the banks are very smart, and the trading floors have split between ‘This is for real’ and ‘This is a joke.’ Yet people are leaving those institutions to start bitcoin companies. We’re seeing hundreds of bitcoin entrepreneurs. Some of them are brand new to financial services. They don’t know what they’re in for, but they’re excited.”
‘‘If you’re used to living in a world where you trust people and institutions, then it probably does seem weird and bizarre that you would trust something where you don’t know who created it. But if you’re in a world where you trust numbers and math and code, it doesn’t matter. There is no appeal to authority. You evaluate it on the basis of the math. It’s just math; it’s completely open."

If I remember correctly, a soft fork means the new mining software will add the new features to the blocks while older software won't be able to but will still build on top of the block, a hard fork means the older software will see it as a violation of the rules and won't build on top of that blockchain.

Coloredcoins are just ways of labelling any portion of BTC. The underlying BTC is always there so the value of BTC doesn't matter as the label is always the same. What that label represents also determines it's value.

Seeds come from random data. They use internal sources and mix it with random data from the computer you are using. This prevents them from trying to manipulate the random source.

Wikipedia could make a record of hashes for all the archival data and use the end hash of the list  as a brainwallet  password so funds aren't stuck. They then have something where it would be impossible to tamper with history. Timestamped into the blockchain forever. A certain history. Digital data timestamped against revisionism. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 04:28:12
I think they designed it so that everytime you get a transaction the public address you see is changed. It's better to use a new address everytime. Because its a HD wallet you always have all the keys. You can never lose any of the private keys as long as you have the seed. No matter how many addresses you have.

@_date: 2014-07-15 07:16:17
I would say no. Vericoin was at risk because it was POS instead of POW which Bitcoin uses. If the theif had such a large pool of funds and held onto them they could create havoc for Vericoin far into the future with double spends with little risk. Since Bitcoin uses POW having a single party own a lot of coins isn't a big deal and the most damage they can do is sell a bunch causing a temp crash in price. It would also be harder to convince a majority of miners to reverse a payment and it would be near impossible with so many miners and so little time to reverse it. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:01:29

@_date: 2014-01-27 06:49:57
Following your premise I would speculate Bitcoin to be the opposite. What if in the future governments demand you use their digital money because they can go after the bad guys better? Perhaps they will force people to use their money and oppress them. Bitcoin is completely optional. It's for everyone to use as they wish. There is no compulsion in Bitcoin. If anything, Bitcoin could help save against the future "mark of beast".
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:20:58
Caveman long ago likely picked up big nuggets of gold and tossed them because they were useless to them. The technology of bitcoin is sound. The market will be very choatic. If it affects you emotionally the best thing to do is ignore prices and do other things.

Bits will bug the nerd and geek but face it, the English language does not always follow logic. Once something has a nickname it's hard to change it even if it is "irrational" so why bother?
Bits is a nice nickname even if it doesn't fit on the metric unit scale. It appears to be related to bitcoin and it's short and easy to say. Trust me, most people don't care about the metric scale and the names of denominations of bitcoins. They will likely see whole bitcoins and bits. Simple.

The chance of making a typo that would work is very very slim. The most likely mistake will be sending to another correct address but mixing it up with another correct address. I'm pretty sure all software checks to make sure it is formatted correctly. At the end of the address the last few characters are a checksum. If you make a typo the checksum at the end will not match the rest of the address and it won't work.

A possible promotional idea for bitcoin would be to head on down to a site like:
  (google search for other popluar zynga groups)
And offer to buy something for them in their game. It will likely be their first exposure to Bitcoin and they might like how easy it is. It will also spread awareness inside the zynga community and perhaps they may get a subset of bitcoiners there! If the community grows the news and other companies will follow. Think of it as spending a few dollars each to grow the bitcoin economy.

Ah, the miracle of multisig! So the biggest risk is someone forging a SMS that is just below max withdrawal threshold and tricking the gateway to publish transaction? How hard is it to snoop on and fake SMS messages?

I think OpenBazaar has the potential to change everything. It's the ultimate global free market. Such a thing has never existed before.

A post by Lucas on the site that I found very interesting:
As soon as OpenTransactions voting pools implementation is ready there is no point to use Ripple over OT. With OT you can have trustless Bitcoin (trough multi-sig voting-pool) and secured Fiat (with Surety Bonds - Bitcoins in voting-pool contract). So trustless exchange / sending of money.
With Ripple you seem to have to trust the issuer always. I don't see how this fits into the cryptocurrency world

If the private key has to be known to the manufacturer, couldn't you just make the chip and software use 2of2 multisig. A security leak from the manufacturer would mean you just lose the hardware security and not the bitcoins?

Quotes from slush talking about a trezor password manager:
The specification is to be released, but generally Trezor has currently capability of AES and ECIES, asymetric cipher based on elliptic curves, and feature of encrypting/decrypting key-value structures. Combining this with hierarchical structure of private keys generated from Recovery seed, there's unlimited count of cipher keys (AES) or private/public keypairs for ECIES which can be used to protect user data.
Each password is basically key-value pair, where 'key' is some identity (username, site) and value is encrypted password for such login. Computer stores blob of these keypairs (it can be local file or cloud-stored file on dropbox, google drive or anything else). Password manager (website like mytrezor) just renders list of stored keys 
(services and logins). If you click the key, value is sent to Trezor, it asks you if you really want to reveal such credentials to connected computer and if so, manager unmask your password just for this particular site.
The encryption will be protected in the same way as sending bitcoin transaction, so PIN and (optional) passphrase.
In near future (except improving Trezor for bitcoin signing usage like BIP70 and multisig) we plan to turn Trezor into identity management token, something similar like failed myIDkey. In contrary to megalomaniacal vision of myIDkey, we want to start with low hanging fruit and improve stuff as time go.
There's already proof of concept for harddisk encryption protected by Trezor:  This works only on Linux, but the concept can be implemented on any OS.
There's plenty possibilities how to integrate Trezor with all stuff directly, like PEM modules on Unix (ssh), Windows login, website authentication, email encryption and signatures etc.
It's really wide scope. Let's see how much interest of Trezor there'll be in Bitcoin community first :-).
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:06:46
It's actually quite easy and I think because people are lazy they will use a trezor. $100 isn't much when you have $1000 worth of BTC you don't want stolen.

Some sites use transaction id to see if it confirms. You can change the transaction without changing the inputs and outputs and get a new transaction id. The site will not see the transaction confirm because the id changed. Known issue and fix at the end of the document.

@_date: 2014-09-15 21:09:48
Found this:
The client sends simple text commands via SMS. The gateway verifies those commands, constructs a transaction and forwards it to the web-service. The web-service verifies, independently from the gateway, and then publishes the transaction to the Bitcoin network. It may seem complicated, but for the end-user it’s really as simple as sending an SMS. And it is secure because we use the phone’s SIM identification through the SMS channel; and, if necessary, we use a Secret PIN as another identifier. The secret PIN is entered using dial tones via a voice call.
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:00:04
It would be a massive security headache except now there are billions at stake! I'd rather see stuff built on top of Bitcoin rather than complicate the base system.

You don't think the mining is productive? The mining ensures that the rules are enforced. Traditional backing with gold was a similar thing. They backed currencies with gold to prevent creating money out of thin air or debt and had something of worth to prevent inflation. The miners secure the network so in a way the whole system is backed by the miners who enforce the rules. Without them the network would fall apart.

I think this is an important part about the zerocoin alt coin from the talk:
But we’re really hoping that nobody comes out of the gate and puts a lot of money in to it because these are very encrypt graphic techniques and it’s possible that the entire thing will breakdown. 
We don’t really know if they’ll at least give us a chance to test this in an environment that’s different from Bitcoins and you don’t have to break anyone else’s stuff in the process of seeing if this will work.

Combines it's own plus the computers. From a pdf:
Generate Entropy
● use HW RNG to generate entropy A (e.g. 256 bits)
● request entropy B from computer (e.g. 256 bits)
● use both entropies to generate final entropy while proving that 
external entropy was used - e.g. E = SHA256(A || B)

I think URS techniques holds a lot of promise for bitcoin.
  "URS can be used to sign messages anonymously (among a group of known users). That is a user can sign a message, hiding among a group of known/registered users, that prevents the verifier from revealing the signer's identity other than knowing that it is in the set of registered users."
What makes this tool interesting is that a group of people can do a CoinJoin and specify multiple output addresses of any size they want. The group just uses URS to announce output addresses and sizes. As long as the total outputs matches the total inputs and you have your own output addresses listed you sign off on the CoinJoin. No one is able to follow whose address belongs to each person since they just announced the outputs with URS.

This comment by jgarzik got me thinking:
"bitcoin will become the root of thousands of decentralized db's"
I think Julian Assange was alluding to a similar idea. All the digital data in the world can now be hashed inside of databases and that database is then hashed again and a bitcoin transaction is created to represent the last hash.
By doing this you can prove digital history. Everybody from large coorporations to small businesses can set up software that provides a means to prove without any doubt that the data existed at that period of time. It would be extremely useful from everything to law firms to medical firms. Their entire IT infrastructure can be set up to prove it wasn't altered after the fact. It would prove useful in cases where the court needs to be involved and they wouldn't even need paper copies to prove their case. For the first time ever, they can't alter the digital files after the fact. Perhaps that was stopping the "paperless office" movement?
Perhaps history can no longer be revised? The blockchain and the data it protects is forever.

The main difference that I see is that blockchains are pegged to each other. So if you wanted something like monero you would create a sidechain implementing the features and you can use it without exposing yourself to speculative value loses or gains. 1 BTC is converted to 1 Sidechain and you can convert back at any time and doesn't use the market to determine conversion. This allows sidechains for any feature you want without having to worry about conversion rates.

Freedom and privacy. The ability for anyone to freely exchange value globally without involving another corporation, government, or person. Digital timestamping of data that is unforgable. Anyone can fund raise directly to the world through colored coins.

First grab a favorite nude picture and put a tiny little bitcoin symbol in the corner. Use that picture every day for your daily deed. Then every day slowly make the bitcoin symbol larger.

The conditioning should work. Please report back for science!

CoinShuffle is a method of mixing coins using the CoinJoin technique. You never risk losing your coins and they are mixed in a way that no person knows the mapping. Wallets like darkwallet will likely implement it in such a way that the mixing can be behind the scenes so you store and keep mixed coins as apposed to trying to mix on spend.

@_date: 2014-01-20 14:57:01
The trezor is the ultimate security device that will extend even beyond bitcoin. It will also enable ultra secure identities that will make online passwords obsolete. I expect online exchanges to integrate the trezor first. By associating a private key as an identity to log on all we would have to do to sign on is enter a user name and click sign on. The website would then give us a string such as: "Mt. Gox. Jan 20 2014 08:01:11 Sign-in authorization for dillpicklechips". I'd then sign the text with the trezor and it would allow me in. It could be used everywhere and every exchange action would have to be signed by the trezor. It would then be impossible to hack my account and steal my credentials without the device. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:09:35

Backing often was used to prevent mass printing of money. It meant anything printed couldn't be debt or just created out of thin air. Bitcoin doesn't NEED to be backed by anything to have the same effect but the mining does do a similar function: it secures the rules of the network.

You would have to use a new Trezor seed. It's possible to create your own and input it into the device. This seed would be all you would need. If you wanted to restore it, there are wallets that will allow you to input Trezor seeds. Once you do this you expose the keys to computers. Trezor seeds should stay on the Trezor unless you know what you are doing. When you initialize it you write down the seed for recovery.

Colored coin development is also being funded you just don't have as many parties you have a stake in it pumping it in the forums. 
Both will offer similar features. The one advantage colored coins offers is that it can securely operate as a light node. Mastercoin has to either download the entire blockchain or trust another party or server to give accurate info. I personally think colored coins will become the dominate protocol but who knows.

Correct, it then becomes important to weigh the pluses of the new features minus the security risk. As the sidechain matures and mining it becomes stronger the risk is reduced.

Those with all the money control the old system. Unlike devices we use in our lives this is one of the main structures of society. Money is critical for society. Those who lose the most from this change will fight with the only tool that could work: propaganda. They will spend fortunes trying to brand bitcoin as a scourge on society and one that will allow terrorists, pedophiles, (any other moral panic of day) and criminals to thrive. They will ignore that fact that like the internet there are uses for good and bad.

Nodes will normally ignore an attempt to double spend. If both TX are out there though, eventually only one will get confirmed. Thats why some people wait for a confirmation if its for substantial amounts.

Mmhm. yeah. mmhm. I know some of these words. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
In seriousness my favorite quotes:
But my focus here is neither ontology nor physics; it is money. Recently Bitcoins and Bitcoin-like things have captured the world’s attention. I suspect that this kind of currency will revolutionize the nature of economies, and consequently the nature of governance. Personally, I am agnostic on whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.
The value of a massless currency in our information based world is clear. Deep-currencies such as Bitcoin offer an attractive approach. But there is an interesting issue that may soon arise. The issue stems from the fact that the production of each note in currencies like Bitcoin requires a large investment of time/energy, and as with gold, this deprives governments of the prerogative to print money. Creditors may like this, but governments will not.

the envelope of scalar performance - important knowledge if we are going to have any hope of knowing how soon our timelocked secrets will
actually be revealed!
Only a single algorithm - SHA256 - is supported by design"
so could bounties be created that test the strength of miners based on how long it takes to crack? if it disapears really fast you know a large entity controls a lot of power when compared to the whole bitcoin network?

-efficient cooling
These same technologies are very useful in the modern era for everyone. The bitcoin economy will push technology and will benefit many.

You actually don't need the site to make a proof. Just hash the files and use that hash as the private key. Send BTC to the address that correlates with the private key. Then empty the address. You can now prove to anyone that the file has existed since the time BTC was in that address.

The part that got my attention was  "we need to spend a lot more money" when talking about security.  Banks and businesses are getting hacked everywhere. Following all the regulations is also expensive. To follow all the regualtions and security the costs add up.
How is the old system going to compete at all with one that is built for the internet where the system demands no compliance with regulation and is voluntary based on location and is more secure with less costs?

I'm not too familiar with armory but for large amounts you load armory on a offline computer and load the private keys. Create the transaction and save it to a usb or something. Then load armory on a online computer to broadcast the transaction. There is guides on their site for doing an offline transaction.

The "microbit" seems to be more popular as the slang term "bit". I don't think people will think it's a full btc either because saying "that will be 2400 bitcoins for the coffee please!" would be silly and they would know that when you said "2400 bits for the coffee" you are talking about ubit.

In a world of many alt coins you run the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Is the alt coin you hold going to be more popular or less in the future? The advantage of sidechains is you can add features quickly and your exchange rate is pegged. You don't have to worry about popularity. As soon as new features are available you can use them and abondon them when not needed. The liquidity between all the sidechains remains the same.

Their hot wallet is using multisig with BitGo. BitGo and Bitstamp must both authorize the transactions from the wallet. They likely have daily max rates set up with BitGo so if Bitstamp is compromised the hacker can't take too much at a time.

I think it would be cool if a website was created like bitaddress that does this. I think the seed also has a checksum so it's not just a matter of picking random words. It would be neat to create a wallet from dice.

Set up the trezor and get a receiving address. Then go to your old wallet and send all the funds to the new address. 
if its a large amount you may have to do a "offline transaction" but that is more complicated.

The hard part would be the actual tampering of the device. You have to open it and change it without breaking it. I don't know if anyone has shown they can do that yet.

If I don't trust the hardware, does using 2 of 2 multisig allow me to use untrusted hardware and still get a boost in security? And if so, how much?

With BitGo as their multisig partner, even IF bitstamp is still hackable at least BitGo would limit the rate at which the theft can occur and limit the damage now.

Everything can be restored from a seed or phrase that can re-create your wallet. If someone takes your laptop they can't steal your coins because they need the trezor. If they steal the trezor they need the pin. If it's stolen just use the seed and send to a new trezor. 
edit: also the computer seed would be written down too.

I'm eagerly awaiting for an exchange to adopt BitID/BitAuth. For everyone with a trezor your credentials can't be compromised. The same security that protects your bitcoins protects your identity. It would be the ultimate in online security and for exchanges that should be their goal! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:07:21
And the Trezor just added multisig support. So even if the hardware has a back door added in shipping (extreme paranoid), using 2 of 2 multisig with your computer being one key, a hacker would also have to compromise your computer in addition to the hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:44:04
I've always thought monero is a good choice. It uses a different type of blockchain that's untraceable and anonymous. You would just purchase monero and transfer the monero to another exchange to convert back to BTC. Unfortunately monero is still hard to use and not much liquidity yet.

A trezor gives pretty much fool proof security. It's easy to screw up and have a security failure on the computer you are using. With a trezor it's hard to lose your funds or have them stolen. It's meant for everyone who is not a security expert.

Of course. I was talking about hacking the individual account, hacking the whole server is always a possibility. I'd hope that exchanges would also make you sign any actions too. It would be hard to have your funds stolen.

@_date: 2015-01-16 23:29:02
Makes sense. So is it possible to use the nfc for phone, trezor for computer usage, all on the same wallet at different times or does greenaddress expect the 3rd key to be backup use only?
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:23:39
With trezor and similar hardware wallets passwords are obsolete. You just sign data with your private keys to sign in. The same security that protects bitcoins doubles to protect identity too.

They would also get a mining pool!
@_date: 2014-10-09 06:25:52
Correct, which is why hash power is a way of securing the network. The larger the network the harder it is to do such a thing. I think the hash rate has got to the point that such a scenario would require massive amounts of money and the 100% would probably be a worse return since you would cause panic.

I think paper wallets have their place but they started before such technologies as the trezor and hardware wallets existed. If the trezor is available, for $100 you can have a device that is secure and fool proof. With paper wallets, it needs a safe environment to make. I'm not sure that's a skill for mainstream. I think trezor type tools are the better solution. 
Their (paper wallets) main usefulness will be pre-loaded wallets done by people who know what they are doing to be redeemed in the future into a hardware protected wallet.

I'm pretty sure you'll need one of these to stop criminals from using encryption since it can't really be uninvented:
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:06:35
Blockchain.info doesn't use multisig and they also send the backups to your email or other places. With a multisig system, the hacker would need the encrypted key and either coinbase's or your own.

Sounds great! What are the fees and rates? Many will want to know that without typing in their credit card number! Who you are is also a little sparse. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:01:00
Without multisig they would have the key which would allow them to spend it. With their 2 of 3 system the key that is shared is encrypted and just stored by them. If you use a good password it's impossible for them to take the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:06:33

Bitcoin uses private keys. Rather than create a whole new key for each address that needs to be backed up, a single random number is used over and over but with extra sequential data so the addresses aren't all the same. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:30:48
Trezor uses random from itself and combines it with the computer. In theory both would have to be compromised so it provides pretty good security.

-there can be many implementations and the trust is only needed for a short time as the coins don't stay in the sidechain, only the ones you want to mix at that moment. It could be tiny bits at a time.
-It obviously won't use the same amounts as the exit from the sidechain and can be delayed in small multiple payments for example.

Thread poster OP conclusion:
The blockchain permanently restricted to 1MB is great if you are a major bank looking to co-opt the network for a next generation limited trust settlement network between major banks, financial service providers, and payment processors.   It is a horrible idea if you even want to keep open the possibility that individuals will be able to participate in that network without using a trusted third party as an intermediary.

I would recommend a smart phone wallet for that amount. Breadwallet for iOS non jailbreaked or Mycellium for Android. Larger amounts and you should have a trezor. Always write the "seed phrase" down. That phrase can always restore your wallet if lost or stolen. And set a pin.

Although it wouldn't be an "offline" paper wallet anymore, you could reboot into tails any time you needed to make a purchase by entering the saved seed at Electrum start up, then reboot when you are done.

There are a few implementations around but AFAIK they use the same math. If zerocash doesn't do a sidechain, I expect a ring signature type sidechain like monero to be designed. Your wallet would move BTC into the sidechain and back and the ring signatures would hide the mapping of BTC.

I would make the paper wallet on a Linux Live CD. This will reduce the chance of any spyware/virus getting the private key. 
And yes, once you have printed out the paper wallet you can send BTC to it. If I were you, I'd create many addresses and split the amounts up. Then you redeem the private keys later you don't have to expose your whole hoard of BTC online and if you screw up with change addresses or something you don't lose it all.

Trezor is cool because you have one seed and every single password you enter creates a whole new wallet. So password "savings" will bring up a different wallet than "spending". 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:54:39
They are different. A trezor also holds btc not just used as a 2fa. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:03:20
It's possible. You just have do program bitcoind to do that for you. I don't know how though.

This means bitstamp users send other bitstamp users BTC using ripple within the site?
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:40:04
Once the trezor is out. Seriously! With this device no one can steal your bitcoins! The average Joe can't do computer security properly so this will fix the problem of security. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 03:55:07
 works good. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:39:17
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. 
On the bright side it will get people familiar with qr codes and that will help people get used to using them for payments and adding new codes for Bitcoin will be really easy. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:58:51
Almost everyone comes up with a bad password for brain wallets. My advice to everyone is to never use them. Random strings are WAY safer!

My machine just grinds away trying to show the MANY ads. Looks horrible. I closed the tab just so my computer could be responsive again. Plus, it has donation links at the top for a ton of other alt coins. Is this a Bitcoin channel or crypto-currency channel?

It's shows up because it is properly formatted address and not because its in the blockchain. That's why it says zero.

Even very smart people can be way wrong sometimes. This is one of those times! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:44:13
An address is dirrived from a private key. When some knows that key they would import the key and spend it to a new address they control.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:38:45
It's going to be hard to since Bitcoin is global not an American company. They'll be able to regulate companies but not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:28:09
A lot of ripples aren't given out but held by one group. Imagine I create a currency and give myself a trillion coins. Now I sell a couple for a dollar each. I now have a trillion dollar market cap! Comparing just market cap can lead to skewed results!

It's a way of showing your bitcoin and digital coins value. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:53:47
IMHO Bitcoin's biggest game changer: we can come to a complete consensus in a "database" despite cheaters everywhere.
It goes beyond money. The blockchain can represent assets and property.   It's the perfect notarizing tool and time stamper. The future is going to be very interesting with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:23:26
There are too many people who love Bitcoin who will create a pool with cheaper fees if it gets out of hand. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:31
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:35:53
I know the answer before I even understand the question. BTC can always help in all areas of the world. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:17:58
The protocol demands the start be a Bitcoin address. All the coins will trace back to them. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 04:06:31
Impossible to crack. Only way is for the person who got it to send it back. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 15:05:27
It operates like Bitcoin so its kind of interesting. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:55:38
My thoughts exactly. I can't imagine them taking hold like Bitcoin. For many it's a quick way to double up and then go back to Bitcoin so in many ways just a pump and dump scheme. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 04:38:56
Looks like someone's clock is set wrong. Timestamps in blocks don't always go in order.

@_date: 2013-12-09 01:39:54
You were doing a trade for 10k in a secluded area with a stranger?
Any large amount must be somewhere with cameras and lots of people. Some banks even have lobbies for a casual business transaction. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:15:21
Yes. So rare it will not happen. Way more things to worry about. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 05:10:53
Noooo, don't give hints!! ;)
Seriously though, now someone is going to feed a GPU farm with every recipe found online and alter them bit by bit and see if they can crack it. Hopefully it is truly unique. You could always add random data at the end to increase the security. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 03:51:04
yifuguo you tease. It's just enough I just want to know more about your plans! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:45:38
The keys are generated on your computer and are not uploaded. That's why people use a live CD and a computer not connected to the internet to be safe. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:05:03
It depends on the amount you are storing. For a tiny bit it does not matter. If you are storing a huge amount and you will be destroyed emotionally if its gone, I'd go the paranoid route.

Oh. That's interesting!

@_date: 2013-12-31 01:30:40
When you are called is there a pin the calling services gives too? 2 pins. One the user gives and one the provider gives. That would prevent spoofing to get the pin since they will know the phone number from the text.

Emotions will always be a problem. It's hard not to get jealous or paranoid that it is somehow too good to be true. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:55:02
If its a watch only address it means the private key isn't entered. To spend it you have to import the private key. Just make sure you spend the change back to a new paper wallet when you are done.

@_date: 2013-05-07 01:29:00
You can always check the address at blockchain.info and see if the funds are there. If they remain there for years, chances are no one else has the key. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:05:17
Bookmarked for the future when it's worth more. Great for the history books. 
His biggest argument is that you need something to back up a currency with another asset. This is gold. For whatever reason, gold doesn't need to be backed up with an asset though... Bitcoin's price will come from it's demand because it is useful, despite not having a physical object to back it up. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:20:25
Offer to train others for BTC and hold on to them and sell when they hopefully appreciate a bit. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:46:20
That's ok, the rest of the world will use them then! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:12:27
Bitcoins are controlled by having the private key. The public key is the address. Brain wallets are created by using any string of characters and converting it to a private key. MOST people pick a bad string of characters for their brain wallet. There are HUGE farms of computers that crunch every book, internet quote, poem, password combinations,  and create HUGE databases of private keys so that anytime someone uses it is as a brain wallet their BTC is stolen. Imagine a wallet that is already loaded with millions of addresses and the associated private keys.

Bitcoin won't drastically change the world but it will eliminate those who control the creation and flow of money to maintain their advantage over others. 
At least that's what I'd reply if I didn't have to register. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:25:05
@_date: 2013-09-19 05:27:16
Who knows. What if the price skyrockets? It may become easier to acquire Bitcoins through mining than using an exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:44:31
But never online so it can't leak private keys and only communicates to other devices in a very controlled manner. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:53:22
A comparison to total citizens online for each country would be interesting too. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:27:40
The perfect app would be both parties have a smart phone app that does micro-payments on a per-minute basis. At anytime either party can close the deal and the Bitcoins already sent can't be undone. The app would also forward the Bitcoins to another address to prevent robbery. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:33:17
Does blockchain.info show the transaction going to the new address? If so, it will show up once it's confirmed. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:18:55
Why would you wait for a confirmation? You can tell a payment is sent right away. If it's coffee then its fine. If you are buying a car you might wait for a confirmation!
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:13:14
That may be too hard for the typical user right now.

Ah, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:22:10
At least it's not a complete scam site that looks identical with the one extra feature of creating bad keys to steal later.
ALWAYS BE EXTRA CAREFUL ABOUT THE ADDRESS! Especially with a site like this where a typo can cost you ALL your BTC!!

If you want someone you can trust I can walk you through moving the BTC safely. First disconnect the computer the Bitcoins are on from the Internet. I thought I saw windows. That is way too much for windows to safely handle.

@_date: 2013-11-09 17:10:54
From the FAQ:
How do I claim a refund?
In the Pre-Order stage we do not handle refunds. A refund will be possible in case of TREZOR not being shipped at all.
@_date: 2013-11-02 04:52:53
Use cavirtex and use the bill payment option to fund your account. The fees are a little high but they have been around a while and are pretty reliable. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:15:54
The Bitcoin boat will sail on with or without the U.S. They will be hurting themselves if they decide not to join the party.

Depends on how much and how much security you want. Paper wallets are the most secure. Blockchain.info is VERY secure if you pick an unusual alias and a good password. Just make sure to back up your wallet off of blockchain.info

Perhaps alt coins will stay but I don't see them taking any more than something like 5% of the market in the future. I really don't see any advantage of any of them right now over Bitcoin.
"Both Litecoin and Bitcoin development teams have turned their backs on the idea of incorporating anonymity into the protocol itself."
False. Something like zerocoin has to be tested first. This is peoples money after all.
"Great the miners have voted to institute a mandatory 1.5 percent transaction fee on all bitcoin transactions. There's no competition so why not, if I was a miner I would vote it in without hesitation."
Every miner can set their own rules for fees. Its a free market and I'm sure some miners will have cheaper fees than others. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:19:13
I think this will bring high security mainstream. Thank you for your important project!
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:57:38
No one know what they are worth. It's like if gold was suddenly discovered how would you figure out the price? Free market and whatever people want to buy and sell it at. Bitcoin is very new and going through a "price discovery" phase. It's new and not that big but the technology allows pretty impressive things and that's why people are speculating on its value. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:40:52
Not without being anonymous somehow and still be cheat proof. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:26:47

@_date: 2013-11-09 00:56:05
A live CD that just boots up will have little random data. Using the computer, typing, moving the mouse all help mix up the random data a bit. It's probably not required but if your paranoid enough...
@_date: 2013-10-27 03:16:59
Use an electrum seed. It will give you 12 words. It's very secure. It's all you have to write down.
@_date: 2013-06-02 15:33:58
It's people dumping large amounts of BTC to sell. As the bid orders are filled the price falls. The more coins you sell the larger the fall in price. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:33:03
Nope just wait. It means its not in a block yet. It will show up eventually. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:48:01
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:34:50
Might help quicken Bitcoin's rise as it will be easier to purchase and trade for them. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 22:52:01
I think the most effective way would be to communicate with everyone that all money tipped to you will go to others. Provide your address as proof or whatever. Then people may tip you knowing you'll pass it on.

Cell phone texts could work too. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:42:26
All disruptions have been with the web wallet the trezor connects too. Other software such as Electrum and Multibit work too if you would rather a local wallet. I have never heard of a single case of stolen funds from a trezor. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:48:10
The only thing better for me would be a Bitcoin meet up for buying and selling.
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:53:03
There's always  where you can sell something for about $30 worth of BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:17:33
I'm not familiar with MultiBit. I'll let another who is take over from here. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:41:09
It distracts attention from Bitcoin on something that is pretty much a clone with minor modifications. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:38:13
In blockchain.info when you send a payment use the "shared coin" option for sending funds. It helps a little bit. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 06:57:56
It's funny that you made me think about my kids and looking forward to them talking instead of enjoying the babble talk!

Boy do I wish I discovered Bitcoin then! At least I'm still an early adopter compared to the rest of the world!
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:40:57
Shared Coin uses "Coin Join" seen here:
Shared Send is specific to blockchain.info and they do the mixing. I'm not sure what one is better though? 
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:39:01

@_date: 2013-11-03 19:51:46
You could go to a dump and retrieve old computers and scan all the hard drives. It would take a lot of work but it would only take one lost wallet to make it worth it. I'm sure a lot of private keys are lost forever and the hard drive they exist on is corroding right now.

It's just another way of proving that whoever created the block did some type of work so it can't just create blocks instantly. It prevents cheating. Hashes are pretty much useless data other than providing a very well understood method of preventing cheating. Primecoin tries to find a certain type prime number chains. I don't think those prime numbers will be THAT useful other than interesting novel primes.

I haven't used coinbase and I'm a little uncertain of your question. Once you have created the wallet and it's printed out you go into coinbase and I'm sure there is somewhere where you can "send BTC" in that spot you would type out the addresses that are on your paper wallet. Once they are sent they no longer exist on coinbase but on your paper wallet.

Hey, I was thinking about that a bit ago! Here's how it works:
To timestamp and prove a file exists from a certain date you would:
-create a hash of the file
-use that hash as the private key of a brain wallet
-send coins to that address and then back to another address
-to prove the timestamp you just announce the private key and address together and since the address did in fact receive coins in the past its recorded in the blockchain and since no coins are there anymore its safe to reveal the private key (just make sure you never use it as a change address!)

Not if you use "shared coin". On the blockchain it mixes your coins with someone else and uses their coins to make the payment while yours go somewhere else. It's pretty basic and works good enough for most people BUT if someone REALLY wanted to, they could use fancy analysis to possibly undue the mixing. It would be hard though.

Yes, lost forever. No, the system doesn't know. No, because BTC are infinitely divisible. If there was 1 BTC or 1 billion BTC it doesn't matter, what matters is how many units they can be divided into. In theory, there is no limit for BTC. (although currently it's 8 decimal places)

Q11: Can you realistically perform the chosen-ciphertext attack on GnuPG?
To apply the attack to GnuPG, we found a way to cause GnuPG to automatically decrypt ciphertexts chosen by the attacker. The idea is to use encrypted e-mail messages following the OpenPGP and PGP/MIME. For example, Enigmail (a popular plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically decrypts incoming e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An attacker can e-mail suitably-crafted messages to the victims, wait until they reach the target computer, and observe the acoustic signature of their decryption (as shown above), thereby closing the adaptive attack loop.
I believe they had to know what the un-encrypted text was prior to figure out the key for decryption. Private keys are unique to each address. I don't know if message signing would expose the key?

Then copy and paste that hash to the brain wallet password. You then copy the private key and public address and forget the rest. 
When you spend from it make sure to spend anything that is left over to a brand new paper wallet.

Worst case you could export the key for that address. Create a new wallet and import that key. See if that works. Back up the wallet too first. A rescan will probably work too.

All amory addresses come from an initial "seed". Once the seed is known an unlimited amount of addresses can be generated. The 100 addresses thing applies to bitcoin-qt.

MyBitcoin becomes really quick easy way to use Bitcoin. It's a shared wallet where the owner knows all private keys unlike blockchain.info. Site shut down claiming theft. A little bit of BTC was refunded but most stolen.

Try talking to gox or tradehill directly. I think there can be arrangements where large buyers are matched with large sellers. But whatever they do don't just dump the money in the market. They will over pay for a lot of coins.

Not sure what you are asking. I see Bitcoin like the Internet or even cash. It's a tool. Used for good and bad. I have faith that the good will be the largest of its uses.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:47:59
It will also allow distributed IPO, bonds, asset exchange. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:12:10
Yup it will be used by the trezor and uses more words and more flexible uses. I predict most other software that uses deterministic wallets will use bip39 with electrum maybe switching one day.

First I would open Bitcoin-Qt and sync with the network. I would then give you one of my addresses. When you send it to me, right away a message pops up with transaction received. I can see in the transactions section that I have a payment to me but it's not yet confirmed. After a bit, I can see that it confirms. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:55:06
Note that users can still use older versions as it only affects miners. But, it's always a good idea to run up to date Bitcoin software anyways.

MYSELF, I'd ask for deposit and convert to $ at that time using 24hr rate. Then when done what US dollars are left convert back at the last day the remaining cash using 24 hr rate. I'd make sure it's all agreed before the trip. If value goes down you lose if value goes up they lose. But you are doing the service and statistically it goes up.

I know, but you can still tell its sent. It doesn't have to be in the blockchain for you to know if a payment was sent. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:36:00
I'd just switch to a deterministic wallet. Then you have unlimited addresses and you never have to keep track of what keys you have. And you only have to write down the initial seed as a back up.

Favorite part:
At the same time, Bitcoin is a novel case. Its scarcity has been achieved without tangibility. It was not picked up at the beach and	carved, nor	 was it dug out of the side of a mountain and cleaned or melted. It was built out of the intricacies of new cryptographic and	computer science innovations that were remixed and put together in a new and valuable way. Bitcoin is dug out the side of	 cryptocyberspace mountain. The	first hit of a pickaxe on this never-before-seen ore was heard on January	3, 2009.

Check 
Using fancy math you can derrive a bunch of public keys (addresses) without knowing the main seed that creates the private keys. Frankly the math is above my head but it works!

The blockchain doesn't record ip addresses. All it does is show what addresses the coins move to.
Sites like blockchain.info record the ip address of who sent the transaction to them. This could be the sender but could also be someone relaying the transaction.

Yes. You are in an altered state. Enjoy.

@_date: 2013-12-31 05:51:30
By what I've read it appears that for the funds to move it has to be signed by both the gateway and 37coins. 37coins calls the user and asks for a pin. To steal the funds they would have to receive that call on the same phone number that owns the BTC and know the pin. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:34:34

There is currently a secret government agency building a massive ASIC farm to pay for top secret projects while destroying Bitcoin at the same time when their hash power overwhelms the network. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:49:00
Why not coach the person to write it down. Have the person reboot and try to import the key in the live cd then use it. Less fuss with printers and you don't have to worry about the key in the printer memory?
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:19:51
Remember that the price of ASIC will also go down too. (Have you seen the USB miners? In the future there will be stuff like that but cheaper. It's just a really new market now) ASICminer from what I've read appears to want to have a large chunk of the hashing power but doesn't want it all. Eventually they will sell off ASIC's or they will be hurting their own business model by weakening Bitcoin. So it's actually in their best interest to NOT get a monopoly. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:23:31
Bitaddress supports base6. Just get a total of 99 rolls with a regular dice and enter it into the wallet details tab. 0 to 5 are the numbers you enter and it makes a private key and address from it. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:28:32
Exactly. The most difficult chain will survive and that is the chain with the most miners working on it. So in a way, it's like democracy where the miners are the voters with the added bonus that its in their financial interest to follow the rules! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:34:35
It's just for speeding it up. You don't add the numbers. You could roll 1 dice 99 times if you want.

Long run it will cause the value to go up. ASIC's will cause the difficulty to sky rocket. This increases the security as it's harder to match the power of the BTC network. Ultimately it will allow more hashes to be done per watt of electricity. As more and more ASIC's get on the market it will be harder for a rogue group to create enough ASIC's to attack the network. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:20:19

@_date: 2013-11-27 06:11:04
I see block times always staying at 10 min mainly because the network is so big you don't really need to wait for a confirmation anyways for most transactions. 
If a computer is made that can crack Bitcoin's encryption the software will be updated and will use crypto that is more resilient to quantum computers.

Hopefully it was a REALLY good password and doesn't exist from a book or something else already existing. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:20:50
oops edited. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:33:02
I've heard it can take time. I'd email them again. Also go to the Bitcoin forum and find the blockchain thread. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:13:28
It has to be something that is hard to solve and easy to check. So far stuff like seti does not fit that criteria because to check the answer you have to put in equal amount of work. Crypto hashes fit the criteria. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 06:40:47
Lol my thoughts exactly
@_date: 2013-10-29 18:38:37
Make sure it's on coinmap.org if they accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-06-24 03:47:13
A lot of people are converting to BTC then transferring but you will lose a bit because of price differences. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 03:20:40
Sure. I just wasn't sure what the most effective thing to do here is. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:48:20
More details about service and what you are trying to do.
@_date: 2013-09-10 05:33:34
 works pretty good.
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:16:39
Cavirtex and deposit using bill payment. Costs 5 bucks on fees every time.
@_date: 2013-09-19 15:11:23
I expect many countries to eventually follow. They will struggle to compete in the end against Bitcoin's decentralization and set monetary policy. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:53:30
It's like saying someone stole cash. Very hard to prove until you get it back. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 02:52:16
Yup. TOR perhaps requires less trust thought. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:57:03
I HIGHLY doubt that feature will be supported by the majority of miners. (It's just an idea at this point) I think people need and want Bitcoin to be anonymous. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:31:37
Never a brain wallet!
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:19:31
Cavirtex is the most popular Canadian exchange.
@_date: 2013-08-01 00:40:13
Did you create a brain wallet or use 2 factor authentication at all?
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:04:26
Bitcoin will be powerful like English because no one controls it. It will evolve and adapt to fit the users needs. Think of Bitcoin as the emergence of English long ago as aposed to finding a parallel in modern times. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:26:20
Create a paper wallet with many addresses and store it in a bank. Every so often remove a private key and redeem at home. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:27:18
No problem. I know Bitcoin can be daunting at first. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 19:41:43
They should call it worthlesscoin. It will then live up to its name.
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:58:32
Careful someone may call your bluff! Lol
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:37:56
I still think it's funny that to talk about it you actually have to say peepee coin. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:52:35
Ya but that's a bit different.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:41:23
I can't seem to see the Calgary or Edmonton store on coinmap
@_date: 2013-09-25 01:25:02
It will enable investors to buy bitcoin without actually handling it or the hassle. So new investors will jump in who are investors and not computer experts. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:37:39
It will increase your profit margins if you hold on to them. (on average) You can also accept them with no fees and it requires almost no work! You just need a smartphone with wallet app. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:53:35
LOL. Keep pointing out how stupid coin validation is! 
P.S. Fuck you. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:42:31
Probably someone with a bit of coin trying to make it grow. Nothing else really. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:04:47
I don't see LTC every catching up. It offers nothing unique enough to switch. BTC has too much of a head start. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:01:57
Go to localbitcoins and find a seller.
@_date: 2013-06-03 02:40:41
Oh, how sweet it would be, to see the day where BTC is as big in China as in the USA. It's a true global currency with no borders. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 05:26:52
It's a secret. ;)
I sure hope no one clicks those spam links that seen to show up on every post. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 03:40:20
You could also just use inputs.io for purchases. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 22:31:37
The proof of work Bitcoin uses is not actually a problem and actually works smoother than primes. And secondly claiming these primes are actually USEFULL for anything is a bit of a stretch. it's not normal primes but specific chains. What actual use are they? Most I've heard is they could potentially be useful but no one has actually found a use for them. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 16:01:55
So BTC was only about $100 of the total?!?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:16:45
It is safer. No counterfeit bills and you can instantly transfer the money to an address that no one can rob you. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:46:00
So by him dismissing Bitcoin will it take over the world?
@_date: 2013-09-30 18:10:54
If you have lots of money and don't want to learn security you can buy BTC without worrying about how to store them. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:43:35
What if I told you the blockchain is for tracking coins and not people. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:02:16
One day I got a $100 bill from someone. I was shocked later to find out they were a known drug dealer. I immediately turned the $100 to the authorities. I cried because I couldn't buy groceries for my family that week. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:27:23
Transaction fees. Eventually they will replace block rewards. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:47:49
Price will only rise because some will think what if it does replace Bitcoin? It won't. It offers no advantage. Bitcoin is instant. You don't have to wait for a confirmation. With tens of thousands you do. Big deal. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:18:50
Trying to get some cheap coins hey? Good luck.

@_date: 2013-09-29 19:48:09
Horrible coin. I hope very few people lose money to this. It offers nothing worth while and could trick people thinking its actually the next version of Bitcoin.

Yup you can buy any portion of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-13 04:47:23
Odd. :)
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:29:45
It's like colored coins. Just a way of using BTC to represent other assets. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:09:10
@_date: 2013-09-01 18:06:19
Spending your bitcoins is probably the best way to help the bitcoin economy grow and as a side effect it makes your remaining coins more valuable. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 03:21:23
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:06:04
Are you importing the private key and it give you an error?
@_date: 2013-09-04 02:48:02
You can leave the USD in the gox account to buy back later if you want. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 06:38:33
It's in the preferences. You just set it to the port that TOR is using. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:41:58
I don't even know how that would be possible.
If a government released a crypto-currency of their own they would have to compete with Bitcoin. Trading between the two will be super simple and quicker than today with old banking systems and paper bills.
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:07:49
Well, Ponzi schemes require more investors to function, while BTC becomes more widely used a side effect is higher value. if newcomers stop it can still function. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:10:54
Great answer! This get's asked a lot and I'll just quote you!
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:55:05
Do you need it right away? Mining is as anonymous as it gets for BTC if done through TOR. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:59:30
Good. Look up paper wallets. It's very secure for long term storage. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:06:59
Not just "the" government but many wonderful governments all around the world!
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:11:41

@_date: 2013-07-13 03:56:09
Sure. If you had the choice you'd pick the best of two bad options. Perhaps adoption will start with unstable countries and move up from there. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 03:05:06
Yes, but maybe no! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:09:51
Bitcoin could be revolutionary or a bubble as they could appear the same at first. Time will tell. I'm betting on the former. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:09:24
Me too! Bet you can't guess what kind! ;)
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:39:04
I don't think it's the actual dowload that takes up the most time but verifying every block from the beginning. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 05:25:42
Lol, I guess I used too much!
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:36:05
It's an illusion. Speed of blocks isn't that big of a deal. 0-confirmation transactions are fairly secure for small payments. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:45:43
He's the resident troll. Don't worry we aren't all like that. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:48:56
I'd worry that your advertising to steal the laptop. Someone could take it and scan for private keys. They won't be safe even if they are deleted.  They could possibly be recovered. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 00:13:12
Also check the tx in blockchain.info to see if it worked.

@_date: 2013-06-07 00:26:41
I'll go with insanely busy and falling behind. NOT a scam. IMHO. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:55:33
It's not just numbers and speed of confirmations. They are kind of arbitrary. The important part is miners backing up the currency and user demand and momentum. Litecoin has its work cut out for them. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:38:18
Don't worry they can't destroy the Bitcoin dream but they sure can destroy the American dream!
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:06:03
Since the transfer of BTC is pretty quick it would work. It's the fiat that takes a while to move around. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:09:02
It will probably work together. Those who want to use it will. It won't be a requirement.

Very sleek looking website. Odd humour or phrases throughout. I recognize a few faces... based in Uruguay... a payment processor, a trading platform, and a very hard core storage method. (if true and not hyperbole)  I guess time will tell what comes from them.
Edit:  might be worth watching to see what comes. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:49:25
Think of the 10 minutes as an "amount of security". If blocks where coming in faster they would be less secure as there is only a few seconds of network strength behind it. In other words you would need 10 blocks of confirmation (if they came every minute) to match 1 block today. They would both be the same secure wise. You could double spend easier when block are happening faster. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 05:14:07
It's an issue common to many tech topics. Who knows. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:07:35
The biggest problem is that it changes the "rules". That will likely never happen. Best to built on top of those "rules" that give feature you need. 
Something like  gives instant payments. Stuff like this will be more common in the future.

No you could have thousands of people asking for a million but the value is where the actual trade occurs. The price is just the most recent trade where someone sold to someone else.

If it's a race to market dominance LTC is slowly getting more and more behind Bitcoin:
Better to compart LTC vs BTC than LTC vs USD.

I don't know mining uses a bit of electricity. But I suspect it might use less resources then printing money?

@_date: 2013-05-06 17:41:29
Look up the address in blockchain.info.
If it was sent it will show up as an unverified tx. That means the network knows about it, it just isn't in a block yet.
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:30:34
Is the electricity rate low enough to make mining profitable there? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:28:05
Cause it's fun and it's the future! Plus not everyone has a bank account or credit card for buying things online. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:05:42
remember with blockchain the private keys are on your own computer and encrypted with your password. Make sure it is a good one! You unfortunately are still at risk to spyware I believe. Someone correct me if I'm wrong?

If it works, passes peer review, and doesn't require too much extra resources then I can't wait till Bitcoin adopts it!

@_date: 2013-10-08 03:08:29
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:25:02
I've been promoting that method for a while.
We just need open source software that catalogues files and creates a master list of all hashes. That way you could create a time stamp of possibly millions of files by hashing the completed list and creating a brain wallet with it. That software could take over the medical field and legal field where electronic documents have to be proven against tampering. With mere pennies you can create the most secure time stamp for unlimited files. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:20:40
Can you sign text with it? I think the ability to sign anything with the private keys will allow many more unique uses!
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:45:16
Because with it, anyone can potentially know everything you have purchased. It makes financial freedom impossible and will be abused against innocent people. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:40:12
It stores it's own private keys. Each program has to be updated to use the sticks wallet instead. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:13:52
Colored coins. They do pretty much the same thing except allow for thin clients. With mastercoin you have to have the whole blockchain or trust a server to report the correct values. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:01:07
Always put all the change into a brand new one for best security. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:47:14
In a free market I think Bitcoin offers many other advantages and its adoption will continue to grow
@_date: 2013-11-03 05:33:17
Import all the private keys and then create a transaction to a new address spending all those funds. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 15:52:40
? They are doing the work still but just waiting till the code is a little cleaned up. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:37:47
I would assume they are lost. They were not stupid so they probably mixed them around in multiple exchanges and mixers. You could follow the blockchain but I'd bet that the end outputs will not be the original thief but someone else. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:09:29
Cool! Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:00:29
Yup but some people will still try.

Why in the world do you sometimes bounce BTC back to a sending address without asking for a refund address!?
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:40:12

The most paranoid could use base6
Roll 3 dice 33 times for a total of 99. Record them down 0-5 with zero being a roll of 6. Enter the numbers into the details tab and bitaddress will create a private key and address for you. Skips using a computer for randomness! 
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:25:05
Ya, that's pretty much up to you. The fees suck but they are pretty much the best out there for Canada. I think the Toronto based one should be open soon I think.

@_date: 2013-12-10 07:17:20
So why not store private keys with oversight? Seriously man do you think millions of unrecoverable assets will be just handed over? 
@_date: 2013-06-23 11:29:10
It's all doable in the future to keep dividing BTC into smaller pieces. It really is infinitely divisible. 21 million is really an arbitrary number and doesn't matter what the end amount is. No matter what number you chose, it becomes arbitrary since you can divide it up as much as you want. BUT the 21 million does give a bit of time to help with the DISTRIBUTION of the coins. That is the tricky part. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:08:23
No different than gift cards. Totally different than a decentralized currency usable by the whole world for anything. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:46:33
LOL, they made a big mistake. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 02:59:12
Because people like patterns and 111 just looks cooler.
@_date: 2013-09-25 03:34:16
Dark Wallet sounds very interesting. I can't wait to hear how it works.
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:14:42
I find that you'll end up doing hours of pointless tasks. How much is your time worth? Perhaps it would be worth it to spend a tiny bit and just buy some off of someone.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:22:02
Who knows it has everything I'd want, but is blue tooth/wireless a possibility or is the security a nightmare to do safely compared to directly plugging it in? I guess you would also need a battery so perhaps it wouldn't be worth it?
@_date: 2013-10-05 02:58:52
Recognized. Now move on. ;)
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:46:29
If it's written in a book or exists online, never use it. Brain wallets are hard to do and still be safe. People ALWAYS seem to pick bad passwords. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 02:28:36
Wouldn't the birthday be the day of the first block?
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:04:29
POOONNNZIII!! I'll stick to something a little more secure like BTC. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:50:00
And no one cares. Except shareholders. ;)
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:23:01
Even as coins are lost we will never run out of BTC to run the BTC economy. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:48:49
One of the best things we can do as well  is visit the news sites online and engage in the news discussions about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:49:42
I think all exchanges are getting huge lines. A lot of people are trying to get into the bitcoin action!
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:56:59
I think their method is flawed. It leaves coins stuck in the blockchain and reduces our ability to prune them in the future.
Just hash the file and use the hash as the private key and sent to the address and sent it back somewhere else. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:57:07
What address did you send it to?
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:35:39
Because you send BTC to the address and that is recorded in the blockchain. The private key can be hidden until time to spend the BTC. The address is derived from the private key but you can't go backwards from the address to figure out the private key. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:03:19
I haven't used them or know anything about them but check out what others are saying about them.
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:44:03
Bitcoin in my opinion won't be replaced but upgraded over time. Zerocoin for example will upgrade Bitcoin to be anonymous. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 02:13:31
They are the hardest currency in the world to forge. You have to break the crypto and no one knows how to at the moment. If ever. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:45:48
No, just using the latest technologies to create a browser plug-in that will allow you to transact in bitcoin anonymously instead of pseudo-anonymously. 
Edit: And some type of identity feature too I think. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:18:43
They can't just take money without your permission. They only take out what you allow. Localbitcoins.com sounds like its more your cup of tea though. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:25:02
Is the ATM on coinmap.org?
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:50:06
A split is a possibility and the free market will determine the winner. I have a feeling the one that values privacy, freedom, and decentralization will come out top! 
Unlike traditional protocols though, this one has real value attached to it. It will be hard to get people to switch if switching causes them to lose wealth. I think it would have to be something unique that would be impossible for bitcoin to do. What that could be? Who knows. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 02:00:06
Yes but wait a tiny bit for it to be finalized in case there are changes. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 01:45:34
It's staying power is exactly why Bitcoin will succeed. As long as people want to use it, it will be around. You can't shut it down or stop it. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:45:07
They would never say 10,000 until "they" have scooped up some BTC first. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 07:15:23
I don't believe you. I think a tip may change my mind though! Lol 
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:09:49
Not a ponzi. Just because it gets more valuable as more people use it doesn't make it a ponzi. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 05:38:07
It's for a mining company (BFLS.RIG) not BFL. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 15:46:11
You are forgetting that Bitcoin is INFINITELY divisible. It can actually go lower than a satoshi but the feature hasn't been developed yet as it's not needed. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 07:07:56
I would create multiple paper wallet addresses and spent a little bit. By spending some you are helping grow the Bitcoin economy and thereby increasing the chance your remaining BTC have value. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:00:40
Go to account settings. On security select google authenticator. Print the page. Scan it with your app. In the box below enter the digits that keeps changing into the box and hit enter.

Sounds cool! Too bad about the QRK though, I can't support that coin at all. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:51:54
Oh well. Not everyone is going to get it especially this early in the game. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:39:54
Yes! It will be the younger generation that brings Bitcoin mainstream and this will bring awareness. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:43:02
And what does the trezor use?
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:32:33
Coinbase automatically sends BTC back to the sending address? WTF?
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:06:38
All code can be seen here: 
The developers decide what goes in but if they do something controversial its the miners who run the program that decide if the changes are accepted or not. Since the code is reviewed by lots of people it would be hard to give an advantage to someone. 
The "genesis block" is the very first block in the blockchain. It started the whole thing! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:48:20
Your thinking blockchain.info. It is used for exploring whats in the blockchain and has a wallet section you can use for sending and getting BTC. The blockchain is the distributed database that all miners have a copy of. It records all new coins and where they are transferred to. It's pretty much a distributed ledger system where everyone has the same copy of it on their hard drive. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:31:34
Thanks I wasn't sure how big the phrase would be. By your calculations it seems like it won't work. Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:16:24
Thank you so much! You have no idea how much I appreciate that! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:47:57
I don't know what to think. If we wait it will buy more advertising and Bitcoin is already bursting at the seams with growth. I would like some type of plan though on what will happen with those funds. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 04:33:33
Always nice to see it go up! The higher the number, the safer mass fortunes can be stored in Bitcoin! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:41:57
I think Libertarian bitcoin friendly candidates could do pretty well! Especially if some bitcoin millionaires are feeling generous.

@_date: 2013-10-21 21:55:06
I think coin jar too?
@_date: 2013-06-23 03:54:31
Not really. I'd say bitmessage may have to deal with this though. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:58:38
Exactly you can prove the entire file system if you wanted with a single small transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:44:23
Everyone can be Bitcoin friendly? 
@_date: 2013-10-16 05:49:45
Thanks for the link. I found the Litecoin chart fascinating. I knew the hash rate for the coin would go up as people with GPU's flee Bitcoin. It appears those days are past as the hash rate is actually going down or leveling off. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:36:28
Why because the name is similar? Oracle would be a fitting name for anyone that wants to appear to be able to call something true in the future. Faker or not.

You'd have to be crazy since most people don't have the skills or knowledge to make Bitcoin anonymous.

China has a very large tech savvy crowd. China is HUGE. They have used digital currencies before and it was very successful. The company issuing them were restricted. They see Bitcoin as decentralized and not as easily restricted. The state media has also been advertising Bitcoin in many news outlets fueling the rise of users. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:17:23
But was there evidence it was a scam or was it worry the operator was anonymous?

It's just too bad we don't know who runs the exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:24:14
You know the payment was sent almost instantly. To undo the transaction it takes a lot of resources and skill and just isn't worth it for anything under a few thousand bucks. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:43:20
Some wacky Christian conspiracy I'm sure. It's only a matter of time before we have nutty detractors too!
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:21:18
I have no idea. I guess we will soon find out! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-02 04:58:00
That would work as well. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:22:30
Not quite. The private key isn't stored on the blockchain. It's just encrypted so when you import the key you decrypt it then with the password.
@_date: 2013-07-26 22:09:03

Using Cavirtex you select the online bill payment option and fill it in. Then go into your online banking site and to to the place where you pay bills. Select "add payee" and put everything in that cavirtex tells you. Then make the payment as if it was a bill. Wait a few days and your done!
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:36:14
Probably didn't know what they are doing. Just dumped them rather than pick a price and let it get eaten up at a good price. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 15:30:40
Exactly. It's either zero coin without restrictions or nothing. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:20:44
When you import the key spend it all at once to two addresses. One to what your buying and the other to a NEW paper wallet. There is no change then. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:45:52
It's hard to tell if true. But really, the LAST thing you need is more Bitcoin. You need professional help and financial help. Bankruptcy is NEVER the end of the world. You can be stronger if you tough it out. You can do it!

@_date: 2013-05-10 04:15:55
Ah thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:08:03
Bitcoin-Qt and many others will show the transaction before its confirmed. That usually takes a few seconds. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:54:36
Thanks for adding alt coins that devalue Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:11:23
Missed that, then.... no idea other than making some pretty cool chips and possibly driving research and development to making chips faster and faster. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:47:03
Mining is undergoing a huge transition right now. ASICs are the way to go. The problem is all ASICs companies other than "friedcat" can't keep up with demand. If you are a noob, I'd recommend spending a bit of time reading THEN once the chaos has gone down a bit, invest in a miner. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:24:16
Why 2? I'd just go with BTC. It will stick around the longest! ;)
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:16:52
Not a mining fee just a normal paid connection with Bitcoin. I think proof of storage offers a potential cheap solution. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 06:05:31
Ya, before all I did was look at porn, but now, I'm addicted to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:29:15
No one is able the counterfeit Bitcoins. The blockchain records all transactions and new coins can only appear in a block made by miners. 
The wallet.dat file stores your private keys/addresses and keeps track of your address book and transactions. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:13:55
Someone beat you to it: 
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:36:33
The solution is for SD to use internal accounts that are funded with BTC. The users then cash out when done back into BTC. They would have to use another method to prove they aren't cheating though.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:49:21
Doesn't the check mark show the transaction was broadcast and therefor accepted? 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:01:26
So the payment went to what address?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:06:30
Why not use a Live CD and create a paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-08-05 08:05:46
Correct but the owner of the store can potentially know you have access to a lot of money depending on what address your funds come from. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:48:22
Probably all three! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:00:24
What if it doesn't know the wifi password and its not connected to a cell network? It would have to be a pretty fancy virus! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:19:28
To answer your question I'm guessing its the total BTC from really old accounts that weren't signed into for some time. At the beginning BTC was pretty cheap and I can imagine people loading their accounts then buying something but not coming back for the change.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:08:04
Guess. You can probably make sence. English don't speak first language?
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:09:12
Perhaps this may put your mind at ease?
@_date: 2013-10-02 03:53:32
No, but you'd be shocked how many people use "authority" to construct their beliefs. Having "experts" warn about risks will stop people from being stupid and spending more than they can afford to lose.  
@_date: 2013-10-13 22:54:57
LOL, I wish! I'm too poor right now to spend any on BTC. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 01:20:36
No, Bitcoin can run through TOR. And TOR can work even in countries that actively try to ban it.
@_date: 2013-10-06 05:09:20
Cool. Bad behavior in the network will have real financial cost. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 02:16:45
Pretty cool, my dream of paying everything in BTC is slowly coming true!
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:08:03
Viruses can read USB sticks though. This is to protect against viruses and spyware for smart phones. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 07:46:49
People could have saving wallets and spending wallets. It would eliminate this problem. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:45:32
I don't know, you could always play the market and buy and sell each day. It's pretty tricky though. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:53:00
It does mention that mining is "intensive". I'm sure people who decide to go the mining route will quickly discover that their PC isn't earning BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:40:11
Wow, it sounds like a big coincidence and hopefully there is no security breach at coinbase. 
I guess the good advice is:
ALWAYS change the password after verification because you just gave it to someone else!!!!
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:00:03
Write down the key manually on paper and hide it!
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:42:08
Trezor. It will make high end security easy to accomplish. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:56:21
Not really. There are some people who have imported the same private key if it's published online. It's really a race to spend it if anything goes in it. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:43:41
I think stocks are going to be traded using "colored coins" soon! Its just marking tiny amounts of BTC to represent something and people will use them for trade. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:34:20
I doubt it. Hard to prove a negative though. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:36:47
Every exchange. They play it safe. When purchasing products the transaction is usually instant. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:34:07

Wait till you see this bubble! I don't think they are worth THAT much.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:06:33
Look at buying something as an investment. The more bitcoin is used as  a currency the more valuable your remaining coins are. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:06:56
Once you need to spend you will and many rich in Bitcoins will spend them directly rather than convert to local currency. This will help the Bitcoin economy. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:06:09
Buying frenzy!
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:32:31
I would guess size and it uses more CPU cycles. Blockchain size is already something being worked on, and adding even more data right now for something that's only a problem in the future wouldn't make much sense. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:35:38
VPNs and TOR and internet cafes. It would probably lead nowhere. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:43:53
Spending helps grow the bitcoin economy. You can't hold forever. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:36:26
I think a lot of them are tolerated and many are of the opinion that they are just clones and offer nothing extra unique that would be worth replacing bitcoin. A lot of the value could come from people investing "just in case" it takes off like bitcoin. The chances that could occur are in my opinion slim.   Some like QRK seem to be nothing but pump and dump schemes. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:46:09
Um, up to you?
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:11:21
It happens at a set block. Striving for one block every ten minutes the reward halves every four years.

I haven't used them but coinbase is probably the most popular. They seem to have growing pains lately though. 
For a simple purchase, localbitcoins.com may be a good choice. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:20:03
Check the tx details from when you sent BTC. You probably have the missing BTC in another address you own when change was created when you sent BTC. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 11:16:04
The "Choosing A Strong Password" section of the Bitcoin wiki does suggest that (space) is a valid character. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 04:52:18
Um that's a hard one. Honestly I find the only sources that are critical of Bitcoin are usually based out of ignorance. IMHO Bitcoin is a very good technology. There are very few negatives.

If you are only sending to those addresses generated you can receive unlimited transactions.

I don't think so. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:18:22
No. At worst transactions will back up a tiny bit. It will be fixed before its disastrous. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:20:28
It's true. Apparently it's really hard to create fake Bitcoin transactions! ;)

hundreds of BTC/block? What do you mean? If fees replace reward and give an average of about 20 BTC per block, that will sustain the network in the future since the price per BTC will likely be higher. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 23:46:11
Paypal could be a huge player in bitcoin. They could establish themselves as an escrow company for bitcoin.

Cracking a vanity address would be no different than cracking a regular address. 
Cracking a regular address is NOT going to be possible for a LONG time.

That also means its very hard to brute force by guessing passwords. So even a simple password is more secure than normal.

That is awesome! I love that that you did that! Many will say imagine what would happen if you kept those but those at the beginning who spent them are the true heros who helped bootstrap the economy. Bitcoin can't exist without spending!

This is one of Bitcoin's biggest strength. Freedom from corporate control. Freedom from government theft through inflation that fiat is prone to. Freedom to exchange value from one individual to another without any interfering parties. Bitcoin is truly revolutionary!

Yes. Your only concern is if your email is hacked they could potentially reset passwords for sites that access your coins. Make sure you have a secure password.
ANY time you have a choice use 2-factor authentication!!! It's very important. AND always back up the codes used for 2-factor authentication in case you lose your phone.

1. Get a Linux live CD.
2. Boot into it. 
3. Download Bitcoin for linux and open it.
4. Create a new address.
5. Go into the help menu and pick the console item
6. type "dumpprivkey youraddressherefromstep4"
7. CAREFULLY write this private key down and address.
8. Reboot computer.
9. Any BTC send to this address are safer than standard usage.
With Mt. Gox I believe you select withdrawal funds and just use this new address you made.

No, Canada first! ;)
Seriously though I can't wait to hear how much they are used. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:40:43
It's not needed. Bitcoin does INSTANT transactions. The network is big enough that for anything under a few thousand dollars worth of BTC a confirmation is not needed anyways. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:53:30
Let me check the new section. Umm. Not sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:25:23
Go to wallet details and enter 99 digits 0 to 5. It's base6 and bitaddress supports it. Meant for normal dice though. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 03:00:10
Well wallet security mainly. I think the trezor will fix all this though.
@_date: 2013-08-12 21:37:05
Guess I should check my spelling! Thanks. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:21:55
I don't think you fully understand how bitcoin works. It's very hard to broadcast a double spend. No one will relay them or count it as valid. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:12:42
I just tell them to itemize their bank accounts and all their investments first and then we will compare. It's then that they realize its a private matter.

This should pump out 300 keys:
You can change the 300 to whatever. I'm not sure how to automatically fill them. Depending on how much time you have or how many to fill you could just use one transaction and keeping adding payees and sent it as one transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:09:59
For those who want to do this without the site and still keep your coins: 
Hash any file
Use that hash as the password for a brain wallet
Send funds to those address
Empty address
The file can always be proven by telling anyone the hash and see if it creates that address. Just make sure it's empty and you never sent change to it. Just delete the private key after in your wallet so it's not used again as change. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:47:36
Look up colored coins, killerstorm and others are writing the underlying framework for a p2p exchange. Also 
@_date: 2013-09-26 02:08:04
What exchanges are they going to use to obtain more BTC if needed?
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:05:10
Nope, it lags a bit. Should get there today! 
@_date: 2013-07-11 17:44:04
It will decentralize with time. Bitcoin is undergoing probably the biggest transition it will face for a long time. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:57:47
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:35:53
You can until everyone withdrawals their coins. If there is a big balance they could sell some hoping there will be no day when everyone takes coins out. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:13:20
I guess our best anology would be illegal file sharing. You will have those who will fight the system and will adapt to survive. Despite all the efforts of governments and businesses to shut down illegal file sharing it has survived and thrived. Bitcoin is a very similar technology in that it too is a P2P network, and can use many similar techniques to hide and avoid any type of blocking attempts. 
I think Bitcoiners would put on a huge fight compared to file sharers. It wouldn't be just about access to information but the protection of peoples wealth! 
@_date: 2013-05-14 04:01:02
Trezor will allow using bitcoins safely even on a compromised computer!
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:34:00
I actually don't think so. For small amounts a non-confirmed transaction is fine as it's actually difficult to double spend and likely not worth the effort. 
I actually see mining pools partnering with large merchants one day. The pool checks instantly if the transaction is valid and not a double spend and then reply back with a promise to add it to their next block even IF a double spend shows up with higher fees. They can't guarantee that another miner will instead beat them but it does make the double spend EVEN harder to pull off and it would be pretty instant. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 06:10:55
I think this will be most pronounced now because of the shift in technology. The hashing power added each month will eventually stop being exponential looking.
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:20:36
Another idea: Get used iPod. Download google authenticator and never connect to Internet again. Useful for many sites. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:36:07
If you had a BTC what would you sell it for? What would others sell it for? What would a buyer be willing to pay? Exchanges just sort all the offers and match up the buys and sells. The value is just what the current trading is occurring at. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:57:36
If any news this month will make the BTC price rise, it will be this. Very exciting! 
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:54:43
This is only the beginning. Many people pay for porn and Bitcoin makes it truly global AND secure with little cost. Plus people can buy it without being on any credit or bank records. Plus with so many scam sites users don't have to worry about stolen credit cards or identity theft.
@_date: 2013-05-30 03:39:32
The closest thing is probably Bitcoin itself! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:35:43
True, but good luck getting anyone to follow the rules changing.

I'm hoping for steady growth that never stops!

English is anarchy. There is no true authority on what is acceptable but rather an evolution of what the majority use.

@_date: 2013-11-26 11:09:22
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:22:19
That 11% will slowly decrease as the total grows. Every 4 years the block reward will half.
Imagine what the price would be like without these new coins! I think the larger block rewards at the beginning will help slow the price rise even though it still will be rapid. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 04:43:09
That is going to be a good feature! No longer will people lose BTC because of not backing up a change address or something. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:17:32
If every Bitcoin enthusiast did that, Bitcoin would be simple to buy and sell in lots of places! That is a REALLY good idea. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 13:15:45
I have no idea what the odds are. It's just another way to say not going to happen so don't worry about it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:57:00
Probably a tiny bit but most would laugh at the idea and it would probably fail. The world wants decentralization. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:18:56
Miners decide what is a valid block. If someone where to mine a block that alters the rules they would be creating a fork in the blockchain and unless a majority followed that fork it would lose to what the majority wants. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:21:44
localbitoins server may just behind then. Give it a bit of time. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:23:37
Plus they use a captcha when signing up making bots a little harder. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:19:20
Only useful for gambling on the pump and dump. I honestly don't see this coin being successful. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:19:41
Use that md5 as the private key and send BTC to that address. Then send that amount to the address you want it attached to. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:47:06
It sounds like you typed in the outer container password. Did you maybe confuse it with the inner password? (I'm assuming you did a hidden volume)
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:07:29
Sorry about the loss. Were all your BTC there?
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:00:17
If you put BTC into an exchange and then take it out, it will likely be different BTC so you can't follow it on the blockchain. The exchange themselves if asked or if they wanted to could match the output though. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:36:23
Something like bitcoin has never happened before. Who knows.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:33:46

I would take your time and learn. Don't rush. The paper it's on is safe but I would move it eventually as its on heat paper I think and that doesn't last that long. Don't actually give the details but what type of info is on the paper? Is there a random string that begins in 5 K or L?
@_date: 2013-07-05 04:08:49
This will be fun to watch the peer review
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:20:56
The best strategy is to buy and hold for a very long time! 
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:04:31
Ya that's not true. When the private keys are lost those BTC are stuck or lost forever. 
@_date: 2013-10-12 04:27:45
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:16:31
People have bills to pay yo! Buy all the coins and sell/purchase stuff when needed. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:15:30
That's over time. I'm sure many were used over many times. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:05:08
Look up that address at blockchain.info and see if it's confirmed or not.

They run it themselves. Think of it as one big shared wallet.

Just don't be the bad luck Brian that sells at a loss before the come back! 
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:43:04
That would be great especially one that used your current location and found the nearest stores that take BTC. That wouldn't be too useful yet but it will be soon. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:38:21
Who knows. Mining is like bitcoin price discovery. Its hard to predict.

@_date: 2013-05-12 03:17:38
It's also to help cover costs from the occasional scammer. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:00:24
I hope it stays that way. Then Bitcoin will be judged on it's technical merits and not on the personality of the person who created it.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:21:38
One day possibly a whole Bitcoin may be out of reach for many.

@_date: 2013-11-08 17:12:01
It's a good way to carry BTC in your pocket. Print two copies. Leave one at home and if you lose the one in your pocket you know you have time to go home and move the BTC before the person who picks it up can crack it.

Perhaps find someone on localbitcoin and have the person in the other country meet them? Just make sure the amounts aren't too large and the trade occurs in public.
