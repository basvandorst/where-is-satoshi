The first guy has about 318BTC from this scam so far. Thief.

you should use [transferwise.com](

 built with Bitpay's Bitcore JS library.

Well, if you're stealing bitcoins you have to send them somewhere, eh?
I don't know much about mixing services, but all of the bitcoins from this wallet seem to have been well mixed. It's very hard to track down exactly where the money is going. And it's all gone from that wallet, as soon as it arrives.

I am the admin. Appreciate you making sure the right thing was being done :)

It's a not-for-profit — very different things.
You talk a lot about transparency but don't go into how nodes communicate with each other whilst expecting them *not* to collude. There's also no talk about trusting nodes to return the money. It's as if anyone can become a bank.
Honestly, except for saying the code is open source from day one, you're giving away coins and that it's "different from ripple" you haven't really answered any of the points here. There's a huge trust issue with this.

Stellar sounds very much the same as a bank, in that case. The thing you're probably selling banks and existing players on is that people will have to trust nodes. And they'll only trust large institutions. That means banks can run the same way as they have been.
Where's the progression other than a new payment/creditor-debtor system?

Awesome! This is amazing. Could we get it in desktop res?

"But you know, if you have unused bitcoin for 5 years, give it to us. It's now the governments."
I think they're trying to rub it out of existence.

Hey guys — just wanted to jump in and say hi. I'm Tony from Cody's post above.
We're super excited about this, and hope you are too. Looking forward to your feedback!
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:37:51
Ah cool! Sorry man, just going off of the article.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:00:31
Why? We only imposed sanctions because they illegally annexed Crimea.

It's on Github:

Edit: I fucked up.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:20:36
What if there are multiple DPRs as in the statements?
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:18:43
So it was Karpeles all along?! He knew that Homeland was looking into it and handed it back to frame Ulbircht?
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:50:21
He oversaw operaions for Mt Gox. I guess you can't oversee money laundering without knowing.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:00:54
No debit cards allowed
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:01:17
I guess not

We're developing "stacked" SSD technology instead of single wafer chips. We can essentially double and triple space by stacking chips on one-another similar to what we've with dual and quad core CPUs (except they're adjacent).

It's fucking awesome! Hell of a drama. 
Trying to catalog all of reddit's collective detective work here: 
It's shaping up to look like there's a lot of doubt around Ulbricht's involvement.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:57:42
Yeah. With  I have 10% of my wage going to bitcoin in my primary, and $100 going to a secondary address for random spending
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:23:59
Also, according to SR users in the second handover period where Ulbricht was given back SR a lot of changes were made. Things like leaking profile data. I can imagine that Karpeles deployed some code changes that leaked Ulbricht's private information like IP address. Isn't that how they claim to have found him, too?
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:04:29
Any more info on the high value API? How do you know about it?
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:35:09
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:26:40
Props to the release, that's pretty cool!
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:00:23
Thanks! I agree that anonymity is a great factor of bitcoin, and it's something we're thinking about heavily. Though you can't see other people's wages, what would you like to see to make this better?
Also, there are other awesome features too — we're a remote team so no forex exchanges are great for us. And being able to use it like a normal currency is fantastic.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:44:51
Is that a stingray truck?
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:52:22
Holy shit. Well, good luck.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:01:07
I have one of these and they're fucking awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:36:51
Yep, check my updated post.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:56:38


Really? You don't have to act like an ass.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:42:54
That's me. I am the *entire* FBI. Freeze!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:56:26
Hah, that's awesome. Congratulations on winning! I've played for a few years on and off, mainly on full tilt. Since moving to the US I've been unable though.

Shopped on QR code. [source]( - printers don't print out "extra white" around a qr code. that white border around the code should be paper white, but it's whiter.
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:55:40
coolio, i thought it was.
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:09:20
Yeah. Even crappy cameras don't add white – they purple fringing and do this:  I couldn't see it anywhere else, hence my doubt. Not that I care that much, either way.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:32:04
Shopped on, though. That aint the original QR code. [source]( - printers don't print out "extra white" around a qr code. that white should be paper white, but it's whiter.

Man, I've been looking for BTC poker. Which site do you play at?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:44:18
Thank you my man. Signed up and transferred some coins... time to lose some money! ^probably ^not ^joking ^:(
