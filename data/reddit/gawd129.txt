Uhh yeah that's the whole point.

after a shot up like it took earlier there's bound to be a selloff.  It's fine.

Thanks man, that fit the bill perfectly!

There seems to be some disagreement as to whether it was malicious or not, but it appears to be down. There doesn't seem to be much discussion about it since 2012 :(

What market share does  have?

Any word on when they'll be available in Washington state?

Thanks, this is a route I very well may take.  
Is "seeds" the term for the private keys? There seem to be a few moving parts here I wish I understood better.

Hmmm, it might have been BitcoinPlus.com, which appears to be down or dead. Anyone familiar with their fate?

Wow, looks cool!  This might be the way I go.
To me it seems like the best option is a "paper" wallet (or maybe Trezor) stored in my home, AND the keys encrypted and stored in the cloud to hedge against catastrophe like a fire or burglary. 
There may be good cause to change my mind, I'm all ears.

Yeah, I don't think I'll end up using it to mine again, but I'm curious to see how much I have in the account.  It felt like very little at the time, but at todays value it might actually be a few bucks. 
Thanks for the reply. Let me know if the name comes to mind.
Cheers
