My fiancee and I just bought an Australian Labradoodle from a reputable breeder.  If we're going to commit to 10+ years of taking care of an animal, we wanted one that we know was going to be low maintenance, easy to train, non-shedding, and hypoallergenic since we both work full time.  If we couldn't have gotten that then we wouldn't have adopted at all.

Depending on your location, bitcoin can be used to purchase products and services from a number of businesses and has a value based on the acceptance of it by the bitcoin community and based on the supply/demand of it on the exchanges.  If you don't like it then you can sell it on one of the exchanges.

I'm having a similar issue with two transactions I sent earlier today, both with the same fee.
Maybe the larger transaction takes longer because it's being sent from multiple addresses?
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:03:15
Any chance you can tell me what's going on with 31 confirmations vs unconfirmed when they were both sent 2 minutes apart with the same fee?

26 hours on the first (12.27 sat/B) which I understand 
18 hours on the second one (221.239 sat/B) I feel this should've gone through by now and is the one making me nervous
2 hours on the last one (222.222 sat/B)
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:27:29
I see...
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:50:49
Can I give it a fee boost using Multibit (where the transaction was originally created)?

I think Coinbase has a 1% fee?  Are you taking that into account?  In my experience I found that the difference in price was made up for by the fee.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:00:41
We’ve noticed you use Circle a lot. That's awesome! Thanks for using our service.
We have a quick question because we need to make a brief note about some of your transfers in order to comply with U.S. and E.U. regulations. This information is confidential and is only gathered to meet record-keeping requirements.
We are curious about the transfer of &lt;censored&gt;:
What is the name of the recipient of this transfer, whether a company or an individual?
What is the address of the recipient of this transfer? (If full address is not known please provide as much information as possible)
At your convenience please reply to this message with your answers to the above questions. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

In about a year I plan on converting it all to USD to pay a loan and will need to research the best way to do that to minimize taxes and red flags.  
I definitely agree with you about tracking beyond circle. I have never had more than $200-$300 in circle at a time and this was just a transaction from old multibit software to a wallet in the new multibit software.   
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:34:09

I put a little bit of money into different coins that offer different uses to the crypto space.  Some offer better privacy, some offer faster transactions, and some offer a more specific use such as Confido coin leaves a transaction as pending until the shipment tracking number that was provided with the transaction lists a package as delivered.

I have had way fewer issues with Gemini in every category: being authorized, selling/buying, and just general uptime.
I finally dropped Coinbase when they're function to get me authorized wouldn't work. And then their customer service was so slow I don't even know if I ever ended up getting approved.
I really wish Coinbase would work better though because their app is great. Gemini doesn't have an app.

To get bitcoin cash from the August 1 split, you need to research how to get your private keys from Electrum. Once you do that, you can import them into a bitcoin cash wallet. I used Coinomi on Android.
Two things to note:
1. Move all your bitcoin out of that address before getting your private key and giving it to another wallet (just to be super safe).
2. This is assuming you had the bitcoin in Electrum at the time of the split on Aug 1
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:10:54


Almost every time I have a conversation about bitcoin with someone who's asking about it, they have no idea it can be split.  OP's dad implied that he doesn't want to have to commit $5600 into bitcoin when in reality he can invest however much he wants.

Oh wow I thought the numbers were actually lower. I just googled it and see between 30% and 46% depending on your source.
Of course, if you're avoiding many of the traps like having kids before marriage, marrying young, or being poor, then you're rates are even lower!

It's a lot easier to explain to the police that a person ran off with cash than a person ran off with bitcoin.

Because context of stats is important. If you know the context of someone and that they've never been married before then you shouldn't be rolling in stats about 2nd or 3rd marriages in the average.

This is pretty awesome and very positive exposure! Two comments:
1. Right now bitcoin isn't great for small transactions. I just paid like a dollar fee and it took over a day to confirm.
2. I would explain to people you are introducing that they can take the bitcoin and immediately exchange it for USD or hold onto it, you don't care what they do with it.

It won't be negative. You bought $300 worth so that's probably like 0.19 bitcoin? So that's how much bitcoin you own. If/when you sell your 0.19 it will be worth 0.19\*price.  Right now 0.19*price is around $300.
