Just got "hacked" from China too. I had a general easy password on it that I use when I don't care about the account. It's conceivable someone hacked a different website and tried using the credentials.

I've never seen a fake email that isn't identified as spam. This would definitely be a first, and I've received plenty of phishing mail. 
Comparing the mail headers between the email saying I logged in from China, and a legitimate email for mtgox saying I logged in from my real IP, the headers are exactly the same. Here's a snippit. 
"Received: from mx03.xta.net (mx03.xta.net. [175.41.252.34])"
This is from Wikipedia:
"Identifying the source of the email Although email spoofing is often effective in forging the sender's real email address, the IP address source computer sending the mail can generally be identified from the "Received:" lines in the email header.[12]"
But, I suppose it's still possible to be spoofed, I don't know much about this.
We haven't seen anyone complain about receiving such an email without having a mtgox account either (weak evidence, I know), and how would these people know what emails have mtgox accounts? 
This wouldn't be the first time mtGox has had exploits found on it's website. One was found just a month ago which allowed "to perform any actions on a targeted account."

You have to realize the majority of users don't post.. But when they get their accounts compromised or random people (like me) start Googling to see if they're alone... 
I don't know how the passwords are getting leaked, but to me it's an undeniable that SOMETHING happened. A site like bitcoin forums could have gotten hacked, giving skiddies a way to try and guess mtGox passwords. Or, maybe mtGox got hacked and skiddies are using rainbow tables against hashes, or hell, maybe mtGox stores those passwords unhashed and deserves to die in a fire. 
Also, you can't expect someone to log into EVERY account on mtGox. I'm sure you'll hear soon enough whether these claims are real or not, it's shouldn't be difficult to pin down the source of the leak or if only hashed passwords were leaked or not.
Edit: Looking at 3 of some of the newest claims, their reddit karms isn't near zero at all.
