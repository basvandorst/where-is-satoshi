Yeah I saw that passing. I opened a GDAX account using the credentials that Coinbase already had from me but I can't get to generate a bitcoin address on GDAX since I'm canadian.
Sucks bad :(

GDAX doesn't seems to be a viable solution for me since I'm canadian. I opened an account, got verified but can only get to check market data. I can't trade or sync a bank account/credit card to it

doesn't seem to be that easy considering my northern non-us, moose petting status. When I log on GDAX, there is a big blue "VIEW ONLY
BTC/USD trading is not yet available in your region." box where the deposit button should be.

Great idea, since she probably don't know what bitcoin is or barely understand it, she'll get the same "we won the lottery" feeling from 25 BTC that she would have got from 200. People who win the lottery can rarely handle money

a bitcoin address that could allow me to send funds from coinbase to GDAX

or keep pumping money on the stock market, as you should always do.
Don't forget that a lot of investors have registered money on the stock market through pension plans, Roths and all that using ETFs and Mutual funds.
I think that we shoiuld view crypto as a diversification channel instead of something that made the stock market obsolete.
