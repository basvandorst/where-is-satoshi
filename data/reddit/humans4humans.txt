No when ever you press the buy button it locks in that price and that is the price you pay. 
My concern though is that it is unclear wether Robinhood actually owns any crypto or are they just selling you the position the crypto is at when you press buy. 
I think it is rather “sketchy” that they don’t clarify that and I think that might even be illegal.

The guy transferred me through a zelle transfer and I released the bitcoin and the bank is claiming the transfer was fraudulent so they took the money out of my account and gave it back to the account that got hacked

What if the miners are holding the bitcoin they mine so they don’t flood the market and make their jobs less lucrative?

Think of it like the diamond market, the only reason diamonds are worth anything is because a few companies lock all the excess diamonds away. 
This could very well be happening with btc

Ehh I dunno he actually has what seems to be a pretty factual analysis of bitcoin, he is saying some very true things that a lot of us don’t want to hear. I do admit the title is way to clickbaity

Yea lol he probably buys high and sells low and blames the market for his ignorance

Nothing left but a stable currency not run by any government, which is what it was designed for in the first place 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:01:46
First off wtf are you trying to say? Second off how is bitcoin useless... it is a new currency likes of which the world has never seen. It is so young right now and it has so much potential.

A South Korean exchange was hacked and a bunch of exchanges are being looked at for price manipulation:(
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:38:17
Yea I agree with you, that’s what I said in my comment 
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:17:37
Not really sure what you are asking but imo gold/copper mining can’t be compared to mining of crypto because the only similar thing between them is the word “mining”
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:24:02
Yea it may use more electricity but when you mine gold and copper don’t you use massive amounts of diesel fuel and man power?

This. Btc was created to be a currency but half if this sub doesn’t realize that 
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:32:01

That would be a logistical nightmare. They would have to corporate with all the different movie theaters. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:51:30
No youre right lol
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:09:33
Yea I have this issue with Robinhood “selling” crypto because you are not buying any crypto you are buying the position where that crypto is currently at... so it’s not even really clear if Robinhood owns that amount of crypto .

NK has probably been hacking all the exchanges they have (I think) the biggest “army” of hackers in the world

The legal system used him as an “example” which is completely ducked. The legal system should making rulings on only factual evidence it should not try to make examples or get revenge.
