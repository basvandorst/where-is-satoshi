i keep everything offline but looking at quadrigacx for future use. Coinbase is useless if you cant exchange when things go nuts.

people at a bitcoin conference have bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:43
good job locking the doors coinbase. Fuckers do this every dip. 100% happy I dont keep coins there.

12 months?
Really just start low and bet no more than a night at the horses. No one should have life savings amount in one thing like a crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:20:38
lol ya good luck with that. Its the wild west out there. Follow basic security practices.

closing the barn door after the horse ran away but dont keep money in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:19:00
in for the long term. a dip is coming for sure. even a drastic down. 
Then Ill buy more. But to be fair ive been putting in small amounts at a regular interval. Worse case is I bought lotto tickets that lost. Best case is the moon. Play within your limits and HODL HODL HODL.

tried to buy at 92 but coinbase is having a shitfit. in a few days i will be eithet quite mad or quite happy.
Just a small buy so no big deal.

isnt this un fucking believable? I wondered if I was a fool at 58. I set an alarm for 9000 thinking it may get that high some time next year.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:13:14
long story short... HODL mother fuckers. and buy when it dips.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:31:28
That is some r/mgtow shit. 
Sorry bitch, Im rich now. No time for uggo's.

selling enough to get your investment back is a solid position. Then let the profits ride man.

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:31:35
Well we did tell everyone its volitaile. Glad get a crash course in it !
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:23
no one knows. Do t try to time the market. Buy a bit at set intervals.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:48:08
its pretty high risk. 10% I would say.
I know some people here would say all of it but unless you can afford to lose it all then dont.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:38:16
Hopefully they come out like skittles. Good times for all.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:24:03
yes sir. Assuming it is 50 you could lose and be ok. Shit happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:35:31
who said he was?
