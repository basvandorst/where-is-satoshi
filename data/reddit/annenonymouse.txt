I like to use faucets to demonstrate bitcoin to newbies and show them how to get and use their first cryptocurrency. They provide a real-world case for micropayments.  Faucetbox isn't the only faucet aggregator, though, so I also send them to ePay.info and other sites. Of course, you can make even more by running your own faucet, and most of these aggregators even have links for you to download the code to make your own. This is also a good example of a thriving free market!

Faucets are on the internet, which works in Europe just like it does everywhere else. A lot of faucets I've seen are also hosted on .it, .de and .ru domains.

Jesus, one of the very best features about bitcoin is the speed of transactions. Even using a Bitcoin ATM delivers your funds within half an hour (at most, unless the network is enduring another stress test). If Coinbase is going to offer this service, they have to be better at their jobs than the average bankster. They may have grown too big, too fast, and are bending over backwards to  please the regulators, but they are extremely vulnerable to being upstaged by new, more agile competitors who can provide better service. With as much funding as they have acquired, their customer service should be top-notch. Since it is far from satisfactory, they need to up their game or fall by the wayside. Unicorns don't have a very long lifespan anyway.

That is fucking INSANE!

As someone who got into bitcoin mining early on (2011) and bought 17 bitcoins for $50, I don't think there is any right time to buy (or sell). When I got out of Mt. Gox, I sold those 17 BTC for almost $900, which is a pretty good return on a tiny little investment. But if I'd held onto them, I could sell them today for over $6,000 even at $375. The market is certainly volatile, but the overall trend is steadily up. Remember when you could by one bitcoin for $250 in October 2015? That wasn't so long ago.

I also run a full node, because as a retired miner, I understand all too well the kind of costs users incur trying to maintain the security of the blockchain. 
I was severely impacted by last summer's "stress tests" so I understand all too well that the capacity issue must be addressed through either a soft fork or a hard fork. I'm on the fence about some of the proposed solutions, but the segwit soft fork proposal seems to be the least disruptive way to adapt to increased transaction volume. I also feel that any major change to the network should coincide with halving points so they are predictable and implementation is planned well in advance, allowing miners to adapt on a regular schedule.
But I don't think mass acceptance of cryptocurrency is just around the corner, and feel that realistically, most people alive today just aren't ready for it. They haven't a clue about the more profound political impact that cryptocurrency represents. This will be a niche market for at least another decade, and I'm perfectly okay with that. The rest of the world is going to need to catch up with us, rather than forcing us to catch up to VISA, MasterCard and American Express in terms of scale. These entities see us as their worst enemy and we cannot win a fight against them armed only with our smug self-confidence. 
We can continue to stay small, completely open source, and free to anyone enlightened enough to understand this revolution. That is how bitcoin started out, and continues to remain as it evolves. Growing this market will take a long time, but I believe the end result will be well worth our patience in reaching that goal.

If you use Amazon, I suggest you try [Purse.io]( to obtain bitcoins using a credit card. Purse.io allows you buy anything on Amazon.com with bitcoin, which is done by opening a wallet on their site and depositing bitcoins, then uploading an Amazon Wish List. Users like yourself, who have an Amazon account tied to one or more credit cards (but no bitcoins) can simply purchase the Wish Lists of another Purse.io user and buy their merchandise with your Amazon account and have the items sent to them directly. Once they confirm receipt of the merchandise, the bitcoins they deposited are then transferred to your own Purse.io wallet, and you can do whatever you want with them afterwards. It works remarkably well!

There are two working bitcoin ATMs in SF, both at Nakamoto's at 2415 Mission Street (the Hive). The Zenbox (which is the BitAccess machine that used to be located at the Workshop Cafe) has frequent problems, and is not always online. The Lamassu has also had some issues, but works more often than not. The most common problem the Lamassu suffers is keeping its wallet loaded. It's working now, but was down for a few hours yesterday.
Edit: the Zenbox does two-way transactions, but the Lamassu is one-way only (fiat --&gt; BTC). The Lamassu also has multiple language modes, so you can change the display language from english to Chinese (traditional), Chinese (modern), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and French.

This was written when he was still involved in Ayn Rand's inner circle in New York. They later had a falling out and he became the statist that we all know and loathe today.

This doesn't happen often, but when it does, it is a major headache, especially when my favorite local BTM is dependent upon Blockchain.info for its hot wallet. Now where can I buy bitcoin???

The now-cancelled J.J. Abrams TV series "Almost Human" mentioned bitcoin in two episodes (each one in connection with -gasp- crime!). It was set a couple of decades in the future where each human cop had to have a robot partner.  Karl Urban was great, but the series just didn't find an audience.

The easiest way is to find out if there is a Bitcoin ATM near you. I suggest checking [CoinATMRadar]( first. This avoids having to create an account with an online exchange, and surrendering your personal information. Some BTM devices don't even require identification, while some only want your smartphone number to send you an access code. There are others that not only require you to scan your ID, but also your handprint and take your photo before allowing you to purchase bitcoin. But many online exchanges (e.g., BitStamp, Coinbase, etc.) require much more personal information and even your bank account routing number before you can make your first transaction.
