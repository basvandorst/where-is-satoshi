Unless you're in debt, then it might mean bankruptcy.

I'm not so sure about that. According to [this]( transaction z goes through if x is invalidated by a double spend. which as far as i can tell makes noriskwallet indeed have risk, that risk is just offloaded to a third party
edit: So if I'm reading the chart correctly, the user signals he wants to pay for something and pays double the amount into multisig wallet m1, norisk service confirms the transaction and puts up collateral into wallet m2, and then both the customer and norisk sign a transaction moving half the original payment back into the customer's wallet and half into wallet m2, and then the merchant and norisk sign a transation moving the collateral back into norisk's original wallet and the asked for bitcoin into the merchant's account. The point I'm stuck at is how this fixes anything. Transaction N is still vulnerable to double spending, so norisk either has to trust the customer and accept a 0 confirmation transaction into the multisig wallet as valid, or has to wait for the appropriate number of confirmations to prevent a double spend. Likewise, the merchant has to trust the norisk service and give service based on a 0 confirmation transaction m, or wait for the appropriate number of confirmations to prevent a double spend. It seems like not only would this mean there is still a wait for confirmations, but this service doubles the wait time because norisk service can't put up the collateral needed for the "0 confirmation" acceptance of payment by the merchant until m1 is certain to have funds, and the merchant isn't going to trust that the collateral has been put up by norisk with no confirmations if they're smart.
plus, couldn't a malicious seller drain norisk's funds by refusing to sign any transactions moving funds out of wallet m2?

Yeah it does. His defense relied on linking krapeles to tsr, and the only link he had was just shot down.

That's your theory. It's farcical for a couple of reasons:
1) You don't need an *expert witness* to come explain how bitcoin works to disprove government witnesses claiming "the existence of private keys on Ulbricht's computer are conclusive evidence that he earned money from Silk Road." The lawyer can bring up the "X might've planted evidence on the defendant's laptop" point in cross examination of the government witness, like he has done multiple times.
2) The government never argued the private keys on their own were conclusive evidence, they are circumstantial evidence and that is combined with other circumstantial evidence like the journals, ross ulbricht's emails, etc. to eliminate reasonable doubt.
3) The vast majority of an explanation of how bitcoin works would not pertain to the theory that evidence was planted. The jury doesn't need to know about mining or how the blockchain stores transactions to understand the concept of a person being sent money in order to frame them.
4) The prosecution already showed that a very large majority of the money sent to ross' wallet came directly from the silk road's wallet, so there's no transaction hops to analyze. 
Andreas testifying "he could have been framed cause this is how bitcoin works" wouldn't add anything, it'd just waste more time and bog the jury down in needless technical details. The defense has already claimed multiple times that ross was framed through the hacking of a bittorrent client ross had active at the time of his arrest. Since it wouldn't add anything, it's not considered relevant in the legal sense.

No I'm not suggesting that, I'm suggesting your entire theory is farcical on it's face. 
And Ross could have called Andreas if he had actually disclosed his intent to call Andreas properly and if Andreas' testimony was actually relevant. Problem is, Ross waited till the absolute last second to notify the judge of his intent to call Andreas to testify, didn't provide adequate evidence that Andreas is actually an expert in whatever he was going to testify about, and didn't provide a description of what Andreas was going to testify about. All three combine to Andreas not being able to be called to the stand. You should read the  [judge's ruling]( on this, but I'll quote you a relevant excerpt:

Yeah, cept we're not dealing with $20, but $13.4M. Was that karpeles' framing stash?
Plus Ross already admitted to being directly involved in silk road.

Point 2 is so that you know for sure they didn't do that, cause you don't seem to actually have a good grasp on this case.


Nope, let me quote you your theory again: 


Explaining how bitcoin works is a whole different beast than getting an expert to say "yes, you can send bitcoin to people without their permission". And that's not what the defense was trying to do either. This is a really sad attempt at shifting goalposts on your part.


This is just dumb. Your original post was a reply to someone asking "In what way would Antonopolous's testimony be relevant?". Are you meaning to tell me you were in fact not trying to answer their question? And further, if you want to play that game you can go ahead and substitute andreas for whatever expert bitcoin witness you wish, it doesn't change the fact that their testimony that ross could've been framed would be yet more baseless speculation without evidence, and hence irrelevant (in the legal sense).
