The government taxes us (and no coherent discussion can suggest a modern society operating without a non-taxing government), but not the FBI. That's not debatable. 
And you can definitely hire private investigators.

We're *not* paid off from the Civil War. The US is still paying survivor benefits from three widows.

What makes you think they are paid? I mean, what have you seen that leads you to the conclusion the troll *must* be paid?
How can you tell the difference between paid trolls and those that simply do not believe that a currency with a long history of instability is viable?
Surely, it can't simply be predicated on the fact they don't agree with you.

I disagree. Reddit already has a clear relationship with dogecoin. Bitcoin is the largest of the crypto currencies, which is one reason people won't associate it with Reddit. It'd be good advertising for bitcoin, but not the reverse.  However, advertising Reddit's shareholder success with dogecoin investments could -in turn- get people to explore/study both the site and the coin. It's win-win for both.

But why does she keep going down for 18 months? I'd like some stability, some horizontal time.

I'd say it was most obvious starting in 2003.
