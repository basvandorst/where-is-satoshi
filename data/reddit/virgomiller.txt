Thanks for the heads up mate.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:49:07
These kind of memes make me laugh hard
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:44:37
That sounds wonderful.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:56:09
Brilliant song.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:50:20
Seeing threads/articles about lightning network makes me more and more hyped.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:17:37
Which analyst?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:37:35
Now he will grow fast!
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:17:09
There is oil and war behind USD.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:00:50
OH MY GOD!!!!
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:24:44
Best trickster ever existed for sure, tricking users into thinking they are buying Bitcoin when in fact they are buying bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:45:07
Saved for later, but a grandpa won't understand that neither, maybe me old man LOL
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:42:53
That's correct. Most of the oldsters don't even grasp what crypto is and it's not their fault. I also tend to ignore news coming for a 60 years old millionaire. People might say he is a millionaire and I'm not, but that does not mean that he knows more about crypto.

Terminator predicted Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:27:20
I wouldn't be buying pizza with Bitcoin xd. Don't want to repeat something like a "10,000 BTC pizza"
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:30:12
Diplo making rookie mistakes.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:40:38
What a fucking retard ver is. Like promoting Pepsi on a Coca-cola twitter...
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:29:38
The memes are incoming, brace yourself.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:26:52
At least good for they hype.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:25:13
That was I was shouting at bcash's forum until they banned me. Probably Ver took care of me personally. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:54:59
Not sure about what's going on with the political importance for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:35:17
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:49:43
Why is it pointless?
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:38:19
This should go in r/showerthoughts
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:57:46
It's not fake news or anything, they are banning banks from operating with cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:24:49
Every dip people are saying this. When is the time to sell Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:55:30
There's plenty of other ways other than a bank to send cash tbh.
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:47:56
Prefer Ethereum over Bitcoin right now, used to in the past...
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:20:28
We're hitting $19k by tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:26:01
Now it's time for the fudsters to put their money where their mouth is.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:55:59
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:28:41
It was $7.1k and then $6.9k on Bitfinex for the past few hours so I don't see how is that a bottom.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:50:40
Well, at least they didn't close your account.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:52:32
There should be a 3rd one saying "Stop the FUD".
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:49:30
Is this supposed to be a FOMO post?
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:37:04
1 doge = 1 doge.
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:33:16
Depends on the amount, if you want to go big then try Bitfinex, for smaller go with a small online exchange. Curious to know, did you hit the goldmine with the amount bought in 2013.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:31:31
So you get charged an extra fee?
