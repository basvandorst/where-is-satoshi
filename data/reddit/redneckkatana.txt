[Story Corps video interview of Ross Ulbrecht and startup partner René Pinnell](  
This interview discussion may or may not have anything to do with Silk Road. It's just Ross and his buddy from Austin talking about their move out to San Francisco.

Dude, it happens all the time in the real world. Not by gambling websites generally, but Tide doesn't ever cease to publicize the fact that they sent a customized 18-wheeler with washing machines and driers and free Tide to Katrina(substitute latest weather related disaster area). There are countless other examples where big business donates to worthy causes while making sure everyone knows.
