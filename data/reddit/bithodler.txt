It's an error on their end. Something is not complete with your profile, and it's closed so you're unable to make any changes to it. You'll have to have them temporarily re-enable your account so you can log in / do things as you could before and close it yourself afterwards.

Still pending on the blockchain? It will return to your original wallet eventually if it does not confirm. If you've not generated a new seed and it does confirm, it will show up again. i've had something similar happen with Trezor, it would show up, disappear, show up again and disappear again before eventually confirming. You should be all good homie
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:16:37
Man I'm very sorry to hear about your cats  and belongings:( That's so sad. I hope you can recover.  I've ordered my fourth trezor, at least it's for a good cause
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:50:33
This is a great idea and something i've recommended my friends do too. I'd love to know an update if you follow through with it. Better health and better wealth :) Good luck!!

You should be cautious buying from third parties, always buy directly from the company if possible. I personally use a Trezor, the screen may be too small for you, though.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:02:07
I agree, really nice site! Good luck you two

Great store! More beanies please :) If not, I'll still probably get the one you have on the site for the upcoming colder months.

In 2017 people really make accounts just to hate on BTC. What traumatic thing happened to you man?
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:15:03
I saw a post previously saying that Kenny should be a secret miner of BTC this entire time; an early adopter. Cartman hating on china for some reason, Gerald hooked on altcoins. They could make a golden episode from it
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:11:16
I think he means the coins value at the time of the peak are $170m lower than what they are worth now. Still up from the value they were originally taken at though

So you think it's going to drop about $2k if it's unable to rise $80 or so by the end of today?
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:06:18
I'd also like a clear answer for this since I've been busy and out of the loop for a while. I have a trezor, will it basically be the same process as claiming bcash? If I have 10 btc, I get 10 segwitx2 coins, just as I did with bcash? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:53:42
This is what I thought would happen when they closed the exchanges too. I was betting on them fully closing all exchanges, and then allowing them to re-open with the proper KYC/AML/licensing required. I believe it was a good move, and they could have made a lot of money shorting it before releasing the news. They would have been able to buy a good amount of BTC, and when they start allowing exchanges to operate with the required stuff, the price should rise as other people speculate in this thread
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:02:09
Don't overwhelm yourself and make a mistake when creating the paper wallet. Just keep them on coinbase with google 2fa enabled until you get the HW wallet, you will be fine.

I'll take your word for it even if I don't agree. I'm not so sure forex and btc trends would have the same kind of behaviors. Good luck with whatever you do brother :)

When was the last time you had a support ticket like this? How many times did this happen?
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:01:06
you got the cavs in 4 right?
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:01:54
Trezor is awesome! You've made a great purchase.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:34:52
Definitely use 2fa wherever it is offered as someone already said. With blockchain.info, be sure to not forget your wallet password. I also would recommend you set a "second" wallet password that you will have to enter every time you wish to send out BTC or make major changes to your wallet. You also CANNOT forget this password

Even if he did create it himself there are people that drug, kidnap, rape and murder people that get out in x amount of years. Ross has probably never even touched the drugs that were sold

If I were you I'd send a simple message like
"Hello, my account is locked could you please look into it and release my funds to me?"
to hello terms and freeze 
these are the emails I found from  
The point of it being simple at first is so you hopefully at least get a generic response and not ignored completely. Once they respond explain your situation in detail and demand them to release your funds to a specified address, or to unlock your account and let you do it yourself. When explaining your situation during the second response to them, throw in that you did not break any TOS on either site / there's no reason to keep the account locked
If at that point you're ignored / thrown in a loop again, you could threaten legal action explained in your previous thread.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:09:05
Trezor. Best decision you'll make :)
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:35:42
$1300 way too low lol.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:22:50
That was a nice listen. I found  to be very interesting as well
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:05:57
did you paste your address wrong on the site?
doesn't seem to be a valid address

So clearly you won't be making "big" money in the finals. Cavs are heavy underdogs. So you know nothing about betting + nothing about sports? What a great combo. Stay broke
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:29:45
Have they responded to your tickets in the past? If so, what did they say when you asked for your account to be unlocked? Were they asking for some sort of verification or you haven't gotten any response at all?
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:45:58
"I see btcusd 9.91% back to 1000$ in the short term. Then probably lower."
Sounds like something someone with no coins would say
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:30:13
Go with the Trezor :)

Have you been in contact with your bank at all and tried to explain the situation to them? Let them know that the other person received something in return for the money he sent  and he's trying to charge back/scam you. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:40:36
Can't think of anywhere else you could advertise it, but thank you for accepting it as a payment method!

Ross seems like the kind of person to never physically touch or do any drugs so it blows my mind the people that are on the streets hustling / real kingpins are getting less time than what he got. Even murderers / pedophiles sentences don't stack up compared to his

I've heard a similar situation and from what I understand they contacted bitpay to sort that out. I assume they would convert your coins to cash instantly for the seller. Try to contact them
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:10:07
Poloniex has higher volume, Bittrex lists smaller coins that Poloniex may not
