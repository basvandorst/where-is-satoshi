It does not have to be so cartoonish. Education has to teach what is a life of success : a mix of financial success and loving what you're doing. I see so many people talking about their bullshit well paid job but having not any time to enjoy it. Just waiting for the week-end or for the 4 weeks holidays to feel happy. That's sad and that's the society of today that tries to teach us that just to be more productive. But if you start doing what you love to do, you'll be happy and you will succeed. It will just be harder at the beginning because you don't follow the straight road. If you love what you're doing, you can work a lot and the success is coming.
Maybe I should have said : love what you're doing.

Just manipulation, the sun will seriously rise for sure in a few months, but will probably go down again.
Nice picture though.

Not really a crypto currency : they will have the control on it. For the use in Fcbk only.

It depends what you define by success. It does not have to be lucrative. It can be happiness, social success, family success, health success.  
And even in terms of financial success, doing what you love to do will help you much faster to reach your goal.
I agree with you with one point : not all things you love to do will bring you financial success.
