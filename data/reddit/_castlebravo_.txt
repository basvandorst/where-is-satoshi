I'm gonna go with the bit about slave labor and taxes equaling theft as blatantly untrue. Considering roughly half of Americans pay no taxes and are under no obligation to work you're gonna have a hard time making your slave labor point. 
If your actual concern is about mis-allocation of capital by governments when you believe that it could be done better by private entities then maybe say that? If you just ramble about how we're all slaves to a state crime cartel then people are going to think you're an idiot.

I recognize that I probably kicked the hornets nest by saying that taxes aren't the root of all evil on a crypto sub- but you should take a break from the internet and get a grasp on how ridiculous you sound.

Yeah but I enjoy living in a place with roads and public education so it’s sort of a wash.

Well considering the US Navy is the single largest factor guaranteeing freedom of navigation and making the seas safe for global commerce, yeah I don't mind contributing my share to funding that either. 
Before this gets a ton of hate, recognize that you can acknowledge the bad things the government does whilst simultaneously appreciating the good things. You're free to renounce your citizenship and move to some semi-lawless state if you want to put your ass where your ideology is.
