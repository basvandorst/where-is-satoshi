so its true what you said kbdwarrior, an ID is needed for everything above 500€ per day, i did not know that. But if its below 500 it works

Ernsthaft what?

Yes its probably anon, because here in Austria we can buy BTC everywhere with cash also, every post office has it for example, completely anonymous. But its still better to use Monero to be completely anonymous tho. Also this Service for buying BTC with cash in Austria exists since almost 2 years already.

yes, you can buy it without ID (at least at the store where i buy it its like that), and when you use the voucher code, you can enter any email and any name.. if you want to be secure you can create a thrash email and use it, but i always just entered garbage like ahsfjha just make sure to double check that your BTC wallet address is correct. I have bought coinfinity vouchers about 10 times now, but always at the same store with amounts ranging from 50 to 300€ each time.
yes you are right, the fees are high, but if you want to be anonymous without the need to tumble the coins it evens out. Because the bitcoin tumbling fee is pretty high too.

the fees are higher than Bitpanda.. as far as i know, bitpanda takes 4% fees and coinfinity 7%, but you dont need to make an account with coinfinity aka Bitcoinbon

Ist so. Geh mal in eine Trafik oder zur Post und frag nach Bitcoins. Kann man seit Jahren. Nur weil du es nicht kennst heißt es nicht, dass nicht halb Österreich seit langem überall Bitcoins mit Cash kauft. In Wien gibts außerdem einen extra Laden nur für Bitcoins..
hier findest du ein paar "wenige" Orte wo du die Coins in Österreich komplett anonym kriegst:

Please read correctly.  I said you need NO account for coinfinity.  Bitcoinbon from coinfinity is anonymous if you buy below 500€ of it per day. What's so difficult?

Were you diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia by any chance?  Reading your post sounds like you are really delusional.

I can only speak for myself, i never had to show my ID when buying BTC vouchers, but I also never bought more than 300€ at once. To use the post office vouchers, you dont need to verify the account, you just need a random email and name. What you say may be true for higher amounts though! But i just recently used both services, and never had to use my Real Name. Yes they do ask for a Name, but no verification is needed.
Also when you say you had to show your ID, it may be different from store to store. I seriously never had to show any ID though, and i have bought the coinfinity vouchers a lot of times now.. the first time was when BTC was at 700€.
How it worked was: 1. Go to one of the BTC shops shown on the map above, pay with cash and get a Voucher. 2.Enter the voucher code on the coinfinity website, without registration of an account. 3. Fill your wallet address and a Fake name into the form and confirm. 4. Wait for Btc to confirm in your wallet
The fees for the coinfinity vouchers are higher than the bitpanda ones, coinfinity = 7%(no account needed), bitpanda(where you need to register a fake account) =4% fees.
But the best thing to use for anonymity nowadays is still Monero/Xmr!
I would love to hear some other opinions of people who bought larger amounts though

You dont have to verify the account, you just need a random email address and a random name.  Also you can buy it at a trafik, if you buy it there you don't even need to make an account somewhere. The fees are higher tho. Post office =4% trafik=7%
The difference is that one is by bitpanda, and one by coinfinity. The coinfinity BTC voucher is perfect for darknet markets, also this is the one which exists for a long time now.
Source: I bought both of them a few times, the coinfinity one exists since 1 BTC was about 700€. I can remember it because that was the first time I bought BTC.
