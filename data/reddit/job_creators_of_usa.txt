I certainly understand the euphemism. I would love to see free markets, I'm just also aware of the fact that not once has there ever existed a market free of manipulation in the history of humanity and it is unlikely that bitcoin will solve that problem.

That money isn't going to get invested, because investing 100% of your networth is **retarded**. You're going to need some cash to pay expenses, and that 1 month salary that is delayed payment will be allocated to cash reserves to pay those future expenses.

Nowhere to be found since merchants like Overstock and Dell are finding that no one is actually using it to buy merchandise. Bitcoin enthusiasts like this romantic idea of universal adoption, but they aren't very apt to practice what they preach. Bitcoin is being used as a speculatory vehicle like beanie babies and pogs rather than as a currency such as actual money like US dollar and Euro.

That isn't going to work here, since the mortgage company isn't going to accept funds that are of dubious origins. You can't just zap money in, they have to verify that the funds are not money being laundered. FinCEN requires this of mortgage originators, and more can be [read here](

Yeah, as said, you're absolutely wrong.
When the dollar tanks, the value of those equities or real estate, in **real terms**, stays near the same. So the value for which they sell for in the underlying currency will skyrocket. Equities are actually valuable assets as they produce a return in the form of products and services. These things generate real wealth and people will value them regardless of what's happening to the currency in which they're being transacted in.

A small price to pay indeed, for freedom. Also I don't understand why people are complaining about consumer protections; we shouldn't be rewarding consumers, they're little filth scums on the bottom of the totem pole. The merchants, the real job creators, should be rewarded for their ingenuity and business spirit.

Sounds like a bunch of bullshit. You're not refunding because you know you can get away with it. Your machines aren't custom built, and you know that you can easily sell a completed machine to someone else.
People who won't refund for an undelivered product are pretty much complete and utter scum. You sir, are one of those people.
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:48:43
But for even largish quantities it's pretty instant. I don't find much need in sending hundreds of millions of dollars back and forth multiple times a week. And if I was then that would be a great problem to have, but I still wouldn't see a need to switch to bitcoin since the value of my money would still be fluctuating wildly by tens of millions of dollars per day as I do this. There is something of value in stability of the currency being transacted.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:53:07
It's much easier to just manipulate the market than it is to discover and exploit inefficiencies in the market. Either that or be in a position where you can profit off transactions (e.g. market making) instead of having to take risks based on the direction of a trade.
@_date: 2014-08-06 01:59:58
The difference though is that I can transfer actual money using a bank account, something I can't do with a bitcoin.

Makes the IRS have an easier time catching tax cheats and money launderers. That's definitely a good thing and thankfully people like Ben Lawsky are working with the bitcoin community to create regulations that will take advantage of the fact that the ledger is public.

If you're "investing" in currency then you're a fucking idiot. It's that simple. 
A real investment will be in equity, bonds, real estate, or something similar.

You can either pay twice in smaller payments or once in a larger payment. Its all the same and ultimately doesnt matter "how many times" you're paying them, only the amount. The amount you pay is determined by market forces. People are currently paying ebay/paypal for this service regardless of the fact that they're getting paid twice and regardless of whatever their current fee is, so that's what they'll continue to do until its no longer profitable and people aren't paying them for this service.

This doesn't matter to me at all since I'm getting more cheap coins out of this.
@_date: 2014-07-18 11:22:34
Holding private keys is the exact same thing as owning the coins. Just as when you deposit money in the bank, that money is no longer yours. It's the banks money, and you are a creditor of the bank. Of course they owe you that money upon request, but while it's with them it's technically theirs and they owe it to you.
Similarly, when you give private keys to another entity, they own the coins and you're a creditor.

I can transfer cash between my bank account and a merchant's bank account without having to use physical money, and the transaction is most certainly reversible in the case of fraud. I know this because I've reversed a fraudulent ACH before.

a current medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes; coins and banknotes collectively.
As you can see in plain sight, bitcoin isn't actual money. Sorry, you lose this one.
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:07:36
Yeah. He did.
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:00:06
Thats probably why no one with a brain accepts bitcoin as payment. It's too volatile since it's not actual money. It behaves like a volatile commodity like baseball cards on ebay.

Look. I am a software developer. A lot of people in this forum are also software developers or otherwise do some kind of job where they sit at a computer all day and can basically work remotely from anywhere in the world. I can see how your idea of switching from minute to minute can work for jobs like that and maybe that's where you're getting this perspective.
The problem is you cannot extend that idea to the majority of jobs out there right now. This doesnt work for things like construction, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, etc. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:43:14
This is actually good for bitcoin. This makes the IRS have a much easier time weeding out tax cheats since their pay history is documented in the block chain and they can just use machine learning and data mining to draw patterns from this that are linkable back to individual taxpayers.
@_date: 2014-07-21 01:08:47
No, he was telling the BTC community about the types of regulation they're going to need to deal with. It's really not a choice for you or anyone that supports btc. This is something you'll have to deal with and he's doing his best to make you aware of all the legislation involved so you can adapt your business / business practices around that.

This is actually good for bitcoin since it makes people pay more attention to what pools they're joining. Further it discourages people from joining pools which allows us to mitigate 51% attacks better.
