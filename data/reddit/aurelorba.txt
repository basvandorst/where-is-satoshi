 When governments prints bonds and then has the Federal Reserve [or central bank in other countries] purchase and cancel them. That is quantitative easing - printing money. 
 When government prints bonds and offers them on the open market to other institutions and private persons to buy them: this isn't QE. This is the government borrowing money. 
 The difference is that in the former they are increasing the money supply, in the former they are not. They are promising future earnings to be paid to the lender. 
 The former - QE is coming to and end in October. And if conditions are right the Federal Reserve may even sell bonds it holds so as to reduce the money supply.

Or a simpler analogy, though dated: a/v experts judged Beta superior to VHS, yet VHS won the market. 
 Also similar as I'm currently reading a biography of Thomas Edison: He insisted on making a technically superior gramophone [record player to you whipper snappers] but limited the recordings produced for it to musicians and performances he deemed worthy.
 The Victrola company's gramophone was technically inferior but had a much wider selection of recordings.
 Neither of these examples are exactly like crypto currencies - analogies never are - but they should be kept in mind by everyone attempting to make the next great thing.

 In the mid 90's there was no doubt that the internet was here to stay. It had been taken up by all large corporations.
 
The same can not be said for Bitcoin.

You don't have to predict anything. You have to observe a period , say 1 month where it's not on a down trend.

The Saudis are producing the same amount as last year, and the year before, and the year before.
Average Monthly OPEC production:

2014 23.3 million barrels

Because I was there. I used email to communicate  with friends. A corporation was a nobody if they didn't have a website.
Did it have all the features of today? Of course not but it was here to stay.
 If Bitcoin had even 10% of the uptake by companies and individuals as the internet had in 1995 I would be impressed by Bitcoin.
  
 It doesn't.

This guy acknowledges the popularity of internet but doubts it will mean the end of print media that he is paid to provide. I've heard print media type claim newspapers aren't dead in 2012.




This guy is writing a mea culpa in 1997 about the prediction he made in 1995 about the internet collapsing in 1996.


Again, I was wrong.  I ate the column.  I am sorry.  I am not worthy

Uh, no they don't. Under a gold standard, bitcoin standard or any other, governments can still borrow money as long as people will lend to them.

 Nothing in the context of this conversation. Who said it did?


 I never claimed any such thing. The value of a currency is based on what value people ascribe to it. Right now the US$ is seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:41:24
It's  backed by the ability to tax.
@_date: 2015-07-06 12:50:24
 The thing is that 50% of Greeks depend on a cheque from the government, either pension or paycheque.
 Bitcoin will not help  them.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:40:29


 That is a well accepted economic principle. Destruction, be it man made, natural disaster, etc, stimulates the economy as what has been destroyed is rebuilt.

 I would pay nothing, then. I have zero liability.
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:22:15
 It is backed by what people put faith in. People put faith in the fact the government can always tax to raise required funds.


I never claimed it was.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:34:37


 Uh, yes it does. Inflation is defined as rising general price levels.
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:07:19
From what I've heard the issue isn't people getting saved money from the banks but their pension and state employee paycheques.
 Without more money from the ECB/EMF the Greek government simply doesn't have the money to pay these.
 No 'coin will change that.
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:10:56
America is no longer printing money to pay interest on the money they just printed. They are promising future money.
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:01:56
So instead of investing in bitcoin, one should be looking for the next thing.
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:46:34
I do too: 'In a decade will 1 bitcoin be worth a quarter?'

That would be true for either extreme.

Some already do. No need for a government collapse. Maybe it's heresy to say so here but fiat has advantages - scale being one.
 Before you consider why the 'better' payment system must win out, consider Gresham's Law.

What else would you compare Bitcoin to other than what you would have it replace?
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:59:50


 I hate to break it to you but there will always be some sort of 'inherited value' in that someone, somewhere will use a different metric. That's the way foreign exchange rates work and Bitcoin wont change that.
 Unless Bitcoin manages to become the only measure of every value everywhere then there will be a comparison, just how euro's dollars, pounds, gold, silver, cigarettes in prison, goats in Somalia, get compared. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 13:32:55
Define 'security'.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:22:14


Uhhhh... that's kinda the whole point of comparisons.

This makes any sense to you?
Oil price fell due to two reasons: Lessened demand from China and increased supply due to fracking and other new sources.
@_date: 2015-03-07 12:53:04
 Correct. *was*. They stopped last year
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:04:41


No. It. Didn't. China slowed down because it had to. It is transitioning from an FDI export economy to one increasingly  driven by domestic consumption. 
If QE was the reason then demand would have decreased int he US. It hasn't.


Demand did collapse. It was called the great recession. QE did what it was intended and was then wound down. The US economy is improving each month.
@_date: 2015-03-16 04:47:20

 Oh they print money all the time - to replace old bills. Will they ever need to stimulate the economy again? Likely. Will they contract the money supply before that? Likely.
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:40:52
The most positive thing you could do is buy as many of your daily purchases with Bitcoin and replace it with &gt;100% of the total spent.
