Im not talking about bitcoin crashing or rocketing - I'm talking about why 9556? Why not at 15k when drop down from 19k and then recover to 15k steady. Why not 12k when it was crashing just as steep as it is now?

I love Antonopoulos videos and interviews and I love the idea of international currency but fuck... this isn't it this is just a speculative playground for day traders
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:19:52
What are you gonna say when its at 8.7k tomorrow? Or if its at 11k? You just guessing. You didnt make this decision out of anything logical reasoning.

Thanks - thats all I wanted to know.

I made about 145k from Bitcoin and Ripple. It's nothing to sneezed at but I'm never going to be living large for the rest of my life on that kind of money.

Buy at 5.5, sell at 6.8, buy at 4.9, sell at 6.5, buy at 4.5, sell at 23k

Even if you think this is happening-  isnt it for better for you to sell now and then buy again once they stop doing this and the price starts going up?
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:26:48
I mean it's slowly approaching a price that oscillating around 5k. Everything it breaks a floor it doesn't go down further but rather less and less, and every time it shoots back it doesn't reach as high... It going to settle somewhere in that ball part until another price bubble
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:38:17
How much did you save from a month and a half ago when it was at 6.6k?
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:20:59
Long gone are the days of bitcoin as an anonymous, independent currency. It's been a speculative market since the end of last year.

@_date: 2019-06-26 07:29:32
How high can it goes? At what point is Bitcoin just a gigantic blackhole money ?

If you think a million dollar will buy you a club you never even looked at house prices
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:50:39
I agree with you 100%.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:26:32
Same with investing in stock - either up or down, the broker always make money
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:44:34
Definitely a pump. The question is is it pump and dump or trying to trigger a bullrun. Im so tempted to buy
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:04:57
Why be patient? Why not sell and then buy back in later ?
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:16:13
You know, around a month ago when it was 6k - people were saying, Why be sad - the price is still up from a year ago. But now that its down to less than a year ago - its switched to a year and a half.   
What's next? If BTC fall to 1k, are you gonna say why be upset - the price is still up from 3 years ago?  
Just accept the reality that it's going down and it sucks. Maybe it'll go up again but don't bury your head in the sand
@_date: 2018-11-17 09:53:09
Yeah, I dont see why he's sad - its now 5400-5500, he can buy back in for a neat little profit
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:03:13
It was at 15k for almost a week.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:59:36
Bury your head in the sand and hope for the best.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:59:16
I've been in for about 3 years now. It's been great. Was tempted to even get AMD as well too
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:58:25
People said no chance it'll dip below 5k either because of the mining cost...
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:47:42
Stay-or-go Economic
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:51:10
People were buying at 12 and selling at 15, the same people who bought at 9.5 and sold at 11, they're just day trading
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:06:08
They will be back... maybe in like 2-3 years when climb back. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:43:52
Its simultaneously hilarious and tragic - on one hand demanding that people throw away their fiat to crypto - on the other hand mock people and laugh at them and want them to leave.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:10:35
yeah I dont mind buying in at 6-7k when it rosed back from 4-5k, rather than buy in at 5k and then have it go back down to 2-3k... rather lose potential gain and make a lost
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:10:12
The wealthy doesn't want to kill bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:48:38
I am. I'm just waiting for the bottom. I don't think this is it
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:39:27
its not even regulation - its just the simple fact that we're running out of people buying in. Everyone who's interested in Bitcoin / speculative crypto trading has already gotten on around December.
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:08:31
But the biggest people profiting and owning bitcoins are millionaires....
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:47:30
I didnt think it'd get under 8k either but here we are. I'm just going to wait until it has a sustain growth again
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:52:51
People don't care. Half the crypto are centralized mess that don't even require proof of work. Most of cryptos are just speculative investment at this point. If you think even a third of the people in Bitcoin are buying it for their use as currency you're delusional. 
You think if there's a Google coin it won't pump like crazy? That people would jump on it?
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:58:13
None of those are blockchain tech?
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:11:43
You should've sold when it broke 9k coming down. It was clear the bull run was over. At this point I doubt there's much further down it could go. Even buying back in at 5k was reasonable. If it falls to 1-2k, bitcoin is done but at this point you might as well hold on to your coin and hope it shoots back up again or sell it all and dont bother expecting to buy back in lower.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:02:55
If you'd bought today you could've save 5%
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:04:50
People keep saying institution wants to bring the price down so they can buy in - but why would they do that when they can make their own coin? What stops them from literally coming together and creating a something like a blockchain AmazonCoin? GoogleCoin? FacebookCoin? Literally nothing. And they will have actual store front to spend those coins as well.
