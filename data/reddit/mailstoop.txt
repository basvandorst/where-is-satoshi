Why attack..... this person posted on here either to troll and get reactions like your doing or he actually did that with his loans? 
So general blanket question..... why risk so much on any type of investment with that type of risk?

* dont know who you are or have ever seen any of your stuff, not sure if you have a bias.
But these are decent points, in that i wish the discussion moved from price hype to development again and implementation, scaling issues. I'm not a developer by any means, i just feel like this community needs to get back on track with the actual future of how bitcoin will be utilized.

thats what it says when i tried to transfer to trezor......"Do not pay this invoice from Coinbase wallet or a bitcoin exchange account. Exchanges and especially Coinbase do not broadcast the bitcoin payment in time, thus resulting in failure. Use the following bitcoin wallets instead: Trezor, Copay, Electrum, Greenadress."
