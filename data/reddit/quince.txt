Given the market turmoil, I think people have been fleeing to the relative safety of bitcoins.  
With gold so difficult to acquire, bitcoins are the easiest thing for people of modest means to secure their money in.

So before someone accepts a bitcoin payment, there is a period of time that both parties need to wait while a confirmation is performed that no double spending has occurred?

I think we should name fractional bitcoins after this guy:
1 juggalo = 1/millionth bitcoin.

Bitstamp is quoting $US96.00 currently.  Why are they so much lower than MtGox?

This sounds like it came out of North Korea.  
It makes me even less confident in them than I was before. It's actually terrifying if you stop and think about it.
After reading this I am done with MtGox for good.

 currently shows a price of ~$US75 while BTC-c has $US81.  
I don't understand how there can be such wide gaps.  Is anyone doing arbitrage against these sites?  10% difference is ridiculous.

I see this as a golden buying opportunity.  People dumping their coins now will be kicking themselves a year from now.

How can we tell what the actual PRICE is now!?

I dumped everything at ~240 and have started reaccumulating.   I already have double my coins plus cash in hand.

If you have the technical wherewithal to mine, there is absolutely no reason to purchase bitcoins outright while the cost of mining it lower than the payout from mining.
