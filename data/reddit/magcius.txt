I apparently don't exist. I understand Bitcoin and its technology perfectly well, and yet I don't believe it's a great solution at all.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:26:13
We're not touching anything. We're just along for the ride, having fun the entire way.

When you make a transaction, it being approved means it's being mined into the blockchain, which means that miners magically get 25BTC out of thin air, which they will use to cover their costs. If one miner mines 10% of the blockchain per day, and there are 100 transactions that day, that means that the miner has a 250BTC revenue, plus any transaction fees.
They take these 250BTC and use it to pay their expenses by dumping it back onto the market into back into fiat. Miners are already really thin margins, as the cost of electricity, bandwidth, and storage is only going up, and BTC to USD is only going down.
When this reward halves again they will lose 125BTC of their revenue. This means that their other 125BTC has to come from mining fees (this is what Satoshi *wanted* to happen, if you've read his whitepaper, because he wanted to stop inflation eventually). So miners will start to ignore transactions that don't have high enough fees, since they will lose money on them.

Like what? The entire incentive for miners to exist is profit.

I'd absolutely love that. Unfortunately, that isn't what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is an extremely wasteful, easy to manipulate, horrible store of value, given its recent volatility. Getting money in and out of a Bitcoin exchange is more like a roulette wheel than an actual system after the closure of MtGox, and the recent concerns about Bitstamp, BitFinex and other exchanges. And then there's Neo &amp; Bee, BitInstant, Moolah, and now Robocoin. Remember GHash.IO and how your big plan to fix the hashrate was to simply plead to them to be nice?
The way you peddle it to people is abhorrent and embarrassing. Merchants should adopt Bitcoin because who the needs consumer protection, because all your customers are actually people trying to steal your money and you shouldn't trust them! Guys, buy in now because the USD is going to collapse very soon and Bitcoin is going to ride its volatility all the way to the moon! Just remember to only invest what you can afford to lose. No, don't worry about how it takes 10 minutes to buy a coffee with Bitcoin, that will go away as soon as it gains mainstream acceptance! It's a deflationary currency, which is good!, even though the mining system is pumping new money in daily, because it will eventually stop creating new coins in 2140.
It's a system nobody really needs, nobody really wants, and doesn't meet any one of its goals that people claim it uses.

I have. There are zero of them.

I, too, take all my financial advice from poorly scribbled words on the back of a banknote.
Practice your capital P's, dude, they're super messy.
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:08:32
Well, Bitcoin certainly isn't wealth either. Not with these prices.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:46:28
So why doesn't Litecoin, which solves the same problem, have the same value?
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:26:08
And how is that enforced?
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:02:12


Well, it's pretty easy to do when there are no points for it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:10:14
I, too, lie to government officials and risk $10,000 fines when going through customs.
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:03:10
You just did, though.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:25:51
So, the reason Bitcoin has intrinsic value is because you can use it?
How does that not apply to USD as well?

These tends of people have an internet clubhouse where they meet up and discuss weird ways to evangelize. It's called "Google for it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:27:40
So, none of the "foundations" by the OP actually matter, since nobody will actual use Bitcoin, and we'll use cheaper, centralized services instead. Got it.
@_date: 2014-04-05 20:03:50
Mandating that we all ditch our Bitcoins in favor of a more scalable fork is not "a non-issue". This has been discussed for a few years now, and yet the community never changes it, even though it seriously wants to, and needs to.
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:06:44
No. It will require a hard fork in order to change the 1MB block limit. It's baked into the protocol.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:35:49
And what if I'm not honest?

I am! Thanks for making my weekend!

how dare the ceo of a public company speak freely about his opinion when asked! calling us immature... i'll show him.. with a boycott!! haha
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:07:40
You sold at a loss. That is not making profit. You said you were making profit.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:20:01
Now they have BTC. That is useless to them, as the only way to get USD to pay their bills is to go through an exchange, where they give up their SSN and take an anal probe to get approved.
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:12:21
I never said it's the "end of bitcoin". Only that it's going to get a lot more expensive to make transactions. More expensive than Western Union or ACH or bank transfers.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:29:40
So, what you want is that if somebody is dishonest, there's rules against that from happening, so that they are punished?
So, regulation?
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:26:33
Well, the latter laws happened as pre-emptive measures towards lots of theft. If you steal money and then distribute it all across the world, it can be hard to return the money to the rightful owner. The thief might be in jail, but the money that the original owner had was lost.
So, things like "you can't exchange more than X amount of money without filing specific forms" are designed to prevent such bad behavior.
The majority of pre-emptive laws and regulations happened because of some very, very specific incidents. Try looking up the history of this sort of thing and you might be surprised.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:07:00
I'll believe it when it happens. This has been an ongoing issue for three years now, it's a big problem, and nobody's stepped up to sit down and write the code.
There's a lot of problems with simply expanding the limit (the possibility of a DoS attack, for instance).

You enjoying your Segway purchase?
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:48:35
They already are ignoring free transactions. A transaction without any fees might take up to two weeks to get processed. See [this post]( by chief Bitcoin engineer Gavin Andersen.

Unlike Bitcoin, in which most of Btc is owned by a handful of miners.
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:45:16
But that doesn't matter. If I want to buy something for $20, let's say, I then have to put down $40 in a deposit, then pay an additional $20, and if something goes wrong, I lose $60. Compared to if I buy something with PayPal, I pay $20, and if something goes wrong, I get my $20 back.

How exactly would a smart contract like this work? What would the program do?
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:48:05


Miners profit by shovelling BTC through BitPay, by [BitPay's own admission]( They're basically trading cheap Chinese electricity for VC money, because of the block reward, which trumps any transaction they do.
Bitcoin users can't do anything and don't matter in the slightest. They're not going to crash their business.
It's extremely likely that we'll see them start to pull out after the next reward halving like the last round of cloud miners and mining hardware companies did.

I mean, no? He was the one who didn't send me shit. I doubt he has any motivation to make me happy.
So, instead of getting my money back, with a \~\*\~ Smart Contract \~\*\~ I am down three times as much and the only recourse is sending an email to a scammer. Truly the future of e-commerce.
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:37:58
So wait, if I'm a buyer who doesn't receive his item, I lose 2.5X my purchase? I lose the deposit, and I also lose the money I paid for the purchase. How is this safer for me?
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:55:46


Yeah, that'll show them Chinese mines

Even if these can be solved with the blockchain, how does 21, Inc.'s product help with any of these use cases?
@_date: 2015-11-15 17:25:49
[CDs]( are effectively time locked accounts without large up-front costs, and are offered at all commercial banks. What's wrong with that?
