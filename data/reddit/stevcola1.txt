No, haven't heard from support either. Pretty annoyed.

does 0 of 0 limit mean I cannot withdraw? Or does it say that on my account because I have nothing to withdraw?

I was going to wait for the price to drop as historically it has and buy it when its at a near low. But you're right. weekly is probably the best. Thats how I built my mutual fund.

Does anyone personally beleive it will hit 10k highs in the near future? if so what time-line and why?  (Thanks for all the feedback everyone - looks like I wont be dumping all my MF's after all lol)
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:28:48
Will do! Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:46:36
Thanks !

Can't argue with that reasoning. Noob question here: What do you mean by "paper" bitcoin profit?
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:32:17
Thanks for the explanation. So by paper gain he is reffering to the gain amount gross of capital gain taxes? Is this just the term or is there a way of reaping the full gain without paying a capital gain tax?

Thank you for the information, that was very informative. Respect (edit typo)

Hey incase you were wondering. I used flexepin today for the first time and everthing went well. I started with $150 to test it out and the funds were deposited in Coinsquare. Only thing I dont like is that it appears that I cannot withdraw the funds. Im assuming its being witheld for a period of time which bothers me because I wanted to trade it for another coin I had my eyes on from a different exchange. 
EDIT: I figured out that I needed to change CAD to BTC on the withdraw page -_- lol .. it works!
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:36:37
Thanks! was the process simple and instant? I will be using CoinSquare as well. I have a fear that i spend $500 and the card they give me doesn't work lol 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:37:14
That'd be great! I may actually do the same thing myself. If so Ill let you know too!

this is awesome, great idea. Dumb question though. How is the quality so good? I play minecraft on PS4 and the graphics are nothing like this.
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:04:37
Yeah thats what I would focus on. For example, I look at people like my father who has money to invest, but is not tech savy whatsoever. I can't see him figuring out how to set up a bitcoin wallet. (he cant even work facebook), But I could see him investing in someone who does a good sales job and has trust that they will take care of him. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:33:32
This makes sense. However, I'd like to learn the technical and terminology and be able to understand what everything means too. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:08:37
Thanks everyone for the advice! Just wondering, is it better to buy online or by ATM? Also can you buy using a credit card? Or does it have to be cash funds? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:52:06
In what way? do they offer people like me the opportunity to sell FOR THEM? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:57:29
Ok so essentially they do exactly what I want to do. Question is: can I do the same? Yes they are a major competitor, but if i practice locally and target investors in who would not normally be exposed to coinbase because they are unfamiliar, wouldnt I be able to get a small share of clients?
