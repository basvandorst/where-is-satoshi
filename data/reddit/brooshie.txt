Question about the Bitcoin Cash - I was going to sell and buy back into Bitcoin.  However, apparently I held it in my Electrum account when the fork happened, not CB.
How do I access it from my Electrum account?

It's not letting me.  If you have any experience in it, mind if I shoot you a message?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:41
That's for recommending that page.  I had found it, but I wasn't sure of its validity.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:33
Could it have to do with the versions of the executables I'm running or the versions I was using when the fork happened?  Otherwise, I'm stumped.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:13:13
Yeah, there are two headers: Address &amp; Private Keys.  I copy and paste the Private Keys (with a line in between each), still no luck. Even if I remove the line between each one, no luck.  Still greyed out.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:37:45
yeah - I unprotected my Electrum wallet, got the private key, tried to import it into an Electron (B)Cash wallet.  Seemed to be "successful", but no transaction history or balance.

Sorry, verbiage.  So.  I had BTC balance on my Electrum wallet July 29th-August 7th.  On August 7th, I sent the BTC from my Electrum wallet to Trezor wallet.  So, Electrum now has no BTC balance, but should still have the BCH.  Fast forward to a couple days ago, I tried extracting the BCash from the Electrum wallet by following this article (  ) to the Electron Cash wallet (please note Electrum wallet and Electron Cash wallet are 2 different wallets)

Sorry, why would you suggest I restore via the seed words if I have the passphrase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:06
I'm trying to retrieve my bcash from my Electrum account into The problem for me is: I exported my private keys from my Electrum account into Electron Cash. When I try to "use public or private keys" and enter all the private keys from the export, "Next" is still always greyed out. I 100% had all of my coin in Electrum when the fork happened (my history shows an import on 7/29 and an export on 8/07)
What am I missing? haha.  Was hoping to just dump all my cash and buy a partial coin, but looks like this little issue didn't help :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:34
The problem is when I try to import my keys into Electron Cash, the 'next' button is greyed.  Does that mean I'm doing something wrong?  
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:36
Yeah, that's what I'm confused about.  They were in Coinbase since 2014, then moved to Electrum July 29th, then moved to Trezor August 7th.  Since then, I've tried to send the BCash to an Electron Cash wallet and also a Coinomi wallet, both unsuccessful.
When I unprotected my Electrum wallet and took the private key, there were actually 3 different lines for private keys, but 2 of them said null (where the actual key was).  I don't know if that matters none or not, just trying to give some info because I'm at a loss haha.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:00:28
I already tries to send it to an Electron Cash wallet.  The blockchain was empty, so is there still hope its on the wallet? Im pretty pessimistic at the current moment haha
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:45:13
You mean transfered?  Because I had my entire balance on Coinbase since 2014, but then when it started spiking up, I decided to move it somewhere more safe (which was that July 29th date).  And that transaction was also confirmed that date.
That's what I was curious about, if there was some sort of lag time that I shouldn't have moved it until after the fork.  If that was the case, though, I would anticipate there would be 1000's of upset daily traders that would make it a more known issue.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:56
I don't have anything in my Electrum wallet - all has been moved since the fork.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:51:13
Hoping maybe someone could help me with a problem.  I submitted a thread on BitcoinBeginner but it didn't get much look.  Thanks!

Glad I sold my Cointerra miner last week for $5,650 (I get about $5,200 after Ebay/Paypal/shipping fees).  And I still have 1.7 coins to hopefully make my $6,150 initial investment back.
For the record, it was running flawlessly.  However, my apartment couldn't handle all the energy so it would break the circuits regularly.

Glad I sold my TerraMiner last week for $5,200

Thanks much!

What do you mean by "right" ?
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:55:28
I sold most of my coins at $10 years ago haha.  My friend sold 100 coins @ around 100-120 a piece.  He now has none left and I have 1.7.  It's painful.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:04:24
My dad has been telling me to sell since they peaked $500 (he's into financial shit so I like talking with him about it, he's about the only one that can grasp the concept).  He still doesn't understand why I'm holding.  I'm not making that mistake again.  Unless some medical emergency happens, i'm holding my measly 1.7 until bank or bust.  I don't care if it bombs to $0, I won't miss out on an opportunity again lol.  Granted, it was in its infancy and I was a poor college student at the time, it still stings a bit.  It was only 5-10 coins if I remember correctly, certainly feel sorry for my friend.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:48:00
well with the differing of opinions, now i know which to believe :P
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:50:20
I've been sitting on 1.7 since it was $100 as well.  I had 10 a few years back but sold them for $20 a piece for beer money in college.  For that reason alone I'm never touching my 1.7 haha.  But I'm with you.  I check on it every so often, and then forget about it again.  +/-, I'm just riding the pines now lol.
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:53:08
I sold 5 coins about 5 years back for beer money.  I feel your pain, stranger.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:40:20
got my coins. took about 7 hours all in all.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:22:38
ah, i see you're in the same boat as me.  I anticipate it's because so many people are withdrawing currently, that they don't have the coins on hand lol.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:39:15
I withdrew a couple coins yesterday and it took 7 hours.  I must be one of the lucky ones.
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:59:22
I bought @ $2 and sold @ $25 for beer money in college haha.  If not, I would have lost them in the MtGox debacle.  That calms me.
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:43:18
Transfered all my coins to my Electrum wallet a couple hours ago and the transaction isn't showing up in the Coinbase account, lol.  I got an e-mail saying it is getting transferred, and I downloaded the report saying it was.
It says it'll take 72 hours, so lets hope they stay true to their word.  (I did the accelerated withdrawal, but lets see if it actually does anything.  It was a couple coins)
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:25:07
I moved mine to an Electrum account while I wait for my hardware wallet to ship.
