Forgot to mention that I explained below. But I now realize no matter how much I explain, it just won't do. Now I feel bad/horrible that I angered some Bitcoin users on here while probably bringing more dislike towards the Doge community. None of which I intended to do, at all. I hate drama. Anyway, sorry about that. 1 upvote for you and have some more doge too.

I just received some tips, and I'd love to pass them on to help your fund!

But I know a user's history is public info, anyone can look at my user history. I never once said I was new to cryptocurrencies, just to Bitcoin. Making Reddit accounts isn't very difficult, if I really wanted to hide my history I would've just made a new account.

Thanks for the hug. Idk why this whole thing is affecting like it is.
And yeah you make a good point re: dogetips, I thought that was just me being nice/trying to be above the drama... or whatever... but it could be taken the wrong way. 
Thanks again 100 bits

Thanks again for everything! It's not much, but I hope you'll accept this doge +all doge verify

Uh, that's why I never mentioned Dogecoin initially. In hindsight, I guess not mentioning it initially is a lot worse. But note it doesn't say "I'll go to another crypto currency and cause a lot of unnecessary drama just for the fun of it because yeah that'll be great for the Doge community" =| 
Also thanks for sharing something really personal. But like I said, a user's history is public for all to see. If I wanted to hide that, I would've created a new account. But anyway, I know this is a losing fight. No matter what I say, it won't change your mind. 
EDIT: And I never said that I was moving to Bitcoin (from Dogecoin). I just said I became re-interested in Bitcoin. Why can't someone be a part of both communities? Damn. 
EDIT2: Sorry about the dogetip, I hope you didn't take that the wrong way. I don't have much but please accept this as my apology 100 bits

Thanks - I don't blame your spidey senses either; I wouldn't want anyone trying to spam/scam/mess with my community. When I get more bits in my ChangeTip account I'll send some your way! I'm just glad things seemed to have settled down. Thanks for understanding and sorry again if I caused any drama.

Uh, OP here. Why does it matter that my entire history is in I actually initially signed up for Reddit to comment on the MH370 update threads. Does that say something (potentially negative) about me as well?
I initially subscribed to Bitcoin because I wanted to learn about cryptocurrencies but moved over to Dogecoin because I enjoyed the doge meme. I will always be a part of the Doge community, but now, I also want to try my hands at Bitcoin. Why can't someone have both? 
Also, I guess I should've said "I recently received tips in bits from multiple generous Bitcoin users" - didn't figure to check my ChangeTip account before posting. 
Anyway, Dogetips for all!

Sorry for whatever drama I initially caused. That was definitely not my intention. I feel horrible. You probably don't care for receiving dogetips (as indicated by the down votes), so have some bits instead.

Luckily, I think things finally cooled off in here, and I will definitely be sticking around in the Bitcoin community.
And please don't feel like you're partly responsible! You did an awesome thing with that tipping post; it definitely made me think about getting into Bitcoin. I also see you tipping other users all the time. You are incredibly awesome for what you do. So thank you so much for your kind words and the bits. I will definitely be tipping it forward! 
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:49:11
But I'm not trying to cause drama? I don't understand why everyone thinks I am. I legitimately am interested in Bitcoin too. 
Oh well. Can't please everyone.

We've had Bitcoin users come over and say hi to the Dogecoin community. I've had generous Bitcoin users tip me in bits. I guess I didn't realize the hostile relationship between the two. I can't speak on behalf of all shibes, but I for one am not trying to cause any drama.

Thanks again for the info. Sorry I caused some unnecessary drama. 
I really appreciate it, but here's your tip back 150 bits

I was just defining a word - satoshi. I used this wiki article which I found through Google by searching for "satoshi" when I had that very question:  I know about DOGE/BTC exchange rates and satoshi because that's one metric people use to define the value of Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies. 
EDIT: And I think I might just go into hiding after this for a while, in both communities. Heh. So if you don't see me it's not an admission of guilt, it's just... I'm really embarrassed by all of this.

Here's the first tip I received:  - I saw a user tip someone else in bits and it was the first time I saw that. 
Here's the second tip I received: 
 - he started a thread tipping shibes in bits.
In hindsight, both of those users are shibes, I guess. I just thought it was really cool. I didn't realize you could tip in bits. I really like the giving aspect of dogetips, and the bit tips really made me interested in Bitcoin again. And I think it'd be fun to tip both in bits and doge. And by no means does this mean I want Bitcoin to be like Dogecoin, so please don't read into it. 
And maybe I'll make a new thread tonight. I'm oddly exhausted after trying to "defend" myself when in actuality it might have been better to just not say anything at all. Heh. *sigh*.

Wow, thank you so much. I really appreciate this. My sincerest gratitude, please accept some doge +250 doge
