Thanks! Looks like this is a way to earn interest on BTC. I wonder what the type of the custody solution that these guys are using.

There is no incentive for the lender to pay.
The lender has the following choices:
1) Lend Bitcoin and pay interest.
 - You'd have PV(BTC) - Interest - NPV(Default Risk)
2) Hold Bitcoin.
 - You'd have PV(BTC)
PV = Present Value
NPV = Net Present Value
In a perfect economy, option 2 is the rational choice. Hence, unless the interest is earned for the lender, there is no reason to lend money. Hence, war cannot be funded.

I have an actuarial, finance and economics background. Every time I try to talk people out of their stupidity, it never works because they can't handle being 'wrong' and will try to oppose you with no evidence until you give up. So I gave up giving proper info to others now. Needless to say, those educational backgrounds really helped me in outperforming others by a BIG margin.

I see alot of unworthy comments here.
First of all, if you want to become a highly profitable trader, you shouldn't solely rely on TA to trade. If you're okay with making $100 a day, sure by all means you can all in TA. 
If you want to be truly successful, you need to consider the fundamentals and the market sentiment and THEN use TA to find your entry / exit points.
