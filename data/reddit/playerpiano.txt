good point, i guess it's dependent on how patient the buyer is when considering when to spend their BTC.

so that means they'll retain their value despite the supply being increased after 2032?

but once the supply increases, the value will change based on the supply. which follows your reasoning, if we found a huge supply of new gold, the value of the existing gold would decrease with the introduction of the new supply.

ah, so regardless of when you buy ownership, the percentage will remain the same. instead of a decrease in value, there'd be an increase...right?

ah that's true, hadn't thought of it like that. that gives me a better idea of when to buy and exchange BTC's. it's not so much the USD exchange rate, but how much value i assign the goods i'm purchasing with bitcoins. thanks!

I didn't know there was a ceiling, thank you for clarifying. so does that mean that once 21M has been reached, the best strategy would be to buy as many as possible when the exchange rate is low? it seems that it wouldn't be prudent to buy right right now since there are 10M more BTC's to be created.

true, i'm looking at it in a risk-assessment sort of way though. stock in a company is an established way of evaluating value, while BTC is entirely new. that doesn't mean it's more risky, it's just a new territory that hasn't been explored yet. I'm excited to see where it goes though!
