You can see a list of supported coins here:
Ledger coins - 
Trezor coins - 
As for other coins, what I’ve done in the past is set up as secure a wallet as you can/are comfortable with (depends on coin and what is available), and then write down the passphrase, test the recovery, then delete the wallet. At that point you have a paper wallet only. To be extra secure you could generate it offline to make sure the keys never see the internet. There should be plenty of guides and advice on that though if you need more detail (search for offline paper wallets).

Of course, the crypto scaling issue is the issue of the decade at this point. There are literally billions of dollars at stake on every side of the argument, so I’m sure a lot of time, effort and money is and will continue to be thrown around trying to steer things. Almost impossible as a layman to know where the truth sits. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:25:33
Of course it costs money to use. Who do you think processes your payments lol? It’s just the merchant paying it not you, but that cost is ultimately passed to the consumer anyway in the final price of goods. 
See the revenue of companies like Visa - its not anywhere close to cheap even, crypto can compete easily if done well. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:10:19
I didn't even think of that interpretation lol. That would give him a massive holding of ~0.083 BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:00:28
So it may as well be a whole new coin, only that it's input+output only goes to BTC. There needs to be some serious integrations between the two before it makes any real sense to the average consumer and gets adopted. I think that's gonna be so many years off, and I would expect altcoins to pick up the slack before that happens.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:28:04
Bank transfers are a tiny percentage, they are free in the UK also, I don’t think thats a huge deal. Its the card payment fees that are expensive, and that applies to debit cards also. If you refuse to accept those payments in the UK, then say goodbye to 70%+ of your sales. People don’t use cash, they use card, and it costs money...which is added onto the sale price when all is said and done. I assume most countries are similar to this, your one country isn’t changing the landscape.
Ultimately who cares if the consumer or the merchant is paying the fee directly...the consumer pays either way in the end. Also no reason to think crypto doesn’t develop similar systems allowing the merchant to effectively pay by discounting prices at point of sale dynamically with the fee amount? Its not a difficult problem.

Geez, give people control of their own money and they instantly just want someone else to hold it for them. If there are forks, or their coins go missing, or they decide to just fuck everyone over and run, then what are you gonna do if coinbase look the other way? Linking to their own customer support telling you why is safe is meaningless, why believe them? Or why trust their insurance? Say they had a loss but their insurance company found a get-out? There are literally hundreds of ways you can be bitten in the ass if you let someone else manage your money, whether they have the best intentions or not.
I just simply do not understand, for the sake of less than $100, why you wouldn't secure your money. It's unbelievably easy to do, and a pretty good learning experience to boot if you have never done it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:28:55


I wouldn't say that was certain at all. Plenty of times in the past BTC has lost &gt;50% of it's value. I suppose being larger now means it's more stable...but it's still small.
I don't think it's a bad time to get in though necessarily, but if it fell to 6k or something I wouldn't be entirely surprised given past events.
Either way, in the long run it will probably bounce back. I highly doubt the next 'crash' will be the end of bitcoin lol :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:11
No problem. Still, a small investment now *could* still lead to a life changing amount of money. Just gotta keep grounded. Say you put down a few thousand, and it grows into an amount that can put a big deposit down on a house. Because of the large deposit, you will have a better interest rate, and the savings snowball for the next 20 years and allow you to pay off your mortgage years ahead of when you might otherwise.
So, don't think it's not worth it if you think it's gonna go up, be smart with it, invest only what you can afford, and what you can afford to lose, and hopefully it will see you well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:19:42
Because it's probably just a made up cautionary tale. Doesn't really matter if it's true, because it has happened, just to someone else lol. You're 100% correct though, nobody in their right mind forgets the name of a website they put $4k into, let alone the value it would have been when it was lost.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:59:33
I just use BTC and BCH mostly, its easier. Bitcoin and Bitcash would seem like sensible names to me but as you say its too late for argument lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:00:41
No, there are huge sell orders on the exchanges right now, 100% objectively proving this incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:33:26
That’s the core idea behind it. Mining = payment processing. Its distributed, controlled by ‘the people’, not by a bank. 
The blockchain is like a long bank statement, and its publicly available to check for any foul play. Everyone has to be in agreement before a payment is written in stone. Someone can start making a false bank statement, but everyone else confirms its wrong and ignores it. 
As miners ‘mine’, they collect fees and also earn new coins. Eventually there are no new coins (there is a maximum amount, no more banks printing money and devaluing your currency), so the fees support the processing then onwards. Of course it’s a gentle transition, and already started. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:32:08
Yep. This is the main point I drum into anyone starting in crypto. Yet everyone does it still. People are conditioned to think everything to do with money is regulated, safe and insured. Until it isn’t.

Great points! If nothing else, we have some interesting times ahead it seems. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:01:09
Sometimes I wonder if it would be easier to just buy and store bitcoins for people, but fuck having that burden on my head lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:56
I don't really know the specifics, but I do know if you don't put a high enough fee, your payment can get 'stuck', and can be a pain to unstick. Most payments now will go with a default fee, to process in an hour or so. Right now there is insane volume going through, so it could take a long while. But, I wouldn't sweat it, everything will catch up eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:59:37
Right thats what I mean. Loading my account *at all* is an extra step. I’m not saying it’s hard, but I’m saying it’s just another step away from normality and will harm uptake. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:58
Just saw it go 19k&gt;16k in a matter of seconds. I dunno what the hell is going on lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:55
I think the simple way to think about it is payments need processing, and you can offer a ‘reward’ for a miner if they process your payment. So the higher your fee, the faster it’s processed. Pay too little or nothing and your payment is so undesirable it gets left for days or longer. Pay a very high fee and you will be processed almost instantly. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:51:14
There isn't anything 'insane' about it. That's how it should be. BTC is in an awful place and that really need not have happened. BCH is gonna swallow up the market share in the meantime since it actually has the ability to function.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:11:40
But it’s more likely than not that these owners ultimately cash out to their own wallets, so its worth including them. 
I’m fully on the ‘be in control of your own money’ train though.

Or a single government/bank, they surely have a dog in this fight by now, and trying to play each other.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:32:14
Yup lol. People want ease of use, at almost any cost. Early adopters loved the ideals behind crypto, the decentralisation, the protection from inflation. The more mainstream it goes the more people just want a slice of magic internet money that will make them rich, and don’t really care what it is. 
Can’t blame people though, its human nature, but I just wish people would consider the very real security concerns when storing their money. I hate to see people get scammed/robbed - both for them, and for the public image it gives bitcoin. 
Oh well, you can lead a horse to water...
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:28:34
What I don’t get is why don’t people place sell orders at 11999.99? The sell orders there were only 10% of the sell orders at 12000, so it really increases the certainty you will sell, for the cost of 1 cent per 12k? I’d really expect to see a ‘bidding war’ (for lack of better term) going down 1c at a time until you are ‘first’. That certainly does happen, but nowhere near the extent I would have guessed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:35:46


BIP39 uses 2048 words.


Then they have the same private key, and so...same wallet. That's why making up a private key or using a song lyric or a verse from a book is a terrible idea. Trying to find a random key is very, very difficult, but running lines of a book and checking for wallet funds is trivial for a computer to do today, let alone in the future. Keys need to be randomised to be secure.
On top of that, there are 2048 set words, so it's unlikely a book would contain them all (perhaps, I don't actually know how common the words are) to work. You could of course look at the word list, and write your own story or lyric, but then seed phrases that make grammatical sense may be an attack vector someone uses.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:05:03
100% this. I did the same as you OP, got a trezor, did a test payment, wiped the device, recovered it, then sent the bulk over. It’s crazy how easy everything is becoming, nobody should feel intimidated by hardware wallets, they really are easy to use, and easy to recover from your phrase if its lost or stolen. 
I would even go as far as saying they are the easiest wallet to use out of anything. Local wallets like electrum, or phone apps, even some web wallets can be a bit confusing with all the security options, where as hardware wallets are a streamlined step by step logical device with few places to do it wrong. 
The only bit to really worry about is good storage and security of the recovery phrase, but I’m sure everyone can work something out, common sense serves for that bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:35:55
I think the real issue for me is being able to sift through all the arguments and FUD from both sides and find the truth. Reality is, the only way to know with any certainty is learn and understand it fully, and come to my own conclusions. Not an easy task without a computer science background..! Probably not an easy task even with one. 
Maybe the easier way is lean towards BTC as my gut says, but hold some BCH too, which given its current price isn’t so bad. Particularly since most of my coin was pre-fork, topping up to equal on both isn’t a huge investment (not that I need equal, I guess). 
Dunno really, I shall do more digging and have a sleep on it. Appreciate the insight! :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:14:06
Why not? People have been accepting it more and more for 5 years, and every time there is a downspike after this much rapid growth. Yes there will (probably) be an overall upward trend, but there has to be a downspike sooner or later. Maybe it keeps rolling to 20k then spikes to 15k, maybe it gets to 15k and spikes down to 6k. But there will surely be one.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:48:07
Any that have publicly identified themselves though? I've no doubt some early hodlers have similar amounts kicking around still but I'd probably be keeping that quiet personally.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:22:26
I guess that’s a good alternative, yeah. Each to their own. As long as the encryption was done initially on an offline machine and then properly wiped. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:52
Yup, I bought in 2013, but I only bought 1 coin. It was a curiosity, not an investment. I think a lot of people are the same. Still, having ‘only’ 1 coin is proving itself to be a very nice asset, so I can’t really complain! 
Bonus of being in pre-fork also, I can ignore all the scaremongering on both sides of the fence and just keep both coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:08:54
I think it's the whole pre-loading thing that makes it different in my mind though. At some point I need to 'load value' into LN. I *must* do that in bulk, since that's the entire point. So I then have two value stores, right? I have a 'balance due to me' for everything on the LN, and a 'balance' in BTC. If I want to see my net assets, I now have two places to check.
Regular banks &amp; visa etc, it all remains in a single bank account. If I want to check my net assets, it's all there.
I think that is a pretty significant problem for mass adoption personally. The way around it would be wallets that just list your net asset, and you spend money wherever and however you want, same as a regular bank, and it decides how to handle the money in the background - but that sort of thing is a LONG way off presumably, and in the meantime perhaps a better scaling solution presents itself.
We have...  
Option A, BTC+LN = over complicated  
Option B, BCH = Crude, brute force method  
Option C, ??? = Elegant solution yet to be discovered  
I think we need Option C for crypto to gain mass adoption. Until then, I think it will remain a small asset store. BCH and BTC are fighting between each other calling each others coins shit, when in reality all crypto is shit in it's own way. When will the godcoin come? Who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:29:24
Man, I just couldn't deal with the pressure of that haha. If I were to hold some for a friend, it would have to be on the very clear understanding that they are only as secure as my own coins are. If I lose, they lose. Plus I'd make a point to sit down and show them the whole process, and thoroughly document who owns what and what that means.
Soon as you start charging for profit, there is an expectation you are guaranteeing the funds.
All in all, I suspect it would not be worth the hassle :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:09:40
Yeah, it's not really intended by design to have high fees, and there are several proposed or arguably already active solutions to that. Bitcoin Cash (or Bcash as it may end up being called) forked from bitcoin, and currently has much lower fees. That new coin has a larger block size - essentially more transactions per block, so has capacity to handle more (on-chain scaling - the blockchain itself has scaled up). Many argue that's a crude solution that leads to a huge unmanageable blockchain...maybe that's the case, maybe not. Bitcoin on the other hand seems to be heading in a direction of 'off-chain scaling' - where smaller payments can be processed outside of the main block chain, and then reconciled at a later date with it. This proposed solution supposedly can be near instant and nearly free to use. It's being tested now, but only time will tell how that all works out.
Also, many other coins may have low fees, but they are also nowhere near the scale of bitcoin. Bitcoin used to have no or low fees too...so it's really down to the design of the system in what the fee's may end up being.
I really don't see it being an issue long term though, one way or the other a solution will work and it will stick, and soon as it does, better be on the train lol. Knowing which train to catch...yeah I suppose there is your risk. But a handful are gonna be huge.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:47
Because at some point more and more people stop buying it and start selling it instead, because they fear, like me, it will go down. It's all psychology really...if everyone was 100% sure it would go up, then everyone would buy it, and it would go up. But that never happens with stocks or currency.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:03:09
Well, exciting times either way! See you in a years time, shoot me a PM to gloat if you are right eh? :D 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:45:12
No reason banks or anyone else can’t offer those services still though that I can see. Things can be handled off-chain and reconciled with it later. Bitcoin can be the base, just as gold used to be. As long as the ‘gold’ is in the right place at end of all the days transactions, banks can give cards, refunds, loans, fraud protection just like always, keep it on a ledger, and balance up on the blockchain periodically. 
The thing they can’t do? Print more on a whim. 
Sure, this is decades off from now, but its not like everyone first imagines. We don’t need to all have apps on our phone, and scan a QR code for every purchase. Off-chain services will take up the bulk, and the majority will go for that easy option, while allowing others to continue managing themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:28:38
Breadwallet uses bits and I find it insanely annoying honestly. It’s too far the other way. No doubt it would be good in the long term but I’d say its too early for it now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:19:39
Yes, but we don’t know if they actually think it’s a good store of value and will go up or they are helping artificially pump the price just to sell later. To give a simple example, they could say its gonna hit 100k, convince everyone to hold until 100k, then sell out at 90k. The price isn’t a reflection of any true value, it’s only supply and demand.
I’m not saying which way it will go, or if they are genuine, all I’m saying really is you can’t rely on anybody to be truthful when they have an interest in it. 
They own bitcoin, they would be INSANE to be acting anything but 4000x positive and hyped about it. Same for 99% of this subreddit, its a circlejerk echo chamber, because we are all invested into it, and want the hype and growth. The more people who buy in the better we all do.
Thats really just how it is, trust your own judgement, or pick who you trust carefully, because everyone else is just acting in their own interest if they realise it or not.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:31:38
That is the main concern I think yes. You would very likely need a data center/super computer to hold a copy of something that currently runs on an average home PC with ease.
So yeah it’s decentralised still, but only if you pay for the hardware. Groups of people could do it fairly easily though. Its more a point of having the option available to you, vs being out of your control off-chain. 
At least this is my basic understanding. I view BCH as possibly the more true, pure coin, and BTC being the practical realisation of that, assuming off-chain scaling happens. What I don’t really know though is how much control/security/privacy is given up by going off-chain. If its minimal, and works, seems like a good option. But thats all way over my head...at least thus far :D Always more learning to do eh...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:23
No, it won't. There will be 21 million coins at maximum for bitcoin. If 100th of a bitcoin is 'enough to be settled' (I assume that's what he meant?), then we are talking what, 100k minimum, just for ease of calculation? That puts each coin at 10 million, and the total supply worth 210 trillion.
Total USD in circulation is 1.2 trillion right now according to google.
Total value of all above ground gold globally is 7.5 trillion according to google.
So yeah, depends what number you wanna base it off, but 0.01 BTC will never be a crazy amount of money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:10
It’s offline. Trezor keeps the private keys on the Trezor device, and never, ever exposes them to a PC. Thats the advantage of HW wallets over a paper wallet - you can manage and spend your money securely, even on a virus infested machine. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:23:56
Yeah, I’m sure eventually we will end on 3-4 commonly used coins, may be none of those even exist yet, doesn’t really matter. Wallets will support and allow easy payments from any coin at some point, it will all become so simple and understandable. It already is so much easier than a few years ago, really. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:37
So in your opinion BCH is doomed to fail due to not being able to practically scale up? Or I suppose the argument against that is perhaps that by the time it becomes globally mainstream, our processing power and storage will have caught up enough to make it viable. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:03
God damn, high fees! But yeah, it will clear at some point then with a fee like that, but it's hard to say how long it will take.
Here is a good indicator of which fee to use. Bit hard to get your head around, but basically every transaction has a size in bytes, a typical transaction will be around 225. This tells you the blocks/time it will take depending on satoshi's/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:58
Depends what fee you paid. Can be anywhere from instant to never, literally.

Nice ride! I got a Mazda also this year (mazda 6) - absolutely love it. Didn’t buy with BTC though..! Congrats and enjoy :) 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:58:08
Right, but think about it from an end user perspective, for a web page, I press a button and it works. With LN, I actually have to manually micro-manage payments on and off the network, right? Unless I'm mistaken with that.
Someone else brought up the analogy of gift cards. It's like putting money onto a (universally accepted) giftcard before buying something. Then that money sits on the giftcard, outside of my bank (BTC). It's not just a network layer in the background, it's an actual layer the user has to deal with.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:11:07
The 'seed' or 'recovery phrase' is literally the key to your wallet. With crypto, if you have the key, you can spend your funds. In some ways, you can kinda think of your key as **being** your wallet, since that is all you ever need to access it, in it's entirety.
Think of it like this...your wallet exists 'in the cloud', you can't physically lose it, if it's on a hardware or paper wallet, that is simply a written copy of your wallet. The **only** way you can fuck up is let someone else have your key (theft or stupidity), or lose your key. Hardware wallets keep the key offline. It's never exposed to the internet, it's never exposed to anybody but yourself, offline. So that's issue 1 sorted. 
Issue 2 - losing your key - this is where the recovery phrase is helpful. Your key will look like utter nonsense. A long string of letters and numbers. Write it down and you will surely make a typo. So, using a particular calculation, which is a known standard (e.g. BIP39), you can convert your nonsense key into a string of words. Often 12, or 24 words. The order is important. To be clear, these words **are your key**, just written in a different way.
So, you have lost your hardware or paper wallet, or deleted your wallet app, had your PC stolen...whatever. As long as you wrote down these words, you can enter those into a new wallet (can be hardware wallet, online wallet, or to generate a new paper wallet), and it will turn that back into the raw key string, and again give you full, up to date, ready to spend access. At this point, should the key be potentially compromised (stolen hardware wallet may only be pin protected for example), you can move the funds to a new address.
So in summary, the two rules you need to follow at all times: 
1. **Do not let any PC, app, camera, person, or anything but yourself see your private key** (seed/phrase). Seriously...never enter it on a PC, never take a photo of it. Hand written, from an offline/secure device (such as HW wallet) only.
2. **Do not lose that private key** (seed/phrase). As long as you have it, you're golden. How you store it is up to you. Buried in the garden, split into parts and given to trusted family, in a safe, under a floorboard, in a bank vault...that's your call. Do what you are comfortable with, but know the importance of it.
If you want the easy route, buy a Trezor or Ledger Nano. They are beginner friendly, and walk you through it all. The only place to fuck up is when sending the funds to it, so send a test payment first to make sure you are comfortable sending. Do it as many times are you need to be comfortable, don't sweat the fees too much.
I guess you can also fuck up if you write the recovery seed down wrong. I suggest setting up, putting $1 or so of coin onto it, and then wiping the wallet clean and see if you can restore it. Trezor has a feature where you can enter your seed on the device also, so it never touches your PC. It's a bit of a pain, but worth it. Not sure about Ledger, probably has similar.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:26:07
"Hmm...so if I bought these amounts, I end up with 21? Where do I sign up!"
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:51:36
A USB thumb drive isn't secure. The computer can read the files on it. A virus can get hold of your data. If it's stolen someone else can steal your private keys. A hardware wallet is ground up designed to be very basic, there are very very few attack vectors. You can plug it into the most virus infested PC, load up your wallet, and make a payment, without any issue. It simply never leaks out your private keys.
As for it being confusing, well yeah, it's not as easy as regular money, but trust me it's getting much easier as time goes on. Backup phrases didn't used to be a thing, you had to look after your own wallet and keys and it was a pain in the ass. In the future, no reason bitcoin can't be just as easy as regular banking, really. It just need support and development.
But, doesn't that make it a good time to get in? The masses are scared, it's too hard, complicated (it's not, but that's the perception). So the demand is low. As it grows and gets easier...the masses come in, and the price goes up.
Honestly, do some reading, buy $5 worth, have a play. What do you have to lose? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:42:59
Yeah so if it's on an exchange or a website like coinbase, they essentially hold the coins themselves, and keep a track of what they owe to who. At any point, you can request them to send the coins (or  regular currency, if you have sold) to an account. So you put your wallet address in and they send it.
I'm not entirely sure on the specifics of it for each site, some may hold it in an online wallet that you control but it's probably not likely.
Really the easy way to think of it is all currency and coins on an exchange are just casino chips. You put them on the website, you get chips you don't own, then you cash those chips out to your own wallet. Only a fool holds onto casino chips, hoping the casino doesn't shut down. If that makes sense...

I don't know enough on the topic, but do you think off-chain scaling goes against what bitcoin is *actually* all about though? I know there is friction between the BTC and the BCH crowd, leading to potential over zealous claims on either side. Where is the truth in the matter? Is off chain scaling going to give the power back to the banks or whatever the fear may be?

Kinda funny isn’t it? A lot of people bought in small, as a curiosity. You are more than happy to tell the world about this interesting new thing, in fact, maybe people bought it AS a talking piece. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:01:10
If that is the case...then that is amazing honestly. I think thats where we need to be, and I didn’t expect it to be that way off the bat. Heres hoping, then.

Yeah when it was mid 11k yesterday there was 700+ bitcoins on sell order at 12k. I dunno what it looked like later as I was in bed lol, but that’s 8.4m, which people are saying cleared very quickly. It’s crazy how much money is changing hands. The 24h trade volume is always a staggering number too. Over 27k coins on gdax alone. When you think bitcoin is still small, and this is one exchange, it’s absolutely ridiculous how much gets traded every day in the world across currencies and stocks and whatever else. There are some real big boys in the market and I’m not about to try compete on the trading front :D

No, if you restore your wallet from a seed, you don't need a pin. The pin is only needed to access a private key already on a wallet, not to add a new key to one.
Kind of like a phone, you need a pin to unlock a phone with someones data on it, but if you factory restore the phone, then put your data back on it, you don't need a pin and can add a new one later.

No problem. Its a topic I struggled with as well, as someone who isn’t really that knowledgeable about the technical side of things haha. There is tons of information on it out there but hardly any of it makes any sense without knowing the jargon. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:43:17
As far as I make it - you’re not wrong. LN is clever, and will be useful in niche situations, but it’s not the widely useable network thats promised. BTC is going down a bad path putting so much reliance on LN and ignoring any other solution. At some point it will become clear LN doesn’t solve the scaling issue and we will just have to see if that is before or after other coins overtake BTC. I’m not holding my breath...

And every company seems to still use them like utilities etc if they have to refund you. They will take your money electronically no problem but you want it back and they have to send it in the post...no surprise there.

No...anything older than an iPhone 5 and suddenly this becomes a free upgrade rather than a fair swap, and that isn't really the point of it. The point is he wants 5 people who genuinely want to leave apple and switch to android, not 5 bargain hunters.

Greater London yes, City of London highly doubtful. Since it wasn't defined, I guess you are correct.

Yeah...I bought in at 1BTC=£80 and am just going to sit on it. Happy to lose it all, and happy to be on the band wagon should it rise. I guess for people looking to invest significant money they cant afford to lose its different, but day to day bitcoin doesnt cross my mind. If everyone does what I do it will never take off though that is the flip side.
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:48:55
Wow 100k, never thought I'd see that so soon.
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:47:20
Yeah they seem pretty good these days, I had some issues with them about 6 or so years back so use ebuyer instead, but they seem to get glowing reviews all around now and their prices are competitive.
@_date: 2014-06-21 15:47:11
I agree. Maybe its better to spend money on either promoting more enviro friendly plastic usage, or research into more cost effective cleanup methods. At this price its a never ending money sink.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:35:29
Great info, I never knew it would be such a large percentage for a transaction like that. There must be a lot of very rich people hoping bitcoin doesn't take off!

Some interesting reading on that here:
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:42:27
It is daunting to buy though, especially for non-techie people. I don’t blame people at all for not investing because you do have to commit a lot of time and effort to get comfortable with it, and we live in a world where we are told of these ‘huge opportunities’ on a weekly basis. How are they to know this one was actually gonna work? Lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:15:52
Does it matter? Aside from making sure you are secure, why does every user of a currency need to know everything about it? If mass adoption is the goal, it should be simple and easy and you don't need to know how it works.

I keep seeing ‘bitcoin 40k by end 2018’ prediction, where on earth did that stem from? Did one popular guy say it and everyone else is parroting?
Not that I think it can’t or won’t happen, just seems specifically 40k. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:12:04
Publicity stunt, and less effort. Win-win.

Currently that is, but there is nothing to say it can't be further divided if needed.

Teachers are normal people, some normal people happen to be idiots, unfortunately. This is a lesson you will come to learn in life. People in 'high up' positions that you would think have sense, like teachers, doctors, managers...they make some very stupid decisions. There's two things you can do...ignore and move on, or call them out on it with whatever measure you see fit. As others have said, I think think in this scenario you should do the latter. A teacher of all people should recognise potential in somebody, and it's worrying that they are attempting to stomp this potential out and create an uninspired and bored individual instead.
@_date: 2013-10-01 13:53:42
Well maybe but most big UK banks are also based all over the world it seems strange if they charge one thing in one place and another somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:34:40
Per unit yes, but in it's entirety it's a tiny currency. Since the coins are limited to 21 million units, they **have** to increase in value a **lot** more if they are ever used as a major currency. If each coin is $100, and there are 21m coins total, then that totals 2.1 billion USD...practically nothing in the grand scheme of things. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 12:24:05
I'm just pretty fucking confused all together...who pays 3.5% EVER to move money? If I pay £5 to a friend it's free, if I pay £10,000 to a company it's free, if I pay money abroad it's a flat rate. I just don't understand where these numbers are being taken from...it's just sensationalist nonsense. This is not the advantage of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:34:54
Right, but assuming bitcoin loss in the future will be small, we will end up with 15 million+ coins. Nobody is going to crash that easily so realistically it's not a problem. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:58:12
Ahh..well that shuts me up! Here I am with my 5 coins, do you think I can manipulate some markets? Hehe.

My thoughts exactly! How the F does this get through QA? Not a major problem for me I guess but I now have to contact 4 or 5 companies via email to get this sorted out. 
Lesson learned on my part I guess...I just set it up and forgot about it, never considered how I could restore these keys should I lose my phone or anything.

This. Using bitcoin in this instance is stupid, it could be worth double or half in just a few hours time and doesn't give the guy a decent value to price his item at. We all know what GBP/USD are worth so why be a nazi about it?

1 trillion dollars with 21 million coins...$47619 per coin. 
That would still give us plenty of room with 8 decimal places! 
If bitcoin ever gets that big, it will be an interesting wealth shift. People on this subreddit would be the most powerful group in the world lol.

I think he is saying that because of all the attention bitcoin is getting lately, it is possible that members of the public may go on another bitcoin investment frenzy and cause another bubble to happen. On the flip side, many people think that it's just a sign of how well bitcoin is doing and shows a healthy growth.
Time will tell I guess...but I'm inclined to think there is truth behind OP's bubble theory - bitcoin has historically proved itself to be one hell of an investment opportunity and people love jumping on the bandwagon (myself included...that's how I ended up with bitcoins if I'm going to be honest about it).
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:07:50
It's probably not being enforced at all - how could it be when bitcoin is anonymous? They just have to have that rule with employees so they don't seem like they are inside trading and ruin their rep. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:17:43
0.0015%, bet 0.01 BTC, place 50,000 bets. Did not win. OK that's all I need to know. 
but...maybe 50,001 is my lucky number! 
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:48:16
That is true of any currency. If everyone wanted to sell USD then their value vs other currencies would fall massively too. It's just supply and demand.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:02:46
Yes you are right, this kind of explosive growth is not a good thing, but in it's very one of a kind case, it does need very **steady** yet rapid growth over a number of years if it's to ever be a widely used currency in the future. It's got it's uses at the moment but it's still an 'underground' currency. Maybe that's where it belongs though, who knows.

Awesome! That has saved me tons of hassle. Thought it would be fairly simple to reset but most of the companies I had 2 factor auth with wanted passport &amp; proof of address scans. Didn't get around to that yet so this is great news.

I guess people use it because many people view it as a stock to by bought and sold rather than a legitimate currency.
