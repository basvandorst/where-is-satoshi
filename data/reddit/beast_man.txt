I also got [downvoted](
You have a point about the lack of promotion, certainly when posts like this come along it is the perfect opportunity to inform others.

I have just started using [Pocket]( its an android ap with a windows version, it syncs all your devices via dropbox. great for being able to access your passwords from your andriod phone and your PC.
have not heard any bad news about it yet...

@_date: 2011-06-17 05:30:45
when did you start mining and whats your hash rate?

I would not be at all surprised if the this hacks intention was purely to destabilize and deter further adoption of bitcoin, by banks, government or other people who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin fail.
IMO, bad news is good news, shit like this is only going to spark more interest in bitcoin, its too late to stop it now.

I purchased my first lot of bit coins through  via paypal.
@_date: 2011-06-07 11:21:02

I deposited AU$ via direct deposit on Friday, the money got in to my account Tuesday evening. I assume it would be quicker during the week.

well most of the transactions I made worked, so probably nothing. but as far as I can tell it was a key variable in what went wrong in my situation.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:30:22
Yes , but if in doubt check blockchain.info to make sure you have your expected balance in the expected address. If anything goes wrong while you are syncing it will be a lot longer before its noticed, in my case this resulted in a lot of confusion about what happened and when.

The unconfirmed transactions are all accounted for, its just the one transaction that is missing now, unfortunately that has over 70 confirmations, I have a feeling its gone, I must be missing a change transaction key :(
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:29:04
You're awesome!
It was because of the encryption reset that I thought I had lost the coins forever, the backup I had was unencrypted and thus useless for the missing change transaction.
I still think I am incredibly lucky that I managed to recover them.
Hopefully this will save some people the agony of loosing coins in the future, it hurts more when you know it was your own fault!

Just about!

Thought I would also note that Havelock Investments seems to be quite user friendly and easy to setup an account. 
Offerings are limited at the moment with only the above IPO and two Mining Funds.
They also offer the purchase of Satoshi Dice shares via Passthru from MPEX.

 -buy 1/100th of a share, easy to get coins in and out
 - My choice, good features and easy to get money in and out.
 - bit harder to get money in and out, usually a little cheaper here.
 - manually buy and sell on the forums, usually get a better price, probably safer than trusting a 3rd party, but a lot more effort.

I guess you would start by finding the transaction ID of the withdrawal from Silkroad and checking to make sure it went to the correct address?
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:11:50
I'm still not really sure.  From what I can figure there were at least 3 things I did wrong.
 * I was using the same wallet on two PC's. 
 * I made transactions before syncing had completed. 
 * I moved around wallets between PC's  with out a proper understanding of how change addresses work. 
@_date: 2013-02-02 02:04:19
I guess the confusing part is if this is something that I stuffed up either last night or long ago when I made the wallet backup then why have these transactions happened now? and the coins went somewhere if you have a look at the block chain.
[just seems fishy to me...](
@_date: 2013-02-02 01:30:32
Yes I still have the old wallet.dat and I have let it sync but it still has unconfirmed transactions.
I have tried all my back up wallets and they seem to either have this transaction in them or don't and have unconfirmed transactions.
It's possible a wallet.dat may have been deleted when a pc was reformatted long long ago but transactions that were made after this one are still there.
the simplest answer is I have stuffed up somewhere, just still trying to understand how, thanks for your input.
