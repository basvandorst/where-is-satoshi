How do you know it’s a private and not public adress?
Also are you sure it’s not mymonero.com wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:15:02
TBH This is most responsible thing to do for ANY bank. You shouldn’t be buying risky investments on credit.
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:29:22
This is actually surprisingly correct, but I doubt that many people are aware of that.
Maybe informing OP of this maybe more productive.
There are sites that can do this but make sure to do it OFFLINE.

If it’s string of many words (like between 6 and 15 words) then it may be recovery mnemonic which would recover your bitcoins almost immediately, but looks like that’s not the case.
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:41:01
Yup they charge more or less 1%, which covers large infrastructure, actual support staff, years of lobbying and fraud protection. 
Crypto doesn’t have lobbying it doesn’t have infrastructure and no fraud protection. Crypto does many things well, but it will have trouble in mass payment sector.
Don’t get me wrong, I want to be rich as well and hold well over 6 figures USD in crypto but mass payment is something we are not mature for yet. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:03:56
It only makes sense for high end retailers to accept crypto (expensive coffee/ restaurant/ real estate/ lamborginis) because these high end places will do everything to please the customer. 
Fast food chains where margins are low will never accept crypto UNLESS there are initiaties that will make crypto better than card, however we can be sure that credit card companies will fight hard to keep their market share.

That is true, he should run antivirus scan first, then use the website.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:06:28
You are one lucky SOB :-), worst case scenario is to pay someone to write a script to try this private key on every adress with non zero balance, best case scenario is to find out which websites were available in 2011 and try them. 
WARNING be very careful, don’t give anyone your private key, and don’t trust ANYONE, don’t put jt inside shady software etc...
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:33:20
Yup, responsible and correct thing to do.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:16:12
You can brute force (I think) every single public key with non zero balance (there is not that many of them), and get results. 
To the OP, do not give your ptivate key to anybody  !
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:24:11
Finding the non zero adresses and indexing them is a job for a pro.
Try accessing email in all possible ways if you already didn’t try to.

If it’s your new wallet adress that’s similar to you old stringg of numbers then it may be meaningless.

Euro was just another FIAT. Fact is that incentives work only if altetnative is better. Right now cash&gt;crypto for such transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:30:54
Ok, now you check if this string of numbers is your public adress or private key, go to blockchain.info and put it in there.” and see what the search gives.
I’m not sure but public adress should show you your balance, and your private key will give error of some sort.

No point being rude, unless you don’t have valid arguments of course. Micropayments on mass using crypto would require tremendous marketing infrastructure and many other factors. 
I know criticising crypto on crypto subreddit is risky but we all should be aware of reality.

Same as tether backed by USD. Not happening. Storing large quantities of gold is not easy and only countries with strong militaries (USA UK....) can do it securely.
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:58:42
I think this just says it all. I recommend you look up the difference between worth and marketcap, then we can have a discussion. Have a nice day :-)
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:32:36

Third option: Illuminati whales will keep bitcoin at this level forever. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:51:54
Coinbase does that, just sell BTC for fiat ( takes 5 seconds) and you can keep fiat on the exchange without ever transfering to your bank account. You will pay exchange fees of course.
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:09:28
Just like a normal company (potential+assets- liability+ predictions) but thats beside the point.
My point is that bitcoin l, even though we all would like to, is not worth $127bilion, even if marketcap says $127 bilion.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:40:38
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:03:26
I would say that ‘’energy experts’’ probably didn’t factor in bitcoin, either because of ignorance or because they don’t want to be associated with bitcoin. Because bitcoin is still perceived as massive ponzi scheme by some. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:03:03
Ok darling.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:36:43
That’s not exactly what I meant. What I mean is that some company would have to process this payment and they will charge fees on top of network fee.
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:13:16
You want to tell me that bitcoin is worth $127 bilion?
PS. Even a company with no dividents has actual earnings which gives it value.
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:01:19
I think ot’s transaction of money in general, I feel the same when I make a bank transfer and when I transfer bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:53:40
Nice one :-)
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:46:00
Correct me if I’m wrong but it tether is insecure, wouldn’t it mean that people will sell tether ( by buying bitcoin) thus driving the price of bitcoin (in USDT terms) up?
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:30:46
I understand value theory very well actually, and what it tells me is that comparing company to bitcoin can be problematic.
If you don’t like my answers then you answer my question: Do you think bitcoins value is $127 bilion because it’s marketcap says so?
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:43:57
Yes but when 30yo mom walks into McDonalds she won’t be bothered to get her private key, copy down McDonalds wallet adress and send 0.00xxx BTC. This would be highly impractical. So you meed some entity which would create it’s own infrastructure and interface to make this technology available to everybody.

DO YOU THINK BITCOIN IS WORTH $127 BILION. Yes or No question.
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:05:51
They shouldn’t because marketcap is not worth. 
Also with real corporation that pays dividend marketcap is somewhat similar to worth. With bitcoin marketcap is very far away from worth*.

@_date: 2018-06-02 02:43:16
Bitcoin is not worth $127 bilion, it has a marketcap of $127 bilion. Large difference.

I doubt all the auctions were more than 500mil. Droplet in the sea. We have no guarantes that bitcoin will even hold current 9k. It’s perfectly plausible it will drop to 6k,5k... 3k. Altough I agree with the opinion that US goverment should be saving more.
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:38:50
All of it at the moment. Around 60k USD.

Usually 2nd output is the miner fee. Exchange (or would be hacker) would not benefit from robbing you this way because fee goes to the miner anyway. There must be a bug on senders side (exchange), raise it with them ASAP before more people lose money.

1,270,000,000 Zlotych (400 milion Euros) have been frozen/confiscated from 2 bank accounts in Poland.
Company Bank accounts belonged to a Canadian man originaly from Panama, and a Colombian man with Panamese citizenship.
Companies were (ALLEGEDLY) laundering colombian cartels drug money and one of the bank accounts was linked to the crypto exchange.
Here is where the story gets interesting: Bank accounts were investigated only because someone scammed Belgian goverment out of (only) 400k Euros. (That’s like being a serial killer and getting a life sentence for jaywalking ;-)) 
Belgian goverment was building Belgian embassy in the Republic of Congo and scammers changed the bank account from sub-contractors to theirs.
Somebody in the mafia is getting their balls chopped of for getting this bank account frozen ;)

No expert can predict price. Only direction and support/resistance levels can be predicted.
Even if he is 51% correct that’s profit over time. 
70% is just conservative numbers. TA’s I make/use are usually 100% correct over time. 
Part of good investing is also risk management such as using stop-losses or observing market sentiments on day to day basis. 
I understand that many here are frustrated because it’s obvious that whales manipulate the market pretty hard right now. But TA is your friend if you want to make profit in this market and become a whale yourself ;-)
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:44:40

Enough to manipulate the market, whatever that amount is. 
No, I don’t know what you are invested in but I can tell you are bitter because of some choices you made.
I can predict drop to at least $6100 (more likely 4100-5200) in the upcoming weeks based on TA before rebouncing to 9-11k in the upcoming months. Assuming whales don’t manipulate the market. You want to stay in tether for now.

Maybe on reddit, professional TA is 70%+ correct even in this market. Excluding whale manipulations of course.
