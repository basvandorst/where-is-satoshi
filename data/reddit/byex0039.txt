I have 333 shitcoins to sell and I am the only owner of this coin. You have 1 USDT and want my shitcoin. I sell you 1 shitcoin for 1 USDT. The market cap of this coin is now is now 333 USDT which coinmarketcap and others list as $333. It took .3 percent in phony USDT to create the entire $ market for this shitcoin.

It has a long way to go before matching the length if the US tax code, which has failed to avoid needless complexity.

Watch cnbc on a bad stock market day and you'll see similar. That doesn't mean one person is controlling the entire us stock market.

When sentiment about being able to sell it for more than it was bought for goes away.

So you are saying miners will spend x on hardware and electricity mining a set amount of coins instead of buying the same amount of coins outright for less than x on the basis of "future gains"?

So make a two transfers intead of one transfer to buy coffee every day, how is that helpful to bring Bitcoin into this transaction?
