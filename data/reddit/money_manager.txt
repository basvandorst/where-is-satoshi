What if I want to store on my computer? What are the additional risks?
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:51:43
I want to invest into bitcoin and hold for long term.
I do not want to hold my bitcoins on the exchange due to all the associated risks (regulatory shutdown, hacks, etc.).
What is the safest way to store my bitcoin? From my reading it appears to be a wallet on my personal computer with 2FA? 
Looking for any advice here.

Interesting, thanks.
A couple more questions if you don't mind..
If I have already bought on an exchange like coinsquare, and transfer the coins off the exchange to my own wallet, is the only fee I pay the 'miner fee' to the bitcoin network to get my transaction included in the block?
Looking at fee estimates to the bitcoin network, it seems the longer I wait, the cheaper it gets. How does this work? If I'm in no rush to get the transaction verified, is it okay to choose a lower fee and wait a longer for it to get verified?

I think the most fundamental aspect of bitcoin right now is that everyone thinks they can get rich off it and the fear of missing out, which is why I continue to sit on the sideline.
Yes I've been wrong from a total return perspective but I have only seen this fundamental strengthen over time with more exposure to the public.
I come into these threads and all the posts are "How do I get into Bitcoin [for the crazy returns]", "I got rich off Bitcoin", "I regret not buying Bitcoin earlier because I would be rich".
Never do I hear people talking about improvements in their daily life from Bitcoin or the block-chain technology. 
Transactions in BTC are cumbersome: USD -&gt; BTC, trade in BTC, BTC -&gt; USD. It's essentially an in-kind transfer. Exchange in purely USD is far more efficient. This is because nothing is priced purely in BTC. BTC price is USD price translated at the current price of BTC in USD.
While I think block-chain technology is very interesting and can challenge current payment tech, I don't see it doing this in its current form and especially BTC.

This is dumb. At the time of the post its safe to assume he'll receive at least $5,700 USD per BTC.
To assume your BTC is worthless is asinine.

Best thing about trading currencies - the markets are open almost 24/7.

You sound like you haven't got a clue what you're doing, nor are you confident in your investment. 
Save your $10 and go get some McDonald's. BTC isn't worth being in.

Today, JP Morgan has revised their BTC rating moving to a strong buy, citing long-term fundamentals and catalysts:
* TO THE MOON!
* Fuck the government! We don't need no backing!
* PUMP and DUMP

Active management performance is determined relative to the overall market. If you can't beat the market, then it implies you are a bad manager and would be better off just indexing the market.

It sounds like you believe in cryptocurrency in general more than you believe in BTC. A new cryptocurrency could arise with better fundamentals and completely replace BTC.
Even if you like BTC, look at the valuation. Sometimes prices/valuations are being propped up by speculative traders participating in this bubble, and doesn't reflect its  true value. Even really great business can be overvalued and not be worth buying.
Make sure you understand how much risk you can take and how much of your capital you can risk losing. BTC is very speculative.
Edit: This is my long-run, investment point of view. Your position for some short-term trading can still be very profitable.

To clarify a bit more, managers are rated on what's called a risk-adjusted basis. We don't only look at returns, but the amount of risk they took to obtain that return. 
If Manager A returned 20% but had a 50% variance, versus Manager B who returned 15%, but had a 20% variance:
Manager B = 15% / 20% = 0.75
Manager A = 20% / 50% = 0.40
So we can conclude that, although Manager A had a higher return, Manager B did a better job, as Manager A only had a higher return because of excess risk taking.
Had Manager B taken as much risk as Manager A, he/she would have returned:
0.75 * 50% = 37.5%
You can simply take on more risk by leveraging your position (borrowing money).
To compare to the market, we calculate alpha, which is the excess return above the market on a risk-adjusted basis.

As an investment, you should not buy BTC because it lacks fundamentals, and you can see how fragile the valuation on BTC is whenever it drops 30% in price on bad news.
Keep an eye on cryptocurrencies in general however. It has given some insight into an alternative market-based transaction system compared to our traditional fee system, and properly implemented, could definitely be competitive (possibly what the BoA analysts are addressing?).

The valuations on BTC were insane! When BTC broke $1000 USD I started researching the hell out of it for friends and family who kept asking me for investment advice on it. I also tracked the price almost 10+ hours a day for 3 weeks.
The only thing fundamentally I could see worthwhile in BTC was a market-determined transactions fees payment model, but this wasn't limited to BTC at all! Its inherent in all cryptocurrencies, and not exclusive to cryptocurrency either..
