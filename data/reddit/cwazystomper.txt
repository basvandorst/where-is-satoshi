Yes, indeed. :/    
Honestly, I think Segwit and Legacy is balancing out.

Scam Ledger Nano. Had a legit-looking “seed card” that is peel-off and seed was already built in. L. M. F. A. O.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:56:34
Exactly! Or, you can create a wallet like it ;)

I'll volunteer to make jokes while witnessing it.
For example, my handgun &gt; your head during the payment ;)
**Edit: I was just saying my handgun is more superior than your head, because you'll probably be so excited to pay that you're forgetting you have to pay bills and burglars might come into your home and stuff!**

Someone took out his life savings to invest in coins. It got stolen off a Ledger Nano he bought on eBay.

@_date: 2018-01-04 23:06:17
He's still a scammer.   
He's scammed almost $1000 out of multiple people.

Sorry, updated it to a Ledger Nano. I got fucked with in the brain on the car. Here's the link to the original:

It was a Ledger Nano on eBay where the seller printed a fake, legit-looking peel-off "recovery seed". The seed was already entered in the Trezor by the time the victim booted for the first time.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:04:57
Yes, there are!    
   
-------------------------------------    
    
 they're Ponzi scams.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:15:40
So basically part of the transaction is "Legacy" and the remaining portion is "Segwit"?
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:57:08
What's the rivalry with SW and Legacy? I'm so confused. They both get the job done, so I'm happy.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:05:37
Yes, but if it is beneficial, why are some people rallying against it?
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:15:16
Because you're not asking for money.      
He just scammed someone last week.   
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:55:49
No worries. You're right, I know.    
But unless an influx of people decide to switch from BTC to other cryptocurrencies, we're stuck with huge fees and long wait times.    
I mean, honestly. I paid a transaction fee of what is 3 hours of working minimum wage in the USA.

I regret it.

For anyone who is thinking of even trying to "bruteforce" all the possible combinations, don't waste your time.
The seed most likely contains a word(s) that is not in the picture. That's why you're given numbers.

Haha I'm still debating whether to open my Trezor I've had for a few months now...
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:41:05
Yep! Just the fees make it tricky to use.
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:15:24
 to do if you obtain an IP address:
1. What corporation hosts that IP? These fraudsters are almost guaranteed to be running under either a VPN, or a public Internet cafe.
2. If it is a VPN, trace the corporation to the VPN provider. See what you can do there with your lawyer and the law.
3. If it is a public internet place(Starbucks, etc.) trace it down to a certain location. The video from the cameras can you get a pretty good idea on who is involved in the fraud.
**But be careful.** These fraudsters are smart (and I know why). Monero(XMR) is one of the most private coins in existence. These scammers may try to convert to Monero. Once your Bitcoin becomes Monero, *the trail is dead.* Once you send from one Monero address to another, the XMR is untraceable -- there is no possible way to know who or when sent the XMR.
So keep that in mind.

Well, I did expect this comment at one point or another. I have no experience creating a website -- don't even talk about a startup. What would lead you to this belief? I'm just curious to hear what everyone thinks.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:57:03
Hm, well I was looking on YouTube and came across this guy who made a video on Kickstarter or some site not refunding the funds to project backers after the kickstarter page was found out to be a scam or something, so.    
IMO we have three options:    
1. get kickstarter and gofundme better customer support and a moderation team omfl. 
2. get kickstarter and gofundme to accept crypto. 
3. create our own... kickstarter/gofundme themed, you know.

or why not develop a faucet like the creators of FaucetPig and earn income passively and steathily?
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:15:47
Hm. The motto of Bitcoin is to eliminate the MM, you're right.
Well, what about the people on GoFundMe? Like, for example a shooting victim's relative who needs funds for a funeral.
@_date: 2018-07-04 02:29:37
It's still a standing idea, although it will take tremendous time and effort that I alone don't have, to create.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:52:49
Yep! I'm just confused whether I should use Blockchain.info or Electrum.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:32:59
Wait wait wait this is getting confusing. So if I use RBF, I just send the same exact amount with a higher fee back to my own wallet. 
EG I have $500. I send $100 with 1 satoshi/byte fee. I send the same amount of BTC with 100/byte to my own wallet. Will it "cancel"?
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:53:01
Huh? What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:31:42
It hasn't even had one confirmation yet. Sorry to confuse!
I'm just not sure HOW to use RBF.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:47:58
I lost my Trezor a few months ago and haven't bought a new one. :(
(Well I got mugged, not "lost")
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:08:26
I'm okay with non-Segwit, just more worried this thing will work(sending the same amount with a higher fee to a different address).
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:24:55
Shit, are there any altcoins that make it easier? Like ETH but not ETH.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:03:19
Hm, so let's say I send with Electrum and check the box that says "Replaceable".
So... can I just send the same amount back to my OWN wallet instead or what is happening?
I might use ETH in the future if it is this complicated...
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:47:38
Electrum? Blockchain.info? Thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:12:24
Yep, I sent it with Electrum and I usually always check replaceable although I never knew what it meant...
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:47:19
So correct me if I'm wrong but here is the process:
1. I sent with Blockchain.info
2. Not confirmed yet so I resend the exact same amount with a much higher fee to my OWN wallet
3. It'll automatically "cancel" the transaction to my friend
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:31:40
It hasn't even had one confirmation yet. Sorry to confuse!
I'm just not sure HOW to use RBF.
