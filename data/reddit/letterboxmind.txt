Yes i agree you should come up with a unique name for your app. I had to search for the app using the dev's name :)  
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:14:10
Downloaded the app. Absolutely delighted at the functions. I'm sure there is more room for growth as time goes by. But for an early version launch, it's clean and so much better than a lot of crap in the app store.  
I think many would appreciate at least 3 decimal digits, especially for altcoins :)  
Also, clicking on a coin currently shows the price and market cap, i think there is space for more information such as 24hr volume, total supply, % change in the last 24 hr. Definitely something to look into for future versions.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:20:59
I've been using Coincap but i decided to support the developer after seeing the screenshots. Also a 16 year old dev made this.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:53:05
My suggestions:  
- Gemini
- Trading View
- Breadapp
- World Coin Index 
- MyEtherWallet
- Blockchain.info
- Coinbase

I've seem some people queuing at btc ATMs with $50 in their hands (probably newbies trying out btc for the first time). This was at the time when fees were almost $20-$25 a tx.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:07:44
Which exchange did you use to buy your btc?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:12:05
Bitcoin is about sticking it to the Man
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:47:01
Is the bitcoin not showing up in your wallet? The tx has been confirmed so it should appear.  
You can move your wallet to Electrum as long as you saved your private keys.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:30:20
Thanks! If you notice the way Coincap displays info in their app, they display up to 3 or 4 decimal points on the summary page. Then when you click on a coin, it'll launch a new page with the complete price. Maybe you can consider doing this too.  
E.g. If you're tracking a coin like Dogecoin, the current price is $0.00700988. Displaying this on your app's main page will look odd. So maybe display $0.007 on the main page, and the full amount when you click on the coin? :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:14:44
Thanks. My understanding is that fees are part of miners' fee for confirming the transaction on the block. So moving btc around should incur a fee. I asked because i transferred some btc from earn.com to my wallet some time back and i received the full amount, so i assume they covered it for me.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:38:29
I didn’t know that. So there’s been no activity on those keys for years?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:52
That was an hour ago. It's 16.8K on GDAX now. Dayum bitcoin give it a rest!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:25
OP, how did it feel to see your btc skyrocket then plunge? I ask because i'm excited at seeing it at 16.9K now, and i plan to hodl no matter what.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:41
Good man
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:49
The question is, will you be ok staring at the Milgauss when btc hits 200k?  
Having said that, the Milgauss is a fine watch.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:10:06
I've also noticed that people I know who put their absolute trust in old money are ignorant about crypto and blockchain. When i say old money, i mean people who believe that the only way to diversify their assets is to put them in government bonds or the stock market. Anything else is speculative.  
When you mention btc, they immediately say "dark web, illicit drugs, etc". Fiat is also used for illicit purposes, but it's also used to buy groceries and pay for diapers. They simply discount btc because that's what the media used to write about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:22
The meteoric rise is starting to scare me a little. I hope for the sake of those starting to invest that they're doing so with prudence, and not dumping all their savings because it's what they heard over thanksgiving.  
Now with that all said and done, HODL!!

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:04
Have you thought of a name for your exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:50:38
The question is would anyone even know if he moved just a small amount day by day? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:00
Then make it a point to buy a little every week!
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:15:47
When Satoshi launched btc, I didn’t discount it totally. But it was such a new emerging technology that I wanted to wait and see where it goes. Fast forward 10 years later, I’m a believer.  
I guess the masses will accept crypto in 10 years’ time — when we’re all on the moon :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:30
It really comes down to what brings you joy in life. If the rollie is going to bring you smiles every day, then go for it! After all what's living if you don't enjoy it? Some people are saving up for a car, a house, that nice holiday. For me, btc is my way to an early retirement if it goes all the way to the moon.

How do I explain to people that bitcoin was barely 1K in Jan this year, and that it took them almost 10 years to get to 1k? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:07:31
If it drops to 1.3k I’m selling everything I have, maxing out my cards and buying every coin I can lay my hands on. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:01:24
I too have a laughable amount of bitcoin. But I’m making it a point to increase it slowly. I hear people say “bitcoin will be $1M in the future” and I refuse to laugh at the idea. Why? It used to a dollar for a coin (at least then when I knew of its existence). No more laughing for me now from now on!

I think a lot of people started looking into bitcoin after Thanksgiving. I heard Coinbase had an influx of new subs over the weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:40:52
I was at a dinner party and we got around to discussing btc. A friend asked me how much i bought. I told him bitcoin was 1K in Jan and it's now 7K. He asked again "so how much?" I just looked at him and laughed.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:11:13
Even $50 worth of btc is better than nothing. Don't wait.

@_date: 2017-11-01 10:15:22
A month ago I told myself it’ll be great if bitcoin breaks $7k by year end. Frankly I wasn’t sure if it would — at that time btc was hovering around 5.4k. 
Seeing bitcoin’s progress this past week, I think 7K is well within its reach and no longer simply a “hope”. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:51:51
Tbh, I was a little caught off guard when he asked the second time. I'm still trying to figure out a classy response.

Waiting for the alert!
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:43:37
Are you on iOS or Android? I tried Blockfolio, Coincap and another app that i can't recall. I eventually settled on Coincap since it doesn't have ads, doesn't require me to sign up for an account and has a number lock too.

If bitcoin crashes to 1K, will all the other alts crash too? Might be a good time to pick up some ethereum and litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:51:59
Woke up today to $6.8K. Beginning to feel like it'll surpass $7K without a sweat at all, so you may be right about 10k. I just hope the miners continue to stay on b1x (is this term correct for bitcoin?) after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:50:47
I’ll wait and see for two weeks immediately after the fork. If it continues to rise steadily, then I may continue to buy a little more. I prefer DCA.  
At this point in time it’s hard to tell what’s going to happen after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:21:08
I’m setting my next price alert for $7.5K. I hope we crack that before the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:10:04
I’m surprised this is not upvoted more. There’s never a right time to time an entry, and it only leads to more regret when an investment hits the next ATH.

@_date: 2017-11-07 07:29:08
Not sure if i'm missing something. Sometimes i hear people say they just paid for their coffee/beer/pizza with btc. While it's good to know that merchants are embracing bitcoin as currency, it doesn't make sense to use btc instead of fiat for a coffee?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:31
I hope so too!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:21:43
I just got alerts for some altcoins I have on my watchlist. Funny how they jumped sharply after the no2x news.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:39:38
Interesting, I wasn’t aware of this strategy (still learning). I can only invest a small amount each week. So going by this method, I should put in some even though bitcoin is climbing, and especially when it’s dipping?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:22:08
We are Satoshi.

@_date: 2017-11-02 08:15:48
It can be done I suppose over time. In the meantime just keep a paper backup somewhere. If you have 6 wallets and you take a week to remember one, then all you'll need is just 6 weeks :)

@_date: 2017-11-28 07:31:44
I think round numbers like 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k are significant milestones.  
A lot of people i know are still clueless about bitcoin. Sure, they know it exists... but they have no idea how fast crypto is developing in 2017 alone.  
Tell them that btc was barely 1k at the start of 2017 and watch their eyes go pop.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:19:53
When you say things like that, it makes me want to increase my bitcoin supply by 0.01 little by little each week.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:04:55
I never thought of it this way! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:29:55
Ah no wonder. I saw it on GDAX and coinmarketcap. You sure you want to sleep now. It might break anytime....
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:33:36
Even if it backs down to 9900, I’m still happy because today I got to witness btc crossing the 10K milestone. Beautiful times indeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:42:34
Interesting strategy. I'd like to see what others think as well as I'm still pretty noob at investing.

@_date: 2017-11-30 13:37:46
I've learnt from the community never to reveal how much crypto you're hodling. You open yourself to a lot of risk.

Someone tell bitcoin to quit being a tease!
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:12:30
Ahh I thought you meant you wanted to buy at $20. I just realised you meant you’re waiting for it to reach 20 to sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:08:44
I could almost imagine people rolling their eyeballs or saying "oh that spike in price is just a fad". That alone is enough to put me off.
Yes, that point you make about not hodling on to their own coins and private keys is true. I used to think owning your own wallet was rocket science -- until i realised it took me just 20 minutes to make one!
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:31:01
Short and sweet! I like this and "only as much as i can afford to lose"
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:53:40
Duly noted. Although my btc supply is pathetic compared to most hodlers.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:42:38
That’s the general sentiment I’ve been getting and I feel I’m not too late too. I was aware of its 1k price in Jan but couldn’t invest due to financial reasons. Seeing it jump to 6k now is just simply unbelievable! :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:08:10
I'm looking at Coinbase, GDAX, Bittrex, WorldCoinIndex just to get a sense of feel. So far only GDAX is showing bitcoin as breaking $7K, but the rest are following closely behind at $6.9+K
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:52:51
So close... it's hovering around 7200 so it's only a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:08:32
Wow, just in time. Nice!
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:11:46
This. The fact that Bitcoin has a fixed number of coins in circulation (16.65M). Unlike banks that continue to print fiat currency when they want to.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:25:10
So it locks in immediately once I send the order and funds in Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:22:42
How do i read this chart? I'm not sure what the left and right sides mean.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:48:51
And bitcoin just went from $7.4K to $7.8k in a matter of 30 mins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:08:28
Is he still holding out now? I would think that the 1k jump from 3 to 4, 5, 6 etc was enough to convince him. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:23:44
Wow you're right, just saw that last trade price on GDAX. It's $6858 on Bitcoin Ticker. Had no idea it went up that high, and the fork is still 2 weeks or so away. Maybe people are getting in early instead of buying days before the fork -- i know i wouldn't.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:51:47
Are you still holding to OMG? Any other altcoins that you're thinking of lately?
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:27:45
Ooo drip feeding my bitcoin stash, I like the sound of that.  Someone mentioned in another comment that it doesn’t matter if I bought at an ATH. If I truly believe in bitcoin’s future, then buying in at 6K, 7K or 10k makes no difference in the long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:10:31
Wait, what was that about McAfee?
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:04:40
Just set up an alert for 10k and go about your day.  
I’ve learnt that ignoring the ticker is the best way to be surprised. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:39:44
Good to know, at least that makes two of us now.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:21:53
Good morning. The bad news is it hasn’t broken 7.5k.  
The good news is it’s been hovering around 7.4. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:53:52
Same here as well. At that time I was reading up on how to mine bitcoin, but eventually gave up as it felt too “complicated”. Plus I figured keeping my computer on 24/7 just to mine some virtual coin and risk PC overheating, electricity costs, etc wasn’t worth it.  
Much regret. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:25:20
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:53:28
This is good advice. I set upper and lower limits so I don’t have to keep checking. Helps me keep my FOMO in check. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:53:16
I wouldn't mind a slight dip, just as long as the price catches up again. Everyone seems to say that's the trend judging from its past performance. If it does, we all get to buy a bit more coins. :)

Hmm, isn't ETC around $14 now?  
I'm not holding any alts at the moment. But I've got ark, omg, neo, xrp, waves in my radar. The coming split is going to be interesting, because there's no guarantee on how things will pan out.

Duh, you need to switch to shortwave radio.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:50:14
Roger Ver would like a word with you. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:35:25
Ah ok, we're on the same page then.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:26:14
Is it okay to talk about altcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:17:19
I suppose those who have hundreds or thousands of coins can afford to spend a fraction every now and then, whenever they want. But it does make sense to hodl, at least that's my strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:02:45
Congrats! No amount of btc is too small. Good that you got started.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:39:15
Yes I’m bracing myself for the post fork. If it dips badly I’ll put it as much as I can. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:53:01
Well last Dec it didn't even cross 1K tbh so your 5K guess was a long shot indeed!
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:54:57
I can’t afford to hodl too many coins so I’m picking my battles. For the moment I’m planning to stick with bitcoin. It’s the only coin I’m feeling the most confident about. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:26:39
Takes even more brass balls to buy at ATH!
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:29:44
Exactly, I'm a firm believer that one shouldn't ask how much another makes, unless you are a close confidant of that person. But like you said, some people don't care about their confidentiality and expose themselves.  
Even if the guy says "I have X amount in my bank", how can I be sure he's telling the truth? In that situation, I'll just give him some random btc number. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:41:48
I heard they're doing a thing with VISA, although like you said, they're decentralized. Currently ripple, lumens and iota are my fav alts atm.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:57:46
Except now, I try not to talk about it unless I sense that the other guy is into crypto.  
I was having dinner with some mates when another friend and i started talking about bitcoin. Turns out we both bought btc, but we didn't make the mistake of revealing our investments. Nice to discuss this with a fellow human IRL.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:09:18
If i’d known it would be 6.5k now back in Jan, I would have cancelled my vacation and bought all the coins I could!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:23:38
Just jumped back down to 7.5k. Pump and dip, pump and dip!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:05:57
But... but the point is to buy every time it hits an ATH!
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:12:19
I have the same sentiment. I think the lowest it will dip is $5K
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:06:42
Where can I buy Shiacoin?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:26:08
Agreed. I think it was the way 2x was handled that rubbed off badly for everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:06:27
If you don't need the money desperately, you could keep hodling. There's rumors that it'll hit 250k, 500k in 10-20 years time. That's some sweet retirement monies.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:54:11
So many reasons why, I just apply Occam's Razor. With btc's limited supply and millions of coins lost, when whales start jumping in the price goes up. Someone tell me this isn't true.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:13:42
I don't have much, so i'm just holding and hoping that one day it'll be worth something.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:03:59
Slow down baby 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:42:47
$3?? Wow what a wasted opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:05:23

Enjoying the rollercoaster ride aren’t we all?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:30:44
Just curious, what kind of electronics are you planning to sell off? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:20:38
Hmm..wouldn't it make sense to hodl to what you have currently and let the latecomers drive the price up even further?
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:23:24
I thought it was December for a second. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:18:35
At least your excuse was legit. Back when it was around $20 a coin, I spent an afternoon at work doing some research and felt it was “too complicated” to get started. Feels good man. 
I’ve started researching more about crypto this year. I know I’m late, but better late than never.  
I don’t want to look back at this day when btc is 400k in the future and regret again. Now matter how high btc climbs, the best time to hodl is today. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:32:46
What’s the longest you’ve had to wait for your btc to arrive in Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:35:05
Time to cancel all the holidays!
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:07:13
I think people are saying it all depends on where the miners go. There might be a slight dip after the fork, but if majority of miners stay on bitcoin, then'll it climb back up again,
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:00:16
Remember, remember!  
The second of November,  
The bitcoin treason and plot;  
I know of no reason  
Why bitcoin should fork.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:23:19
It hasn’t broken yet, don’t get us all excited.

My first reddit gold!  
Whoever you are kind soul, thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:52:38
Almost 50 minutes, the excitement is brewing. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:33:46
You delivered. But in all honesty I have no idea what you just brewed. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:07:11
That's true. Well, consider it for your next product!
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:29:08
How’s the brew coming along?
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:04:48
I would have if it was a one-off payment. But I receive regular payments so accumulating a ton of gift cards is not going to make it any easier for me to pay my bills. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:27:39
I keep hearing about people losing their paper wallets back when they bought btc for cheap. I'd be livid if it happened to me!
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:31:11
Good call. Definitely saving you from sleepless nights.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:18:18
That's also part of the reason why I feel the laws that regulate the banks are ambiguous. Different banks have different practices and policies, not to mention laws differ across countries. 
None of that with blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:52:04
Sounds like you've got it all worked out. Good stuff! You mentioned you live reasonably frugally so I guess at this point, 'more' is simple a greater risk than gain. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:05:53
After my cheque took a round the world trip and arrived with much admin fees, I decided "screw it". I joined Payoneer and created a virtual US account. TransferWise has a borders account too for non-US residents. That's what I'm talking about -- the banks deserved it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:23:33
Same in my country too. I have not stepped in to an actual bank in years because of online banking. But the foreign cheque made me feel like it was 2007.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:01:30
Exactly! That went through my mind as well. Fax it, scan it, whatever. Although I think there might be some regulation that requires the original cheque to be presented for verification. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:27:24
I think I should have reworded it differently. Indeed the average person knows about bitcoin. But beyond knowing that bitcoin exists, a lot of them don't have at least a fundamental understanding of what blockchain means. Mention smart contracts and see their eyes glaze ;)
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:30:52
Amazon sends cheques to its non-US resident affiliates. It's a real pain; trust me I wished they offered direct deposit.
Crossing my fingers for the latest Amazon/bitcoin rumored collab though!
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:27:48
I don't think so. I'm not from the US and I still see the occasional cheque. I understand businesses steal deal with cheques, no?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:26:41
Kicking myself all the time. I remember telling it was too "difficult" to learn how to buy into bitcoin at that time.
I blame myself.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:39:27
I'm excited for you too! To the moon we go!
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:07:19
What happened?
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:50:15
Amazingcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:15:52
If you're really concerned, you could do a 50/50. Put $300 in btc and save the $300 for christmas or something. But since your expenses are covered, I think you should go for it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:38:15
Yep, don't be too hard on yourself. A lot of people missed out in the early days. I tell myself it's still not too late too.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:27:33
I went to my local bank a couple of months back to cash a foreign check. Since it was issued in a foreign currency, I was told that they (the bank) had to mail the cheque back to the origin country, get it verified, then have the cheque mailed back to us again before the funds can be cleared. All this is supposed to take a month.
I would also incur a bank administration charge, a postage fee and an agent fee. 
Screw the banks, they deserve to be disrupted. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:20:04
Love the graph!
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:45:32
Do you think it's a good strategy to put in maybe $10-$20 every week and just let it sit? I don't earn a lot, and i'm still kicking myself for not investing earlier. But i'm wondering if i'm too late to the party if all i'm doing is just $20 a week.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:21:48
Some analyst predicted it will hit 7.5k by Dec in this [article](
I have no idea who that is though
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:30:47
Just curious, how long was this ago? I just checked Wikipedia and it says that the Zimbabwean dollar was suspended due to hyperinflation, and USD (plus some other currencies) are legal tender. Were local businesses still dealing with their local currency?
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:24:09
I'm seriously considering setting aside a significant portion of future bonuses into crypto. That shiny new TV? I'll pass :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:02:59
It's just a ruse to trick people into depositing more money with them, while they create imaginary money out of thin air with their high interest loans.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:23:33
No it's not weird. AI will replace a lot of jobs in the future, so you're smart to be looking at ways to become financially independent. Nothing wrong with having a job, but as the saying goes 'never put all your eggs in one basket'.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:22:42
Yea that’s why I still regret. That possibility of being scammed $100, but $100 of bitcoins back then .... ����
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:51:49
What was the rate of btc then?
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:55:22
I like your outlook in life -- don't get mad at oneself and just appreciate what we have in life.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:01:03
I remember 5 years ago when it was still in double digits? Looking forward to the day 5 years from now when it really hits 10K
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:18:19
I've been waiting for my year-end bonus to put some cash in bitcoin. But seeing btc rise from 5k to what it is right now in just weeks is giving me massive FOMO.
Say bitcoin continues to rise till 7k by christmas (assuming it will), and i keep buying $10 each week, is it a good strategy?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:08:01
I was so excited when it broke 5k yesterday. Imagine my shock when I woke up today to $5700. 
$6000, let's get it!
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:10:39
I agree with you. At least when money was back by gold, it meant something. Now it's just built on a house of cards.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:44:33
Man, i've been seriously considering buying some more to hodl and hopefully get some free B2X after the fork. By more, i mean something like $50. Pathetic investment, i know...
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:47:57
Their verification system is indeed a fail for me
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:05:57
The banks are already feeling the heat from fintech companies disrupting them. Can't imagine what it's going to be like when blockchain really hits critical mass.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:21:36
Good thing your bank came through on the insurance. Still, a whole year's wait!
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:40:29
More importantly, I think you also gained experience in sending and receiving coins through your wallet. This will come in handy in future!
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:39:16
Are you mining from home 24/7?
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:28:34
That's why i'm kicking myself for not getting in when i knew about btc back then. And also the reason for learning more about the forks and whether i should also invest a bit in btg/btcash etc. The more i read about crypto, the more i see it as a viable alternative over fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:08:16
Yep! Governments and banks are already starting to look into blockchain for their own use. They're feeling the heat.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:07:52
I hope China returns, but maybe next year. I'm hoping to put some money in when i get my bonus.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:34:54
I've been thinking about this, and it seems even as we see Bitcoin surge like a meteor this past month, the general public still doesn't seem to know or care much about crypto.
A hardware wallet is very safe, although complicated for beginners. But frankly a digital wallet isn't that hard to set up. Heck, if a person can create an email, they can setup an account with an exchange. Sure, an exchange has its risk, but at least it's a start.
The way I see it, a lot of people are going to take notice about crypto and try to get it when it's too late... and we're already on the moon... with our teslas. :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:26:06
This is precisely why I support blockchain. We don't need some arbitrary middlemen to verify permissions; it all exists on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:37:36
Just curious, why do you recommend 2, 3 and 11? I'm still learning more about crypto and looking for solid twitter accounts to follow.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:55:26
I hold my private keys. I think i still have some time before the fork in mid-nov, but to be safe, i'm going to make sure i buy what i need at least a week before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:54:35
A little goes a long way. Never underestimate the power of dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:43:27
Yes, one income is risky especially if a person is laden with debt. Lose a job and risk staring at an abyss of bills. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:24:43
Banks are never going to fully embrace decentralized cryptop, imo. A few banks in my country have stopped doing business with certain exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:38:38
Same here. And then I remember when it hit 3k.
I think it's only a matter of time when it hits 10k. Need to clock the overtime so i can buy me some 0.1 bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:34:52
What do you think it will be worth in 5 years time? Noob here.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:11:43
That's right, I should have asked Amazon to do just that. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:01:55
Has this experience made you wary of doing cross border business with clients/partners who pay out in cheques?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:57:46
If anyone's wondering, that's on October 25.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:16:33
$10? Oh little faith!
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:53:30
Are you still using coinbase for your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:42:37
I like your strategy. I've been getting excited ever since it broke 5k, then 5.7k, now 6k. 
But then when I look at my monies, i realise i can't even afford 0.5btc. $20 is still doable though on a weekly basis... although i ask myself is it even worth it. :|
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:40:09
Is crypto available for online poker now?
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:41:12
I've been thinking, should it be 'sedl'?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:29:25
Indeed they will survive, and will attempt to shame crypto as currency for the darkweb.
But secretly they know their time has come. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:31:19
I'll never use any form of crypto created by banks simply because I feel it's against their interest to endorse a decentralized crypto like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:04:46
I suppose all will be revealed after Amazon's earnings call.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:34:47
Agreed. It's 2017, no reason why they couldn't simply scan it. And even if it were against government regulations, then the statutes need to be updated. It's not like I mailed the cheque to the bank, I was physically present, with my identification papers, with the cheque clearly issued to my name. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:36:21
Thank you for the explanation. I've been hearing some outlandish claims that bitcoin will rise to (insert outlandish valuation here). I always thought it may be unbelievable that bitcoin could rise to $50k in 10 years. But then i remember, since there are only 21 million bitcoins in circulation, if people started trading only in crypto and more specifically bitcoin, then it shouldn't be a surprise if the value increases exponentially. I'm still a noob and learning so correct me if i'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:22:46
Woke up (again) today to $6000 BTC. :o
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:00:19
At that point in time, I really felt the banks deserve to be disrupted. I know it sounds trivial, but no business or organisation should take their customers for granted, especially not with the way tech has been moving forward.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:19:35
Magic internet money. The best
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:28:13
They make their own money, while crypto gives us magic internet money.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:20:28
Your guess is as good as mine.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:24:08
Ouch! That sounds like a real pain. Yes, screw em!
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:57:02
Ah I see, that was before USD was legal tender there then. So what did you do with your stack of Zimbabweans?
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:26:23
thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:30:55
That's a wise move. After Mt Gox, no one should ever leave a substantial amount of btc anywhere other than their own wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:10:45
Interesting to know. What's the crypto of choice? BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:21:49
True that, after all banks exist to make a profit. We're talking about fiat currency here ;)
It's just the idea of knowing that my cheque took a round trip around the world that was both hilarious and excruciating. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:27:46
To think that it was only $650 exactly a year ago!
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:19:33
My guess is they are so terrified that some mystery hacker is going to hijack the scan and temper with it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:58:41
That's true, as with any investment holding for the long term is usually the best approach.
Imagine if fiat money becomes worthless in future, those holding crypto will be the new kings!
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:33:08
It's also why I avoid WU, just too much risk associated with it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:28:50
Thanks! Are they against 2X too?
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:21:56
Someone told recently in a similar thread that we are the [early majority]( 
I agree with your point about being the 1%. A lot of people i know are still clueless about the value of bitcoin, while i wake up everyday to a surprise spike in bitcoin (still remember when it broke 5k).
I'm still learning more about btc, btg and b2x and the upcoming fork. Who knows, maybe i'll split my pathetic investment into all 3 equally. :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:51:03
Ouch, you must have been really mad with yourself (assuming you didn't buy in to bitcoin at later stage)? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:54:35
You have done well for your age. I'm impressed you took the time to learn about the money market and crypto on your own. BTC rallied very hard in 2017 so even if you'd bought in January, you still would have made a nice profit by now. 
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:15:05
Ma! I'm rich!
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:14:28
Actually even though OP stated btc, I'm all for crypto in general to disrupt central banks.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:30:43
Zero. Zilch. Nada. It's time for fiat to go.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:12:10
I have personality issues
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:34:40


Thanks for the tip! It's $99 a month for the sub though :(
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:58:21
If Bitcoin really revisited $2,500 due to some bad news, would you take the opportunity to buy more btc?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:35:28
Kicking myself when it was still $680+ at the start of 2017!
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:22:27
Apparently Amazon still does.
+1 to them for adding bitcoin support
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:10:40
Well look on the bright side, at least it makes for an interesting story when you have visitors over.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:32:24
I feel your pain. Even something as simple as a wire transfer can cost at least $25 and above. 
$25 in fees to transfer money across cables. -.-
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:57:50
Yes, that makes sense. Although I'm sure Amazon being the *ahem* giant that they are would be keen to hodl on to much bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:35:46
Ok fine. +1 to the rumors for adding bitcoin support.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:21:57
I hope everything turns out well for you as you seek the change that will change our world.
