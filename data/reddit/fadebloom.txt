Wait, what happened to the whole "We are Satoshi" and "We are Bitcoin" threads that were going around when this DSN first broke?  Man, the institutional memory of this place...

I've ordered from them before a few times and would definitely order more if they accepted BTC.

This is an easy situation to resolve.  Send an email to support and you will be refunded.  Easy as that.
The 15 minute window is to protect everyone.  It's out of BitPay's &amp; TigerDirect's control if, for some reason, your transaction took longer than that to arrive.
Now, kith.

I don't think perpetuating a racist stereotype about being "rich and white" helps make your point.  Nor does the ageism.
He doesn't support bitcoin because he has donors that don't want him to support it and he's part of the system that is threatened by it.

"We are Satoshi"... remember?

This. "Coinbase still can take up to (and sometimes more than) four hours to first broadcast a transaction to the network. That means Bitpay invoices will time out (15 minutes) and other merchants will delay shipping your order until the transaction is broadcasted."

Haaaaaaaaaaaapy cakeday!  :D

Serious though, why is this link being downvoted?  This is a fascinating and unique item that you can purchase with bitcoin!

Hey guys, I'd appreciate any feedback and/or a few satoshis if you find this site helpful.  Thanks for looking at this!
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:22:13
Thank you for that feedback.  I did add a mobile friendly version ( and it should auto-detect if you're using a mobile device.  Let me know if your device doesn't work and I'll look into it.
The converter is a great idea!  Adding that now. :D
Edit: Converter added!

It's really easy to get a verified Coinbase account.  I know that hindsight is 20/20 but that should have been a red flag right there. :/

Very clean design!

Sorry OP, according to Capital One's terms of service: "We may limit or refuse any part of a deposit. If an item you deposit is returned to us unpaid or is otherwise charged back to us, we will charge it back to your account."
You can't open an account unless you agree to their terms.  Since you agreed to those terms and they aren't acting outside of those terms, I'm not sure you can argue against them.  (IANAL though and this is not legal advice.  Get real legal advice from a lawyer in your state if you want actual legal help with this.)

Hey man, looks great!  If you need instant spot averages, feel free to use coinprice.us.  I'll be happy to create an API for you to use for this purpose.  We definitely need more convenient ways to trade in BTC!

Again, no, you are incorrect and playing a game of semantics now.  Racism exists.  That is a true statement.  Racism itself is ignorance and hate which is incompatible with truth.  To say that "the truth is racist, retard" is incorrect.  Truth is not racist.  You may be racist - which was the point I made earlier by your frequent derrogatory reference to this guy's skin color - but truth is not.

Are you being sarcastic?  This senator is a Democrat.

According to the artist, it doesn't.  He said, "Thue mammoths died off approximately 35,000 years ago - truly conscience free ivory."

Congrats man!  Very nice to see such a success story!

Bitcoin was never about illegal activity...  :/

Thanks, yeah MtGox prices are just not reflective of the market.

"doing crypto" is a very broad phrase.  PHP is used extensively throughout the interwebs and generating asymmetric keypairs or signatures is a good example.  I appreciate you at least taking the time to respond, though. :)
