Honestly I'm thinking about his more now and it makes sense-- If you were to travel back in time from some future time, no matter how much money you made in fiat it would be worth a lot less due to inflation. Maybe it is even worthless because of an impending crash.
But let's say you drop a little bit of technology that creates a deflationary currency and can be redeemed forever (as long as he took his private key back with him) he could be the richest person in the world at some point.

Came here to say this. In the case of the US, it is the army + the will of the people (in theory) and their wealth (which pays the army)

If you had 2BTC to start and only sold $550 worth per month right now I think you'd still make money in the end.

True. And if trading on the stock exchange were anything like this... trading would be halted every day.
I think the big influence here is that there are many ways that "market order" prices are the way new money comes into the system, so someone could find a way to manipulate that to get cheap prices to buy and high prices to sell. Not to mention that there are a lot of people running around with way more money than they ever had and are willing to take big risks with it.

You do not need capital to make transactions in BTC-- I can move it around within my own wallets without any exchange of capital.  The capital could have entered the market years ago that originally "funded" my bitcoin.
Transaction fees however require capital I guess...

Makes sense. But for an always-on market, are there any better numbers to go by? Rolling averages maybe?

Prepaid cards have balances on them using regular currency.  Virtual would be more like Zynga currency or second life bucks or whatever

Also perhaps you can put it up for 2,352,941 DOGE

What about an economy based on debt, though? A lot of international trade and other things are based on the value of capital now vs capital later.  Slight inflation encourages spending and development as you start to lose value after a while.  If a currency only gains value why would you spend it?

That's funny because you can buy tons of other virtual currency using PayPal... just not crypto.

They don't guarantee ACID though, you need to take advantage of their ACID features for it to be effective

If you run both of those in one query, yes.  But the problem comes from doing a calculation or something in between...
My non-innoDB solution to this is to just do an UPDATE user_balances SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE user_id = 31337;
That is atomic, but not verifiable (since checking success would be a different process, you would still need some kind of locking to prevent a different thread adding another 100 between UPDATE and checking affected rows)
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:59:16
I don't consider it, now-- I would never deliver that kind of thing.
But I learned all this the hard way over the past 6 years, running an online game where large numbers of queries means race conditions will often hit on the mark, and people will try to exploit them once they realize they're there.
I would venture to say that I had a very hard time building ACID compliant queries into my web application in a performant way, it is by far the greatest struggle I have had in programming.
I think I figured it out by the time I had to build an inventory system that tracked items for a store with millions in sales, but it was very painful getting there and race conditions might still persist in little cracks here and there.
I have never used mongoDB so I can't comment

I've thought about accepting coin and discussed it with my partners.  
As far as legality/tax issues, you're actually converting into $ very early when it comes to things like BitPay... you can do your receipts as normal and it would be like your daily cash deposit into the bank.  I wouldn't treat it any differently than something like paypal or a credit card.
It's a different story if you want to sit on the bitcoin and not convert immediately, since it is now an asset and can appreciate in value (capital gains).
Say you sell a $10 glass of wine, but you keep that $10 in bitcoin.  Bitcoin's price doubles, and when you cash out that $10 is now $20.  It's fuzzy, but first the $10 is your revenue from your business and the second $10 is like earning money on a stock or bank account.
Hopefully, eventually, you can pay sales and income tax with bitcoin directly and not have to worry about its relative value... so you would just pay tax on your ~.01 BTC in the example.

Every coin had to be mined at some point. While mining is very tight and hard to turn a profit, someone somewhere is mining every block. Why wouldn't you convert that into fiat to buy more equipment?

Closed? Which market was this, that closed?
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:33:27
It's not the senate's job to interpret the law, just to make it.  The only way to find out if bitcoin is really legal is for there to be a court case or to see official DOJ/SEC policy.
You can ask the Senator if they intend for it to be illegal in the future, or if past legislation they were a part of should have made it illegal.

I mean it *is* shady.  But only slightly more or less shady than cash, depending on how you look at it.

Devil's advocate:  An actor from the future acting in the 2010 market would potentially alter the course of bitcoin history and potentially derail it from the path we know. 
The smartest move would be to obtain coins that were known to have been lost anyway-- for instance, intercept someone's old computer that is already lost forever.  And then wait until peak or after to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:25:26
Honestly I can't imagine how you would do that without breaking tons of other things (the internet, encryption, etc) essentially we'd only be allowed to use government-approved devices to access the internet, which would have a whitelist of programs and files we could use, etc....  I think a smart thing would be to tax exchanges heavily.

Not to mention many alts $ value is actually just leveraged BTC value.  $ value has been much more closely related to BTC $ value than the alt's own $ value... mostly because many $ entries to crypto are to BTC/LTC/ETH
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:13:10
You are getting wrong that part of the people who pumped Bitcoin to $20k were people who over-invested and may be concerned about their position (people that invested more than they could afford to lose) and they are panicking because they are down when they expected to be way up.  Those people may have lost faith in the moon coaster and are worried about their savings, admitting that they may have made a mistake and taking a small loss to end their stress.
Then there are the people who can afford to lose and are bullish on crypto. They don't care about those shifty people-- in fact, they want to shake the tree until they fall out, driving the price further down so that they can get a great deal on their next buy-in.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:45:17
Agreed! This is essentially the same as the stock market and highly speculative tech stocks in terms of the emotions that could go into it. Just live your life. There are a lot of different ways to think about it.
For instance, NOT selling at the price you sold it is almost the same as the decision to BUY at that same price.  Would you have bought it at that price? No, probably not-- if you had the cash you'd have probably used it for whatever you wanted to buy instead of buying bitcoin.

IOTA tried to do this and it became very confusing. They have similar coin divisibility to BTC but low value-- so right now all exchanges deal in MIOTA-- 1,000,000 iotas. But people just started calling that Iota.
So you had a situation then where people started selling 1 single iota on ebay for the same price that 1,000,000 iota goes for on an exchange... And this was the system the currency STARTED with. If you go about trying to do this with BTC which has been around for a long time, there will be even more confusion for scammers to take advantage of.
What might be better is a token that by design has a BTC reserve locked up in it. Lightning network is an example of this, which I read in another post uses milli-satoshis as its base unit. A network like that could be completely renamed and rebranded but would still be pegged directly to BTC (when tokens are created, BTC is locked up in the channel, until the channel is resolved back to BTC)

@_date: 2013-11-30 16:06:21
The way it would probably work is you would have local low-latency networks (MarsCoin or something) and then there would be an exchange or intermediate currency that has long (day or two) verification times.
Still would be faster than waiting for a check to clear in banking 1.0
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:15:29
Actually, I disagree.  You are the same amount of likely to walk away with nothing in the end; The odds don't change the more you play. If you're going to get anything out of it it's entertainment and therefore extending your play experience is the best way to derive value from a game that's not in your favor.
