I cant refer to a specific model of government. Nor do I think we need government. If we have government I think it should be governance over technical issues and how we should apply new technologies to free up people from monotonous work. There have been estimates that there can be a 90% reduction of jobs now with restructuring of our current model can be eliminated. Free food water and housing is already possible. But with corporations hoarding automation technology you will only see these technologies today take jobs from people. Clearly capitalism has failed and this incentive based system corruption will always yield more gain than honesty. People need to rethink why they are driving down the street with a car that has 5 seats and they are only using one. The only problems in society today are technical problems. Politics is literally philosophy.

Of course you like your house TV and internet so do I. "existential crisis" Is meaningless words that you have given meaning to by your own rationale and assigned it to me. I have no idea what that means as it relates to how you defined it in your own mind nor does it have a referent. This is what I am talking about. You really dont understand how your words work so how to you expect to understand how anything works in your life. Everything that you like is technical. Your house/toaster/TV/internet. You also said "what matters is living" I agree we are all living. A "nice life" is completely subjective. You are right things do not appear out of thin air people make robots that make products. What is the purpose of getting a job or having one? to acquire 1's and 0's of X countries currency to hopefully buy food/shelter/water. You notice people who dont work are homeless right? You dont need corporations. What we need is a collective effort to make the best longest lasting essential products with no waste product. You are mistaking incentive with motivation. Every great inventor did not invent someone due to the monetary implications. Humans are happiest when they are not worried about food/shelter/water and its no coincidence that creativity and happiness are directly related. So replace corporations with a collective effort to improve our lives. Provide housing/food/water for everyone in the most efficient way possible through a collective effort. Free people to do what they want to do the most which I can assure you that most people would not say "work for a corporation". There is no such thing as a utopia nor do I believe one can exist. By the way thanks for the questions. It feels good putting my thoughts into text.

Capitalism is terrible I just explained that. Science is subjective so studying genetic disposition of cancer is useless I.E Cancer Institutions have been nothing but a black hole for money and research. All I am saying is that the only real decisions that are made are technological ones. Not how to make a cost efficient toaster that breaks in a year. Chemistry,engineering and mathematics are pure languages they are not subjective. So I am only talking about science that needs guidance (maybe) I am not even sure about that. I dont have the answers but I sure as hell would rather live in a minimalist society that focuses on proper education/science and progressing the human language than this heaping pile of stagnate exploitable shit we call capitalism.

Competition in an incentive based monetary system will always lead to corruption. This is why almost all your food is bad for your health. This is why prices are so high. This is why we throw away billions of electronics every year. We are polluting the earth with these incentive based systems. Competition does not drive innovation, competition suppresses innovation. This is why the electric car was delayed so long. This is why we are still using oil based engines. This is why our government is corrupt and uncontrollable. Centralization of power through monetary gain is the problem. Maybe if people were more informed about how everything works. But then again school is a government institution that has failed along with every other government institution. I feel you are defending the ideology of capitalism and not the actual practice of it because if you would just look around you can see that it has clearly failed. I have not even mentioned the federal reserve to top it off.

Well I guess this is where I disagree. Corporations exist to serve their own self interests. This is why our government has to make laws restricting what corporations can or cannot put in their products. If they did exist to help the people then they would share their methods of their business to other businesses. Which is not the case.

Whats ridiculous to me in the united states: The fact the everyone walks around with full confidence in a currency they know nothing about or refuse to even do a quick google search about how the money they are saving for "retirement" is completely going to hyper inflate in the coming years. What is ridiculous is that 99% of people are are addicted to food and deep down subconsciously they know they should be eating fruits and vegetables but refuses to. Or convince themselves that a bag of frozen broccoli for dinner is enough vitamins and minerals to suffice. What is ridiculous is that these same people with these eating habits think that cancer is a genetic disposition when they get cancer in their later years. What is ridiculous is people sit around watching a screen in their living room that is proven to lower brain function. What is ridiculous is that people work 40 hours a week for 30 years so they can retire just to realize they wasted 30 years of their life. What is ridiculous is that Cannibis is still illegal in 2014. What is fucking ridiculous is this entire government that induces false wars while  convincing everyday people using abstract words that have no meaning which in turn those people assign their own pseudo meaning to those words to convince themselves we should go to war. I strongly dislike this culture. I fucking hate strip-malls. I cant drive down the street without getting ads shoved down my throat. But some how people think bitcoin is ridiculous.

Everyone who thinks this current value is not hype/speculation driven is completely delusional. The bitcoin is not being used to buy anything other then it was being used to buy things a year ago. nothing has changed at all with the bitcoin therefore we are in a HUGE Bubble, its just getting attention.... but the real value of bit coin should be nowhere near what is it now.
