“A dead cat bounce is a temporary recovery from a prolonged decline or a bear market that is followed by the continuation of the downtrend. The name "dead cat bounce" is based on the notion that even a dead cat will bounce if it falls far enough and fast enough”
Are we living in the same dimension buddy? We seem to be looking at different charts.

You know what that motorola from the 90's was really good at? Making phone calls and the battery lasted all week.
You know what I want my money to be really good at....spending.

Not if you have to buy it from a regulated exchange which complies with money laundering laws, in which case your identity and address are verified.

Not many places outside of the third world and the US accepts USD as payment.
Bitcoin can be bought and sold with EUR and GBP as well as a number of other currencies.
The BTC/USD price has no interest to anyone who can't spend dollars as they'd still need to be exchange for local currency.
My government is working very hard currently to devalue my local fiat currency but it still has a lot more buying power than the US dollar.

First I'm not the op.
I know what am/pm mean because I'm British and not European but I also use 24 hour clock exclusively myself.
This is the 21st century, clocks are digital and mine are all set to 24hrs, "if u didnt know , nothing wrong , but having an attitude about it ...not cool ." (like your grammar)

History and use[edit]
Exeter Cathedral Astronomical Clock, showing the double-XII numbering scheme
The natural day- and night division of a calendar day forms the fundamental basis as to why each day is split into two cycles. Originally there were two cycles; one cycle which could be tracked by the position of the Sun (day) followed by one cycle which could be tracked by the Moon and stars (night). This would eventually evolve into the two 12-hour periods that started at midnight (a.m.) and noon (p.m.) which are used today. Noon itself is rarely abbreviated today, but if it is, it is denoted M.[1]
The 12-hour clock can be traced back as far as Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt.[4] Both an Egyptian sundial for daytime use[5] and an Egyptian water clock for night-time use were found in the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep I.[6] Dating to c. 1500 BC, these clocks divided their respective times of use into 12 hours each.
The Romans also used a 12-hour clock: daylight was divided into 12 equal hours (thus hours having varying length throughout the year) and the night was divided into four watches.
The first mechanical clocks in the 14th century, if they had dials at all, showed all 24 hours, used the 24-hour analog dial, influenced by astronomers' familiarity with the astrolabe and sundial, and their desire to model the Earth's apparent motion around the Sun. In Northern Europe these dials generally used the 12-hour numbering scheme in Roman numerals, but showed both a.m. and p.m. periods in sequence. This is known as the double-XII system, and can be seen on many surviving clock faces, such as those at Wells and Exeter.
Elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Italy, numbering was more likely to be based on the 24-hour system (I to XXIV), reflecting the Italian style of counting the hours. The 12-hour clock was used throughout the British empire.
During the 15th and 16th centuries, the 12-hour analog dial and time system gradually became established as standard throughout Northern Europe for general public use. The 24-hour analog dial was reserved for more specialized applications, such as astronomical clocks and chronometers.
Most analog clocks and watches today use the 12-hour dial, on which the shorter hour hand rotates once every 12 hours and twice in one day. Some analog clock dials have an inner ring of numbers along with the standard 1-to-12 numbered ring. The number 12 is paired either with a 00 or a 24, while the numbers 1 through 11 are paired with the numbers 13 through 23, respectively. This modification allows the clock to be read also in the 24-hour notation. This kind of 12-hour clock can be found in countries where the 24-hour clock is preferred.
Use by country[edit]
Main article: Date and time representation by country
A typical analog 12-hour clock
In several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken system of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British Empire (the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, India, etc.), though a few others (Mexico, Egypt, the Philippines and Malaysia) follow this convention as well. In most countries, however, the 24-hour clock is the standard system used, especially in writing. Some nations use a combination of the two, preferring the 12-hour system in colloquial speech but using the 24-hour system in written form and in formal contexts. This is true in some European nations and Latin America.
**The 12-hour clock in speech often uses phrases such as in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, and at night. Outside of English-speaking countries, the terms a.m. and p.m. are seldom used and often unknown.** In England, the descriptive phrases were universal until relatively recently; e.g., Rider's British Merlin almanac for 1795 (published in London)[7] uses them, and so does a similar almanac for 1773.

Just checked the source code on git and the default is 336 hours but yes I guess you're right and it depends which nodes have picked up your transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:12:06
I presume you mean btc1 (segwit 2x) and btc0. (core)
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:59:20
Of course miners check the rules or else they can't form valid blocks and from outside appearance mining nodes and non mining nodes appear identical.
Given the peer to peer nature of bitcoin you may be directly connected to a miner who will check your transaction and pack it in to a block without the interaction of any non mining nodes.

But price is independent at each exchange is it not? Trends from one exchange may contaminate others but there is no such thing as the price of bitcoin. Only the price people are willing to pay on the exchange you're trading on.
If you're trading on a Euro exchange with other people trading in Euro's the price is actually based on euro/btc trades not usd/btc trades.
This would only be the case if you where converting euro to usd and then purchasing on btc/usd market or am I way off base here?

It's about weight of work behind a chain not it's length.

If you hold your own coins they'll still be on both chains and YOU'LL hold the private keys to access them.

What would be the point of a network full of nodes validating transactions that will never get packed in to a new blocks?
No blocks mined and the network is dead. 
Your node can censor all it wants but Bitcoin is the chain with the most work behind it.

Do a search for child pays for parent if you really need the transaction to go through otherwise you can just wait 72 hours and it will drop out of the mempool.

Can we get this right people.
The major version number of core is 0
The major version number of segwit2x is 1
BTC or BTC0 is core and BTC1 is segwit2x.
I keep seeing people make this mistake and it's going to cause major confusions.
There is no such thing as BTC2.

If you want protection then you pay more for a service which wraps cash/bitcoin like paypal does for cash.
