You can continue to claim you hodl, but until you prove otherwise your actions say differently. Altcoins necessarily reduce wealth in bitcoin, so I disagree with your argument.

Indeed. The blockchain is now massive and node counts are droppping due to miners continuing to mine full 1Mb blocks. They should ignore the spam instead of forcing every node to store them for eternity.

I don't think so. The level of support is pretty much zero for people who have common sense and don't want to destroy bitcoin for altcoin profits. This wouldn't remove people from either of those groups.

They would be able to ignore them and mine non-segwit blocks no matter what percentage, even 100. They could mine empty blocks for all they want. They would be leaving the mining fees on the table though.

Less *segwit* transactions, less size *allowed per block*.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:17:50
Have you used a Trezor? Whenever you plug it in the Trezor generates a random PIN on the screen. You then have to verify on the computer you are using that it is the same. I don't know of any PIN that you can setup before use that prevents someone else from signing transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:19:25
This is simply not true. Accounts at all exchanges have split the balances held there, so you are free to dump them for BTC. There is no way to deposit since there are no blocks being mined on the BCH chain. I don't know who is making these silly buy orders for $700+ on a nonfunctioning crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:34:58
He's not talking about not making transactions in lieu of using lightning network, but by making regular transactions on chain instead of using segwit transactions on chain. This way blocks will only be able to be 1mb, instead of larger. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:58:16

They passed on nothing. They raised millions with their ICO. They just want more.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:05:15
I'm sorrry but I don't really understand the significance of this. If someone has physical access to your trezor, then they can simply make a transaction and have the trezor sign it. This just allows someone to extract the private key, but if you already have your bitcoins signed to another address then you lost your money either way.
Edit: I get it now. An attacker can steal the key without the user knowing. Then any new bitcoins received can be stolen.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:43:54
What size is this block post-segwit activation? 
I'll spare you the trouble, it's greater than 1MB. So it did increase block size.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:43:14
Whenever I enter the PIN it is randomly generated on the device and I have to put it in the browser. Anyone who has the device can do that too. Unless I'm missing something when I set up the device.

Basically suck it up and pay the higher fee now so that full nodes don't have to download the larger blocks for eternity.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:48:44
These last 2 hard forks are different from the rest of the money grabs. There is real money on the current one right now enticing people to sell. What they are trying to do is point out old bitcoin money and identify to exchanges (and bloq and other blockchain tracking cos) who holds the old money. I'm sure old hodlers are smart and not showing their hands, but it means we need to keep being vigilant and upgrading bitcoin's fungibility and privacy.
