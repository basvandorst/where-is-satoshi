They have been solid for a long time, and have a huge amount of customers. It's always easy to say afterwards why you use something, but that's not the point here.

Yeah me too :/ wtf! Exit scam?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:48:57
What makes u think they have 500 customers? It's like saying Bitcoin only has 600k users...  Bitstamp has 2500 reddit users, massive! LOL

ABN Amro locked/suspended my bank account after I bought over 2,5 million worth of BTC over a 30 day period. AVOID THEM!!! 
edit: did not lose any money, bank just let me withdraw to another bank but closed my account.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:34:24
yes they are very noob-friendly
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:55:15
2700 euro worth of BTC to a friend in Mexico in 2013. Western Union and Moneygram refused my transfer after filling 2 pages of information. Done within 10 minutes with BTC.

Nice man !
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:46:43
Great thanks
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:57:07
It's basically just people leaving sell orders at round numbers. Usually not sharp money. We saw the same at 10k USD.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:22:01
Ah lol I just wrote a mad facebook post about this on my own wall :P
'It's funny to see how most of the Dutch news pages like AD.nl / NU.nl spread fake/negative news about Bitcoin/cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, it's up over 1000% since January 2017 and has been profitable every year since its release.
For example last article that was written by 'Tine Kintaert' (
As she might not be aware of the fact that bitcoin.com is a website owned by the creators of 'Bcash' which is a direct competitor of Bitcoin.
They are just trying to make people afraid. Investing in Cryptocurrency has its risks, but the potential rewards are way higher than any other investment. If BTC is a bubble then Gold is a bubble as well. Cryptocurrency has a great future and it's still very early days!'
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:45:43
Ok thank you!
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:46:50
Could only happen if there would be on average at least 100,000 transactions in 1 txid. This is what lightning network can do. BTC itself is not ready for replacing euro/usd as of yet, but with future updates that should be fine too.

CRUDEly(crude oil) assembled a rig(drill platform) like a BP engineer(responsible for oil stains in the ocean).
LOVE THIS GUY!!!
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:06:06
Sorry to say buddy, you sound like an amazing guy. But your wife... Can't really judge her since I don't know her at all and not her side of the story. All I can say is that it is a massive red flag if your wife insists on having huge wedding costs at any cost, even if it means selling something you believe will be worth more in the future. Sounds like she didn't care much about you in that situation.
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:15:16
Dont use them. They will steal ur coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:32:32
Yes you are totally right. Thanks will do :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:14:12
Can confirm it is real unfortunately
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:21:27
We used to call them 'gold diggers'. BTC diggers will be a real thing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:21:01
You will see what power 1 BTC will have soon my friend :)
Everyone has a price.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:16:02
He did hahaha wtf!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:57
Yes BTC might drop but I already bought the majority of my investment at 6k euro per BTC. I am just soo done with banks after the ING bank closed my account for cryptocurrency deposits/withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:31:56
Yep true. I am aware of the risk, but there could be a much greater reward. I am happy to take it, even if it crashes to 0,00. Then I will probably decide to get paid to euro again :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:17:54
I deposit into Skrill. There you have the option to withdraw to any EU bank :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:00:46
Crazy, I am sure they can afford themselves a hot girl now :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:08:27
You are a fcking legend. Guys like you only need 1 testicle. That 1 testicle is bigger than anyone’s 2 testicles together.

Nothing will happen to the BTC price if LN fails. BTC was already growing steadily before LN was even announced.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:49:15
It will always be possible but it is too expensive to keep doing for a longer period of time. It's possible to spam any coin that is mined by miners (decentralized)
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:41:23
My bank account at ABN Amro got closed because of heavy Bitcoin purchasing/selling. They warned me to stop, I refused and kept going. Then they closed my account. I could provide another bank account where they transferred the funds to. 
Don't think they are allowed to keep the money unless you are found guilty of a crime.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:20:41
It matters a lot actually, long-term.
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:12:18
I have no experience with that wallet, but my friends mainly use blockchain.info mobile wallet. Works really well! 
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:45:52
The only reason BTC fees were extremely high was because of some big players spamming the BTC network with low transaction fees.
Also, SEGWIT adoption was really low. 
Btw, if you are a BTC holder then please don't follow People there are spreading FUD and want BTC to fail. Only bcash fanboys can be found there with zero knowledge about BTC or crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:10:21
and why are you less optimistic about LN?
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:02:35
Kraken is just as big of a scam as any other bank
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:06:03
Alright, best of luck! I would just buy on Kraken and hold on a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:52:19
This is exactly what we SHOULD NOT WANT!!! What makes Bitcoin great is that it gives anyone complete freedom of their own money. Banks can close your account, have extra transfer/account fees and increase withdrawal/sending money times to whatever they please. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:22:23
One of the reasons BTC is a huge success is that there are not any women in charge
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:50:29
Lot's of transfer to/from foreign countries. Got all the proof and documents and taxes paid, they don't even bother.
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:59:18
Nah I transfer to Kraken, and only receive international payments.
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:05:01
I agree. No issues with Bunq/bl3p.eu so far!
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:29:46
I would just move to Binance or Kraken! Kraken has improved their speed and u can deposit fiat from the Fidor bank instantly and withdraw aswell. I could help you better if you explain me exactly what you want to use the exchange for.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:24:51
The better question is: how is she hot?
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:11:05
Ok thanks! So if someone hacks my private key they can take all the funds? Makes sense now. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:47:55
HWHWAHAWHW xd

Go make me a sandwich and get far away from the developer team
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:33:33
What's the difference?
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:39:35
If women would be good and smart enough they would already be involved a long time ago in crypto. I am sure some women are. But the fact is that the majority of women don’t like risky assets. Also, they are usually not confident enough to be one of the few that do something new. 
Another thing is that guys are just better than women in programming.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:25:38
I love Kraken. Their website is super fast now btw.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:57:05
It's all about where your coins were at the moment of the split. That would be breadwallet. I suggest you check out:

You are focussing for BTC to replace the current payment systems, which it will most likely not. However, I truly believe bitcoin will be better than gold. Gold is a 8 trillion market, enough gains for me.
