Are you quoting someone or you just talk in quotations all the time?

how about you say something to this newcomer* that will help them improve their investing skills rather than comment on other people's advice? You can do both, you can help the newcomer, but you can't *just* criticize criticism. Yes, I'm doing the same thing. But I agree with the guy you replied to and have nothing to add.

Relax. Take a walk. Come back in 48 hours and you'll be fine.
When you come back, and bitcoin has gone up, please take out half because putting 100% of your life into an investment is irresponsible.

You sold your bitcoin to buy a fucking used alfa romeo? What a cuck

Take a look at r/btc. that place is a shithouse for attackers. Posts about exaggerated fees and switching to bch

I understand his significance. No reason to treat him like your god. You've gone from saying "take my money" to corporations to one guy.

how are you born and growing up broke as dirt and shit but you are OK with buying shit like iPads, christmas presents and bitcoin in general ? Your money management problems are showing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:14
Honestly, I hope you're just buying now and then selling in 3 days. You'll be rich. Keep us posted !

the risk of coinbase getting hacked and losing all coins is probably close to the risk of bitcoin hitting $0. it's not a priority for people with negligible purchased coin.
