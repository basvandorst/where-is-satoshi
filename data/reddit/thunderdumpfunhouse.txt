These guys help people with MMRD and help run group homes for them, they do great work. Worked with them for years and they will accept bitcoin. Thank you for the consideration!
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:50:33
Keep up the FUD until I can grab more please.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:02:46
I’m interest as well. Btw, is there a way to follow a post on Reddit for comments without leaving a comment? I’m on Reddit iOS app. Thanks! 
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:31:19
I doubt many. Sorry won’t let me edit it to fix the typo.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:00:11
How much? 
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:42:21
I think it’s libertyx loaded on a genmega machine. Yes it looks identical to a regular ATM bc it is, however you can use it to buy btc via your debit card using libertyx. Rumor has it we will be able to use these to sell btc and have it dispense cash in the future. If you see any genmega machines call the service number and ask them load libertyx on it. The machine operator will make more money so it’s in their best interest to do so. 
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:30:14
You’re right. Let’s all pack it up and go home now!
Just because you don’t seem to get it, I bought many give a shit what the price is. The goal is just to acquire more satoshi.
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:59:05
How many Euros can you buy with $100 your currency vs US? Now take that /100 and get a %.. then do the same with btc. If the % is close then you know it isn’t being manipulated.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:09:51
I work at a non-profit and we are starting to look into accepting it. Hopefully accounting sees the value as I do. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:28:49
Is there any reason besides fees that bitman would rather take bch over btc? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:22:29
I work for a non-profit and I've been talking to the about accepting donations in btc. They are not against in. Any info you can send me? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:42:16
I know it doesn’t mean much but I absolute love every time I read about a cause you give too. Thank you @_date: 2018-08-17 21:51:34
How much do they want? I’d love to have that 
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:33:26
I have one on my rear window of my car. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:59:16
I've helped others do it if you want to msg me. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:28:56
Subscribed and can’t wait for next week. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-05-27 03:06:51
Thank you for your opinion. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:47:30
So... can I buy one? 
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:38:07
Can you add volume? I just bought a 10” lcd to build this as wall art.
@_date: 2019-11-14 13:41:15
Bakkt volume is something I watch via bakkt bot that I think is important but there maybe like a volume of how many transactions or something? Guess now that I think about it that’s kind of pointless but bakkt vol would be sweet If you could do that somehow. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:27:56
Take your holdings off the exchange!! 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:56:08
I’ll do it if you want? I’ve bought it plenty of times from people on here before. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:06:58
I love this. Might have to try to build one.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:17:09
@_date: 2019-10-03 04:12:39
This is wonderful.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:45:02
Forgive me for not really understanding but if we are getting equal amount of both we won't lose money if if goes up why do we want 2x to fail and btc to win?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:44:33
Awesome please keep me in the loop.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:48:08
We’re up $500 since 24hrs ago?
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:59:30
No, it would be worthless so no one would mine it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:44:46
I was hoping I could find a reason to use a pi and like a 24" screen. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:05:42
That makes sense. Why would anyone cut over? I would imagine the amount of users on reddit are peanuts compared to the amount of miners out there. Who is behind it and what do they stand to gain? Sorry I really am just trying to understand this. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:15:55
Honestly I just pulled it out of my ass but that wasn't half bad was it? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:55:46
It said that they will inform me before the finish time and allow me to cancel then if I choose too. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:37:28
I didn't even think about it and mine says the 16th now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:35
Tomorrow around 4pm CST.   $8715
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:45:55
I'd find it and random it for 5. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:58:03
I agree that is why I was trying to clarify this it seems to likely for abuse. I think I was just not understanding what they were saying. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:54:51
Would there be any negation to just cancelling and just starting the process again at a much cheaper price point until you get it low and it starts to go up?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:39:01
Education is never free, you’re going to pay for it with time or money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:28:42
Don't tell anyone your words. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:52:47
This is pretty much what I think I'm looking for. Just run it full screen. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:41:37
I'm new to crypto so this may be a dumb question. Is there an app out there that you can put how many exact coin you have in say an offline wallet that will update with value in an app automatically?
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:14:28
I didn't watch it expecting much, but it wasn't bad at all.
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:27:42
Thank you for sharing. I’ll be trying this in next couple days. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:23:07
Why is he selling bch? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:44:35
What am I not understanding? How is this possible?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:36:09
Is there a command list or anything?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:49:37
Can I ask how much of his business is paid for I btc? How has it worked out for him? Has he had any issues? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:59:44
I think they get half the fee. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:51:26
Sure it isn't copper? I think they usually are. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:50:45
Since I have zero clue, what’s the point of a faucet? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:10:49
I wish I could buy like $20 worth just to put under my mattress so I could be hood rich. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:32:05
What's rate here? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:34:24
Wouldn’t every 10 minutes be a new record?
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:37:24
I’d would be way cooler if it was wall about 4x bigger. 40cm x 30cm is too small imo,
