What issues did you find?

That’s insane, Litecoin and Bitcoin are both stone age crypto, antiquated and old with bits tacked on feebly in an effort to make them suitable.  In terms of market cap they are shitting on others, but in many other respects they are getting shat on by a variety of new and novel projects with great tech created at the point of inception. Exchange support is just around the corner for XRB.

You can have a prime ribbing for spelling steaks the way you did!

He's talking about an index not one particular trade over 30 years, so it is likely safer than bitcoin.  To the OP I suggest both.

I'll wait till it's released I guess?

Agreed! The list of cryptos that haven’t even found a real life use case is just a bit bigger! Same with people mocking VISA because of yesterday’s network issue - Visa has achieved more than any blockchain up to now in terms of scale etc, people are deluding them selves with irrelevant info.

The guy plastering my kitchen only accepts cash mate.  But I see where you are coming from, thank you.

Yes but to be fair Silk Road (and others) only function thanks to bitcoin.

I've done it online several times buying and selling and it's definitely the cheapest and easiest way to do it, quite safe if you pick a reputable user.
I'm with you on everything else, fees are ridiculous, and having to wait to have ID verified by exchanges is stupid. Also, once you get the bitcoins these days it takes 1 hour + to verify transactions etc.
I first bought BTC several years ago and have been watching as an outsider since then, and my experience of using the currency more recently has been bad. It has definitely gotten worse, slower more expensive tx fees, are any measures in place to mitigate against these issues? It will never work as a cash alternative, I'm 100% sure of that.  A decentralised currency is a great idea but with a decentralised group of people running it with different ideas it's clunky imo.

It’s already fine in uk/euro but this resolves an issue whereby you had to withdraw large amounts in euros instead of Sterling.

It’s possible she is just saying the price is too high for her to feel like it’s a good investment, I would like to think that she is aware that you can divide btc, although disappointing if she doesn’t.

I saw it on The Sopranos, the wise bull is saying don’t be so excited, if you take a calmer approach you can get far better results with less effort.

It’s an ironic advert for a bitcoin company isn’t it?
