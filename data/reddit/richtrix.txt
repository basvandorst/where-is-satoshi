You obviously have no children

That's my boy! Too bad he wasn't smiling in this pic. Will have to repost another soon! His name is Callum, which is Gaelic for 'dove', bringer of peace.

Give me a  break. Propaganda? Dad is a miner. Dad brings son to bitcoin meetup in a "I wanna be like dad" style shirt. Someone thinks it is cute and takes picture. I agree that using kids to promote political causes is pretty terrible but this hardly applies. Mining is an occupation or hobby not a political cause. My son also recently participated in a March for Dimes walk where his team raised $1600 for research into rising prematurity rates. He was born two months premature. I doubt that if he was a decision making adult he would object to having done this. Likewise, I doubt that he would mind this outfit when older. In fact I imagine that by the time he is in his teens he will be quite thankful that he and dad were involved in bitcoin at this time. Also, cute outfits loads of fun for parents and heaping adoration on them and their cute outfits is fun for the children too. He has a cute hat that everyone comments anytime we take him out with it on. It encourages otherwise strangers to interact with him and he gets something out of that I'm sure. For the audience at this event there is pretty much no cuter outfit possible. So what's the harm in that? Another cute hat he has say "Jr. Zookeeper". We got it at the zoo. Is that wrong to encourage zoo keeping without his consent? Clearly not. It's just cute.
