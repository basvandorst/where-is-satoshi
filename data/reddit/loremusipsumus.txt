Yes, probably sent it to himself, but what does he gain from doing all this?
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:47:15
Hullo, I am not an advanced expert like you all so some questions.  Aren't all BTC trading public? That is, where ever the hacker sends the money to can be seen publically? Also, is it illegal to hack BTC? Is it possible to somehow track the hacker based on the transactions and force him to return the BTC with a threat of prison for committing felony?
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:06:17
I cannot understand how a browser manages to raise 4.5 M , but things like SpaceEngine are still stuck at $50,000.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:30:10
Yes.       
If you are well connected so people route through you, you get a small fee.     
Just install lightning client - éclair, c-lightning or lnd lightning-app.       
LN nodes need Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin core may integrate LN after few years.       
There's also a mobile wallet.      
Desktop wallet - 
some sites - lncast.com lightninggem.com Yalls.org etc
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:13:04
Which OS are you on?         
Note : all are in testnet (free testnet coins to test :  )      
Web wallet : htlc.me         
Mobile wallet(send only, can receive on chain) : Search for "Eclair wallet" on play store      
This doesn't need full chain downloaded : (It still downloads ~1gb)       
        
This needs a bitcoin testnet node:     
            
Get testnet coins from a faucet, open 2-3 channels, wait for confirmation, try transacting, report bugs in the "issues" page.    
Send between your wallets, open GUI/UI issues, suggestions, anything. Take note of the funds you are starting with, and see if there are any cases where you are losing money. Try to crash it. Anything.      
Services : yalls.org , lightninggem.com , lncast.com , lightning.bitrefill.com and more
(don't open channels with all, try to route payments)        
Also, slack invite link, where you can ask questions about lightning-app, lnd :         
Place to chat/ask questions about eclair :       
If you are familiar with the command line, you can also try out lightning-c           
Sorry if its a bit disorganized, put it together quickly
Thankyou! Spread the word. We need more testers!

"The big hubs like banks".    
We don't know how topology will look like.     
But I'm inclined to think the only hubs will be popular lightning sites - many connect to then as they deal with them. So it's decentralized. Time will tell

Yes    
It *does not* have its own chain. Bitcoin is the judge. What happens is instead of broadcasting all transactions, you broadcast in case of dispute in a trust-less way(you only need to trust bitcoin blockchain). Bitcoin smart contracts enables this.    
In a lightning network, you don't need 100% consensus, so one node says max payment is 0.02 btc and other says 0.04 btc etc. You only need to have consensus between sender, receiver and routing parties. So there can be different ln nodes with some different rules on the same network. 
You can also have your own private network (say within an organization) where you don't broadcast your ip publicly.      
You can have LN networks only for large payments, LN network for small payments, and ways to send from one network to another.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:23:08
FUD? Lightning is a hot wallet

@_date: 2018-01-11 11:40:24
no, 2mb     
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:30:49
1) in a block-chain, all transactions are stored on all nodes. In LN, you store only the transactions related to you. You also store the channel state of all other nodes so that your node can calculate routes. So it's in your computer. All these transactions are also valid Bitcoin transactions so you just publish the final state on-chain(Bitcoin chain) when you want to,say, withdraw to your cold wallet. In next versions, there will be optimisations so that you don't have to store all channel states. It's not a big deal though, I think 10 million channels are like 100mb.     
2) There is a book called "mastering Bitcoin", it's a free book, and the last chapter covers this. Get it from libgen.io 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:39:28
"modern LN could be set with very high locktimes."
Isn't that the old way? If I'm not wrong currently all channels are infinite and can be closed anytime by cooperating

 everythign is authenticated, you can't report fake information, peers give proofs the channels acrtually exist and they can update them
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:22:41
In the eclair wallet I use, waiting period is 1day(can be changed of course)
I was confused too, so just checked Mastering Bitcoin - with CSV(which is what current implementations use), channels can be kept open indefinitely, allowing 281 trillion state transitions in a single channel

A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second
An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn’t exceed its upload limits. It’s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 100 gigabytes the first time you start your node.
6 hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.

For others - in some cases, ransomware does not actually encrypt the files. So before paying live boot some os and check if files are actually encrypted.
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:22:29
They may attack randomly, if it happens and you don't have important files or have a back up, you can just format your pc and reinstall os / backup your files.   
Here's how it works, you have some files on your pc. The attacker encrypts them(messes up the file and you can unmess the file only if you have the "key" ( password)), and says, if you give me 5btc ill give you the key. So the attacker doesn't actually have the files, its on your computer but encrypted. Unless you have the key you can't  open your files.  
In case if it happens(pretty common), don't panic, just google the thing you see on your screen and try to see if the key exists in the net. Sometimes the attacker says he has encrypted your files but in reality hes just making you think that so you will give him btc. That way, it is super easy to get your files. So if it happens, paying should be last resort after verifying there are no methods to bypass the "hack".

Guys whatever you do don't force your family members / friends buy bitcoin saying it will rise. It can destroy relationships.

Hello, you can post your reasons for supporting SegWit in , its a new sub ( 1 day old ) .

No? Those markets are centralized right?

No seriously, if you look at  more than 50% miners haven't decided whom to support. Give them a reason to support your views.
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:01:22
Correct. If no one used as currency, and everyone just kept it with them even early adopters, then value will be 0.

You will have twice the coins but value adjusts itself. The total value may be lower or higher than previous price, it depends on the market.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:38:12
Are you ?
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:54:08
Look up etherum and etherum classic, those are two forks. NIce study. Look at them graphs. Price going up all depends on market, if theres a demand for both , yea. Think of them as probably two different coins. Short time after fork, price probably would crash in both. Again, look at etherum and etherum classic price history..
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:13:37

@_date: 2017-02-28 14:58:48
Ok, so thats not a problem. If I'm not wrong, the initial fee was 70 sat /byte, while the current recommended fee was more than that. You won't lose money buy txns getting delayed, hope it confirms soon.
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:10:29
Nothing. Heres the problem, it needs money to run to pay txn fee but everyone started complaining that it is taking a fee. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:14:46
That is just variance and that percentage does not matter.
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:34:00
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:47:34
Hopefully when we get a scaling solution fees will decrease.

It was 20% vs 23% few days ago, doesn't matter, what matters is when segwit reaches 95%.

To be fair to them segwit provides 0.7 mb which will then get filled. There must be another way  to keep scaling when blocks start getting filled again.

Yes, also check out "replace by fee" in electrum.
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:00:54
Ok, your opinion. I think it will change this year.
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:06:58
That depends. If you don't trust in future of bitcoin / think it will be messy / think another coin will overtake bitcoin you can move your bitcoins and exchange it for something else. This is not something I would do because I think the market is too huge ( relative to an altcoin ) for bitcoin value to simply vanish. Remember, if fork (segwit or other) is successful and widely supported, the value will actually go up as scaling is probably the main problem preventing wider adoption.   
If you have the resources, you can set up a full node to voice your opinion. You can ask miners to support x or y.   
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:09:09
Actually the tokens or something (I wasn't there during the hack) means customers recovered 97% of all lost funds.

@_date: 2017-03-05 17:35:31
Nay, all when channels close, it will be registered on the chain, so miners keep getting fees. The fee market will adjust - if lightning comes to fruition, more people will use bitcoin. Which means more people closing channels and using the blockchain.   
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:55:52
Its not about  increasing blocksize, it is about giving miners full control of blocksize. Many are fine with 2mb/4mb, BU is not that. BU gives unlimited control and large miners can mine huge blocks kicking all nodes and small miners out.       
"single variable in code" Nope. BU changes a lot of things. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:46:19
Which wallet did you use? You paid a very very very low fee - 14.97 sat/B . Fee depends on number of inputs you have. Current fee is like 100 sat/B

I'm assuming he wants to analyze it for stats/personal project.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:01:02
Ok, why segwit should come before block size increase  -   
SegWit is a very important part of scaling. For example SegWit fixes the quadratic scaling of sighash operations bug, so that it's safer to increase the blocksize and increase capacity.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:06:41
Wrong, group 1 wants a BU hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:33:19
In LN, its essentially a race to zero fee, so all fees will probably be zero anyway(in LN).

Please read up the comment. Poster was saying 3rd party is not required. 3rd party is required. 3rd party may even censor txn. To use bitcoin directly (without "middleman" ) I have to pay huge fee?f    
LN is great for micro-transactions though.

Many folks like big blocks but don't like BU.
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:29:41
In 2020, if adoption is great, even with LN we need bigger blocks. So yes, I'm up for any proposal to increase blocksize in future. 1.6TB/year would  not be that much in 2020 perhaps, and this is only if blocks are full.     
What ever the case is, segwit should be activated so we can see how the LN market works.

Segwit has been thoroughly tested extensively...
Don't get me wrong, I also support bigger blocks. But I don't understand opposition to segwit.   
Also "then review it", well, reviewers don't do it for free, also, its about the whole "consensus as a goal" instead of as a rule.   
At the end I'm no technological expert in bitcoin code so I really don't have a right to comment really..  
btw its around 22% supporting BU, well, that % may soon change depending on Antpool ( antpool went back to mining neutral blocks).

@_date: 2017-03-06 21:43:52
This question has been posted multiple times.. you can try the search bar.  
Tip : Instead of asking others opinions (which will be very biased) research it your self).   
Anyway, in BU, it is consensus as goal, not consensus as rule.  
Also some top miners can create huuge blocks which will kick small nodes out.  (there is only one node in all of west africa).   
Top miners can keep mining huge blocks , so all nodes will now be limited to data centers, not home computers. It will cause centralization. Why not just use Paypal in that case? bitcoin is about decentralization.  
Also, when data is in datacentres, it is easy for govt to stop it.   
There are many more - there was a BU bug which resulted in a loss for one miner. Then BU is not as peer reviewed as Segwit.   
I will ask - what is your argument against segwit?   
Eventually there has to be / will be on chain scaling. But BU is not the way - it is not peer reviewed. It is a different experiment.

"Connecting like facebook friends" is nothing to do with Bitcoin system itself. It is something wallet makers can add.

First off, you are mixing up segwit and offchain.  
Segwit is not offchain transaction. It is a softfork (backwards compatible upgrade ) which fixes some problems like malleability. It also makes 1.7-2.3 mb total of txns go through in a single block.     
Segwit / similar upgrade which fixes malleability is required for Lightning Network.     
To see how lightning network works, check out        
I'll throw in a couple links for you from :  
Segwit :     
Lightning :     
You may check more links at .  
You can set up your own "lightning node".  
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:24:16
Decred coin is another cryptocurrency. In the same way we have us dollar and yen, you have bicoins and other coins.
Miners vote using hash power - the power of their special computers (called ASICs) which is used to "mine" bitcoin (mining is creating a block, and a block contains the recently added transactions).      
I'm not sure what tokens you mean by, in bitfinex there are Bitcoin unlimited and bitcoin core tokens - both of them does not exist, but if hard fork happens you can convert tokens to real coins.
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:18:11

Quantum computing -    


See the implications of quantum computers on public key cryptography here 
The risk of quantum computers is also there for financial institutions, like banks, because they heavily rely on cryptography when doing transactions.    
Internet -    
True. If internet is down, yes bitcoin will be down. (So will be trillions of dollars of business). Not sure about some existence of "kill switch" though.      
Bitcoin is deflationary in nature because of fixed supply.      
Look at it this way - now one bread costs 0.001 BTC, after some time it will cost 0.0001 BTC etc.     
Hyperinflation - relative to USD bitcoin has an uptrend. If usd hyper inflates, bitcoin will just rise even more in usd terms. 
You need not buy "one" bitcoin. Bitcoin can be divided to 8 decimal places (and even more through a fork).

Hardware costs decrease as time goes on, so sensible scaling is not a problem. However, giving complete control to miners is a problem as one pool (under influence of an attacking state) can mine huge blocks and RIP the small miners and nodes.

What do you mean by "the" mempool?
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:10:36
Thats odd, electrum always suggests correct fee for me.   
Anyway, next time, you may use replace by fee - bumping a txn with a new fee (tools -&gt; pref -&gt; fees -&gt; enable replace by fee ). You can also set your own fee there too. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:30:51
0 confirmations ? Quick download electrum, restore your seed and double spend. Make sure you set txn fee pretty high.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:46:41
Some bitcoin "plus"(BCL) coins are actually different coins. My advice : don't buy unknown small coins. Sure, they can triple the value but become zero too. 
post hardfork tokens are sold in bitfinex.com. It also has risk - if fork does not happen before dec 31 all BU coins will become zero.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:48:50
Also why create multiple new accounts and post the same thing..
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:20:50


One can't "roll" hardforks back like that. If I'm not wrong, in that case, ALL txns made in &gt;1mb blocks will suddenly become invalid.     
I agree something should be thought about on chain scaling. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:05:08
Around half? The main thing to decrease fee is LN.
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:45:13
Bitclub?   
Ponzi schemes are sad. If so, hope they go down too.
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:15:24
If fee is low use replace by fee on electrum.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:21:50
No, some of antpool never shifted to BU, they were gradually upgrading and this will too.
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:42:55
You have to code the whole thing again. It induces more technical debt. You can already try out LN in segwit testnet btw.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:47:44

@_date: 2017-03-04 19:17:40
Yes core devs do read the sub.  Maybe can help you(he is a dev).   
What I think - as usage grows, if blocksize becomes larger and larger by the formula you gave, the blockchain would be huge, that it would only be stored on data centres and not in home computers. This leads to centralization.   
I agree with on chain scaling as long as it doesn't affect the decentralization goal.  
To completely use bitcoin as a trustless system one has to run their own node, which isn't possible if blockchain becomes huge.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:05:31

@_date: 2017-03-07 06:00:47
Ok, why segwit should come before block size increase  -   
SegWit is a very important part of scaling. For example SegWit fixes the quadratic scaling of sighash operations bug, so that it's safer to increase the blocksize and increase capacity.
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:10:09

Nope, as I said before, solutions exist. My personal opinion  - tiny txns such as $1 ones could be off chain on LN. Of course some want it on the block and I respect that, but imo, it kicks out many nodes.

May seem silly, but if someone gives me a payment request, how do I see how much I"m paying him ?
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:38:59
The 2nd case has more txns.   
Less txns = less popularity?   
Maybe in 2nd case
30,000txn * 0.0005 BTC? From user point of view fee is less, from miner point of view, more fees.    
Can't really say though, I don't know much about how the game theory will play out.   
I personally am looking forward to LN.
@_date: 2017-03-31 06:47:07
Bitfinex will give you the coins in exchange for tokens.     
You have 1 bitcoin. You give one bitcoin to bitfinex to get tokens(core coin and unlimited coin).   
When (if) split happens you can exchange tokens back to coins from Bitfinex.

Here are a few numbers -  
26.4% of miners signal segwit.   
Antpool (16.4% of total hashpower) said they are ok with segwit if there is a hardfork to 2mb.   
f2pool(12% of total hashpower) said they will try segwit in litecoin and then think about it.     
Many agree that 2nd solutions are needed anyway - to enable micro-transactions which would be impossible directly.   
The question is about on chain scaling. What after Segwit? Will there be onchain scaling?   
(For reference , the "other" bitcoin client has 20% miner support).

Transaction fee is a problem for me ( I'm from India ). We play small chess tournaments and payout using Bitcoin( tiny amounts, just among friends). Even upto 5% is transaction fee. Now we just have our own "lightning network" ( names and amount on a text file) and pay out as a whole.

Electrum default settings.   
12 word seed on paper. Password on paper.   
I'm alright , right?   
I always had this doubt, if 12 words recover my wallet, where does it recover it from? What if the place it recovers it from gets hacked/goes down?  
Edit : I know I ask too many questions. Thanks for always helping me out, ! Newbie here, convinced 4 mates about Bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:30:54
I'm not an expert, so someone else will jump in, but "electrum" won't go bankrupt. Anyone can set up an electrum server. It is decentralized. In case for *some* reason all servers go down, open electrum, export private keys and put them into another wallet.  
In electrum, wallet -&gt; private keys -&gt; export
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:13:10
Yup just 12 word seed.  However its not direct, quoting Mycelium uses BIP44, and Electrum uses its own thing. It is still possible to use the same keys for both. You'd need to find software to convert your Mycelium seed to a BIP32 master key, and then derive the xprv key for m/44'/0'/0' and in Electrum choose "restore normal wallet" or whatever the restore option is, and when it asks you to put your seed words, instead just put the xprv key string.

@_date: 2017-11-13 05:20:46
Bitcoin split to Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash 3 months ago. 
Mining Bitcoin cash has lower difficulty so there are days when mining bcash is more profitable. So some miners flock to bcash, causing transactions to be slower on Bitcoin. But slush pool continues to mine on Bitcoin so we can have faster transactions. After difficulty adjustment, Bitcoin becomes easier to mine. Then a few days later it flips and the thing repeats again.   
Bcash is around 15% of Bitcoin's price

Inefficient without segwit, no dual channels.

Open source - anyone can see the code used to create the program. 
Others can see if the person who is writing the code is trying to do something funny.
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:44:42
point of the post was to show the share of mining power, not the name of miners themselves, so I didn't bother to do a high res version.   
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:27:09
144 equals one day. They probably didn't update it.

Bip141. That is segwit

again, 30% is for last 144 blocks. scroll down to see how many are NYA since antpool etc started     
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:57:01
cool, thanks! Does this mean, assuming all new txns will be segwit only, the bitcoin network will support around x4 more txns / second than today?
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:17:45
look, i'm not blaming you, and coinbase text here has nothing to do with the coinbase company, its just a text the miners include in every block, and in this case, these miners have started including "NYA" in the text, saying they are ok with new york agreement.              
all i'm saying is I don't like anyone accusing others                         
and i'm sorry if i was rude

Hey, offtopic, but when the need arises for another blocksize increase(after say segwit and 2mb blocks) what will the procedure to decide when to do it? And how is it determined "when the need arises"? Thanks       
^sorry for poor english

Segwit should have been activated last year

Most posts on this sub is now about price or ridiculous comparisons.
When did this happen? This sub used to have good discussions. Any other forum where it's more technical and less fluff?
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:18:01
well you're right
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:56:52
they were vilified because they spread wrong information (and still continiue to do so) about core team
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:38:24
Litecoin hashrate = 7,460 GH/s          
50% hashrate = 3730 GH/s           
L3+ hashrate = 504MH/s            
number of L3+ required to reach 50% = 7400 units.        
Cost of one L3+ = ~$1950           
$$$ required to attack litecoin = $14.43 million                    
Same calculation for Bitcoin (AM741, $714, 7.3TH/s) whose hashrate is 5,165,284 TH/s        
needs 353786 miners costing $252,603,204 (this is ignoring electricity costs, costs of producing that much number of miners, cost of human capital, cost of setting up things, bandwidth costs etc which makes the cost rise even more).                
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:06:50
All I see there in the link is a countdown.            
Bitcoin (for simplest txn only) is 7/sec.     
Litecoin is 7 * 5 * 2(segwit) = 70/sec.         
So more txn than that will result in fee bidding, which will drive fees up. Like every other cryptocurrency.        
Also litecoin is more insecure than bitcoin (it costs less to reach 51%).         
Litecoin don't have many devs. Look at how many are actually using segwit.    
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:47:08
9) It takes some time to get roi. If they sell the miners they get the money on the spot. Also mining has risks, what if difficulty becomes too much, what if there is a govt crackdown mining, what if govt says using electricity for mining is illegal etc. But when they sell they don't have to take any risks.       
          
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:12:54
 what will you do if price goes down?        
Literally every rbitcoin post is about price, when did this happen?
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:45:01
well segwit2x will lockin on 23rd and is compatible with the uasf 
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:06:11
I made a claim "litecoin is easier to attack than bitcoin" and you asked for a source and I provided a source. And now you are rambling about something else.             
And $15million is chump change.       
You are the literal definition of , asking everyone else to read but looks like you are the one who didn't read.       
Oh and how many are using segwit atm in litecoin? How many active devs does litecoin have? Very less. Features are more are less being copied from Bitcoin.      
oh and satoshi not living is good for decentralisation.            
I'm convinced you are a troll trying to waste other's time.      
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:32:48

" schnorr aggregation, Lightning" etc are not mutually exclusive with this "2mb" thing, right? (I don't really know what they mean except lightning, Ive tried that in the testnet and was pretty fun). Well, even after all optimisations etc, we still need to increase the size some day again, right? How is this "consensus" reached to change the existing "set in stone" consensus?   
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:07:49
not an argument. no one can predict the future. litecoin can become $5million /coin and bitcoin $0 because of some protocol bug. But that is irrelevant. You made claims, and I showed your claims were wrong.
