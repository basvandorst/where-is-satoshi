Don’t worry, it’s normal. I️ personally sold all of my coins and went LTC.

You have to wire money, then you can trade. Wires take like an hour for me. I️ put an express on my wires so there’s a fee but it works.

That’s what I’m worried about.

I️ think your thinking correctly, I️ agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:19:55
Shouldn’t take that long!

Lol my friend just bought TRON, just take the link to the block cypher and check back into it

You nailed it. I️ think it’s too private and governments won’t deal with that. We need to see where money goes. 
I️ think a certain level of privacy is great, but too much can run up issues.

Just HODL, don’t trade

LTC baby! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:16:36
Get back in. LTC at 2-3k this time next year.

Buy, in 2018 we will see money pour in unlike ever before.

Sketched out by that coin. If regulation does come, it’s going to really go after those anonymous untraceable cryptos. I’m staying away just because I️ personally believe those coins aren’t worth the risk.

Yeah it’s instantaneous!

BTC is lacking a lot of functionality, specifically transaction confirmation times.
Plus, I️ like to speculate the market cap. More gains can be made with LTC since less money is required to drive the price up. 
Jan 1st, 2017 BTC was around the same market cap as LTC. Now BTC is at 270 - 300B.  If LTC can achieve just 1/3 of that growth in the next year, we will see a $2.1k LTC which is around a 7x on the current price. Now, if LTC can reach 200B Market cap we will see a 3.5k LTC.. let’s moon ☝️����

My thoughts too

Buy. In the financial world, a 250 B market cap is pennies. It will reach over 1 T. You’re not late.

I’m SG and I️ approve this post

Check how much bitcoin you have with how much you paid, then calculate the current value of how much your btc is worth now, then add or subtract.
