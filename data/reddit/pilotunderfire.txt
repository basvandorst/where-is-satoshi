yea nope :/ I cant find any way to transfer BTC to paypal in USD... or convert BTC to usd and then send instantly to paypal... 
would be nice to find a visa pre-paid card site that will accept BTC to load the card...

�� bought my first $400 at 10 and 11k, hopefully a smart decision but if it’s not it’s only $400 lol I’ll most likely invest more.  
I’m looking for some solid advice on day trading it if anyone has any...
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:07:57
I will.   But I wanted to our of curiosity and for fun try and trade it, not caring if I lose it... (small amount) (entertainment value)
