Will do my friend has done it.  He was the one who advised to do it through mycelium and said he'd come with me to an ATM to make sure everything is done correctly. Thanks for looking out

Haha got it. thank you, one last question I asked yesterday but the more response the better, I can't afford to purchase a full coin was planning to purchase for around 3 thousand is that still decent ?

Thanks for the advice my friend suggested mycelium .only thing though is they charge an interest of 4-8% which isn't bad

Your referring to the words they provide you with when your creating it right ?

Can't Afford to purchase one bitcoin, do you think purchasing 2-3 thousand dollars still worth it ?

Unfortunately I don't have the full amount to purchase a full bitcoin unless I use my personal line of credit which i get a discount rate of 3.5% since I work for a financial institution. not sure if that makes sense to do so  since I'll be paying interest until I pay it off again. So I was thinking of putting down 1-2 thousand dollars and keep adding on to it weekly via coinbase since it's a  pretty low interest doing it that way.

Great advice that's exactly what I was thinking of doing invest in bitcoin and ether, I'm going into this ready to lose my money, and no I'm not looking at it from a negative stand point but I'm trying to say that I'm only going to investment the amount that won't effect me in anyway so I'm definitely ready to do that. What's the best way to go about purchasing it? I'm in Canada

Fair enough, correct me if I didn't get your point, so what your suggesting is to purchase a full coin with Credit and sit on it since the anticipation is that it will continue to rise rather than to try and chase to grab one gradually?

Haha no I meant in terms of money is it secured enough via mycelium?

Good point I'm really new to this although mate of mine suggested I invest 5 years ago, I never bothered look into it which fuckin sucks but it is what it is. Now I can't afford a full bitcoin I was thinking of putting in 3000 dollars and every pay cheque add some more to it, but my plan is to invest and hold for the long haul win or lose doesn't matter, question is you think it's worth to buy or is it too late at this point?
