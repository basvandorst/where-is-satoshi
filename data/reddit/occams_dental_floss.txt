For the curious- 
* One Troy oz of gold costs $1,255.       
* One Troy lb of gold (12 ozt) costs $15,061.    
* One oz of gold costs $1,144.      
* One lb of gold (16oz) costs $18,303.    
   
So for those wondering, BTC at $19,600 is more expensive than either definition of "a pound of gold."

On the other hand, if you can't beat them, have you considered joining them?   
Once the Bitcoin option market opens up you will be able to do butterfly spreads to profit on the volatility itself.
