Possibly a double bottom near 15,750 now. May propel it back into the mid 16's and beyond from here.

Yes, the fees are lower / zero. 
I just didn't want people transferring money to GDAX thinking ok I'm ready to buy and then realizing after the transfer process started that they have to wait 9 days before they can actually buy.

Uber built an unsustainable model, sacrificing the future for the near term. I use taxis or uber now depending on what's in front of me/quickest. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:01:16
Are your buys through ACH transfer or using a credit/debit card? Only thing instant I've seen is using a credit/debit card but that has fairly high fees associated.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:20:15
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:19:41
Ok but you can't lock in a price with GDAX. You have to deposit USD and wait for it to clear which can take a week, then buy at market price. If the price of BTC goes up 2000, you're going to pay the higher price. Would've rather just paid the measly fee. This becomes more true the higher the transaction amount.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:24:00
For a while it seemed like taxis would die off, but drivers can't make a real living and buy a new car with uber wages. Taxi model might not be perfect but it's sustainable. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:06:20
They are exactly the same. If you buy through coinbase (instead of using gdax) they charge you a premium of about $100/BTC though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:23:10
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:55:50
I've done three ACH through Coinbase / USAA and it takes a week to completely fund. And USAA is a partner of theirs she generally clears faster than other banks in my experience. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:56:38
I trade on GDAX. I know. Most people when they go to buy want to buy at that day's price. I would've cost myself hundreds of dollars more if I had waited on GDAX funds to clear on the several buys I've had. I wouldn't have paid fees though! Lol
Also people need to understand how to trade not just with a limit order but as a market maker instead of a taker. You will still get charged fees on a limit order if you fulfill an order already waiting on the books.
You're misleading people a little bit. Be careful.

Bitcoin is snakebitten since it started dominating headlines ~beginning of December. Also around the time of CBE/CMOE futures starting.

We're about to plunge again aren't we? God forbid we just have a nice upward trend channel.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:19:34
And as an early uber driver who drove for several years, I can tell you uber ran into the same problems that made taxis what they are today. Uber's quality and prices dropped more and more as they tried to gain more market share and keep up. Now it's running a little ragged and is similar quality to taxis. Your analogy supports Andreas' thoughts beautifully. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:48:26
Price action setup here. It's about to either shoot up pretty good here in the next 15-20 minutes or so or take a temporary plummet. If it breaks below 16100 watch out I think. If it breaks ~16350 should shoot up. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:22:24
You REALLY wanted to talk about capitalism, huh?

We're now pretty close to that resistance mark, let's see if we can go through it and if the author is right in his prediction.

Yes it's on the assembly line right now.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:19:58
Yeah I looked away for a second and it was gone. 2 minutes before it was 200+ BTC at 17k for sale. Did it just get removed? I didn't see a record of 200 BTC bought there.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:00:15
Lol? I called price action and it dropped within ten minutes severely. Not sure what you were calling me out on

I tried my best to listen to it with an open mind, deciding from this debate if Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash is a better currency / investment.
Jameson (had never heard of him before this) comes off as a very smart and refined person and he showed a lot of respect and just seemed like a decent guy. Roger comes off as somewhat condescending and immature. They both were decent about not getting inflammatory, but just have to say Jameson really sounds like a stand-up guy in this space.
They both made decent points, but I felt that Jameson articulated them better and I believed him more. It feels like Roger is just pumping something and constantly trying to create a "gotcha" moment, such as at the end when he just kept trying over and over to get Jameson in a quote saying that the white paper described Bitcoin Cash. Jameson actually seemed like he had conviction for something he believes will work longterm and will work better. 
Overall, guys like Andreas and Jameson seem like they look at the technical issue and are passionate about something that is robust and will work, not just a near-term solution. Roger, as he constantly brings up, is an economist and I believe it. He sounds like a shmoozer. Give me an engineer over an economist to solve real problems.

Can you use LN to send payments to another person (as in, not a business). Say for a craigslist transaction?

What a dumb take. Bitcoin represents everything wrong with the American economy? Really? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:24:09
I sent via gdax (no fees, at least not to me) to my wallet about 6 hours ago and still waiting...not sure when to expect this to clear. It took a couple hours when I sent the night before last and it was pretty congested then. Same method (gdax, no fees).
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:56:22
Lost and inaccessible forever - correct. That is forever lost out of the 21 million. 
Estimated 3-4 million is lost forever, so really no more than 18 million (and far likely less) will be able to change hands.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:06:47
If it's a bank transfer, it will take about a week to clear. But it will show the funds as pending in your account.
If you use a credit or debit card (lower limits per week on coinbase, and higher fees), it will be pretty much instant.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:47:25
This is kind of a bad example of the problem that LN is addressing. Your issue is more with the exchange fees, and it sounds like you're using a credit card. If you use a bank transfer, the fee is 1% to buy (this isn't un-similar to a commission you'd pay at, say, Fidelity to buy a stock). If you want to transfer your money to gdax and buy using a limit order, you pay ZERO fees (free commission, even better than a typical stock broker). Then you can use gdax to transfer to your wallet, again, for FREE. 
The real problem that this is addressing is speed to get transaction confirmed (at times can be hours, others much quicker depending on traffic), and fees to move around after you've purchased and you're trying to spend or send to another wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:47:17
Same deal but I sent it to gdax first then transferred to bread. Did this to avoid Coinbase fee. Will it not go through bc there's no fee? I see people talking about transactions getting stuck becaysevthey didn't set a high enough tx fee. Does this apply to a free gdax to breadwallet transfer?

Green represents the amount of buy orders out there (cumulative). Red is sell orders at different price levels.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:00:56
Somewhat safe but not really to leave there. All advice will say move it to a wallet where you control keys in case of hack.
You can transfer instantly between gdax and coinbase. They make it easy because it's the same company.

Actually you don’t have to itemize (go over the standard deduction) to get benefits from the up to $3k in losses. It comes off your income immediately. At least for stock sales.
