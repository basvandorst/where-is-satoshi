Government decides "bitcoin bad!"
Government tells cash app (twitter owned) bitcoin bad.
Cash app/government/twitter shuts your account down and may or may not give you your funds back.
If you buy on exchange, and transfer to your own wallet, it is YOURS, virtually (excuse the pun) untouchable.  This is the inherent value of bitcoin.

Get out. Any woman who buys handbags like that doesn't give a f about the world. Get out gracefully. And buy some bitcoin before it gets back up to 8.

Wonder how Anderson's CIA handlers are going to have it spun?
Or maybe his handlers are heading to GitMo with Comey and Brennan?  Hahahhahahahah
Doesn't matter how they try to spin it; Satoshi Tsunami inbound!
