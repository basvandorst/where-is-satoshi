lol. 
Overstock's net income last fiscal year was 88 million. In one month they had a 1+% bump.  I know it's not the total revenue, but I'm guessing Bitcoin has the least amount of fees and overhead than any other payment system they've ever used..  so hard to gauge exactly.
Not that it will stay at 1 mil a month, but if overstock makes 5% net increase for the year (which they should do easily)....   Well let’s put it this way, if other companies see Overstock make 5%+ with very little overhead or advertisement for Bitcoin, you'll be wishing you bought Bitcoin at the price it's at today. ;)

Great,  Satoshi is still among us and Newsweek is about to face their biggest lawsuit ever.
He could have broke his silence that he's kept this long, simply knowing that someone's life could be in danger now. it's reasonable for him to have some humanity for some unsuspecting soul who got doxxed by a moronic reporter. 
Hopefully he doesn't have to get "involved" in the future simply because reporters generally value their work.. and their job.

The only thing that surprises me is that this isn't written by that shill at the LA Times, Michael Hiltzik.. who has written more negative ill-researched pieces on Bitcoin than anyone that comes to mind.  
Actually, I'm starting to think there's a mantra at the LA Times that if they hate Bitcoin long enough.. it might just go away.. heh
Hiltzik, as long as you've been dissing Bitcoin, I've been mining and trading it, and it has yet to be the doom and gloom you keep promising..  So how's that for your "crack" journalism..?
What's worse is you're going to try and write a rebuttal from your lawn chair years from now about how you didn't understand it, "no one did".. no we did, you didn't.

He's Satoshi, he knows everything.

Whatsapp was bought for 19bn!? That app sucks.. anyone try it? haha  My only guess is FB bought it so they could straight up have your phone # easier, instead of pestering you to add it to your FB. no thanks.

How so? Did you honestly just take the top comment from the top reddit post (Bouncer fights off gunman) right now and apply it here? haha
If anything I would say she lacked balls, sitting on the story till you have real evidence, enough credible sources, etc..  even with the potential of losing the scoop, story, or someone stealing the headline (had it been accurate).. that woulda been balls..  and probably woulda saved her career.

Hey at least it's something.. Every protest has to start somewhere. 
First thought.. Thicker Markers will prove most effective. 
My 2nd thought.. Damn Tokyo buildings are nice. ;)

"ok here it goes... " a minute later you realize what you just missed out on for not having a good memory.

I have no idea if this works, but I have personally wished there was a service or that I could do it myself after I've sent a transaction and forgotten to add a fee and wanted it done more quickly.
My guess this is an idea that is implemented somehow in the QT in the future, but cool idea none the less OP.
edit* ever accidentally not attached a fee, and had confirmations waiting for the supposed "10 min." average.. and then had like three 30 min. blocks in row? ugh....

KNC is. believe me.  Soon to be the majority hasher.. AND now solo mining. AND now making their own wallet... Scary stuff.

love how this got downvoted.. for the record I was half-kidding, all bears get mad at the slightest thought of them not getting coins cheap. rofl. sad bears.

He kinda is.. . My guess is a lot of the earliest prophets of Bitcoin have some extreme greed muck residue that was probably too hard to resist in the early days.. and will be hard to shake off, cough Silk Road, cough Mt.Gox Insider dealings.. etc..  
Thankfully guys like Andreas are around to keep the heads to the influx of new blood in check.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:58:11
So further evidence that Mt. Gox has known about "TM" as far back as 2011, (which we already knew they must have considering they "own" Bitcoin wiki and it's written there) , that it hadn't actually effected his "holdings", and still used it as an excuse to hold withdraws and drive the market down (purposeful or not)...  It really is looking grim for this guy.  His smug reactions and demeanor truly fit everything you could imagine about his character.

speculators will keep the price down till they no longer can. and then it'll just be a new "low" they set with big walls and such.  The volatility is good in a way, spreads the wealth and network but the speculators will run it right into the ground too if they have to.. it's a catch-22.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:55:10
I think this is a great idea, I'm glad Andreas is behind it.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:29:24
People have been talking about it on Bitcointalk. sounds like KNC might be the culprit. again.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:30:49
I don't know if he want any more attention after the last few weeks whirlwind.. but he does post here you know. ;)
*edit just realized you posted his reddit..
I want to follow up what Ducky said.. This guy has been running around so much I think he deserves a break. I find his fervor a real inspiration, if anyone needs a bahamas vaca it's Andreas!.. heh.

The fed is not gonna give up their most valuable assets.. Esp. when they don't have to.
The "auction" announcement was probably just a stall tactic while the US tries to figure out how to get Bitcoin all for themselves, just like China and Russia are doing. heh. ;)

Not trying to stir the pot.. but this guy posted this last week... so his prediction (or his inside scoop) didn't come to fruition so now he's demanding they step down?? wth? Or am i missing something.?
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:41:30
On one hand great because he seems to really "get" Bitcoin, on the other hand big companies (Amazon, Ebay, which means Paypal, who will surely all jump on board eventually, it would be stupid to just ignore Bitcoin, it's like ignoring the power of the internet..)  they might find it odd..troublesome.. that the ceo of a competitor company is on the board of TBF.  Again, this would only delay the inevitable..
