Hahahahahaha I feel like we're a community of genrally well informed people here on reddit, yet we still have tiers of stupidity among our ranks.  Yet somehow we can still relate about the dumbass people at work..

This just in! A pun about crypto currencies manifests on Reddit,  investor confidence skyrockets btc up 4000%!

I say leverage the market correction and play it to your favor.  If you have money to blow, why not gamble it away on something could potentially have growth and prosperity?  Unlike Becky's marriage.

If I had a dollar for every person that called me about setting up a mining rig or advice for trading crypto...
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:44:08
If I had invested that in crypto, it would have been -2,000

People still look at contractors the same way.  Unemployed.  When I came to this realization..  I deleted my LinkedIN profile.

It's funny when measures to punish the rich hurt the poor because the poor came up with those exact measures.  It's practically India in a paragraph.

Left after she started mentioning patriarchy and started spewing out logical fallacies. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:53:05
This is some shit
@_date: 2016-12-03 14:22:13
No however those measures were more than likely were supported by the poor.

You've also forgot about the amount of time determining whether or not it was a penny.  The lack of consideration that someone may have glued it down with epoxy is also a wild card.

Is that Ricky Gervais?  OP..  Are you Ricky Gervais?  And you're in Arlington Texas?
@_date: 2016-10-07 03:48:54
Hehe leave it up to Texas to conveniently forget that law
@_date: 2016-10-11 20:05:16
Yes, thank you!

Most of us here are broke thanks to Perry's antics. But I won't go into too much detail into my dillusional lament. Someone however really needs to eliminate the cruel and unusual punishment that the surcharge renders the state's citizens.
