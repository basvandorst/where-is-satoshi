Bitcoin won't help Greece any more than Greeks buying foreign currency will.

It's wrong. Paypal and eBay aren't accepting Bitcoin. A subsidiary of Paypal that manages all kinds of back end payment processing for (mostly large) merchants on their own websites is supporting Bitcoin.
You can't pay for goods with Bitcoin if the payment is through Paypal or through eBay (unless you do cash in collection and convince the seller to accept with no middle men).

So has the massive fall in the pound affected bitcoin at all?

Thanks a lot for the great reply Jimmy! I really hope this succeeds even more than I did this morning.

Hi Jimmy, I just wanted to say I think this is a fantastic idea. I'm sure if anyone can pull this off it will be you. I will support the idea later today.
I have a few questions which I haven't found answered anywhere else so far:
* Will your journalists and reporters be geographically distributed? Taking the Bitcoin example having journalists in China might be beneficial.
* How will you deal with news that is only of limited geographic interest (ie local, regional and country specific news)?
* Will English be the only language supported? If so how do you plan to deal with the editorial bias issues surrounding selective news and viewpoints this introduces?
* Other so-called neutral news organisation, eg the BBC, suffer from bias issues to do with selective or over representative reporting of certain issues or viewpoints (Brexit springs to mind). Anecdotally this is often attributed to journalism as a profession attracting a skewed distribution of political views compared to the population in general. Do you think involving the community in the writing and editing process can fully overcome this kind of issue?
