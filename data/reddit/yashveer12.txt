@_date: 2018-01-11 20:44:09
They wanna see big crash around $1K per Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:29:41

@_date: 2018-01-12 20:23:08
FYI, they are not world's largest exchange
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:20:31
majority exchanges are already ready to accept segwit, even coinbase is ready in 2018..
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:30:16
4th already done, its time for 5th ban as soon as btc recover its price...
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:26:02
 who will pay 5% extra + credit card charge??
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:13:28
yeah its called arbitage, but if it was possible to buy @ international site, Then you will not find the differences in india/international prices,, just like bitstamp/bitfinex/gdax prices are same if they keep 10% difference, Then arbitage happen instantly and price will be become almost equal.. but india can't accept international users nor we can buy from international site, That's why our prices are around 10-15% higher and No one can do arbitage trading !!
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:28:09
Okay, if people are right... Then what will happen? any risk with my money?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:19:09

Indians always follow international market prices and then trade in india,, i don't know night prices and afternoon prices matter, but if its really happen like you said, Then the difference will be low like 2-3% not more than..........
Again Indians follow international prices for dump/pump... I always use bitfinex because india has very low volume to execute my trades !!
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:28:49
Bitfinex for smooth and fast trading 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:07:15
use segwit txn, segwit txn cost is around $2
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:25:28
fee should be $15 to $30 for Non-segwit transaction
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:24:21
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:55:16

@_date: 2018-01-26 22:05:20

@_date: 2018-01-27 10:13:03
Zebpay (india) is a exchange as well as a wallet, Ofcourse i know that there are wallet where we can set our custom fee.. But that's useful only for those who wanna buy some products online/offline.. i have sent an email to my exchange but they are not decreasing their price...
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:24:24
according to today price, you are still in loss !!
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:05:37
Huge impact will come and Huge support of buyer will come too. Whales earn a lot by Margin sell and Buy..
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:18:45

@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:44
Panic sell already...
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:28:28
but zebpay charge 1.18% trading fee for maker orders !! not good for daily trading purpose but good who wanna HOLD for Long!!
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:41:02
Leaving on exchange who keep more than 99% digital assets in cold storage is good..
example-  bitfinex, coinbase, bitstamp

@_date: 2018-01-20 11:06:04

@_date: 2018-01-28 11:04:34
There are other exchanges are also available like bitbns (bitbns is trusted and owned by Buyhatke) which has low fees and instant deposit and Fast NEFT withdrawal, if you think 0.25% fee is high and free depsoit/withdrawal, Then you should immediately leave the crypto market as this is only for those who afford risk and understand the market volatility... Hope this Helps you !!
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:47:57
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:43:21

Yes, I check that, But BTC price is changing very frequently and they cancel transaction when btc price exceed -2.5% or +2.5% . So transaction cancel chances are much higher and you know about refund which takes 7-10 days!
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:00:30
they sell btc and bought bch 1 day before launch for earning quick money, So BCH price doubled, They earned a lot of money and whole market crashed !!

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:54:26
Looks like you bought from Zebpay or unocoin.. Yes indian rates are 10% higher than international..
But for your information, They are Broker not a exchange, Also you can keep your bitcoin to zebpay itself or international site like Bitfinex. or save your bitcoin in a Paper wallet or blockchain wallet
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:36:04
Yes, we will use bitcoin as a currency, but in india bitcoin is not famous. i heard only couples of Malls accepting payment via bitcoin in Bangalore city.  
Note: I always support off chain transaction for Free payments and we can do via Zebpay, but zebpay sell price is much lower than buy price... But still good !!
Note:- we do not support on chain transaction which is very Late as well as cost is high around Rs 700 according to current price !! Same case should be followed in USA by choosing coinbase, So Blockchain load will be reduced !!
Thats my suggestion, However if Tax is getting applied on bitcoin, So it should be 15% because we are paying gst while bitcoin and bitcoin has Risk as well !!

Bitcoin is a payment system and not an Investment !
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:25:39
Great, How you calculate this? This is actually matching in my case, Yes i bought at 0.2 btc for 1 bch (1500$ BCH/ 7500$) but i sell after 3 days when BTC is getting UP and only  UP, 300$ Loss on that time when btc was 9700$ , Since price of BTC get doubled So loss will be doubled as well which is 600$. If i keep BCH till now, then i will face loss of 1900 USD for sure !!
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:43:57
Not kraken, will suggest bitfinex
