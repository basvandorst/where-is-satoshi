No, I am in contact with Coinbase to stop the 1 BTC buy order. This guy has taken over my account and I can not log into it. I am going to the bank and will be having them close this bank account ASAP.

No, its someone who got a hold of my email password. Then reset my 2fa (Authy) to a different phone number. Then reset my coinbase password / email address and then took the buck. Getting into my email allowed them to do the rest. I noticed that my email password was not working tuesday night but thought that it just got locked and today is when I needed to use my email I called the ISP (Comcast) to have them reset my password. 
Looked through the email and found the above posted emails.

I can't believe how nasty some people are even to kids on reddit!
To me it's enough that the kid did a project on Bitcoins. 
Kodos kid!

This solution is not a good fit for everyone. We really need terminals that can interface with cash register is a better way.
I think it took me longer to configure the tablet then write the code.

Here is code for a bitcoin Payment Terminal using Coinbase API. Written with Google Chrome App Builder. Checkout the link its got a lots of pictures as well.
Terminal connect with the point of sale system so cashier does not have to do a lot of work.

As a gas station owner let me try to answer this. Gas pumps are controlled by proprietary system so they are hard to hack. What gas stations can do is prepay using bitcoin. In this case you would go inside and say I want $20 on pump  and I would like to pay in bitcoin. The cashier would ring the sale and put the total sale amount into a bitcoin terminal. The terminal will show the QR code to scan once cashier gets acknowledgement that the payment has arrived they can cash out the sale and you can go pump your gas. 
I just started this today am will be training my cashier on it all day today. 
My gas station is called the Cosmic Market and is location is greeley, colorado.

Its not that bad! My store is here but I live in Denver.

I am sorry, I just got so excited and used the incorrect wording. Please accept my sincere apology.
I tried to edit the post and change the title but am unable to do it. Sorry again for getting excited and creating a headline that would get attention. I am also sorry for using all caps again I was in the moment.

Your are the first customer to use bitcoins at my Gas Station today! I started working on the cashier terminal last weekend and I came this Friday to get things started.  I live in Broomfield, co and only come to the store on the weekends. I am a full time computer programmer working for a very large telecommunications company. I was at the store all night and when we opened at 4am, I taught my cashier how to use the terminal (5 minutes). I told her to call me if any bitcoin transactions are put through. She called me when you left and told me very excitedly that she did her first transaction. 
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for being the first bitcoin customer and making my day! I honestly was not expecting it that fast!
First bitcoin transaction after 3 hours of launch time! 
Thanks you again!

We just started this today. So we will see who will be the first to buy gas/snacks with bitcoins. In my store all cashiers are able to accept bitcoins through my simple to user bitcoin terminal.

Its not had, I just did it and started today accepting bitcoins. The biggest issue is there is a need for a simple bitcoin acceptance terminal. I used coinbase api and created one into my back office. I have a $49 android tablet that running in kiosk mode directed to my terminal web page. 
When customer wants to pay in bitcoins the cashier rings up the sale on the cash register than enters the amount into the terminal. The terminal display a QR code for customer to scan. All this goes against coinbase API and money is collected at current exchange rate.
The Cosmic Market located at 2730 23rd Avenue, Greeley, Colorado the fist Gas Station to accept bitcoins full time!
