Especially if Zynga somehow financially benefited from this act. Companies steal ideas from each other, so if Zynga benefited, others would follow.

Depends. Assuming this would just be regular currency, except online-only, the government can know where every piece of currency is owned by who. There is no need to enforce anonymity. Someone who tries to use fake digital cash would just be identified by the government and traced.

Yep. the Ecuadorian digital currency would be legal tender, and people in Ecuador HAVE to accept it by law.

You can make the same argument that someone can just hack into his own internet bank acount and give himself a billion dollars. Which in real life, would cause the bank to shut the account down.
The thing is, it would be impossible to hide the changes because legal tender has too many real life links. As long as the government know how much money is suppose to exist, and know exactly where every dollar and cent is literally in who's ownership at all times, trying to hack the system and make yourself rich just won't work. Not when the system is so transparent and government backed.
Quite simply 90% of all money are already digital. They get hacked all the time, but it never caused any damage because the system has been evolved to deal with it. Ecuador just wants to go 100%.

Historically yes. Most people were too poor to own gold, silver is within the range where it is able to make purchases without being too heavy or too tiny to handle.

Seriously, if I can buy FOOD at a world wide restaurant chain, it would definitely be a game changer. This means someone can legitimately LIVE off Bitcoin in a literal sense, and world wide too.

Doesn't matter, hell if the US government is stupid enough to dump all their Bitcoins then I will definitely jump in and buy them.
People are just WAITING for the dips to enter the market. I don't know what you are so scared of if the US government intentionally screw themselves over by abandoning the coins they currently hold. If they want to lose a few billion dollars in the long run it is someone else's gain. You are confused if you think it matters if the US government dump their holdings; the coins are finite, this is not like QE where they can keep printing.

Why would the value be driven down? The size of the total number of Bitcoins didn't change. Doesn't matter who owns it. The only thing you CAN do is to destroy them, which decreases supply and increases value for everyone else.

If there is no demand, then what are you worried about? And if there is no demand, why are you caring if the government would dump their batch of Bitcoin or not? You are not making sense, mixing up terms used for the money that can be mass printed with money that can't be.
If Bitcoin is destined to fail, then the government wouldn't bother doing anything to it. If the Bitcoin has demand, then it doesn't matter what the government does because it can't do anything except stupidly throw away all the bitcoins it obtained from Silkroad. 
And why even bother with the drug market? The primary means of money transfer for drugs is the US dollar. It seems you are confusing fiat USD with Bitcoin. There is no equivalent of worthless Gold ETF the government can use to manipulate the price; the only thing they can do is by throwing their own Bitcoins away, and that matters not to the market at all.

It is my opinion that China would want the US dollar to stop being the world reserve currency, but China doesn't want to volunteer the Yuan as a replacement. If a politically neutral currency can replace USD globally, China would be able to hold on to their own Capital Controls and export power while not being victim to US monetary policy. At least that's my opinion of why they tolerate it.
