This is a song by Sir Crypt-a-lot
I like big blocks and I can not lie.  
You other miners can't deny.  
When transactions comes with an ity-bitty fee and block rewards for me 
I get sprung.   
Wanna pull up some!
Cause you noticed that block was stuffed!  
Deep in the chain we're cheering, 
I'm hooked and I can't stop swearing.  
Oh baby, I wanna get richa, take lambo pictures!
My accountant tried to warn me, 
but them blocks you got makes (me so horny).  
Ohhh Lumped transactions. 
You say you wanna take a ride to the moon?  
Well troll me, troll me, yobit, bittrex and polo me.
I see candles dancin.
sharp analization!
must vet, or get rekt
doin research like a turbo vet
I'm tired of magazing
sayin small blocks are the thing
Take the average troll man and ask him what
It's gotta pack much block
So trollas (yeah), trollas (yeah)
Has your crypto got big blocks (hell yeah)
Tell em fork it, fork it
Fork them healthy blocks
Baby got blocks!
I like 'em square, and big
And when I'm throwin' a bid
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get them cheap
And ugh, 10X, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout doge thou
cause silly coins are made for memes
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Crypt-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of this bubble
So I'm watch'n Youtube videos, 
wannabe noobs talkin' like pros. 
You can have them noobs, 
I'm boss like Nakamoto
A word to the alt coin mistas, 
I ain't tryna screw with ya, 
I won't cuss or diss ya, 
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fork! 
At the break of dawn, 
Segwit's got it goin' on. 
A lot of noobs won't like this song, 
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it, 
And I'd rather stay and HODL. 
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong, 
And I'm down to get the profit on. 
So, trolls (yeah) trolls (yeah) 
If you want to get a Mercedes (yeah) 
Then stay around, stick it out 
Even fed boys got to shout. 
Baby got block
