I mean it's on them. They know their setup better than you or I, they know what they are doing. 
They are a profit driven entity. If they are leaving money on the table they are being irrational.
Maybe they don't want to mine 5 sat/b because they want to drive up the lowest fee cost. That would make them a rational actor, actually.

the man with a mining cartel could be getting sicker asic chips
a tear should be shed ;(
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:56:39
It's funny because it would lead to nothing.
"Hey, I don't want to pay 5 sats to send a transaction, so lower your shit"
"I don't want to spend 6 sats worth of my electricity to mine your transaction, so raise your shit"
They already have all the economic incentive they need to decide if it is profitable for them to mine it or not. Asking them politely? Do you think they need to have good PR? Permissionless currency...
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:54:54
it's really not a loss, they mine the empty block and proceed onto the next block. block rewards are worth way more than fees
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:28:45
the concerning network security, as you put it, is because there is no competition for asics yet. SHA256 is a good hashing algorithim, but the shift to asics back in the day was because of bitcoin's popularity, not because of a weakness of SHA256. if bitcoin switched to equihash, you best believe people will be trying hard as fuck to make a new asic for it. why wouldnt they? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:54:41
It does make a bit of sense. Jihan Wu's cartel controls roughly 60% of the network's hash rate.
Now, even if they controlled 99.9%, eventually a 1 sat/b transaction would be confirmed by the .1% left over.
In this (strawman) example you can see that it would take an extreme amount of time for a 1 sat/b transaction, because of their extreme super majority. You knew that it would confirm when you sent it, but you also knew it would take atleast a couple of weeks, months, etc. 
Now change the numbers to 60% and 40%. the 1 sat/b transaction would be confirmed, maybe in days not months (like the 99.9% example), but it would still take longer than a 5 sat/b transaction. 
Even without 100% of the hash rate, they can absolutely incentive people to pay their minimum accepted rate.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:09:50
Sure, if you want to think that go ahead. I disagree because I know bitcoin is likely highly overvalued right now.
Thought experiment: Massive run on bitcoin, drives up prices to 5 million per bitcoin in 12 hours. It then crashes down to 25k per bitcoin in the next 12 hours.
It's still at an all time high pre crash...but it lost 99.5% of its value.
Yeah I'm going to say that timelines kinda matter.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:27:23
They want to set a price floor, it's a rational thing for them to do.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:37:05
which is why USDT is such a hilarious concept
Lets make a crypto that is tied to a fiat, because reasons, and not even prove that it is backed by this fiat. It's like worse than normal fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:30:19

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:39:03
I guess collapse is a subjective term huh? 
At this point I don't ever see bitcoin going below 2500 again. Anything below that, to me, is a crash.

Shut the fuck up.
I value my bitcoin far more than 10k per bitcoin. Until the market adjusts to what I value it as, I will hold my bitcoin.
Now if I want to use and replace, that is different. 
But don't act like people have to spend bitcoin for it to survive. It survives by just surviving.

A PoW fix by the community would have to have serious consensus. 
I hope it doesn't come to it but the community will absolutely go nuclear if it comes to that. 
As a programmer I am super curious to what the best fix for changing the PoW would be. After all a hard fork is pretty serious business. It takes a lot of work to get everyone agreed on a change. Like, I would want more than just a simple change to using cryptonight or equihash - I would want some kind of function where it could switch between different hashing algorithms on the fly

You might think so but i disagree
look at gold, to buy it you need to buy it above market price and to sell it you need to sell it below market price. If the price doesnt move at all in a year when you sell it you lost money. 
People still buy gold as a hedge, store of value not because it is easy to transact with but because its value is not tied to fiat.
As long as I have the ability to send a transaction from my cold storage, it has the same utility to me as someone that uses it everyday as a micro transaction.
as absurd as it sounds, bitcoin could absolutely survive with 100$ fees precisely because of how hard it is to get the community to adopt any kind of change. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:31:22
I think we as a community should send him some donations now that fees are so cheap

@_date: 2018-01-29 20:50:52
Yeah, to be fair that is absolutely true. But you know, every day more eth is mined and it leaves that ICO amount being less and less of a percentage of the total supply
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:55:05
Agreed. Blocksize increase in 2017 was not necessary
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:25:47
I realize why there are numerous opinions on what is best, but that is why we have discussion boards to argue it out. The reality is the best ideas will win on their merits. Blocksize increase will eventually be needed, but to pretend like it's needed now over payment channels and then SCREAMING IT from the rooftops just makes you seem ignorant.

3 is the most likely situation, but you assume that Tether has to be redeemable for USD. It does not. Everyone knows this, and I'm kinda surprised you have not seen that this is the case.
USDT is just a counterfeiting of USD but in a crypto.

@_date: 2018-01-30 17:46:15
Miners can make code changes - anyone can - but no one can force an update on me or you.
I don't mind voting on consensus by miners. If they all unanimously agree to a hard fork, generally speaking users will also. But, if users do not agree, we will have two chains. One with a lot of hash power, one without. The value will stay on the chain with little power...until the markets fix that and the hashing returns.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:41:50
You can be all snarky and pretend like this is the case but no retail investor in 2017 is buying bitcoin because they want to send micropayments

if you don't have access to an American bank account with USD you can use USDT. Most overseas people would fall under this
Tbh the idea of a USD coin is fine with me if it was actually redeemable for cash, like actual paper. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:35:16
Unless they are just trying to introduce a price floor
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:02:39
Question 1: Is it currently illegal for a bitcoin mining cartel to form and fix prices? 
question 2: should it be?
I think the answer to both is no. The cartel would have to have 100% of the cartel of the network's hash rate to completely enforce a price floor.
Without 100% hash rate someone else will mine them (eventually)
So this means they are either being irrational/incompetent by leaving money on the table, or rational by trying to form a pseudo price floor. I mean after all, the difference between 1 sat/b and 5 sat/b is 500%. 
I'm just saying there's really only so many reasons for them to be doing this..
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:39:48
Lol let the adults use the internet son
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:00:20
Uh how does that not matter? An asset exploded in value one year and crashed the next. That is not at all the same thing as a bubble inflating over years and years (because of sub prime lending) encompassing many financial instruments and derivatives like CDOs that tons of pension plans, 401ks, municipalities put money into. That's what caused the global economy to shut down.
And yeah... I know how percentages work. 
I don't know how long you've been in crypto, but I've been in long enough to expect a correction significantly lower than we are at now. We are still at an all time high circa december 2017...
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:28:40
And miners want them as expensive as possible. It seems like they have conflicting desires - because of course
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:04:50
but in this case diversifying for them would be to turn on some miners themselves 
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:55:33
Lol we all have taken basic economics. 
They are either doing it intentionally or not, right? If Jihan Wu tells his cartel to do it, it is likely for a reason.
They would want to set a price floor. The market sorts it out. If someone else wants to accept less than 5 satoshis, that is their choice. These cheap transactions would eventually be confirmed even if the cartel owned a super majority of the hash rate
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:33:04

my esxi host for my home lab has enough DDR2 slots for 128 gb (x7dwn+). thats ddr2, obviously super old.

Without any source I can dismiss the "most" claim.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:14:49
That's a cute way of saying it. 
I didn't misunderstand anything.  You made an apples and oranges comparison. I pointed that out. You tried to defend an indefensible position. Simple as that.
And now you hide behind the "the government is so strong bro! you don't even know" defense. Sad.
You have not acknowledged the valid points I made.
A court can prove a bitcoin address was funded by me. 
For them to impose any kind of penalty on me for not withdrawing the funds as ordered, they have to prove those funds are actually in my control. If you disagree with that, then I don't know what to tell you. No one is going to go to jail for not turning over bitcoins if the court cannot prove they own the means to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:24:38
lol its really not that easy to truly understand bitcoin
i have spent atleast 40 hours, at the minimum, reading about the protocol since 2013. i also had to research a lot into why central banked fiat currencies are a horrible idea
My friend james refused to buy in last year. hes been trying to get me to cash out all this year. he said he wont buy in now because its too much. i asked him what if it went up even more and he said the same thing - its up too much and he wont buy it
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:28:16
This is where you are clearly not thinking.
Think. How can I turn over bitcoins that I have no private key for? 
The court has to prove that the bitcoin are in my possession. 
Think about it. Type up your response, wait 5 minutes, and think it through this time.
But then again if you are unable to see the apples and oranges comparison you might not be intellectually capable of that.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:38:36
if you really think the government will be able to imprison people without proving they have the ability to turn over the bitcoin in their possession you are at the least incredibly ignorant 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:22:14

Coinbase will eventually get hacked. They are a bitcoin bank, i can't think of many bigger targets. I know for a fact that bitcoin deposits have a lloyds of london insurance policy on them. 
I'm not saying leave them in there forever. Im saying make sure you understand the more times you deposit into a bitcoin address realize you are making more inputs for you to later use when you go to empty it.
More inputs, more bytes for a transaction, more fees later.
I currently have like 2.5k on gemini. im going to get around to depositing it into cold storage soon

I won't be condescending and ask if you believe that the entire connection from my computer in the midwest to some asian server is fiber optics.
And no, obviously using the pacific communication cables would be faster but you can't always use those to connect to china or other asian countries. The european-american lines have significantly more capacity.

@_date: 2017-11-11 14:23:07
While i agree most users dont care about some protocol changes, they absolutely would care about something drastic like you proposed.
First In pretty sure that doubling the bitcoin supply would require more than a bip, pretty sure its a hard fork. Bips are still voted on by the miners. Lets imagine its a crazy bip that gives miners a ton of power. They vote for it 100% and it is implemented.
The users don't get a vote, right? no say in the matter? I disagree. They can leave the protocol. They can make a hard fork reverting to the original state and begin a new community without these asshole miners that were only thinking of themselves.
In many ways bitcoin already is the truest form of democracy. and while mob rule usually doesn't work, I feel like enough users collectively want bitcoin to succeed

I want trustless so i do run my own node. I can easily, i have a server stack in my house. Shit doesnt take up any extra space for me to allocate (potentially) terabytes purely for the blockchain. obviously not everyone can do this. if blocks were 100mb i probably couldn't even afford to do this. If you dont think that long list of whitelist SPV nodes will shrink with larger blocksizes you are in for a rude awakening. 
If you want to place trust into trezor hardware for a $10,000 transaction go ahead. I wouldn't send anything over $1,000 without an airgapped computer personally.
I personally wouldn't trust plugging any device like that into my phone unless I basically made it. but if you want to, feel free. You understand the risks you are taking. And obviously I was referring to a normal hot wallet, so you countering with a hardware wallet is more or less a strawman.

better analogy is this
the pilot is being told by some customers that the plane needs to take off now even during the storm. the pilot points out this storm is dangerous and that it makes the flight way less safe for everyone. Customers are angry and there is becoming a back log of flights. the smart pilots know that they have to wait out thse storm, or until some better solution presents it self.
some dumbass pilot tells everyone that he is going to fly anyway, and some people join them.
you focusing on technical details is, like i said, nitpicking code. I am a developer, i know how to nitpick code in reviews. blocksize is not just some insignificant technical detail.

Quit being so emotional, it is unbecoming.
Do you give a shit who develops the bitcoin code? Be honest. You don't. Code matters, not who made it.
Just like what I am saying...Just because core developers say to do something doesn't mean the userbase has to do it. They aren't elected. They hold no power over forcing protocol changes.
For a hard fork, the community has to be convinced of the changes needed. If you can't see what nick says as "shut up and do what we say" and how it is troublesome, well you need to step back and actually think about it.

I don't see why it's a bad thing to keep the wealth you accumulated. You could make your money work for you for the right investment, or not. Your dollars should not be worth less a year after you made them simply because of inflation. That's like basically taxing those that want to save their money. 
You haven't convinced me at all why high levels of savings are ACTUALLY a bad thing, as opposed to just something some people believe is bad for the economy. I can see why it's bad for the government - less exchanges of money will create less tax revenue for them. 
Money is cheap now, so people will invest because they *have to* just to keep their wealth worth the same.

Quoting the 2008 white paper in a 2017 discussion about scalability is nothing more than an appeal to authority at this point. I dont want to slander satoshi by pointing out the things he did not predict or even bother reading what he *could have* meant by that passage. Moving on..
SPV is great for many use cases. My webapp wallet on my phone.  A coke vending machine. An IoT fridge that wants to automatically order my groceries.
Notice a trend here? small devices that physically should not be expected to make big (valuable) bitcoin transactions. 
If you are suggesting that the vast majority of people should be willing to trust someone else's node to verify their bitcoin savings, well i dont know what to say besides the fact that bitcoin literally is based on being trustless.

The technical arguments the developers made for why they don't want to go the big blocks way was very strong and convincing to me. 
The FUD was not strong enough to convince the user base to switch to bitcoin cash, because the technical arguments were strong.
Ultimately the developers (or some representative, doesn't matter) have to convince people why a BIP or hard fork should be implemented. 
Would you rather we had an environment where a BIP could be implemented without a vote by the miners? 
what about a mystery protocol upgrade, you don't need to know what it is - just install it.

Then no offense but I don't think you have thought the blocksize debate out far enough. It's pretty clear to most that the biggest innovation of bitcoin is that it's a trustless currency and any increase of the blocksize will lead to a corresponding decrease in node count.
The fact that there is no auto-update function in the core software is proof enough that the core team is not owned by anyone. There is no way to force a protocol change on users.

I simply fail to agree with the keynesian view that saving is somehow bad for the economy. If there is nothing that I absolutely need to buy then why should I spend just to spend? if there are no investments that I find value in investing in, why should I? I should not be forced to spend my savings because of shitty monetary policy, I should be encouraged to do so with the right investment idea. Not because I had to just to fight inflation
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:15:52
Dropped packets are always of concern when we are talking about traveling great distances.  If they weren't a concern we could just send over UDP. That is obviously not going to happen.
I ran my ping for 342 send requests and received back 340 packets. 2 packets dropped, sure it's a .5% packet loss which is more than acceptable in most situations. But any packet loss is proof of why we have to use TCP for broadcasting a finished block. 
Ping statistics for 119.9.116.64:
    Packets: Sent = 342, Received = 340, Lost = 2 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 207ms, Maximum = 846ms, Average = 222ms
I understand that this is exactly why we have broadcast relay nodes. But again, my point is that increasing the block size will lead to more centralized mining for this latency reason.

Actually, I believe my claim was that the physical distance increases the time needed to transmit a block once it's been mined to the other nodes and that the larger blocksize shows this as an issue. My anecdote of being able to tell how far away a web server is based on physical location increasing the latency. 
How long does it take you to ping  I get around 200 ms on my work's connection. 
how do we establish if an ISP is 'bad peered'? 
Passed this, I don't know if currently a freshly mined block is transmitted in TCP or UDP. I would assume TCP. Am I incorrect?

The answer is they can hard fork and make their own blockchain.
but they can't because users won't use some bullshit blockchain that requires ridiculous fees. Users matter more than miners. It should be abundantly clear.

@_date: 2017-11-21 16:14:08
That is literally what they are doing. They don't have a bank account so they can't give you money anyway. So they give you bullshit USDT that actually can be withdrawn, giving you the illusion that they are solvent.

It is painful to read.
Don't get me wrong, i feel like the instant speed possible with a super cheap micropayment is something we should be striving for. It is absolutely not the most critical thing for bitcoin. Absolutely not. does it suck that users have to pick between cheap transactions and fast transactions? Yeah, its not that bad though.
it is just a fact that block sizes have to stay low for the currency to remain decentralized. Imagine if bitcoin was to filtered out of china's network by their government. Should we just say fuck china? fuck no, that's why we need to be able to use radio transmission and the block stream satellite to be able to broadcast the blocks. A small blocksize is just necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:40:40
this isn't even getting into the whole fact that the new blocks have to be transmitted over the network. at 1mb you don't see it be that bad.
ever connect to a Chinese website? shit takes forever, even on my gigabit connection. Do they just have shitty internet? No...the connection literally has to go across europe/africa to then cross the ocean to get to the united states. 
People think that storing big blocks is cheap because storage is cheap are being idiots. The Chinese miners will have a huge fucking advantage if they are able to make larger blocks. No one would be able to build the next block on the largest chain because it will take them so long to even get the block from china.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:05:05

it allows you to withdraw back into bitcoin when you want, it only subtracts the btc used to cover a coffee purchase when it is made
you load up 50 dollars onto this wallet once a week, sending it with a low sat/b fee because you don't care if it gets there in 12 hours or 24 or whatever
they already own the private keys, so when you make the purchase they just subtract it from their database showing what amount you still are able to withdraw from their wallet app

Not that I disagree, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's impossible to manipulate the exchange rate. Bittfinex could just post a bunch of bullshit transactions and move the price on their exchange.

I'm not really talking about lowering the blocksize from 1mb. It certainly is small. I am referring to the people that think increasing 1mb to 8mb or greater is not a big deal.
At 1mb the latency issue I am talking about is, more or less, non existent. Maybe it is something you can observe at a tiny tiny insignificant level.
But at 10mb? 100mb like fake satoshi wants? I think you and I agree that we would see some issues there.

from the bitcoin wiki
"Bitcoin already has some built-in quantum resistance. If you only use Bitcoin addresses one time, which has always been the recommended practice, then your ECDSA public key is only ever revealed at the one time that you spend bitcoins sent to each address. A quantum computer would need to be able to break your key in the short time between when your transaction is first sent and when it gets into a block. It will likely be decades after a quantum computer first breaks a Bitcoin key before quantum computers become this fast."

a 1MB file is undoubtedly small for most conventional uses. that is like a 15 second video clip.
a packet lost here or there isnt important for an FPS game. for a finished block...it is obviously a huge deal. which is my whole point.
So again back to my question, do you know if blocks are sent in TCP or UDP? I have to imagine it is TCP, but i dont know for sure. and we again are back to why latency matters. a bigger block than 1mb will proportionally  make proximity to the latest mined block more and more relevant.

Where did the post originally say to rely on coinbase as a wallet permanently? 
literally a quick start.
do you think it is likely that coinbase gets hacked at this point? I would think them going evil and stealing funds is way more likely at this point

In your example bitcoin wouldn't even be forever pwned. You even outlined what the community would have to do to un-pwn it.
You literally just explained why the miners don't get to decide consensus. It's kind of baffling how you are unable to understand that they are beholden to the users in just about every way.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:54:26
the only way for people to accept this alternative route requires...consensus 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:57:00
If the majority of reddit users' opinion is indicative of the bitcoin community at large, it most certainly is consensus. 
Consensus relies on what the users want more than anything. The users make value for the miners to value.
If you refer to the reference of nodes in the white paper, well I just hope you realize better.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:47:19
You are fundamentally misconstruing the issue here.
No one is saying it is physically impossible to dupe some poor sap into BUYING your tether from you, for whatever rate he sees fit. People were buying mtgox coins that were unable to be withdrawn, speculating that one day they will be able to withdraw them.
If a USDT coin is tied to a dollar in a bank account, it is supposed to be withdrawn from tether directly. It is supposed to be converted to USD and transffered from tether's bank account to user's bank account. This action is supposed to result in the amount of USDT being destroyed since it not longer has that backing.
If you don't understand how that is different than selling a USDT to someone else, then I don't know what to tell you.

They will point to the SPV section of the white paper and say that satoshi thinks the users don't need to run nodes, that this isnt what he intended

The initial wording was that no one can withdraw their USDT for USD. Which they can't. you are the one that said exchanged.

Bitcoin isn't a coin that is supposed to be redeemable for anything. It is not backed by anything other than itself. So no, you can't 'cash out' your bitcoin without selling it to someone in exchange for USD.
USDT is supposed to be redeemable for USD.

I am not some dumbass big blocker that buys into the cult of personality around bch and segwit2x. But to me this comment from nick is very troubling. 
We know that the arguments to split off from the core chain are mostly full of hot air and bullshit conspiracies. LN and off chain settlement layers are the only way (I can see) for how to expand the network capacity without adding a centralizing risk. A permanent increase to the block size is something we should be looking at as the absolute last possibility. 
I know nick realizes this, but the Bitcoin community has to be who is convinced to accept a protocol change. Miners don't decide it. Developers don't decide it. I like nick. He is very smart. Even if we found out he was really satoshi, I dont care. His proposed protocol changes have to stand up on their own. We don't have a leader for a reason.

I have been buying bitcoins for years. you can buy any amount of bitcoin. currently the protocol allows you to transfer as little as .00000001, which is fractions of a penny. it takes a while to get verified on coinbase or gemini so you should get that started asap. Use 2 factor authorization to access the exchanges. I recommend you look into paper wallets to store it for yourself. 
On coinbase you should setup automatic buying. I would start out with buying a hundred or 200 for your initial investment and then invest 50-100 every paycheck so you can dollar cost average and ride the peaks and valleys.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:21:32
What if JP morgan, goldmans, etc said fuck bitcoin and bought enough mining power that put everyone else to shame? 99% of the market is owned by them. 
Do they get to decide the future of bitcoin?
The white paper is clear on this, that the nodes (he really means miners at this point) would only accept blocks that they deem acceptable. If something deviates from what is acceptable (hard fork away from them) it is ignored. Even with 99% of the miners hard forking away from bitcoin, the 1% that is left with the ruleset that the users want will be is used going forward.
BigBankBlockChain will continue on its own chain while what the users want will continue on the original chain. Miners have no absolutely NO ability to force the users to do what they want. They decide for themselves. If users want to go along, then they will. If not, they don't. Simple as that.

Its pretty simple to see why a miner would have economic incentive
first we know bitmain really owns closer to 60% of the hash rate, so spamming would only cost 40%
if the network is currently at 98% capacity, spamming to bring it over to 101% will raise the average fee because now there will be a true market to get your transaction in the next block.
Lets imagine the average fee is 50 sat/b, they then spam the mempool full of 45 sat/b transactions. they will most likely not be confirmed quickly, but anyone that sees the tx count for that particular fee will see now that 46 sat / b is essentially the "floor" for what would confirm quickly, encouraging them to use a fee higher than 45 sat/b. This will compound and the average fee will raise over time. With the appropriate conditions, these miners could manipulate the market to raise the average fee.
As far as why its not happening anymore, that's a hard question to answer. Obviously i am not them so i can only speculate .
But with the major exchanges implementing batching, the transaction count has been steadily dropping. Remember, this is ultimately a function of network use vs capacity. Dropping the network usage to 97% of the network would have profound implications on the cost of using spam to drive up the average fees 
Maybe this isnt happening, but it totally makes sense to me and would be rational for the miners to do what they could (when they can) to raise fees.
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:44:51
Double spending is still not possible.
waiting for a enough confirmations still would make the 51% attack sufficiently expensive to discourage it from being practical at all. the average user does not have to worry about a 51%
at this point only nation states should worry about it
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:17:28
yeah I'm not surprised.
You made a wild assumption and look like an idiot now. 
you're probably pretty dumb so this shouldn't be surprising to you
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:36:30
Something to keep in mind,
After goku got his ass kicked on namek by captain ginyu he had to go into a medical machine to heal.
My point? just because his power level was over 9000 didn't mean it would never fall under 9000...
And we know that on namek his power level went over a million after that.

@_date: 2018-02-27 22:35:52
not true at all. with a 51% mining attack the only thing that can happen is deny all transactions except certain ones the malicious actor wants 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:31:08
Not at all. I dont give a single shit about people that piss their money away on shitty get rich quick schemes. People wise up or they stay poor.

I dont think this is something we can count on, at all
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:20:23
Okay, ill play along.
what evidence would be sufficient to you?
email logs?
proof of quid pro quo?
a remark stating that this transaction was malicious in nature?
my circumstantial evidence goes with the time line. spamming started right before coinbase released bcash for sale. at another point the spam stopped after the NYA.
Beyond that. do you argue that the miners do not have financial incentive to use spam to drive up the average cost?
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:07:03
Yeah, honestly the only altcoin that i believe cant be a sidechain is monero. 
but again monero, like litecoin, could only ever be a complement to bitcoin not a substitute. Monero actually increases the value of bitcoin if you ask me

I will explain in a way you should be able to understand. 
Everyone has biases. This isnt whataboutism. It is important to know someone's bias. I start all arguments in a formal discussion by mentioning my biases that I know of. RT, in your words, is just an extension of putin. 
Does this mean everything RT says is automatically false? No, it doesn't. It means when they talk about something like Putin's favorability polls, we automatically know to think it's bullshit. 
Another example. When al jazera talks about Israel we all know that it is bullshit and can be largely ignored. When they talk about issues in Venezuela, do we immediately dismiss it out of hand? Probably not
It shouldn't bother you that people can see past the brand name and think for themselves

basically a future is an agreement to buy/sell a financial asset for a length of time at a designated price
on jan 1 2018 you and i agree that I will sell you oil at 75$ a barrel for all of 2018. If the price of oil goes up to 95$,  you win. if it goes down to 55$, I win. 
The price and length of the agreement are up to the contract.
USO is an etf that buys and sells month long futures of oil. So basically they have to sell their futures at the end of each month and buy the new ones at the beginning. Based on that, it effectively tracks the price of oil.
