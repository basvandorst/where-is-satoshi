[Yup, there's a wallet for Bitcoin now in the app!](

Not to spread FUD but this is just my speculation after being in this since June.


Yeah and thats one thing BTC cant handle just yet. As we've seen, exchanges crash. They all did at the same time last week.
Another point is that the new people coming in know nothing about BTC other than, "Oo look at the price go up and up! Time to buy!" They will be the first ones to sell when it drops 5%.
From my point of view, the tech is there and everything but its not ready for this kind of adoption yet.

People do just forget too. I don’t make that much and even I get surprised when i find money in an account that I forgot about. I bought potcoin a while back and just realized that I had left it staking since July haha I took it off Blockfolio because I swore I sold it. Forgetting or breaking your phone is pro hodling.

Hate that I can't withdrawal for 4 or 5 days though

If they do, it's like them having a picture of my balls without actually getting to touch them. Idc who sees them but I'm picky of who gets to fondle them.

Had the chance to buy in at 1800 last month, didn't because I thought it would go a bit lower. Look where were at now haha 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:42:43
It honestly wouldnt do much but give us more of an opportunity to buy in at a lower price

So even if the split were to happen or whatever, bitcoins would be safe in any wallet? I noticed there are certain wallets that support it and that don't support it. Just unsure if that matters.

Which wallet would you recommend?
