Any bit of help is appreciated. I will donate later if ai can take back my SIC
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:58:40
Thank you for support. I opened a ticket. Waiting. 
And no, I did not sell any SIC. Just bought. There was no wallet at the time so I left them on Coinexchange. I have photos of trading history and withdraw history. 
I saw someone posted that they anounced they will convert SIC into SWC but on telegram.. Well I don’t have telegram. They should have send me a message in Coinexchange or something.. It is very frustrating when you know you can miss so much money. It was like I hit the jackpot.. And now I have no choice but to stick with fu..ing SWC  which is not even on coinmarket

that is great news than. Go for it whatever it takes. I feel that the guys behind localbitcoin are abit dodgy. I had my small altercation with them about a user. They seem not to care to much. Maybe they want to keep your bitcoins. Is alot of money

So do they charge €10000-€15000 just to work on your case? Or do they guarantee you to win the case for that sum? I am curious

For the dip !!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:01:33
It does not affect the dollar in this situation because of the nature of bitcoin which is anonymous. So the FED can print money and buy BITCOIN as much as they want and they could not care if the price is to high for them. As long as there are available bitcoins to buy. 
My point is that it is not fair . We can't afford to buy with money made on a fuucking printing machine... It is just a thought. But it is possible right? As long as you have unlimited fiat currency. what can stop you?!
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:15:59
hahahahaa . Hope this is legit
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:29:58

Appreciate the effort. I am an ordinary guy. And I managed to buy at least 1 btc few years ago. Is not that hard to own 1 btc for the common men.  Not to mention all exchanges where you can buy btc. I mean it is like all this exchanges have infinite bitcoins. They never run out of btc's.. LocalBitcoin again. Full of users selling btc's. And there are different users in different countries. Just add that up to the sum. I just have this thought in my mind that there are more bitcoins than we are aware of..
Anyways is just my thought. I wanted to share it with the world. Maybe I learn something new. And yes I know about the block chain . But maybe there are more block chains interconnected.. Dunno. I'm not IT specialist

Maybe I was just wondering on my laptop and saw that on google. Have you thought about that thin head? Seems that the biggest problem in your tiny  skull is why I didn't screenshoot the photo. OMG :)

I want to be the first to trick or treat some bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:17:38
why not?
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:52:47
I agree with you. But all have allies and there is like a chain reaction. If NK or America starts with that fucken Nuclear attack, Russia, China, France, Germany, will follow probably . I think Russia can't wait for that spark. And China is most propaply with Russia. Europe is in the middle. I don't even want to think about it..

was 3300 just a month ago. Is just stupid to think it can go to 100k in one run. Simple
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:00:45
I have seen that all over the supermarkets where there is a machine to top up your phone sim card . They added bitcoin. But I would never use that. I assume is a rip off. I use LocalBitcoin and Coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:32:43
True. On mid long term.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:31:34
I was thinking the same. But now is just to late to buy anymore. The price is too high:). I will wait for the dip and buy separate btc and btgold
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:59:46
isn’t it halving in 2024?
