I was bummed out when they were forced to no longer offer Interac e-transfers as a payout method.

If you're using bitcoins as a currency instead of an investment, you should be turning them to cash as soon as you get them to avoid this. If I am selling something like t-shirts for bitcoins, as soon as I receive bitcoins I'd be cashing them to hard currency as soon I get them. Easier for me in Canada as I can use cavirtex.com to sell and get interac cash transfer directly to my bank account for a 1.50 fee.

The market I use was up through the whole mtgox fiasco. If I had some disposable income that I could afford to lose, I'd buy because I think things will pop back up. The fact that it's still in the double digits I think shows people still have some confidence in bitcoins.

I confirm that this is a great exchange. I only changed 3 bitcoins to cash but the process was easy, and I felt comfortable every step of the way. I've been using Interac cash transfers via e-mail for a while now with other sources and I am thrilled to be able to use it with bitcoins.

I agree, it's freaking great.

 is who I've been using. I've only cashed out a whopping 3 bitcoins but it was handled from bitcoins to cash in my account with no divulging of information other than my e-mail address in less than 2 hours.
