I asked the other day if he'd done one yet. I guess this is my answer.

It's currently 18.9594499btc which is at this moment ~$11,923 not $200k.

I general I would normally agree with this as it's certainly the case across the board in that 'industry'. I too wasn't particularly impressed with the questions, I'm just passing on info that should hopefully help verify the validity of his IRC chat.

The term 'goxxing' or to be 'goxxed' should be entered in the OED. It could be extended to an adjective aswell. Someone who's a bit 'goxly' would be someone shady / dodgy / likely to steal.

Hi Jimmy, 
I donate to Wiki anyway but will happily up the amount if you include btc as a payment method.
FWIW: I would have a play around with your own wallet first and get a good feel for bitcoin. I'm sure after spending some time using it you'll be of the opinion that it can only be good.

Just wondered where you're at... be good if you can have a user submission part to save having to manually update it. Should be straightforward enough to police it for abuse.

Would having a Qcode on the donation page *really* deter donors? I think those who are bitcoin aware would know what it is straight away while those who aren't familiar with it would just ignore it surely? 
Definitely worth introducing it with social media first though.

Indeed. This is part of the psychology behind decent landing pages when doing IM. Funnel them through a tree using only 2 - 3 options at most each time until then end up in the right place. To accept bitcoin and remove confusion would probably only take a few steps of this at most I would imagine.

I believe it has done far more than that. It is merely the beginning and yet it has demonstrated how decentralization works in the real world in actual physical and practical ways. It is the start of people waking up to the concept that they have been slaves all this time. 
I'm by no means a 'libertarian' in the extreme sense but do think that we, the people, have relinquished far too many personal freedoms until now. 
The Blockchain concept is the breakthrough and bitcoin is the vehicle delivering the message to all.

I use the term 'lawyer' as a generic term, it will have to be a serious team in reality. Would be perfect if they were part of the bitcoin community already. ;)
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:10:43
The reason I want a physical metal 'paper wallet' is to make them aware that it has a value. Although they are my lawyers I don't think they'd see a bit of paper the same way as they would a metal coin. (Actually one is a junior and probably more open to the idea but you hopefully get what I mean) - it's symbolic more than anything. 
I sincerely hope that if I give these next week, they will start thinking about crypto-currency and become aware of it, and perhaps the value will rise by a good amount within a year or so. As they start following the markets they will start talking about it with friends, relatives, colleagues etc. and introduce more people to it.
.The metal coin itself is there to make it something they don't lose. ;)

Ah - hadn't thought of ebay. I suppose I can verify the value if I know the wallet address before purchasing, but I'm wary of buying it and in the time it takes to send it to me the seller transfers the coin to another wallet.

This is awesome. So glad to see others saved by bitcoin. I was homeless for about 6 months after losing my job and divorce. Homeless and penniless. My only possession was my laptop and for the first few weeks I stayed at different friends. I mined coin (this was way back when they was cheap and easy to mine). Only managed a tiny amount but then the value went up and namecheap started accepting bitcoin. So I found a coupon for $0.99 domain, I bought a domain with btc and set up a website on a free host. The site generated me much better income than I could mine for with my laptop - It is now my only source of income!
Bitcoin saved me when I was homeless too!
