Ahhh he is community manager - I missed that and thought he was part of the management. In case of C-levels I think linkedin is hardly a personal thing as you are representing a company as well. In this case I see the point.

“This is my personal linkedin and not related to work” - WTF?:D Isn’t linkedin kinda always related to work?

Not of their accounting system but how things work with banks and businesses in EU area. You do not call bank to see if the transaction came in. You have your software or bank software where you can see transactions when they are posted to your account. Usually bank processes postings twice a day - once in the morning and once in the afternoon. If it is not posted then it is not in your account and you really cant call bank and say "hey I‘m missing 5k in my account where is it?".
IBAN is the account number - basically "what is the account the money should go to". If you put iban in the notes as well it doesen‘t affect anything as that is more of a reference. 
If it is any help with foreign payment form in my bank I see:
IBAN, BIC/Bank code, Name and address of the destination bank (this i where the money is going).
then there is a divider and says (your name, address, zip country, purpose - here you would include reference number or a description of what you are sending or in your case "invoice payment [client ID]")
So technically if you put the correct IBAN in the IBAN field and missed client id or just put iban in agan in the notes they could have money in their account and not be able to match it to your account.
p.s. I said I agree with their communication being sub-pair, but I wouldn‘t blame them if they missed IBAN typo because you did as well :)
edit: check the IBAN from the IBAN field with this and you can see if it exists and where. IBAN by itself contains all routing information and it is very easy to check if there was a typo in IBAN but depends if your bank does this:

Probably because that is more recognized source compared to Kraken? I dont know. Also if this with Kraken happened now, it shouldnt anymore in the future.

Interesting. Im paying directly via EPS for bitcoin (taking money directly from checking account and sending it to another/exchange ) and no issues whatsoever, but this is in EU.  
To be honest in your case I would take my money elsewhere although I really wonder what they are afraid of - legal problems, opening credit line to you etc. 
Edit: if people doing forex trading have the same problem there would be something :)

Never knew that internet bubble caused 2008 recession. Silly me thought that recession was the cause of that price drop in the graph. Oh well... 2 graphs fit, must be cause and effect.

What was the possible mistake? To be honest I would never know good international payment from shit with al the routing numbers and what not. 
As a business you are not calling your bank for transactions - you have a list updated once or twice a day that your accounting manages. 
I think they could have better service but you were still not a good customer to work with as they wont and cant do investigation into your transaction.

I think that the whole blacklisting thing is really brought up whenever somebody thinks there is something sinister happening when its just business as usual or shitty service(not limited to banking). If there is a rational reason why they would be blacklisting people using bitcoin I could be persuaded. Lets be honest, bitcoin community is a home to a lot of conspiracy theorists, sov cit., type people.   You got large deposit, somebody flagged it for money laundering, terrorism suspicion etc.  they were checking it but obviously couldn't tell you anything about reasons. I was working in a sector where we were processing credit cards. When there was a fraud issue it was never "fraud investigation" it was "checking supply", waiting for bank confirmation etc.
