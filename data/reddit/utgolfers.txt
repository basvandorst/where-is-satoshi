You know shorting but not longing? Same thing as buying, just in futures format.

How about forks? Is that treated as a dividend upon which taxes are required or as like a stock split with a cost basis adjustment?

Someone linked this which I hadn't seem before and is a useful read:
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:17:51
Thank you.  Please reread the first sentence of my post where I explicitly said nothing stated was advice.  I was hoping someone more knowledgeable could make corrections where necessary.

FBAR isn't really onerous at all, so maybe best to just submit it?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:07:29
Yes you can.  
I think his point is that he wants his world to be denominated in bitcoin instead of USD, not that he can't deduct losses.  But of course the tax authority is going to deniminate everything in their currency.  If he were the tax authority then sure he could do that, get rid of the FRB, etc. but not how the world works now.

There's two different reporting requirements: an exchange's and yours.  That Q&amp;A refers to where the exchange needs to provide information.  A taxpayer, though, doesn't have a lower limit on what income and capital gains they need to report when submitting taxes.

If you have a short, you are betting on the price to go down. If instead it goes up, you either have to post more cash to the exchange or close the position. These show the latter case happening, weak hand shorts giving up for now.

Conspiracy to commit fraud or the like.

It's monthly, but you can just roll it forward to the next month.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:03:23
Thanks.  How about these two:
Fork distributions
Transaction fees (i.e. is that considered a conversion to fiat/purchasing a good or  service upon which cap gains would be due on the appreciation?)
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:25:22
I would think that your basis for the new coin is determined by its fair market value at the time of the fork and that the basis of the original coin is adjusted by that amount similar to a stock split, but like I said it could also get dividend treatment (which is I suppose your "found" category), or maybe another way...  It seems like a different sort of activity to mining and that including it as income would not be the right way to think about it, but ya I guess we'll see.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:07
If the allegations are true, that is prosecutable as fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:54
Not really.  Unless you pay withholding installments or otherwise extra withholding from your normal paycheck, you're likely going to have to pay a fine to the IRS since you underpaid by a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:00
Yup definitely agreed, or both.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:59:53
I was thinking about treating it like split property &amp; reducing the cost basis of BTC by the day 1 traded value of Bcsh and using that same level as the cost basis of the Bcsh.
The whole thing seems like a mess from a tax perspective.  Hopefully the IRS will publish some more guidance soonish...
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:55:09
Do you have a reference on that statement?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:03
That's a great thread.  Thanks for digging up.  I think a lot of people have probably not realized the  if they've used a foreign domiciled exchange to buy and sell.  That was the main reason I used coinbase since it seemed to be sitting in the US physically and wouldnt' trigger an FBAR requirement.
Have you found anything about how to treat forks?   Specifically with Bcash, does that get treated like a stock split where we need to adjust the BTC basis down and use the day1 bcash price for its basis, like a dividend where taxes would be use on that this year even if we haven't sold either yet, or in some other way?  What about with coins sitting on Coinbase where it wouldn't be distributed until 2018?

Losses can be taken as a deduction against your gross income, though.  Capped at $3k I think it is but able to be carried over.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:57:47
No.  It's still the taxpayer's responsibility.  There was a bill to exempt exchanges to fiat under $600, but it hasn't gone anywhere yet.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:25:28
Makes a big difference, though.  If it's a dividend, taxes would be due this year while if it's a split of property into lots, then bases need to be adjusted but no taxes until it's sold.  I think...
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:14:47
Gains were realized on 0.2 of the original purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:50
Yes although it would probably be more like conspiracy to commit fraud than insider trading I would guesss.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:30:39
A deflationary store of value is already a great application as a hedge against fiat-denominated assets. 
With how much the price has increased and transfer fees being denominated in coins rather than fiat, it's not really practical for small transaction until some of the new development efforts come online.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:57:04
No, if in the US you definitely have a tax obligation on capital gains from bitcoin to fiat (or services).  Read the irs guidance: 
For bitcoin to other crypto, you in my opinion likely also have an obligation per their Q&amp;A although this could potentially fall under a 1031 exclusion.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:09:48
Yes, banks are using the tech of bitcoin, blockchain, and it's been under development for longer than a year. One of the avenues is for example loan settlements which take about a month.
That said, a lot of the projects underway look like they could be just as easily solved by a list.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:37:17
Yup, unless you're not entirely successful or act alone.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:03:47
You can claim losses as a deduction to your gross income.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:49:47
Regarding Type 5, I don't agree that this would create infinite tax liability.  The total cost basis in my example remains constant at $300.  Whether that's all in one coin or split into 20 (or in 2 like in my example with one being -$100 and the other $400), the cost basis is constant.  And then you just apply whatever you sell it for against each of those individual cost bases.
Or did you mean liability as a reporting liability?  I agree that would be a complete PITA to have to sort out and keep track of bases for very low value shitforks.

Someone asked the following as well:


If you sold them for services, that should be a taxable event.  If you transferred them to a wallet and then lost that wallet, I think that could be taken as a capital loss (i.e. a deduction up to a limit against your gross income).  I do not know enough about how the audit process works to know how difficult that will be to prove what happened.


This is Action Type 3 described in my post.  I think it is addressed by Q6 in the IRA FAQ, but there is still some uncertainty if that could instead qualify for the 1031 exclusion.


[Buy a boat?](  Like it or not, capital gains is part of the US tax system we have at the moment that you are bound to comply with as a US citizen.  Yes, though, I think if you figured out how to put crypto into a IRA, then you would either not have to take capital gains (for a Roth IRA since that is with post-tax money) or only upon withdrawal (traditional IRA).

This is pretty typical from him, though, with his opinions on stocks changing pretty rapidly also.  It's just the style.  He's no hodler.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:50:13
But the fees are expressed in crypto itself rather than in $ lije a brokerage fee. Does that fee amount then constitute a sale of crypto for a good or service upon which a CG tax would be relevant (on just the fee amount)?
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:03:28
Moving from one account to another is not a taxable event.  If your on-exchange coins were overseas, you will probably need to complete the FBAR requirements for offshore accounts (especially if &gt;$10,000).
Also, hijacking for a related question:  how does the new taxable basis work for BTC &amp; BCH?  My best guess is that we can reduce our BTC taxable basis by the value of the BCH at the split and then the new BCH gets that starting basis.  
So just for illustration purposes let's say you bought BTC at $1000 and will sell it after the fork at $3000, and BCH's initial price is $300.  Should you report a capital gain of $2300 ($2000 plus the reduction in basis from the new BCH)?
Anyone confirm / know what price to use for the new BCH if that's the case?

You coat your hands with a mixture of flammable liquid plus a lipid so the fire stays away from your skin &amp; quickly burns itself out.  The layering is skin, lipid buffer, flammable liquid.
Don't try it unless you know what you're doing.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:22:43
Well done.  Remember to declare the mined amount as income.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:32:09
For the least taxes, hold until it's worth zero. ;)

Can you explain please the fbar requirements related to paper wallets?  For example,
1) withdrawn while overseas
2) withdrawn while in the US but took paper wallet overseas
3) withdrawn while in the US and left paper wallet here but had the seed memorized and went overseas
4) purchases/sales from a US-based exchange made while physically overseas
Probably missed some possibilities, but those were the ones that came to mind.
Also, you mentioned US tax laws, but any idea how UK remittances would work in the case of the above scenarios for a UK resident non-domiciled US citizen?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:45:10
Under your second stated option, does that mean you need to reduce the cost basis of the parent coin by the same amount?  (Even if it means that the cost basis would be ... negative?!)
Example:  bought 1 BTC at $20, received 1 BCH on Aug 1st at $275, so the cost basis for BCH sales is $275 and the cost basis for BTC sales is -$255?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:10:30
So BCH needs to be reported in 2017 taxes as income but with zero basis?  Even if it has some value?  Any chance you know of a legal opinion written discussing that because it sounds odd. Presumably it would have some value when it is issued (albeit illiquid to quantify and perhaps fleeting), so that sounds wrong to me to report it as zero income...  If it has value, though, that should be able to be subtracted from the basis of BTC.  What you're describing is just conceptually very different from how for example a stock split works, so I'd love to read a legal opinion if you know of one.
My question about moving funds is related to the UK remittance rules, not the US tax code.  Sorry if that wasn't clear, but I've only ever seen "remittance" as a thing in the UK for non-domiciled individuals.
