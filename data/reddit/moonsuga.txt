actually i didn't think of that. I will say Windows phones are doing very well internationally. That is something to consider, and thanks for that tip.

How are you going to go around without using existing infrastructure to connect to the internet... is this a scam?
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:03:29
this looks really promising. reading the requirements, i think its not ready for an iOS 7 device.

can someone eli5, how does one become a Core developer for Bitcoin?

exactly. im pro as well, but you know how the feds feel about it currently. rather not see coinbase go down the tubes over it.

well even gladder that I'm mining them :)

they labeled it as "wrong subreddit" when it clearly wasn't. a 4000+ upvoted thread disappeared from and hence didn't make the front page where the world gets notified on stuff like this.

understood and you have a good stance there.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:42:55
well that was to keep the price high. if they had a problem with it, the price would indicate that.

aww man thanks for the tip. I have no idea how to set that up.

this is going to sound bad of me, but im turned off that the nexus is plastic based. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:30:07
the reason i mention the htc one is that it actually looks very sexy and appears to be made of metal alloys. i know it sounds bad but i dont like the idea of a plastic based phone.

@_date: 2014-02-04 19:44:00

I am really saddenned with 's choice to censor this news. However, the most successful post I can find is on Upvote that and get it to Reddit's front page. This is a big deal.

my only concern is coverage, but i've read that tmobile does well in SF. I got a text from AT&amp;T saying I'm eligble for a new phone with additional 2 year contract....

Other than that, just remember than BFL already sells these ASIC Miners for bitcoin and they have a very, very shitty reputation in terms of customer service and deliveries. It kinda sucks because once Asics come into play, GPU miners become essentially worthless... and the Asic companies themselves suck too.

sadly you can't get a statement like this if you call Chase and ask.
So you have to take this post with a big grain of salt... but it's not unlike a big bank to do something like this. we should all get credit union accounts just to be safe.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:24:16
OK, looks cool. But if it is for Mac then I would say unless you have an ASIC plug/play, you're going to melt your mac with GPU mining. am I wrong though?

thats just one address to your wallet. you can create more and label them specifically if you want to organize who pays you on what address. it is not your "account number", but just one way someone can pay you

I'm reading that it only applies to people with saving in accounts over the insured amount. So for example, if FDIC insures 250k, and I don't have that much, nothing happens, right?.... :(

as opposed to a bail-out, its a bail-in. i hate reading news like this because it makes me want to pull all my cash out of chase immediately. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:11:55
I was hoping I was wrong! I'd love to let my mac work for me while I am away.. but pretty sure mining on it will overheat it, melt it and not be worth the power it would take to mine.

Well, the only thing I see potentially worth investing in is LTC.. but I don't know a whole lot of places that are accepting it as payment yet. 
Or are you asking about fiat currencies? I would simply argue that the fact they are being printed like crazy every month is a good reason not to invest in them.

I know this won't help, but others have made similar mistakes.. with way bigger amounts of BTC... thousands, tens of thousands of dollars gone in a second. I know $80 is a lot for you, but this is a good lesson to learn early on. Take a break and bitcoins will be waiting for you when you return.

i'm more afraid a company like that, or a govt, would invest billions into mining infrastructure to mine the rest..

I would love to actually give away BTC on cute lil BTC shaped flash drives or whatever... can anyone help me out with that?

your site is way too laggy. I tried creating an account. I didn't get passed it because I didn't have a long enough password, but now you're saying that my email is already in use...

exactly. sickening!

exactly why it isn't a threat. BTC users don't want bank involvement, period.

not sure if you're being sarcastic but I pretty much have to agree with you. CNN, NYtimes, Mainstream media in general don't have the balls to conduct REAL journalism anymore.. i.e. ask tough questions

I am guessing.. nothing.

So no Samsung then.. Nexus is way to go? I'll look into it for sure. I'm getting bored if iPhone anyway, I've had them for years. iOS7 sucks too.

please, not sure if there is a rule, but linking an article that's paywalled kinda sucks :(

I vote we buy a small island in the Virgin Islands. 
Long live Bitcoinia!

What's my country like? (United States)
