You should Chechen how much electricity, paper, and other resources wasted by ATM machines to serve banking system. It is thousand times more than mining operations 
@_date: 2018-09-01 05:51:26
5 cents 
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:51:08
No, ordinary one
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:05:33
We provide hosting services, just sent your miners to Kazakhstan 
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:24:05
No, you see that we made isolation of hot air coming from miners with special wall, that has holes in it for exactly each ASIC’s fan to suit
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:21:45
Yes, please do. That’s sounds fun)
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:19:46
Yes, exactly 
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:25:52
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:30:22
Yes very noisy, you can’t just put them in your house)
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:25:35
You should try with 5 or 10 ASICs, which can be bought from us. And then we can provide you hosting services only for 0,05$ per kw/h all included. That is the easiest and fastest way to start
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:21:17
No, that’s not Tesla walls. Those are for isolation of hot and cold sections. We use fuel based electricity. Total cost is 5USD cents per kw/h
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:23:03
Yes, soon will show more facilities and now our own container for mining in production. We provide turn key solutions for mining operations here. So any wine interested can contact me and buy some mining equipment 
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:53:27
Much more
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:18:37
Electricity cost + all other costs = 60$ per ASIC per month. What we do to reduce, acquiring new locations with lower electricity cost. They are very noisy, you can’t hold em in leaving room. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:45:15
Well done, also some boxes out of photo reach
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:40:18
Yeah but in our case, temperature is good, and no need of under clocking
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:19:29
Those are antminer s9 and s9i. You need to buy one to check, I guess
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:11:13
And coal energy 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:34:58
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:25:16
Who are you dude? What are doing on reddit? Go and do commanding 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:34:07
I hope �� one day it will come true
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:27:47
You can visit our office, but what is a purpose of visit?
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:28:09
Yes Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:33:41
Wow! What a nice offer. Tell me what can you help with? Maybe I will find something for you
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:20:15
Nice! Cheers!
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:27:08
We pay 60$ per miner per month. Expected ROI with these exchange rate is 14-16 months for new antminer s9i
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:06:22
Why do you think mining difficulty increase, you think giant companies investing in mining just for fun and to support network. It’s strictly business, everything is already calculated and taking into account risks, profits still very attractive. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:55:09
Thanks, next facility comes without power supplies, will directly plug cable. Anyway thanks for advice. Where is your facility? Which country?
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:43:33
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:22:26
Only 12 countries in the world for now, which are financially positive for mining
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:41:15
Yeah it was always like that. Thank you mate, uploaded new one, check it 
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:10:06
Come and say hello to our security with guns ��

@_date: 2018-08-27 03:55:48
Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:29:15
No we use BTC pool and Antpool 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:21:35
Not someone, millions of us, hodlers 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:03:15
Bro it’s still profitable. All costs are 0,055$ now per kw/h, that makes nearly 60$ per miner per month. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:25:33
Here only S9i. Didn’t get question what do you mean by selling? Btc? 
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:13:56
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:35:33
It depends, mostly keep. Nearly 80-90%
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:24:24
You got common pacifist opinion on that, if you don’t risk you never get night profits. So basically, depends on your market expectations
and willingness to risk
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:22:46
Not so profitable in countries with high electricity cost
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:02:51
Cheap coal power
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:21:09
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:01:48
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:23:15
Reading and doing different things. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:44:24
Yeah 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:38:33
You got the point ��
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:19:08
Kazakhstan 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:25:59
Whahah, thanks for understanding. Yes English is not native language for me)
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:34:35
We are mining with our own equipment and also provide hosting services for our clients. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:47:32
Btc pool is good though 
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:53:25
Under clocking is dangerous, makes ASICS overheated, which leads to cable melting and breaking hashboards. But if you put it in cooling liquid then might be the case
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:02:06
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:12:25
Very smart
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:13:20
Yes, it’s common technology
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:28:04
Thanks for explaining) stay positive 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:31:17
There is one French company who made mining heaters, but the price is very high. It is easier to buy several ASICS
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:28:46
Electricity costs 5 cents per kw/h
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:36:43
Usually cleaning need to be done minimum once in 6 month, depends on level of dust in facility
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:12:43
Eerh need to check
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:26:16
Yes, hot channel is separate and excluded with the wall, from hot channel air is deleted by big ventilators. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:30:20
Green LED means that everything is okay and ASIC is working properly. Red LED means there are problems 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:28:55
Thank you for observation
@_date: 2018-08-31 06:52:10
So many really funny comments, should have been rewarded ��
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:20:33
There are filters, but still sometimes you need to do full cleaning
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:23:18
Nearly 14-16 months with current btc/usd rate 
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:44:10
Hopefully no
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:21:56
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:04:27
14-16 months, depends on BTC price. Not gonna sell now, hodl 
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:44:37
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:06:57
What’s electricity cost there?
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:46:11
I’m native Kazakh, born and lived here entire life
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:00:32
It’s not a bedroom though. It’s separate facility
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:21:23
Simple mathematics 
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:24:22
You mean I should exploit that Borat personage to raise capital?
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:27:21
Nope 
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:50:34
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:36:08
Bitfury is not a good option for mining
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:01:20
Nope, much more less
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:06:39
Sorry, was busy with family time. Thank you for commenting. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:27:54
Total  135 of antminer s9i
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:22:51
Yes, will need to do something with that
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:07:47
You forgot about costs, not everything is about price increase and difficulty. If you have relatively lowest costs in the world, you still competitive 
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:20:36
Not a fact that earn more when buying and holding. For example you bought in March btc for 9900 usd and no after 5 month you are making losses. But if you bought asic you already made some profit from mining. Just google it
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:26:51
Thanks, for now it’s 5 cents, but want to decrease to 2,5 cents 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:35:41
Oh yes, my lovely one ☝️ 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:24:26
For business it is ok to have payback period for 2-3 years. But I think it will be much faster 
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:54:06
If you have low electricity cost then reasonable, each 14 THs
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:24:47
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:47:20
Sorry for that, will improve soon
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:34:58
Yes, just for 850$ and hosting fee of 68$ per month all included)
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:21:04
5 cent kw/h
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:09:00
Why not, I’m open to any win-win opportunity 
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:21:42
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:22:35
Commercial secret
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:22:20
Hopefully Btc price will increase soon 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:27:40
Ok, I thought it is only related to oil. Now I got it 
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:06:37
But what about efficiency? How many THs remain?
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:37:16
Good question, not loosing today. Cause electricity in Kazakhstan is just 5 cents
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:08:22
Finally one thinking man
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:21:47
Started mining in May, and increased quantity significantly month by month. Now for 1 ASIC profit is almost 103$ and costs are 60$. So net profit is 43$. But strategy is not convert BTC into USD until it hits minimum 9,900. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:29:06
Not yet, but hope to have it
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:39:31
Fare price ��
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:03:39
Innosilicon introduces T2, but haven’t tried them yet. Also some more to come
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:47:04
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:33:50
Thanks man for the support, appreciated. Yeah as long as my costs are lower than profits it is reasonable to mine, even if it is not, still depends on expectations if btc price
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:42:49
I don’t care, but mostly Kazakhs react badly, don’t ever try to bull  them with Borat
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:22:13
Should, shouldn’t. Already done. Maybe you should
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:13:44
I appreciate your support, stay positive
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:58:10
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:03:54
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:22:59
Same again, you need to study more between mining and just hodling
@_date: 2019-03-22 10:00:17
I know owner and he says that he is doing it for more people to know about bitcoin. Profit is not primary purpose
@_date: 2019-03-15 10:38:26
That’s main reason why miners doesn’t invest in Kazakhstan. However, our president is 28 years ruling country and has good reputation for foreign investments 
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:38:30
It is straight to the topic, I just wanted to shout to the fools who still waited for buying opportunity: “I’m buying fools” and bottom disappeared

Thank you �� 
Start small and grow step by step
@_date: 2018-10-12 02:03:24
Who said that power cost is 0.05? Antminer consumes actually in average 1.4 KWh. That means 1008 KW per month. Multiply by our final rate $ 0.05, and get $50.4 final price. First, learn some mathematics and know details
@_date: 2019-03-22 04:53:55
He left position, but still ruling country
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:50:22
$0.05 per KWh 
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:09:16
Kazakhstan 
@_date: 2018-10-27 06:02:16
[16.65 KZT ~ $0.045 per KWh]( 
Nice! What work you can do for our company? 
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:01:08
Reasonable for miners, who mine with much higher electricity costs. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:58:46
Not at all
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:59:39
Yes need to pay some import tax and VAT. For precise calculations please write email to xive
@_date: 2018-10-13 02:03:21
Yo guys why so much worries, we are already running 500 machines in our first 2 facilities. This one is 3rd one. We give you few of 50$ and sign contract locking that fee. The rest is on our company. We have repair service, all parts come from Bitmain. China is our neighbor country, so it is much closer than shipping to USA or wherever you are. So relax and don’t bullshit too much in comments regarding services you not gonna use, if have exact interest PM me and I will provide all necessary information in very details 
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:01:32
Not plus, monthly you pay just $50 for each antminer 
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:09:04
It’s for kids, and it’s a night time. Also snowing and cold
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:09:08
This professor is really arrogant and just can’t take that he lost in investing in crypto
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:02:36
Like NiceHash, but different
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:03:28
Yes you are right, nearly always
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:08:17
I don’t want to sell anything now. I just trying to get some people to help me build platform
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:11:10
I can say that now in Kazakhstan demand really increased. Just a month ago you can easily buy btc for -2% and now it’s +2% and still struggle to find. Volume definitely increased
@_date: 2019-04-05 06:03:52
It’s just one of places where I know appropriate audience is. If you can advice where to post please do so. 
Thank you
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:52:41
What a use of language, man you are awesome �� 
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:40:14
Yes, but it’s too complicated and I’m not sure whether it is up to date solution.
@_date: 2019-01-30 11:18:37
Go ahead, you are more than welcome 
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:27:03
Good luck mate
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:41:51
Replied 
@_date: 2019-01-12 05:01:37
True. Many foreign miners relocate their equipment to Kazakhstan. For example our company provides hosting services and we host clients equipment from Honkong, Kuwait and China 
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:38:48
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:53:23
Yeah. I’m always interested in people, who were smart and lucky enough buy Bitcoin before 2017. You must profited much? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:27:33
But you can buy much cheaper heaters than antminers
@_date: 2019-01-13 02:47:39
Yes, but these miners very risky to buy 
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:04:11
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:54:57
Thanks

@_date: 2019-01-12 05:57:27
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:38:28
Wow, expensive heater
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:48:58
Dude it’s not a fraud, maybe just my poor English. What do you want from me, I don’t understand? And why you so angry? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 06:38:14
Thanks dude��
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:19:22
No, Xive mining company 
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:51:31
$42 per antminer is what we charge now. This price is just for S9. Other models should be calculated according to 4.5c price and negotiated individually. But now 99% equipment that we host are antminers s9
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:46:44
I’ve sent you pm
@_date: 2019-01-13 09:46:05
Thanks bro for informing 
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:30:15
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:30:55
Wow dude, you’ve got balls. But not everyone want to and can be like you
@_date: 2019-01-13 02:50:49
Our company provides hosting services, and I’m responsible for working with incoming requests 
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:31:05
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:37:09
Yeah still profitable
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:49:58
It has a lot of rises and drops during last 2 years )
@_date: 2019-01-13 02:45:52
And what is payback period for S15 and S9? What are ROIs? That’s what makes real sense 
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:53:15
And regarding address we are located in Kazakhstan. Our office is open for any client interested. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:52:21
Antminers by Bitmain
@_date: 2019-01-13 08:44:01
That’s what happened in 2018) 
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:24:49
Just have sent
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:18:52
4.5c per kW/h hosting fee including everything 
@_date: 2019-01-12 10:06:27
Yes 100% true. That’s what happened with recent price drop in November 
@_date: 2019-01-13 02:47:08
I’m not saying we are beating Kuwait, but client preferred to host it in our facility. I don’t know why not mining in Kuwait, if someone knows please share
@_date: 2019-01-12 05:56:37
Join us, invest in mining equipment and come to visit us)
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:34:45
Less miners doesn’t mean less coins mined
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:03:49
Website contains information for our first facility, which is full. Second has $0.03 per KWh electricity + $0.01 hosting fee
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:32:37
Just fire accident, I guess 
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:21:19
In 1 month time we plan to finish new farm. I don’t know about shipping rates from California, but from China mainland air cargo is around $5 per kilo to Astana. Truck cargo is the cheapest, less than $1 per kilo
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:28:59
I saw your website. $50 per kw-month is quite expensive nowadays. Your electricity in Canada is losing competition to many countries, including Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan and even China itself. So if you are really who you claimed to be (owner of 2 datacenters), then you should look for relocating your mining operations 
@_date: 2019-01-13 02:48:32
That make sense, thank you for sharing 
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:50:06
Pricing is 3.5c is electricity price per KWh. And we charge 1c for hosting. Facility is not build, it is already built and we have long term rent 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:50:24
Thank you for sharing, hope made some profits. Agree technology is awesome 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:44:45

Halving is not near time, and at that time price of BTC can be much higher 
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:49:19
Why? Tell me your strategy 
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:25:45
That’s the reason why many companies like Genesis build their new data centers in Kazakhstan.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:03:48
Hi. FOMO guys mostly regret about buying BTC, we have miners who planned to do it for a long time, coz it takes up to 6 months to prepare facility, buy equipment, transport it and launch. 
For now, we don’t consider buying solar panels, coz it is much cheaper to use coal sourced electricity.
