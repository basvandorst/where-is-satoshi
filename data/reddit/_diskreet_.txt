I’ve worked for him for a while and taken pictures of his house as it is quite nice with our work in. 
I understand your point and if he ever confronted me with it i would apologise and remove anything he wanted me to. 
About asking him, I will when I see him, but seeing as I know him and that he is not the most technical man I know I thought I would ask those who might be more knowledgeable than myself.

He said they’re £2.5k each ? So either he’s lying or you are. Either way I feel your offer might be on the low side.

Temperature in the room was at a cool 81.3 Fahrenheit. My equipment is on the toasty side at the moment.

So I bought my BTC through Coinbase. (Maybe it was my naivety when trying to find the simplest way to get some BTC).
I moved said BTC to my electrum wallet.
Made some purchases (that's what this currency is for no?) 
I have some small change left in my wallet. Was thinking about moving it back to my bank account, which I would of gone back to Coinbase to exchange to my currency and send it to my general account. 
I am reading (here mostly) a lot of anger and/or distrust towards Coinbase. 
If and when i decide to move some money back would you recommend another service or to continue with Coinbase?
Just curious for opinions.

A predictable response.

The more I read about BTC et al the more stories like this pop up. 
Are these people for real?

Miners will be paid by transactions fees alone.

My toast landed butter side down this morning which predicts a drop in price I’m afraid.

I use it as a currency, not an investment. That's what it should be used for, I believe anyway. 
I want to make a purchase, when I exchange I add a little extra to what I need. I buy what I want to buy and have a little left over. The next time I come to do the same there's sometimes a little more, sometimes less. I have never taken any out, just don't see the point when I want to use it as a currency not an investment. 
All this post was about was understanding the difference in the figures. I'm not a trader by any means just a simple guy using new tech to the best I can.

Not at all, just was curious.

From r/all here. Anyone care to explain what I'm looking at ? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:46:46
Much appreciated kind sir.

Where I am not a Luddite I try to understand as much about technology as I can. Though some of the deeper intricacies of bitcoin really do fascinate and amaze me sometimes. Thank you for that explanation.
