Basically the core dev team can do basically whatever they want, the fantasy is that if they did something so utterly terrible that every single person hated it that someone could make a rival bitcoin and everyone would switch to that version but that is basically totally unlikely to happen unless the core devs do something truely absurd, so basically they got bitcoin hostage and there isn't much the community can do.

adoption has been going up very little. Number of transactions per day is down, number of users joining has gone from 1000+ a day to like 90 a day, downloads of bitcoin core are way down. Most any way you measure it the idea that bitcoin is blasting off in popularity just doesn't reflect reality.

Say there was just one node. That one guy would have 100% control of the network and what transactions are passed through. If there are few it becomes easier to separate or fool the network. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:00:14
also note that while bitcoin has a max of 7 transactions per second the fact miners limit block size to a third or a quarter of that means that bitcoin can actually only handle 2-3 transactions per second. Slow enough that just the 10 million transactions walmart did alone on black Friday would be enough to consume the whole bitcoin network for about 2 entire months.

That is a pretty good deal.  Bitcoin is extremely slow if you are talking about sending something to someone that they want to cash out to actual money. It would be nearly impossible to send bitcoin to someone and have them holding a 50 dollar bill the next day without a bunch of preexisting relationships or something. Especially if they lack a bank account and so on.

It also has the problem that this forum has selective memory and buries the memories of the predictions of doom that actually came true. Notice the hyperfocus on 'professor bitcorn" because he got it wrong by guessing a 99% fall in price, but everyone predicting 1-60% falls in price all were right and so aren't talked about. Likewise everyone saying one pool could get 51% of the network were laughed at but all turned out right or everyone claiming mtgox would fall and then it did. 
Having a list of detractors stored up runs the risk of having to remember them and check off their predictions as they come true. Which maybe of them do.

The limiting factor is that there is transmission time and a 4gb block would take hours to cross the network while the guy sending 10kb blocks basically gets everyone in the network to see his instantly, so there is always going to be a huge advantage to not making huge blocks, which will always keep the bitcoin network unable to handle large numbers of transactions.

That has basically happened repeatedly and will happen repeatedly again. 
Bitcoin is in a weird loop of every time something bad happens instead of actually learning it could happen instead saying "okay, now that is done everything is safe forever" and doing the exact same thing.

Mining is the only thing satoshi brought to the table. He didn't invent ledgers or cryptography or private keys or elliptical curves. If it turns out mining is shit then maybe the guy and maybe bitcoin isn't as good as people originally thought, so it's easier to displace it to "BITCOIN IS PERFECT! GHASH IS EVIL!" than admit bitcoin protocol wasn't made right and the security isn't actually very strong.

People very quickly figure out what is going on when someone is forcefully trying to give them 'free money" they quickly figure out what the motive is.

Only 1MB worth of bitcoin transactions can happen per 10 minutes. This means bitcoin can only do 7 transactions per second. On black friday walmart did 10 million transactions meaning it would take bitcoin weeks to process just one store on one day.
People tend to brush it off as just a number in a text file, like we could just make it 10MB or 100MB or 1000MB with no problems. But mining pools already prefer smaller blocks and already limit their blocks internally to 300kb or 200kb meaning that it is less clear that turning the max size up to a billion kajillion gigabytes would actually cause miners to actually raise the block size. Bitcoin might be stuck at only being able to do 2 or 3 transactions per second.
(miners like smaller blocks because they cross the network faster, if someone made a 1 TB block it would take hours or days for all the nodes to see it, but a 1kb block will be seen by everyone in seconds and thus more likely to be counted as the real block)
@_date: 2014-07-14 10:24:55

That doesn't seem balanced at all? Ghash only allows 350kb blocks. That means bitcoin can handle 2.3 transactions per second. 
On black friday just walmart alone did 10 million transactions. That means that JUST to handle one store for one day bitcoin would take 1 month and 20 days to clear through just that.

It's not actually getting more popular. Volume is the lowest it's ever been and adoption has stalled, with no new major retail anythings taking it in months and the number of bitcoin nodes is lower than it's been since 2010. 
The people that are telling you it's only going up uP UP are people that need to convince you to buy their coins for more than they bought them for.

Bitcoin won't go to zero. People have invested their dumb life savings into bitcoin and won't walk away basically no matter what, bitcoin is a captive pool. mtgox was entirely shut down and people were desperately buying and selling the coins on some off site dumb fake exchange that stole all their money. 
Miners can extract a whole heck of a lot of money out of the true believers if they don't care about furthering those people's goals.

ntimelock is basically nonfunctional right now. Nodes won't transfer it. It's marked as nonstandard. It's one step above not existing at all right now, exactly the sort of thing that seems like it'd open it for rewrites. 
Also lots of past transactions have been rendered nonvalid. They disabled almost the entire scripting language in 2013, almost all the math functions, almost all the string functions, etc. Changing the format on a nonstandard unused thing like ntimelock isn't outlandish at all.

This is not a yearly thing, this is the lowest volume bitcoin has ever had since 2011.

Someone releases a client and then people run it or not. In theory anyone could do that, but so far basically only one group actually releases updates to the protocol.

Even if the block reward is zero the reward you get for an orphaned block is exactly zero dollars no matter how many transactions you put in it.
When each block is gigabytes in size it doesn't matter what kind of space magic the network is, the block some guy made that is only 500kb is going to cross the network hundreds of times faster than the one that is 5,000,000kb always.   
The fact that even at 1mb people ALREADY cap the blocks they mine at smaller size should be proof that this isn't something that can be hand waved away. Nor is it some far future concern for the year 2140. If we raised the block size right this second it would do nothing if all the miners don't even make blocks bigger than 400kb now and cap blocks at 250kb or 64kb because it's faster.

Once you get bitcoin make sure to keep them in cold storage! All you need to do is follow these 19 simple steps!
Bitcoin Cold Storage Procedure
Bought new $200 toshiba laptop from Best buy. It's only purpose will be Bitcoin Wallet management
Bought 4 USB sticks (each from a different manufacturer)
Download Armory onto 1 of the 4 USB drives from an online computer
Turn on new (offline) computer, Go through set up procedure and Disable Wifi
Install Armory onto New (offline) computer (windows 8 OS) from USB drive
Create encrypted Wallet
Create Fragmented Paper Back up (w/ Secure Print) with cable connected printer
Create Personal Paper Back up (w /Secure Print) with cable connected printer
Test the paper Backups
Back up encrypted wallets to the other (3) USB sticks.
1 USB stick goes in a safe, 1 goes to a family member, 1 stays accessible to me
Create watching only wallet from offline computer and transfer it to USB stick I used to install armory client
Import watching only copy onto online computer, Wait for synch
Send a test amount of BTC to an address generated by offline wallet
confirm it transferred successfully by checking watching only wallet and on Blockchain.info
Send the rest of Bitcoin to cold storage Wallet
Again confirm it’s been transferred
Pass out Fragmented Back ups to trusted Friends/Family
Personal back up also in safe with 1 of the USB sticks.

Credit cards intentionally have a thing where if it suddenly starts being used thousands of miles from where it normally is that it gets a hold on it to prevent it being drained by a thief. This is a very sensible feature for a credit card to have and is easily lifted with a simple phone call (or prevented with a phone call ahead of time).

Bitcoin is big on paper millionaires. The spot price rises, people confuse what spot price means and think they have a lot of money. 
The truth is "spot price * number of coins" doesn't tell you how much money there is, and in the end, only a few people can cash out while a lot of people are left holding the bag. 
Spot price is a useful rule of thumb if you are selling a coin or two, but people confuse it with a real PRICE metric for a number of coins. 
Like right now the price is 655, any one person can get a good estimate of how much money they have by multiplying number of coins by that price. anyone with many coins or any group of people can not do that. the 655 price is only supported by 5000 coins or so that were bought on the market today. I tiny number.

Yes, except the confirmation time on bitcoin is already so absurdly long that everyone already is opting out of actually using any confirmations to buy anything that it doesn't really matter much if it's 50% longer of 5x longer or 500x longer since most things ignore it anyway and just assume double spends won't happen.

You take a bitcoin, and say "this bitcoin represents a car" then you can give someone the coin and they own the car.

There is no "full solution", the whole concept of it is that it's an impossible problem.

That is good enough a solution for 99.999% of the people here because most people don't really give a fuck about decentralization or any of that, they just want bitcoin to be their get rich quick ticket to the moon and the appearance of being decentralized is basically just as good as being actually decentralized in that case.

Why would a site called one year Bitcoin show two years?
@_date: 2014-06-23 10:35:34
You should also look at mining and transaction speed. Bitcoin has a maximum throughput of 7 transactions per second. The claim is always that that could be easily changed by raising the block size limit. But in real life the large mining pools already have internal block size limits that are between a quarter and a third of the hard coded max, making it a real question of why they would work at 100mb blocks if they already don't want to work with 1mb blocks. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:26:27
Again, this isn't some magic future hypothetical, right this second the actual miners all limit their block sizes at sizes smaller than the hard coded cap. 
This isn't some discussion about 50 years from now, it's happening right this second, bitcoin has been reduced by the miners to 2-3tps because it works better that way. Simply typing 10000mb into the max block size field doesn't magically make them stop doing that.

Only 1MB worth of bitcoin transactions can happen per 10 minutes. This means bitcoin can only do 7 transactions per second. On black friday walmart did 10 million transactions meaning it would take bitcoin weeks to process just one store on one day. 
People tend to brush it off as just a number in a text file, like we could just make it 10MB or 100MB or 1000MB with no problems. But mining pools already prefer smaller blocks and already limit their blocks internally to 300kb or 200kb meaning that it is less clear that turning the max size up to a billion kajillion gigabytes would actually cause miners to actually raise the block size. Bitcoin might be stuck at only being able to do 2 or 3 transactions per second. 
(miners like smaller blocks because they cross the network faster, if someone made a 1 TB block it would take hours or days for all the nodes to see it, but a 1kb block will be seen by everyone in seconds and thus more likely to be counted as the real block)

If the economy breaks the bitcoin economy will also break. It's the same economy, even if it's denominated different.

The hand wavy answer you will get is that we can just turn the block size cap from 1mb to 100 or 1000 or 1 million mb and it's all just the simple change of a number in a text file. 
This ignores that already mining pools are setting internal caps on blocks of 350, 250 or 64kb and not actually making max size blocks when when the traffic exists so they could. 
Basically the bigger the block you make the slower it can cross the network and the more likely it is to orphan. It's already a good idea to cap blocks small and when blocks at 10gb each it's going to be a hilariously giant advantage to be the pool spitting out 20kb blocks. 
Of course you make more money if you include more transactions (although currently just barely) but the amount of money you make if your blocks orphan is always the same: zero bitcoins.

Long term time locks rely far far far far too heavily on the concept that transaction format will remain static for years or decades.

In  isn't the reason that users don't need to know exactly how credit cards work only because someone else does it for you? 
if you don't know how paper wallets work you risk your coins being stolen by keyloggers right from day one. If you don't know how change addresses work you risk sweeping your paper wallet wrong and losing the money, hell, if you don't know the entropy source your wallet generator uses and how strong it is bitcoinrobin hood might come and steal every last cent and only give it back if you know to post about it on reddit. 
Even if you look at the getting started wiki you can't know if the links are real links or hacking attempts. Even if you google web wallets you might get the blockchain phishing site as the first result if you look on the wrong day. 
bitcoin says "be your own bank" and that starts on day one. There is no grace period where get to opt out of knowing the thousands of arbitrary pitfalls bitcoin offers.

Despite it being a dumb slogan bitcoin isn't actually a bank and doesn't actually provide bank like services. There is no insured accounts, no loans, no checking, no mortgages, no checking, no overdraft loan.
Like, bitcoin might replace western union or something in some wildest fantasy, but bitcoin just literally does not do anything that banks do.

If the economy collapses switching to another currency doesn't magically fix anything. If your boss can't afford to pay you he can't afford to pay you in dollars or pesos or dogecoins. If the business can't get a startup loan in dollars he isn't getting one in darkcoins or yen either.

there would be two bitcoin networks. Some people would say "this is the real one" and some other people would say "mine is the real one". Hopefully everyone would instantly magically agree which was the real one. Otherwise you'd have coins that worked some places and not others and everyone would have coins on both so you could spend them once on each.

If they don't like the outside block they can just remine the chain from the last block they got. 
I imagine they don't see the advantage in doing that for whatever random block that was with whatever random transaction was in it. But they have the power. 
Say like, someone stole 500,000 coins from the owner of ghash, or whatever fortune he's amassed from running this thing. Do you really think they would let that transaction stand? They have the power, it's just a question of what makes it worth exercising it.

That is a fake quote, but he has some real quotes about bankers I bet would enjoy:
The essence of the Jewish Idea to its influence on the labor world is the same as in all other departments-the destruction of real values in favor of fictitious values. The Jewish philosophy of money is not to "make money," but to "get money." The distinction between these two is fundamental. That explains Jews being "financiers" instead of "captains of industry." It is the difference between "getting" and "making." The creative, constructive type of mind has an affection for the thing it is doing. The non-Jewish worker formerly chose the work he liked best. He did not change employment easily, because there was a bond between him and the kind of work he had chosen. Nothing else was so attractive to him. He would rather draw a little less money and do what he liked to do, than a little more and do what irked him. The "maker" is always thus influenced by his liking. Not so the "getter." It doesn't matter what he does, so long as the income is satisfactory. He has no illusions, sentiments or affections on the side of work. It is the "geld" that counts. He has no attachment for the things he makes, for he doesn't make any; he deals in the things which other men make and regards them solely on the side of their money-making value. "The joy of creative labor" is nothing to him, not even an intelligible saying.	 ”

That is an extremely shitty thing to do. People don't give you savings bonds to be get rich investments, you give people bonds as a way to give them an amount of money in the future. 
Your grandma wasn't just some stupid old lady that got you bonds because she was such a dummy she forgot to invest in something that could hit big. She specifically picked to give you something that gave you a known amount of money at a known time to help you out.

The fact that the bitcoin protocol is comically weak and prone to centralization is a big problem and is generally one people would rather put their head in the sand about as much as possible.

That isn't actually the government stealing your money. After a certain number of years money goes out of banks and goes into government storage. It's then kept there for 1 century before being touched. If you request your money at any time before the 103 inactive years are up you get back the full amount. 
It's a consumer protection thing, not big bad government stealing your nickles. It's specifically because government is better able to store accounts ultra long term than a bank would. Go back 100 years and almost all the banks have turned over or changed massively, while the government is unlikely to disappear. 
On the other hand, the truth isn't a pro-bitcoin narrative so lets just pretend that after 3 years aussie government steals all your money, bwa ha ha!!!!

People are just going to tell you that in the future bitcoin will simply just magically become more stable. No one will give any answer for why that would be. As things like corn and gold and other commodities move quite dramatically up and down in price and are thousands of years old and have trillion dollar market caps. 
The only reason currencies are stable is because of a whole system based around forcing them to be mostly stable. It didn't just happen because dollars or yen "got big" or "time passed".

The issue isn't if they will WANT the fees, clearly they would love 1000btc transaction fees in giant blocks, the issue is if the orphan rate forces smaller blocks, which it clearly does.

Yes, of course they want the fees. But the issue is that if you are making 10gb blocks and someone else is only making 500kb blocks his blocks are going to be the one that comes out as the accepted block more than not.

the bitcoin community in general are pretty hostile to the idea of volume. To a bitcoiner one coin being sold at 1000 would be better than a thousand sold at 900 because a lot of people have been fooled into thinking "spot price" is how much money they "have" in a 1:1 way.

The limit itself isn't specifically, since it can be changed. Propagation delay of larger blocks is the problem. Miners already have chosen to not go above 200-300kb and that already is giving them an advantage. Just imagine when each bitcoin block is 10gb, how much of an advantage the guy that says "nah, I'll set mine at 250kb" will get, how much more quickly his blocks will propagate. And how the advantage scales with network speed. If we get 10x faster networks that makes the 10gb block go faster but also makes the 250kb block go faster so you can't just wave it away with "moore's law will fix this".

There is nothing irregular about a double spend. You can spend a coin a billion times until one gets confirmed.

The absolute max block size is 1mb. In real life this is much smaller as most miners cap at a smaller level, but at least in theory it could be 1mb. This translates to 7 transactions per second which translates to 604,800 transactions per day. 
In theory the hand wave is that some future version of bitcoin could fix that cap, but none have yet, and so if anyone wanted to do over that number a day right now they would be reduced to begging gavin to please change bitcoin for them or else making an altcoin themselves and calling it bitcoin and hoping people go along with it.

Then that is pretty much the heart of "Bitcoin is in a weird loop of every time something bad happens instead of actually learning it could happen instead saying "okay, now that is done everything is safe forever" and doing the exact same thing."
Bitcoin is a long story of bad things happening then instead of anyone learning from it just saying "that happened in the past, everything is fixed now forever!"

Once you get over 50% you become the only miner that can get blocks. only the longest chain matters and if you have most of the network power you will always eventually come out with the longest chain. 
Getting all the blocks, only the stuff you put in the blocks will be in the blockchain. If you don't put in my transaction then no one else could. 
If you want to double spend you just keep making your own block chain then let the other miners make their own, then you buy a whole bunch of stuff, then you say "JUST KIDDING!" and replace their block chain with your longer one that says none of that stuff ever happened.

It isn't actually a technical achievement in cryptography though, it's a bunch of decades old ideas stapled together. It doesn't do anything at all new in the field of cryptography. That is sort of exactly what I was talking about though. People can't think bitcoin is just a cool idea or whatever, they want to assign deep and structural significance to every single part.

Without being too inflammatory, the user base for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly-informed about currency systems and macroeconomics.  I say "increasingly" because at one time it was fairly well-informed libertarians but as the currency has become mainstream, it's attracted more poorly-informed individuals and the conversation have become more polarized and less knowledge-based, driving the well-informed and balanced people away, or at least prompting them to recede into the background.

@_date: 2014-06-16 22:55:46
I see virtually nothing on this list that bitcoin even remotely does, it's not even the same sort of thing. 
 
1. Accepting Deposits:
The most important function of commercial banks is to accept deposits from the public. Various sections of society, according to their needs and economic condition, deposit their savings with the banks.
For example, fixed and low income group people deposit their savings in small amounts from the points of view of security, income and saving promotion. On the other hand, traders and businessmen deposit their savings in the banks for the convenience of payment.
Therefore, keeping the needs and interests of various sections of society, banks formulate various deposit schemes. Generally, there ire three types of deposits which are as follows:
(i) Current Deposits:
The depositors of such deposits can withdraw and deposit money when­ever they desire. Since banks have to keep the deposited amount of such accounts in cash always, they carry either no interest or very low rate of interest. These deposits are called as Demand Deposits be­cause these can be demanded or withdrawn by the depositors at any time they want.
Such deposit ac­counts are highly useful for traders and big business firms because they have to make payments and accept payments many times in a day.
(ii) Fixed Deposits:
These are the deposits which are deposited for a definite period of time. This period is generally not less than one year and, therefore, these are called as long term deposits. These deposits cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the stipulated time and, therefore, these are also called as time deposits.
These deposits generally carry a higher rate of interest because banks can use these deposits for a definite time without having the fear of being withdrawn.
(iii) Saving Deposits:
In such deposits, money upto a certain limit can be deposited and with­drawn once or twice in a week. On such deposits, the rate of interest is very less. As is evident from the name of such deposits their main objective is to mobilise small savings in the form of deposits. These deposits are generally done by salaried people and the people who have fixed and less income.
2. Giving Loans:
The second important function of commercial banks is to advance loans to its customers. Banks charge interest from the borrowers and this is the main source of their income.
Banks advance loans not only on the basis of the deposits of the public rather they also advance loans on the basis of depositing the money in the accounts of borrowers. In other words, they create loans out of deposits and deposits out of loans. This is called as credit creation by commercial banks.
Modern banks give mostly secured loans for productive purposes. In other words, at the time of advancing loans, they demand proper security or collateral. Generally, the value of security or collateral is equal to the amount of loan. This is done mainly with a view to recover the loan money by selling the security in the event of non-refund of the loan.
At limes, banks give loan on the basis of personal security also. Therefore, such loans are called as unsecured loan. Banks generally give following types of loans and advances:
(i) Cash Credit:
In this type of credit scheme, banks advance loans to its customers on the basis of bonds, inventories and other approved securities. Under this scheme, banks enter into an agreement with its customers to which money can be withdrawn many times during a year. Under this set up banks open accounts of their customers and deposit the loan money. With this type of loan, credit is created.
(iii) Demand loans:
These are such loans that can be recalled on demand by the banks. The entire loan amount is paid in lump sum by crediting it to the loan account of the borrower, and thus entire loan becomes chargeable to interest with immediate effect.
(iv) Short-term loan:
These loans may be given as personal loans, loans to finance working capital or as priority sector advances. These are made against some security and entire loan amount is transferred to the loan account of the borrower.
3. Over-Draft:
Banks advance loans to its customer’s upto a certain amount through over-drafts, if there are no deposits in the current account. For this banks demand a security from the customers and charge very high rate of interest.
4. Discounting of Bills of Exchange:
This is the most prevalent and important method of advancing loans to the traders for short-term purposes. Under this system, banks advance loans to the traders and business firms by discounting their bills. In this way, businessmen get loans on the basis of their bills of exchange before the time of their maturity.
5. Investment of Funds:
The banks invest their surplus funds in three types of securities—Government securities, other approved securities and other securities. Government securities include both, central and state govern­ments, such as treasury bills, national savings certificate etc.
Other securities include securities of state associated bodies like electricity boards, housing boards, debentures of Land Development Banks units of UTI, shares of Regional Rural banks etc.
6. Agency Functions:
Banks function in the form of agents and representatives of their customers. Customers give their consent for performing such functions. The important functions of these types are as follows:
(i) Banks collect cheques, drafts, bills of exchange and dividends of the shares for their custom­ers.
(ii) Banks make payment for their clients and at times accept the bills of exchange: of their cus­tomers for which payment is made at the fixed time.
(iii) Banks pay insurance premium of their customers. Besides this, they also deposit loan installments, income-tax, interest etc. as per directions.
(iv) Banks purchase and sell securities, shares and debentures on behalf of their customers.
(v) Banks arrange to send money from one place to another for the convenience of their custom­ers.
7. Miscellaneous Functions:
Besides the functions mentioned above, banks perform many other functions of general utility which are as follows:
(i) Banks make arrangement of lockers for the safe custody of valuable assets of their custom­ers such as gold, silver, legal documents etc.
(ii) Banks give reference for their customers.
(iii) Banks collect necessary and useful statistics relating to trade and industry.
(iv) For facilitating foreign trade, banks undertake to sell and purchase foreign exchange.
(v) Banks advise their clients relating to investment decisions as specialist
(vi) Bank does the under-writing of shares and debentures also.
(vii) Banks issue letters of credit.
(viii) During natural calamities, banks are highly useful in mobilizing funds and donations.
(ix) Banks provide loans for consumer durables like Car, Air-conditioner, and Fridge etc.

The bitcoin market has virtually no depth, more than a microscopic number of people realizing any profits from bitcoin drains the entire pool. For this reason there is a strong demand to create a bunch of memes and sense of community responsibility that just leaving your bitcoin sitting forever is somehow a huge virtue. To the point people have a "funny joke" of hilariously flipping letters to make it some community meme thing to try and make it a community virtue, since if it's not that, bitcoin crashes to zero. People need to put money in, not take any out.

The total number of bitcoin can be increased. Right now libertarians are the majority of bitcoiners and of course that is basically unthinkable for the group of people that right now control bitcoin. The goal of bitcoin though is to spread to everyone, and in that case it seems like walmart shoppers and teen girls and bankers and whoever else will be the vast majority and the original bitcoin users will be 750,000 people trying to have their will imposed on 750,000,000 people and will likely fail to control the economy just like they have failed to control the economy we already have.

Banks have more than 1 kind of account.
- Put it in a safe deposit box and you can access all of your original money with no limits at all but no interest or anything either and no digital access.
- put it in a normal bank account and you have 100% 24/7 digital access and limited but not very limited physical access and you draw interest.
- put it in a CD and you have very strongly limited digital or physical access but you have (potentially) higher interest. 
Pick the account that is right for what you need. Don't cry if you put it in the wrong kind of account. If all you care about is getting physical dollar bills at any time then put them in a safe deposit box.

The amount of money you get including transactions is minuscule. Larger file sizes make the blocks transmit slower, everyone basically wants to include as few transactions as possible without freezing the entire network.

What that would actually show is that the miners would quickly blacklist the malicious transactions and the attack would be harmless.
Although, I mean, Doing that would ruin literally the whole point of bitcoin and show the claim that you can control what you do with your money and no third party middle man gets to pick which transactions are or aren't frozen is a total lie but whatevs. People would do the thing where they ignore that because it aligns with their priorities this time.

That is the whole point of a bank. You don't just give them money so they can put it in their mattress. You give them money so they can invest your money and give you a cut of the profit with the person taking none of the investment risk.  
I don't really understand being angry at that. Or why it's a bad thing. If bitcoin got big why wouldn't the same system exist there too? Even if it wasn't called a bank.   
Once a bitcoin company exists that might be trustworthy to not just run off with all the money at a drop of a hat "Put your money in this fund and we will invest it for you and give you a fixed interest rate which is lower than the actual interest the investments get but is guaranteed and insured up to 250,000 dollars" sounds pretty reasonable.

Bitcoin price has been going down for over a year at this point. Over and over bitcoin people have thought that bitcoin is a company stock that will some reason rise on good news but since that doesn't happen and the price continues it's slide unaffected some dumb people have decided that good news CAUSES the price slide. Instead of the two things having nothing to do with eachother and good news having no reason to raise the price of an asset like this.

Bitcoin miners on average get about 40 dollars per transaction they process, largely by the coins they create. They also get like 12 dollars or something in miners fees. 
There is a very hand wavy idea that somehow the transaction fees will go up but that will be totally okay? Or maybe miners will make way less and that will be totally okay? Or maybe transactions will go up even though there is no indication that actually is happening at nearly the rate to make up for the 40 dollars a transaction is costing them now.

Even though some guy told you bitcoin lets you "be your own bank" you guys get that bitcoin doesn't replace nearly any actual function a bank has, right?

The problem with that sure seems to be that evilpool just says "Oh, we don't use that" and then it doesn't matter how perfectly engineered some other mining software is.

Bitcoin's "price" is set at what a very small number of people are selling at so a lot of people think their worth is "# bitcoin held * spot price". This for some people can make big looking numbers but generally ignores that sales don't work like that and a large sale lowers the price rapidly so the last coin they sell is worth much less than the first.

Because bitcoin's price is doing so poorly a lot of people have magically decided that halving will somehow shoot the price up and we simply need to wait and not do anything and we will all be rich.

The market cap for bitcoin is 2.8 billion right now. Even with the user base being teeny tiny that still is split too many ways for anyone to be truely super rich. Satoshi holds the most bitcoins at around a million which means he has a few hundred million dollars at most. With very little of that being actually spendable since even a tiny fraction would crash the market (ignoring that him even touching his money at all would crash the market itself). 
Bitcoin isn't really making anyone all that rich.

A flat fee would make more sense, but having one ruins bitcoin since it just opens an attack based on intentionally sending maximum sized transactions to DDOS the network at the flat fee. Bitcoin is stuck charging by the Kb. A system so complex not even most bitcoiners could accurately tell you what the fee is for any given transaction.

So miners mine even though the price has crashed and you run nodes even though it COSTS you money. Do you want to rethink the concept that p2p networks only can exist if they have some weird money token? Because every single P2P network will disagree with that. 
Even in cryptocurrency something like litecoin is down to single digit percents of it's former price and yet it seems to have a network that experiences no outages and has had no more issues with network security than bitcoin has. The idea a network needs high priced tokens to function is incorrect at every level.

It's funny because that is the equation of how safe a transaction is with a given number of confirmations and the number people actually use (zero or one) comes out as super insecure and untrustworthy using that equation, so it's probably an equation you want to hide from people to get them into bitcoin, not one to show off.

 The thing is, bitcoin doesn't actually even come close to 1mb blocks. It doesn't really even ever average 1/3rd of a megabyte blocks: 
The argument for the need of gigantic blocks is really based on hopes and dreams of some bitcoin future.  That may or may not happen. 
We know for sure the reward halving will happen. and transaction fees have been shrinking instead of growing and that isn't good, so someone needs to figure out some way to keep paying miners somehow. Making transactions scarce is the solution people have come up with so far.

satoshi wasn't really smart enough to think of mining pools until really late. Bitcoin was originally P2P with users being nodes which were miners. Later on he realized that wouldn't happen and halfheartedly let things split, but the whole concept he has was meant to be P2P.

It is impossible for bitcoin to go mainstream. the protocol can handle no more than 604,800 users who make 1 purchase a day if you use the incorrect but widely passed around 7tps number or less than 250,000 users if you use a more accurate estimate of maximum transactions in a block. 
Even if gavin blesses us with his wisdom and raises the block to 20mb that only allows an economy with no more than 12 million daily users. And his plan is to move to that over the course of the next decade. 
Bitcoin can not go mainstream. So don't worry. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:48:18
However, if more than 604,800 people want to do that a day they have to ask galvin's permission, since otherwise it won't work until he releases a new bitcoin with new rules that he decided on that allow things like that. He said he might later sometime.

Divide the average block size by the average number of transactions per block to get the average number of bytes in a real world transaction. Divide 1mb by that number and you get some number between 2.7 and 2.9 (it varies).
2.8 transactions per second 60 * 60 * 24 = 241920 a day. 
I rounded up by 8080 transactions to try and make bitcoin look better than it really is. 
20 * 241920 = 4,838,400 transactions per day. 
4.8 million is 4.8% of 100 million.
