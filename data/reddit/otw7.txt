I haven't heard this argument before.


Full nodes get paid zero to verify and store transactions.  What difference does it make if all transactions in a block cost 1000 bits or 0 bits?

In 2009 when the US was in recession it makes sense to keep other countries from borrowing dollars in US markets which would drive up interest rates.

I kept thinking ok...when are they going to mention bitcoin?  It never happens :(

The guy that announced electrum on [bitcointalk asks]( that users donate to the people running public electrum servers.  I don't know anything about the company mentioned in the [post]( It sounds like that entity is supposed to make sure wallet development continues.

A couple of the bitcoin blockchain websites aren't working right now.

I hope blockchain.info makes the changes suggested on the github page and gets relisted in 60 days.
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:19:47
How does blockchain.info make money?  I haven't found any services they charge people to use.
Edit: Looks like [advertising]( is one service they charge customers. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:06:44
Ok, sounds like they could be a starting point for bitcoin information and searches.

This is confusing.  Google reports 1 USD equals 6.35 VEF, but 
 is saying 1 USD equals 174 VEF
I guess only the government gets that special rate?

[Blockchain.info]( has a page that lists unconfirmed transactions, but do any sites show a graph of unconfirmed transactions over time? 
I'm looking for something like [blockchain.info's]( chart that shows the number of transactions per day.
@_date: 2015-05-10 04:33:54
No, it's not related to bitcoin directly. The guy does talk a little about paper money to say that it hasn't always been blindly accepted.  He then speculates that crypto-currency may one day replace paper money, but he's waiting for something like fedcoin to give crypto more legitimacy.

I'm sure there are plenty of unconfirmed transactions that could be included here.

I hope you can get access to your money again.  It sounds like circle is automatically flagging everyone for unusual activity or extra identity verification.

ok, maybe it's at step 2 of 2 after you enter your billing address in step 1?

This is all circle says about cash advance fees.  The advice is basically "check with your bank."

I'm not sure what implications this has for people who have generated more than 12 addresses with their multisig wallet.

I don't think bitcoin has figured out transfers &lt; 1 BTC with no fees. Or how to include more than a couple thousand transactions in a block. There's still work to do.

I don't think destroying all your bitcoin is the most productive thing you can do with what you've accumulated during your life. 
There are tons of charitable causes to donate toward, as evidenced by AnalyzerX7's [tipping tuesday posts](
You could send all the bitcoin back to miners intentionally, unlike what rstn [accidentally did](
You could donate it all towards a basic income distribution like There's the proverb "[You can't take it with you]( but it sounds like that's what you want to do.

Is a debit card cheaper and more reliable to charge than ACH?

So Bill is talking about all this credit eventually collapsing because people inevitably won't be able to pay it back.  This will lead to credit cards not working, and there will be a run on physical cash. I think he's saying the cause of the credit bubble will be negative interest rates, but there must be other ways to fight deflation than just interest rates.  Countries have high interest rates and print money like crazy, so they still have high inflation rates.  I don't agree on the cause of the next credit meltdown.

I've talked to a few people with iphones that say they don't install any apps on it. Some people are just ignorant of the features apps provide, and others would rather do everything through safari.  What can you do?

Has anyone using circle for iOS noticed that the notification widget doesn't update unless the app is open?

Your encrypted wallet details are stored on blockchain.info's servers. breadwallet stores all the details about your wallet on your phone and  talks directly to bitcoin nodes to send and recieve transactions rather than blockchain's web services. 
I would say the breadwallet app operates in a more decentralized way and is very easy to use.  I don't have any evidence that using blockchain.info wallets are unsafe and not perfectly functional however.

Just the other day I was looking for how to make donations to Debian.  I found this [Software in the Public Interest, Inc.]( company.  It looks like they handle donations for many well known projects, but there isn't a good way to make donations.  No bitcoin

Thanks for releasing version 0.5 of breadwallet! iOS users need a wallet that doesn't rely on a particular web server to function.

I'm confused by touch id too. When I open the app there is a lock at the top right corner of the screen.  I can tap it and unlock the app I guess, but it only asks for my passcode.  There is no touch id option. 
Edit: I initially set the touch id limit to 'always require passcode' I thought this would make sure I could not send any bitcoin without being prompted by touch id. Now I realize there are two types types of authentication. Passcode auth and touch id auth (which also can be bypassed by entering a passcode). The key is to raise the touch id limit if you want to use touch id, this has nothing to do with authorizing transactions or not. Your transactions will always need to be authorized by touch id or a passcode.
