Well, I don't do CrossFit but I do electric vehicles/Tesla.

Batteries are mostly sold by ah or mah, the peak output / discharge current is what you're thinking? At a 35 amp load/discharge that battery has an hour's capacity.

Apologies for not being very clear, that's the AC current at 110v. After inversion it's 45 at 12v, whereas the panel is only 8.3.

It's been a while since I was into this, apologies if I'm incorrect. The panel is 100w at DC12v (8.3 amps), the PSU is 500w at AC110v (4.5 amps full load, 80%+ efficiency? I haven't calculated for that loss). The inverter is probably 80% efficient also. Crudely calculated that inverter is going to be consuming 45 amps, the battery is only rated at 35 amp-hours.
The panel will only be charging at a rate of 8.3 amps/hour assuming full light while the inverter is consuming at least 45 amps/hour.
So that's about 62 minutes at full light before the battery runs out.
There will be a lot of savings if you could run the device (which will only be a mix of 5/12 volts DC anyway) directly on DC12v but generally PC PSUs are very stable and safe for the attached hardware which does make the decision tricky.

I don't think 3rd-world issues would be quickly resolved without money, Bill seems to value their issues over our money, I think he does care and share; he is just starting at the worst places in the world first (seemingly excluding war/political issues) and working his way up, then we all get the benefits of his lessons along the way (including Fusion energy).

Here's me thinking it was to avoid the GPU bottleneck and is more about minimum FPS at this stage.

The buck stops with us, financial data is no joke. I'd rather piss off floor staff than use company time trying to secure a personal hobby which shouldn't be anywhere near the workplace anyway.

Is this other server on a point to point network or provider managed wan?

Would you like to know more?

I perceived it as "wins the heart of" or to a lesser degree "marries". I always do. I'll keep an eye out for this in the future though.

Generous behaviour indeed.

How much of that force now relies on lines of code? You only need another NSA defector who knows how to access all those hardware backdoors and things get concerning. Or am I just paranoid?

Silver - 418,000 kW/mK
Copper - 393,700 kW/mK
Aluminum - 216,500 kW/mK
Nickel - 90,600 kW/mK
The cost of a silver heatsink would be comparable to a water/liquid cooling setup, the difference in price compared to the performance of copper is too much.

I would imagine more than one of those wallets is lost, too.
