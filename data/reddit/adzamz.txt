Which .com stock are you saying that matters? Is it Facebook? Yahoo? Google? Im buying back in on a break of 10k, what I have found from experiance is that you can never offload in a downward spike but can always load up on a break as the only way ppl make their money is by selling whn its going up.
Im disgusted by most people in crypto chasing dollars.
I have been working on adoption while ppl pump these ICOs wow.

Your 0.0002 is gone! No moon! 
But really its a good thing, if BTC can not make it then the convenience of blockchain transfers atleast thats swomething.
We had a chance to uncouple from the banking system buyt thge extreme swings of shitcoin traders really lost it for sall of us,
Did you know that its best to make money by doing something useful rather than speculating on crazy bets?

What I meant is what the plebs see, they see BCH as a stock split ETC
But everyone went along with it as long as they got $100USD more value...
And I was mining BTC on CPU's
