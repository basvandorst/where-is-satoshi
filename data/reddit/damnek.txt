Rackspace has a tainted history when it comes to bitcoin. Slush had ~3000 btc stolen from him from a server running on Rackspace, and there is strong evidence suggesting that it was an inside job by Rackspace employees. Also, hosting half of the nodes on the bitcoin network at one single company is not good for decentralization either.. Just some things to keep in mind.

Hi FjolnirBit,
Welcome to the bitcoin community.
I agree that the synchronization process is quite lengthy and painful. Bitcoin-QT is the reference client which does a full verification and hence the long wait. There are also lightweight clients such as Electrum and Multibit (or even web-based wallets) which are a lot faster to start up, but for maximum security it is recommended that you run Bitcoin-QT (I do).
What you say about the transaction verification is close but not entirely correct. The transaction gets verified by miners and a transaction is fully confirmed once the miners have included your transaction in 6 consecutive blocks.
Here is some more pocket money to play with.

I've followed the merger with MMOExchange and I have to say that it was poorly executed. There's still hardly any activity on Ogrr despite all the new users they brought in from MMOExchange. Ogrr has to understand that you can't just take a database of users from somewhere else and dump it into another forum with a different design and philosophy (bitcoin).
Hopefully adding a programmer will speed up streamlining things but I believe that it's already a lost cause when it comes to MMOExchange.

Yes, but it should be much easier to validate a formal specification.
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:36:02
Instead of having to understand *how* a particular program executes its commands to get to the output, the formal specification is a statement about *what* the output is. For example, a typical sorting algorithm can be fairly intricate, but its formal specification would simply state that for any given input array of numbers, the output of the program consists of the same numbers, but ordered such that for any index n, the number associated to it is less than the number of index n+1.

Definitely yes. Buy 1.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:35:41
Here's the problem I have with switching exchanges: Right now I trade with 0.2% commission at Bitstamp. If I were to start trading at your exchange, I would have to start off in the most expensive fee bracket first and trade at an exchange that has virtually no liquidity. So essentially I'd be paying to trade at your exchange. I'd recommend you guys to try to deviate from the current exchange market by offering for example the option to trade at a flat monthly fee. That would definitely capture the attention of bigger traders.

It's my first attempt at a meme. Please forgive me.

@_date: 2013-01-26 12:29:51
If a coin such as litecoin, which has no real advantages over bitcoin, were succesful, it would mean bad news for bitcoin. Because then people could also create an ABCcoin, XYZcoin and so on. Therefore I'm glad it receives no attention.

Although the result sounds catchy, I'm not buying it. They came to this conclusion using some arbitrary software model of how social networks interact.

Fyi GOOG went up 12% in 1 day yday.

Another way to look at it is that litecoin does not meet market demand other than a small group of people trying to be early adopters.
@_date: 2013-02-07 08:44:17
The perfect mainstream introduction. No difficult explanation of how it works (I.e. mining), just how it is USED. Which is all that matters to the average user.

What a lot of people seem to be missing is that this rally is not more extreme than the previous two. The price rose by roughly 350% and 300% respectively. So far we're at about 200% from the last stable price ($13.5). I don't think $30 and higher is out of the question.
