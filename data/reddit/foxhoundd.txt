Bitcoin dies if there is no utility.

There is a ton of use cases being made for the blockchain technology. No reason it should be limited to being a currency hence all of these altcoins.

The only thing I am concerned with is the massive amount of hype surrounding the lightning network. Feels like people think this will solve all the problems when in reality it's just one more step of evolution. People may be disappointed when it is less than perfect because it was hyped up so much.

If it drops that much you have to look at why and not blindly buy.

Anything remotely critical of bitcoin is either labeled trolling or related to altcoins. It would be nice to see actual discussions with opposing arguments.

As far as coinbase goes, I have bought and sold with no problems. Bitcoin delivery can take some time (3-7 days) which is only bad if you are trying to sell soon or if you panic. I would recommend coinbase based on my experience and considering I live in the US. If anything you can transfer your bitcoin out and use another exchange. Although support is slow on their end, they do follow through which is what matters.
