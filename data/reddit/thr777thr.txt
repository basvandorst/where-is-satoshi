Sometimes the CPU doesnt want to wait for the data it needs to execute some command, so instead of waiting it executes the next command. This is called Out of Order Execution (OoOE) and since the 90's it has sped up contemporary CPU's a lot. Some guys from a university in Graz, Austria have recently figured how to trick the CPU into considering to execute as next command something usually forbidden - like accessing memory that is off limits to normal users. Now, when the CPU considers this command it finds out that the user cannot actually access this forbidden memory and gives an error. But still because it was already preparing for the command because of OoOE some part of the memory was actually moved to a thing called cache. The team of researchers has found out how to read from this cache and how to trick all current Intel processors to do this. 
All of this means that there is a way how to read any data in memory by anyone - cryptographic secrets, passwords, system data, other virtual machines in the cloud. All Intel CPU's are affected, some ARM and even though AMD says it is not affected, they also use some kind of OoOE too.

Meltdown exploits a architectural problem that is in silicone on the dice. The only patch Intel can roll out is actually a change in the physical architecture of the CPU. As for software patches (Linux, Windows, etc) I would be sceptical. They are an immediate remedy but the underlying architectural problem remains.
