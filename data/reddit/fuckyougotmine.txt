Where does the 110M number come from?
@_date: 2011-09-17 02:12:05
someone who thought mtgox was a fucking joke?
just because someone thinks a big business would be retarded to take bitcoins at current market conditions doesnt make them fishy. you are way fishier

threads like this over there are relatively common -- someone has an idea, yes men agree its good, someone with knowledge and experience explains [not necessarily fatal] flaws, and is demonized.  this one just devolved into "lol whores dont know shit, we do." Reading some of their ideas makes sensible people realize what a wretched hive of scum and villany they are, and makes nonsensical people sign up.
is what forum.bitcoin.org should be

im not going to play you little semantic games, nor am i going to debate this useless point.
@_date: 2011-09-17 03:30:07
i wont try to discourage you.   However, im still going to suggest that you think about why your idea needs bitcoins. if its a shit idea, bitcoins wont save it. If its a wonderful idea, is it still wonderful without bitcoins?
 What the community needs is a problem to solve, and to be able to solve it with BTC.
If you want a business, you need something that will keep you fed and sheltered, and that doesnt require bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-06-29 06:07:33
something feels off about using that calculation, in that most btc were mined at low price, and there isnt $110M in demand for them. i dont know how else to value them though; i kinda think you could justify within x10 / x0.01 that value

never attribute to evil robots what you can attribute to stupid meatwads

not every jackass stable is "a wretched hive of scum and villany" 
i mean, lol whores amirite?
@_date: 2011-06-26 03:00:45
are they coming from the main mtgox wallet (bolstering it up) or from new accounts
@_date: 2011-06-24 03:55:35
he's probably short on btc, but he likely has a significant amount of money, though i bet no random account sees anything
good luck dude
@_date: 2011-09-17 03:26:26
i -have- to have a bank account. there is also a contract with banks: they hold my money and use it in exchange for interest or check-writing privledge. Still, they dont hold my physical analog of a wallet.dat

mine's a swiss army knife for trollin. yours, 
your right im emvious

Avoid the wallet hosting. Nothing would convince me to give someone to hold my physical wallet with physical monies, why would i want to do the same with a digital wallet?
Colocation -might- be a good idea, but consider 1) how many people around you mine and are willing to move their rigs, and 2) how many miners will flee as profits dwindle.
edit: if you want a bitcoin business, try to think of something that can only be done with bitcoins. there's no reason to take an existing business idea and tack on BTC and do it poorly: no one really needs Webcams: now with BTC, or SlimJims: BTC accepted. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 05:25:02
If one is going to immediately exchange BTC for local, why not just deal in local? Using BTC like this is using it as a cipher, not as a currency. Ideally, a business would pay wages and buy supplies with BTC they receive for goods and services and avoid things like middleman transactions [and transaction fees]
the point being, many businesses will have trouble reconciling 'using bitcoin' and ' due diligence ' and ' increasing shareholder value '.  the economy needs to be built more, on more flexible actors.
