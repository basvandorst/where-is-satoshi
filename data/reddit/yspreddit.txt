I’ve been enjoying the drops to buy more during the fire sale, so I thought you can join in on the fun. The closest guess by December 2018 at 12 pm PST will win 5% of said accumulated wealth. Closest guess must be within 5% of the total count. Guess must be in BTC. No purchase required. Side effect might include nausea, indigestion, and staring at a chart for too long

Not possible. First to 0.1 but I’m sorry because that’s not possible 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:57:12
That’s why I put the guess around it staying today doesn’t qualify for the game. That’s the likely guess
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:30:27
Hahaha maybe. I’ll be the richest man in BTC

That’s a huge drop you are predicting 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:14:19
I haven’t placed the order. It would be quite easier to guess if I placed the order. You can be quite close to the value but statistically its more difficult to guess the right number. I’m not trying to make it too easy :)

I mean a consecutive drop in value from the previous purchase mark. I’m buying the dip starting yesterday at $8501. So every 10% dip from there I’ll buy $1000 more in value. Next purchase is at $7,650.9 , then $6885.81 and so on. I’ll likely have only the ones I purchased today so I excluded that and a guessing option

What I have isn’t part of the game 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:43:53
Yes of course. First purchase is at $8501 so 0.117633219621221 +/- 5% is not an option since that just means i don’t get to buy anymore after today
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:27:16
Try the percentage. It’s more fun.  If the price drops to $2000, then $500 is a 25% drop, but $200 is a 10% drop

E Z mate. The game is there, but you are not forced to play it
Starting point is $8501
Next buy point is 10% Lower to$7650.9
Then 10% to $6885.81
Then 10% to $6197.23
There is a long way before it hits 0
You the just guessing how low it will go before it starts going back up
Simple but not simple because no body knows 
So umm play or don’t no body cares but you and there is 100% chance you won’t win if you don’t play
