������ I had this same thing over the weekend. Haters be like: Sell! sell! Or it’s a ponzu scheme, it could go to zero. 
Well guess what, so could the stock market, and the 401k savings. That market could lose 50% or more of its value in a hot second. Never to rebound. 
Lots of haters. When we are rich and driving our lambos, these will be the same haters taking negative about our new wealth.
Did you know there are only 20 million bitcoin addresses in use? That’s like 1993 with only 500 websites, and today there are over a billion websites not to mention email addresses.
People are already beginning to talk in satoshis. 
It will not surprise me if some central bank, government, or or institutions find a way to corner the bitcoin market to store the worlds wealth.
It’s nothing for them to print money to buy up bitcoin. Let that sink in.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:13:50
Lite coin will have the same problem of scaling once it becomes like bitcoin. High fees, long transaction times, and shady exchanges.
Someone needs to bring bitcoin or any crypto at the speed of the credit card companies. 
Going to a bitcoin atm and waiting 30-60 mins to get the money out is insane!

I used to be a big fan of CNBC back before the crash of 08. When the crash happened, they were like ��. A big f-ing surprise. These are suppose to be the people to tell investors to watch out for the coming bad weather, but they didn’t. Instead, they sat on their hands like they had no clue what was going on.
And now comes Bitcoin. They hate it. BTC goes against everything and their audience stands for. But they have to accept the realty that the Little Guy can go buy a trezor or a nano and have a mini Swiss bank account in their pocket. 
They can call BTC a fraud and fake all day long. They will never tell you, or educate the pubic on what fiat money is. Just paper with ink. Zero inherent value. With BTC, I trust the math and the code.

The transaction time will not change anytime soon. The fees will remain high. This is internet gold! Bitcoin is for rich people to hold and store their value. The market is pushing those short term hodlers out. Giving it to us on the cheap. And we get even more richer. Thank you to all those this holiday season selling BTC. It makes it cheaper for me to buy! ��������

It will not surprise me if central banks will use their fiat currency to buy bitcoin. They can create money out of nothing to buy bitcoin and raise the price. 
Right now there are only 20 million bitcoin addresses in use. There are over 1 BILLION websites on the internet. We are just at the beginning of something that is about to change history. 
In 2018, the crash will happen with the global economy. People will have no place to park their money except in gold, oil, and bitcoin. 
Many countries are backing away from the US dollar being their reserve. 
The stock market, bond market, housing market, are all in a bubble. Why won’t the talking heads on CNBC talk about that? A bubble is when something is trading for a higher price beyond its value. The global financial market is in a bubble! 
And this is why we have bitcoin. We are all buying pieces of a lottery ticket. It’s taking vision to see that a major transfer of wealth, the greatest In history is taking place.

In my opinion, no! Because you have the major played and institutions involved in the game. They want the bitcoins from the Little players. Fear and greed are in the mix. 
Next year when the market in the US crashes, BTC will be waaay too expensive for people to get in. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:35:04
That’s why I put money in everyday. I rallied on the pump of some altcoins. �������� and bought more coins. One day everyone will have a bitcoin address like an email address. And when that happens, those who even have 1/10 of a coin will be counted among the wealthy in 5 years.
 
A major shift of wealth is about to take place. The baby boomers are dying out or retiring. It’s a major shake up of money.

Most of the world think I am idiot for hodling bitcoins. I’ll take it as a compliment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:43:49
I see the whole crypto market sinking in price even more toward x-mas. And then a massive jump right after it’s over. 
I think many of the small hodlers panicked. They cashed out. They couldn’t stomach this crazy ride. It’s very possible for all of the altcoins to drop 50% or more. If most people can’t see ahead beyond a week, I don’t expect them to have the vision to see into the coming 12 months. 
Most of the coins got pumped. Now there is a dump.  Great! I bought some coins during a pump. I’m down 40%. I’m hodling and buying more.

At this point in the game, accountants need to services these types of transactions to make sure all tax obligations are paid.
I cannot recommend anyone. However, you need to keep in mind fees for selling the coins. 
There is a misconception that the IRS is out to “get” people who own bitcoin or other altcoins.
If we were trading in the stock market, we would be expected to pay tax on our gains. 
The IRS just wants their cut of our earnings. This is just like any other investment or business that’s making a profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:10:53
They don’t realize that the definition of money has changed. I was on the internet in 1993. People thought it was stupid. Some kind of upper class luxury. And now, if you don’t have an email address, people think you still live in the 80s.
Most people have been programmed to go to work, get paid, and then store their wealth into fiat currency to pay off debts! This is why you have to work 2 and 3 jobs to live in America. Everybody has a car note, a mortgage, student loans, and credit card debt. 
So when bitcoin is at 1 million, and yes it is possible if all the millionaires each bought one coin, all of these people will be in tears they missed the boat.

You can begin  to mine other altcoins by building a rig.
Also, there is bitcoin arbitrage. Google that. 
Trading exchanges:
Trade placing limit orders.
There are also trading bots written in Python. Those are used to make automatic trades. 
Then value investing in some coins for the long term being 6 months or more. There are a lot of coins in the top 100 on coinmarketcap.
I like to buy on dips and put the gains into bitcoin for long term holding. 
Those are just some ideas in making money at this full time

BItcoin is the doorway into the crypto world. If you want the altcoins out, you’d want to take them out in BTC. There are those who say you can cash out in litecoin.
But right now, if you want some fiat cash back you either have to get it back in bitcoin, use a bitcoin atm, sell on localcoins, or use an exchange(which I don’t trust any) to move your money into fiat again. 
And all of the velocity, the higher and the more it’s used and circulated, makes it more valued. And also Bitcoin has the position around the world as THE Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:28:52
I told someone I owned bitcoin today and they looked at me like an idiot. And yesterday a friend of mine suggested I should sell out since he can’t get any of his money back from coinbase.
The truth is that bitcoin is not for everyone. When bitcoin is at $200,000 or more next time this year, just watch how all those naysayers are going to change on you. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:51
It is my opinion that it is a long attempt to get us to sell our bitcoins. Most people are holding under $5000 USD in BTC. The institutions and the wealthy want in on the action now.

Just to let you know. I don’t find coinbase or gdax good for getting money in or out through wire transfers. They care only good if you are paying with a credit card.
Also I don’t keep anything on the coinbase exchanges. They can shut down at anytime. And especially when there is a surge in buying or selling. 
And currently, many of the exchanges are not taking new customers. It’s been that serious. So for 2018, expect more people to jump in.
As for the fast way to get fiat, try to see if there is a bitcoin atm machine in your area. You can also buy bitcoin through localbitcoin. You can either meet in person or pay via PayPal.
This was the way people bought their first bitcoins anyway. Either you mined them or you bought them from a person directly or through the mail.

Hindsight is 20/20!  Back in the day, the only way to even get bitcoin before Mt. Gox was to mine them yourself, or pay someone in cash via mail or in person.  We are still in the early adoption phase. Just think of what AOL was to the Internet, Coinbase is to bitcoin. 
When a billion people own and trade in bitcoin on this planet, just even having 1/10 of a coin is going to make you wealthy.
But back in the day, it was a very sketchy climate back then in the early days. 
If you look at the charts, economic unrest in Greece and Zimbabwe have set off the bitcoin to new highs.
Bitcoin is now a portable store of value and wealth.
Major things behind the scenes on political levels had to take place for bitcoin to be what it is right now.
And guess what? The more countries that experience civil unrest, the more bitcoin will be the go to way to store wealth, making it portable across borders.

I am aware of how this works. The private keys are stored on the phone. If you are storing a few hundred dollars. Fine. It’s a good tool. However, I would never store $100,000 in USD on a phone like that. It’s a security risk with you and the phone together. Just use your imagination. Think. Someone knows you have 100 bitcoins on the blockchain. The phone has the private keys. Now you, your precious fingers, and your phone become targets. Hackers will no doubt find it easier to target users of this kind of phone for attacks.

South Korea, Japan, Western countries using their credit cards were driving up the price of BTC. A lot of people were getting loans and borrowing on margins. 
Now that credit card purchases of BTC are banned, loans tapped out, people are cashing out to pay for taxes, and to declare losses.
The next bull run wit be with a populace in trouble with their currency like Zimbabwe or Greece.
BTC got a lot of hype in 2017.  Now we are in a correction. Don’t be surprised BTC at $2000 in 2018.
And as for institutional investors, putting money into BTC is like picking up a cigarette butt. They have enough money to make their own cryptocurrency. They can throw six figure incomes at developers. 
BTC needs to reach critical mass for wide adoption. How about America, Germany, France, and the UK take it on? BTC needs a strong push from at least three wealthy countries to moon and to get thar LAMBO. 
So for now, sit tight, and just wait out this bear market, and don’t be silly and “buy the dip”.  Who came up with that foolish investing advice anyway?’
I’m buying when most of the HODLERS are in panic. Right now I’m just smelling fear.

No. That’s the coming reality. When you look around, you see that most people to not understand business cycles. Boom and busts. Economies always go into recessions and crash. This happens to correct and purify the market of greed, liars, and cheaters. 
So when the market takes a hit, the average person on the street thinks it’s coming from out of nowhere.
They don’t understand money. And thanks to the internet, a new generation has access to the information of what money is and isn’t, and basic fundamental principles of economics. 
Meanwhile, while the banks and financial institutions are hating on the bitcoin, they love the blockchain and are racing fast to implement it. But the average person on the street is and will still be clueless. 
So why is that? Because they know that in about 20 years, the millineals will be running the planet. And they don’t believe in this fiat currency-fractional reserve bullshit. They look at it as a government Ponzi scheme.
But we, as bitcoin holders are no longer wearing the hoodwink. There will be some major rise and tides. Ups and downs to make the stomach queasy. But we have to hold on and do not sell our bitcoins. That’s what the masses will do. And then they do sell, that’s when bitcoin is on sale. And institutions will come in and buy them cheap.
This industry is in its early adopter phase. 
I was using eBay in selling in 1997. Most people thought eBay and the internet was a scam. And now guess what, everyone is on the internet, it’s on every smart phone. And all you need to do is smack a button to access the internet. 
And thus, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The early adopters who hold on will be very wealthy in the future. A major shift in wealth is about to take place. Get ready.  
I will see you at the top.

Just keep in find just from peer to peer, it takes 10 minutes on the blockchain. Then the third party such as coinbase publishes the information back to you. 
Personally I keep some of my bitcoins outside of coinbase. With them, you really don’t have direct access to your private key. That’s why it’s good you have a trezor. But have multiple wallets that are not online, or some app on a phone. They can all be ultimately compromised.
