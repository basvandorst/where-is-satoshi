I made few withdrawals before, but this never happened. I already partially did what you suggested 2FA and e-mail confirmation, I just don't need locked withdrawal address this time because I'm paying for service and this address changes frequently.
After 2FA and confirmation code it says withdrawal request submitted successfully, but after that I don't receive an confirmation e-mail and on the "Withdrawal" page it just says "canceled".

You should be banned for historical fraud and manipulation you made in the past with your "service". When bitcoin market was small, you moved people like sheep by using first mover advantage, plus you took money for that from people and you were telling them 50% that it will go up, 50% it will go down, my grandma can do that, you are probably doing the same thing again.
Good thing is that you lost most of your BTC, because someone up there is watching.
Right now, you can't do anything because market is much bigger, I don't know why you even try. People stay away from this "expert"!

I hate when this happens, I was in a such a hurry and now I have to wait for their support to respond. When you see minutes, it usually happens that it takes daaaays :(

Yes, I forgot that we are bitcoin community where uber crashes live :D Ethereum lost 7% compared to USD (9% compared to BTC) in a blink of an eye and this might be the start of the bigger crash, so don't say that I didn't warn you on time :D
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:11:22
Ethereum crashes, since this news was posted on Ethereum Reddit 2 hours ago:

If I remember well, the CEO of Bitfinex admitted in one interview that he is TRADING on his own platform, but not too much?! I wanted to give Bitfinex a try, but when I have listen to that interview, I said to myself, no way. It's completely unprofessional method to run a business.
Bitfinex == MtGox2

Brothers of the mine rejoice!
Swing, swing, swing with me
Raise your pick and raise your voice!
Sing, sing, sing with me
Down and down into the deep
Who knows what we'll find beneath?
Diamonds, rubies, gold and more
Hidden in the mountain store
Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free
Come on brothers sing with me!
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole
The sunlight will not reach this low
Deep, deep in the mine
Never seen the blue moon glow
Dwarves won't fly so high
Fill a glass and down some mead!
Stuff your bellies at the feast!
Stumble home and fall asleep
Dreaming in our mountain keep
Born underground, grown inside a rocky womb
The earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become our tomb
Face us on the battlefield; you will meet your doom
We do not fear what lies beneath
We can never dig too deep

Well at first I wanted to buy from him. I looked at his first post in the thread and he did not explained where from gift cards arrive. At the bottom of his first post it says:


Gift cards don't grow on the tree, they are usually purchased via credit cards, so this is not a elimination of fraud suspicion.
Then I visited last pages of his thread, in order to find some evidence, maybe he explained meanwhile. I found that people ask him where gift cards are coming from. He was like, I cant explain, read my thread. His thread has 29 pages, so I was no lazy and started reading because I really needed a new cell phone. I could not find a single evidence or explanation how those gift cards were purchased, all I could find were evidences that he is a scammer.
I said to myself this was close, I could have been busted because of this guy...
@_date: 2015-04-18 09:45:15
You show the same type of behavior on bitcointalk whenever someone ask you too much question, you start with insults and threats. You are a completely insecure person and you don't have a single argument for your actions, you as any other scammer.
@_date: 2015-04-18 09:15:21
I have read every single post in your thread and there in not a single line that explains the source of your gift cards.
All I could find are people asking you to explain in your OP where those cards are coming from and you telling them to read all posts in your thread, because you know that no one will go thru 30 pages of your thread.
Don't try to push misleading information that some piece of evidence is hidden somewhere in your thread, it's not.

This is great! :D

If he acquires gift cards on Localbitcoins for 30-40% with a goal to resell them on Bitcointalk for 25%, then he must be very naive or maybe completely aware that those gift cards are bought with stolen credit card.
If you ask me he exactly knows what he is doing, bitcoin mixing, buying accounts, not trading on Purse &lt;25%, sock puppets theater on Bitcointalk etc...
Him not knowing the gift card source is harmful for people who buy those gift card from him. For him and his counterparty on Localbitcoins there is no risk at all, only suspect in this crime investigation would be the end user, in this case Bitcointalk user who buys those gift cards.

We are talking about 205.86869014 BTC earned in 2 months:
He cant get this amount of money on mechanical turk nor amazon associates. Even if he can in some mysterious earn this amount of money on mechanical turk or amazon associates, he can cash out from those websites to his bank account without losing 25%. He is definitely not using any of those websites, he is probably a carder or he gets Amazon gift cards from carders.
@_date: 2015-04-18 10:53:58
Even if you are right, he cant make this amount of money by using amazon associates or mechanical turk.
What amount of money we are talking about, 205.86869BTC in two months with an average BTC price in this period USD252.3 and his discount of 25%, we are getting $70000.
Let's assume that he is a top Amazon Associate with max. 8,5% fee, it means that he his website sold $825000 worth of Amazon products and his commission was $70000 in two months. This is highly unlikely, even best Amazon Associates don't get this amount of money, even for a year.
According to Google, average income on Mechanical Turk is 1-5$/hour, much below minimum wage, so this scenario is also highly unlikely, I could even say impossible.

On Purse.io at least you have some protection:

There is a simple reasoning behind his actions. Thief would not be able to complete verification process on Coinbase or CeX.io, it's questionable, would he be able to use Tor on Coinbase, etc... When thief steals or obtains stolen card, he has couple of hours to get rid of it, before the credit card is actually blocked by the bank. That is his motivation to give a huge discount, he has couple of hours before real credit card owner calls his bank to report card theft. Amazon gift cards have fast turnover and they are usually a favorite choice among credit card thiefs.
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:22:46
Cash... highly unlikely that he would act like this. Cheques...maybe, but until he provides print screen(s) of his affiliate marketing account(s) this theory is also highly unlikely.

Hey, relax, you already covered all trail, FBI will need much more time to catch you. Maybe a little less time because you forgot the hide your gravatar on the Purse screenshot :D
@_date: 2015-04-18 09:40:19
FBI investigation could take **up to 24 months**, so it can take a lot more until fraud reports appear on the Bitcointalk. I guess that you will disappear much earlier, probably in a couple of months.
Yes, you sold really a lot **205.86869014 BTC** worth of Amazon gift cards since you opened your Bitcointalk account 2 months ago:
You have covered the trails with **bitcoin mixing** and you will probably vanish in a couple of months when first fraud reports appear on Bitcointalk.
I have posted a link in the first post, it shows that **you bought A Purse account** on bitcointalk, I will post it again:
I have posted the same screenshot in my first post in order to prove that you are not using a Purse at all, here's the screenshot again:
**Your username is hidden** (reason: probably username of a previous account owner), number of your completed transactions in hidden, not a single active transaction is show in this screenshot, **0 BTC in the escrow**. Considering the trade volume of 205.86869014 BTC  in a period of 2 months, you should at least have 10-20 active trades in this screenshot. You probably bought this Purse account just to make this screenshot.
Another proof, there are **literally thousands of USD currently in offers on Purse at a lot less discount than 25%** and you are scamming people only on bitcointalk.

Amazon4u you will not laugh when FBI gets you.
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:01:23
Too much, blah, blah and no quality information from you. You are following the usual scammer pattern, when someone asks questions you yell, insult people, play with misleading info, offering replacement thesis etc.
Cut the crap, we are still waiting to hear what is the source of your Amazon gift cards! You are failing to explain that for 2 and a half months!
