Your analogy only makes your case as long as you believe (and everyone else agrees) that the US will be able to continue paying ever larger debt bills. And that the amount of money they print in the mean time won't devalue the dollar so much that the currency you are repaid is worth less than the currency you loaned...
Basically, your analogy rests on the notion that the US government is fundamentally equal to an extremely responsible, intelligent investor...
I'm not sure that can be taken as a given.

Please help me understand why capitalizing on the arbitrage that existed prior to the freeze was not simple. I thought there must have been some catch, but couldn't figure out what it was. I opened a Gox account to try to exploit it, but the freeze happened before I was able to fund the account.

I was wondering how far down I would have to read before finding someone to point this out.

Right... Until the president of the nation that holds itself up as the greatest bastion of capitalism and property rights turns around and nationalizes all gold held in private hands.
Is that part of the "universally understood property law"?

I haven't read all of it yet, so I'm not sure where I'm coming down... That first article certainly raised good points. I really don't like creating artificial scarcity in blockchain space, but I haven't yet gotten to a convincing proposition about how to incentivize miners after the end of the mining reward. I very much appreciate you putting together those links, they were exactly what I was looking for.

What makes you think that government is so much more effective at curbing sociopaths than anything the private sector could offer? Can you think of any other service that is better off when the service provider is allowed to use force to grant itself a monopoly? 
A lot of people are under the delusion that money can only possibly work when backed by a government monopoly...

Could you explain or link to discussion about why block saturation would be disastrous to bitcoin?

They don't have any today. "Their" representatives don't represent them, and the police sure as shit don't work for them. 


I guess corruption and abuse of power never go unchecked in Europe? Impressive. I guess we only need a free society over here.

The question to ask yourself is whether there is really any advantage to be had by granting a monopoly on force (aka government). It's pretty well understood in most other products and services that monopolies are bad for the consumer. 
Polycentric law wouldn't be perfect, but the notion that it would lead to warlords is simplistic. We already have polycentric law among nations. War isn't non-existent, but its prevalence is declining. 
War is not cost effective for any but those pulling the strings. It takes justifications and motivations like religious or nationalist rhetoric to get soldiers to risk their lives against their interests in all but defensive actions...
For instance, if a security company wished to behave like modern police and enforce a ridiculous war on drugs, the amount it would be necessary to pay "mercenaries" to kick down doors of potentially armed "offenders" would make the program difficult to finance without the ability to demand taxes from people who don't support the objective.

There are such people. Why on earth do you think there would be more of a problem with them in a free society? Right now we give them badges and you can't do a damn thing about it. If you were free to choose which security provider received your funding, don't you think keeping some of the sociopaths who currently can't be fired from various police forces would turn into a major liability for these greedy companies? If 2% of my customer base might leave over a single high publicity use of force incident, don't you think I'm going to be pretty selective about who I let parade around with my logo on their shirt? No such mechanism exists today. You *have to* pay your glorious leaders to provide security services, regardless of how terrible the product is...

Money certainly would grant you some latitude... but do you think you'd be able to rape and murder children at will? I suspect you'd find it very difficult to maintain anyone to work on your personal security force if you behaved badly. Not to mention your neighbors would be likely to unite against you... Paying for your own security does not equate to making all of your own rules without regard to the moral sensibilities of the people around you.

Get ready for KYC laws to get tighter still.

The medical industry is the most effective cartel in the United States (next to the government, I suppose). If you don't believe that, try to sell your own health product or advice. Whether you have done quality research to back up your claims is much less important than whether you have made your offerings to and asked permission of the powers that be.
Should it really be illegal for me to seek out the medical advice of a retired nurse who holds no current official credentials? What about an internet educated individual? Of course it's possible to get quacks in such a situation, but that's what the reputation system is about.
This project could be big precisely _because_ it offers the opportunity to bypass the toxic regulatory environment which hamstrings and drives up costs in traditional medicine.

Syde80 answered the question. The payout address is part of the hashes you are calculating, meaning that you can't play it both ways. If you find a good hash, it is only valid to send the money to the pool's payout address.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:58:49
The problem with that is that you can only ever trust a hash if _you_ calculate it. If you ask my software to hash itself and send the result, I can simply wait a moment (to act like I'm thinking), then return the pre-calculated hash of the legit software.

Great explanation. Thanks! I knew it had to be baked into the protocol. The rest of Bitcoin is just too well thought out for a gaping hole like that..
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:49:12
Since many of the "approved" clients are open source, it seems like it would be trivial to modify one to behave as a normal pool participant until it finds a successful hash, then suddenly behave as a solo miner.
I have a moderate interest in digital security, and I'm fairly certain that there's no way to detect or prevent such a thing, unless it is somehow built into the mining protocol.
