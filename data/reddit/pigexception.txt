You don't have to buy anything. How about that as a reminder? This all space is getting filled with fucking bloodsuckers.

Actually, since Roger Ver keeps calling the real Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core", we should really create a bitcoin fork that would be called "Bitcoin Core", that would confuse shit.

Happened on every bull run before, will happen again.

How somebody in this day of age be factually 44-45 years old?

hint: they stop holding :D

So just to clarify, the updates are already written, they only need to be tested? Is there any deadline for that?
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:04:49
That kid showed some important uses for the fiat money. Can Bitcoin do that? I don't think so.

Honestly, more advanced woowoo is still a woowoo. At least be entertaining, god damn.

It is the same thing as to say that the Christian Church can start "doing science" too.

The point is that the two diverge from the very beginning :)
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:06:57
Yeah,  is still ok. Actually looking at the list, all the ones I recognize were crypto trash so youtube just decided to take it out. Good move ��
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:21:04
it is wordpress, but close enough.

So it's just cuz:

What is a stable market? NASDAQ went 77% down in 2 years in 2000-02, then 50% again 2008-10, gold went &gt;60% down between 1980-1982, now it is down 36% since 2011
oil went down 75% in 2008, then up 200% and down again 75% between 2014-16, currently it is in pretty steep decline. 
This 100% negativity is as unfounded just as much as all that "bitcoin will replace USD" in 2017.

good. gives a feeling that it was built by one of us :P

I would say the addiction is similar to the addiction you get for a good TV show.

What is the reasoning behind 14 days wait to readjust the difficulty?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:13:22
Too early to tell. The ones that are celebrating are either stupid media or people who just got hit pretty bad. I am personally looking for a decent confirmation to get back in. It would be nice to retest 6k or something like that and form a double bottom. The only problem though is whether the bull market will continue, because if the December was not the peak of a bubble, then what the hell is going to be?
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:36:15
There will be 21M bitcoins only, so maybe it has something to do with that.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:45:34
I know this is not a productive/constructive comment, but this Alex Jones guy is a fucking idiot; makes even Ver look good.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:34:22
so the next phase is "return to normal"?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:47:18
To be fair, you need to have really high IQ to understand this.
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:08:10
Do you even "preliminary analysis", bro?
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:17:48
Finally, finally, some sober comments in here.

I wonder who survive winters better, bears or bulls? It is getting quite chilly here, no?

"Keep track of your bags" I like the touch :D
