China, like all governments, wants to figure out how to tax. monitor or control the crypto economy.  This is a struggle far deadlier than FUD. Any country trying to "make it work" is doing the obvious attempt to end-run the next step in human evolution.

The globalist shill (sorry for the immediate ad hominem) is playing cute with the word "fraud".  He makes the false equivocation between a new form of money finding acceptance and the counterfeited and debased government paper fiats.  Fiats are frauds, and cryptos are pushing them out.  Painting both with the same brush is the thought process of a con artist.

It holds your actual private key.  The coins are on the blockchain, so if the device is destroyed, the 12 secret words will recreate the wallet on a new Trezor. The difference here is that the exchanges, like Coinbase, actually have your private key, which means your coins can (and have been) stolen from an exchange (MTGox).

I would love to answer any specific question you might have.  A world view is a big comment.

For those who bought early and low, and are now in the possession of value far above their "basis" , every purchase now is probably now subject to capital gains tax (15% USD). The administrative burden that would exist for the government to verify all these transaction may bring it to its knees (and of course be impossible). Not sure that bugs me too much.  This bill is strange acceptance of this reality, but a serious nose under the tent problem for them.  I agree it won't pass.

Certainly "in the end" Bitcoin may not be the last one(s) standing.  A move against a specific currency is a first move.  The overthrow, whenever, will only happen after many years of parallel use.  Some smaller governments may seize the opportunity to let the crypto capital flow.  China will either turnaround (loss of face), announce a gold-back Yuan, or arrest several thousand.  And that's just in the next year.  Let's watch!

We can think of the crypto being many small businesses tearing at the establishment.  Seeing Microsoft or IBM trying to do crypto is a bit comic, as they have failed to innovate for a decade.  They may certainly try to get the government to favor their flawed version of crypto, as cronies always do.  If they can draw attention while the real web 2.0 is built, then the fun irony will be evident.

A political change due to crypto may be the only way to NOT cause the deaths of millions.  The death of a government is not the death o its people.  The Chinese people have done and will do far better the more their outdated rulers are made insignificant.  
Big things, big changes start because of small ones.  We are well past the small part.

Totally agree about the miners.  Seeing how both Russia and Japan are making mining moves to fill any gap, I find it so limited that those party guys are ignoring the power shift.  Rather cut off their own noses to spite their faces.

Didn't say the first part about the other bans.  This is a first step and many to come.  You admit to fiat currency controls prior to adoption, but do not recognize that blockchain adoption and government controls are mutually exclusive.  Private money removes the ability of a government to steal via inflation.  They can still demand taxes at the end of a gun, but they cannot steal while you sleep.   Big change comes from small things, history proves this.

As Crypto becomes a reality, these attacks will come daily.  They will be in denial long after they are laughingstocks.

Totally agree.  The USG hasn't made their first really big stupid move against crypto.
