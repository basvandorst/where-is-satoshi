At the time that I wrote that, it was something like 1-14 blocks for inclusion.  Now it is slightly longer, 3-14.  That's still just about an hour.
If you increase your fee by about 30-40% you drop down to an average transaction time of half an hour and your transaction will almost certainly confirm within an hour.
Now compare this to alternate forms of moving your money.  Moving money through an ACH transfer takes days, a wire transfer takes a day or two.  Sending a gold coin or a wad of cash through the mail takes several days.  None of these methods work in the middle of the night, on weekends, or holidays.  Bitcoin, as it exists now, is much faster and much cheaper than the alternatives.

Do what manually?  If I understand correctly, the address in question is the GDAX address that you were told to send it to.

Use a wallet that allows you to pick fees.  Then look at a site like this: 
At the time that I am posting this, I see that 100 sat/byte would be a good fee.  An average transaction is about 250 bytes, and the current price is 11,362.84 so that comes out to $2.88 for a non-segwit transaction.  A segwit transaction should be even cheaper.
If you are paying more than $3 for a transaction then you are overpaying.  A segwit transaction should be much less, under $1

This is definitely not taxable, but it could (in a very small way) factor into the taxes that you pay.
Let's say that you buy $1000 worth of bitcoin.  You transfer it to your wallet for $10 in fees.  You now have $990 worth of bitcoin.  It doubles in value and then you sell it for $1980, well actually you sell it for $1970 because you had to pay another transaction fee  You have a capital gain of $970.  You put down the $970 in capital gains on your tax form.
if you get audited you need to have all of this information available, so that the IRS can see all of the steps of the process.
The only taxable event is the transfer of bitcoin.  It doesn't matter whether you are selling Bitcoin for dollars, or altcoins, or if you spend them to buy something.

Swapping it for something else covers using bitcoin to buy stuff.  If you buy an altcoin with bitcoin that is a taxable event.  If you give a gift of bitcoin to your brother that is a taxable event.  If you pay an employee with bitcoin that is a taxable event.
Now obviously (hopefully?) the government isn't monitoring your moves super closely, so for small transactions no one is going to expect you to pay taxes.  However, if you buy $100,000 worth of Dogecoin with half a dozen bitcoins you probably should send the government a check, even though you received DOGE instead of GBP for the bitcoin.  If not. you run the risk of punishment if the exchange reports the transaction to the government.

The purpose of money is to coordinate the usage of resources.  We do this through a communication method - prices.
Governments and banks (which are really just a branch of the government) interfere with this communication through inflation.  By inflating the currency they direct resources towards themselves and away from the people.  This allows them to increase the size of government, by allocating resources to fraud, waste, and abuse.
Bitcoin's inflation is now much lower than fiat inflation and will eventually taper off to nothing.  Bitcoin is neutral money - it doesn't favor anyone.

No.  When you buy on an exchange you are credited bitcoin into your account.  The exchange retains the bitcoin until you withdraw the bitcoin to your own wallet.  That withdrawal is an actual bitcoin transaction and at that point you have the actual bitcoins.
So what you can do is you send a big lump of money to the exchange, then you spend 10% of it per day buying bitcoin.  At this point you are paying exchange fees, and technically you don't have any bitcoin.  After 10 days the money is all spent.  Now you have the exchange send the money to your wallet.  This is a bitcoin transaction and someone has to pay a fee to record the transaction in the block chain.  Some exchanges will pay the fee for you, others will make you pay the fee.  Now you have real bitcoins in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:47:49

Cash out the minimum that you need so that you don't need to worry about getting food onto the table.  Something like rent and groceries for one month.  When you go to buy your groceries don't buy the same stuff that you always do.  Instead buy in bulk: 20 pounds of rice, the largest bottle of oil, the biggest package of toilet paper, etc...
Now you have some breathing space.  As money comes in you won't have half a dozen pressing needs to spend it on.  You can take more time to make your purchases, you can buy smarter and save more money.  That's all most people living paycheck-to-paycheck really need - breathing space - and all you need to get it is one month of money.
Leave the rest in bitcoin and only cash out for emergencies.

Here's the thing though: you obviously didn't do your research.  If you had done your research you would know that a $300 dip isn't even considered a dip.  So if you come here posting about a non-dip then people are going to laugh at you, because you invested in something that you clearly didn't research at all.
If you can't handle an 80% dip you aren't ready for bitcoin.  I survived a 94% dip.  Imagine if the price went below $1000.  That is what a 94% dip would look like today.
Just look at the charts and stop worrying.  Maybe you would have been better off waiting a few weeks to buy, but maybe the price will be much higher in a few weeks.  No one can really predict it, so just get in and enjoy the ride.

It really isn't that simple at all.
First of all, you need $10,000 for the BTC and enough money to protect your margin calls on the short.  Let's say that you, like the market, expect BTC to hit $20,000 by the end of the contract.  So you need to have 44% of $20,000 and keep that on the CBOE exchange.  That's $8,800 that just sits there.  So right there your minimum safe upfront investment is $18,800.  However the price could easily go far beyond $20,000 so you will want to have much more in the way of margin otherwise you risk losing your position.
Ok, so I have $15,000 on CBOE and $10,000 on Gemini. I buy a bitcoin on Gemini and short one on CBOE.  When all is said and done my gains and losses cancel and I gain $10,000 in profit, minus fees and taxes.  Maybe I made $7,000 in profit.
So now I look at things and see that I had $25,000 in capital locked up and I made $7,000.  That's 28%, pretty amazing... but I could have invested in Bitcoin.  The price went from $10,000 to $20,000 remember?  So I could have made 100% profit, going from $25,000 to $50,000.  Much of that would be tax free because you can easily control capital gains taxes to keep your effective rate low.
That's the best case scenario.  What happens if my $15,000 margin isn't enough?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:39:49
Well not exactly.  The capital gains tax rates won't change, but due to different deductions your taxable income will change which in turn will mean that your capital gains will partially (or completely) fall into different tax brackets.  As someone with lots of children, I expect to pay slightly more in capital gains under the new system, but overall I will come out ahead.

Bitcoin transactions take inputs and produce outputs.  Inputs and outputs can be of any denomination, expressed in a 64 bit integer.  Outputs of old transactions become the inputs of new transactions.  Inputs are completely consumed by transactions, so transactions usually produce two outputs: the money that you want to send, and a change output.

You have the causation backwards.
A fixed number of bitcoins are produced each day, 1800.  Miners compete over those 1800 bitcoins per day.  The harder miners fight over those coins, the harder it becomes to mine coins, so the rate at which they are produced does not change.
In a purely efficient market, the cost of mining those coins would rise (or fall) to the price of those coins.  The price of bitcoin drives the cost of mining, not the other way around.
The market is not efficient, because mining requires specialized computer hardware.  Most of this hardware is manufactured by the largest mining company.

No, miners have absolutely no ability to influence the price.  They work for us. Many of them are actively hostile to bitcoin, but they can't do anything about it because we have them by the balls.
The price is determined by supply and demand, like any other commodity.
Supply comes from two sources.  The main source is not new coins, but coins held by people who invested in bitcoin a while back.
Demand comes from two sources: new people getting into bitcoin, and people who already have bitcoin buying more.
The price is the amount of money that buyers need to spend to convince long-term holders to part with their bitcoins.  It has nothing to do with miners or the cost of mining.  Nothing.

Yes, volatility is going to be crazy.  Big players can take large positions in Bitcoin for tens of millions of dollars.  Then they can take even bigger positions in Bitcoin derivatives.  They can pump and dump in Bitcoin and what they lose in slippage they will more than make back on the derivative side.
We're going to see extreme volatility for at least a year.  By the time the dust settles we're going to see a semi-stable price much higher than the current price.

Bitcoin started with the release of the original bitcoin program.  It was a node, could mine bitcoins with your CPU, and it was an unsecured wallet.  At some point the mining feature was taken away (because GPU mining had completely taken over) and a few years later you could put a password on your wallet.  This software was eventually renamed "Bitcoin Core" and is now mainly used just to act as a node.
Most bitcoins were not on MtGox when it failed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:23:37
I don't fully understand how this works, could you please explain it in detail.


Yes, so you lose your margin.  But are you able to get out of your short position?
Here is how I understand it, correct me if I am wrong:
1) I want to short bitcoin.  The price of a future is $20,000.  I sell one for that price, and I put down the 35% margin required, $7000.
2) The price of a bitcoin increases to $30,000 the next day.  The price of the future cannot go up by more than 20% so the price of the future is $24,000.  I put $4000 in so that my margin is fine.
3) The price of a bitcoin increases to $40,000 the next day, but the price of the future only goes up to 28,800 because of the 20% limit.  I  have to come up with $4800 but I decide that I won't or can't put more money in.  What happens?
Obvious that money will come out of my margin, so now it is down to $2200.  I want to cut my losses and want to close my position.  To do that I have to buy a long position that matches my short.  Then the two will cancel out and I will be free.
However... I can't buy a long position.  Who would sell a long for $28,800 when a bitcoin is worth $40,000?

On April 28th the price hit an all-time high of $2.  It continued to rise and then on June 8th the price peaked at $34.  That's 41 days of gains to get from $2 to $34.  Then the price gradually went down to a new low of $2 before starting to rise again.  Only 41 days of gains were lost in that decline.


On October 18th 2013 bitcoin hit a new high of $152.  The price peaked on November 30th, 43 days later.  Then it declined to $152 before starting to rise again.  So even at its lowest we had only lost 43 days of gains.

Here is how you grab your private keys if you know their addresses:
Then you import them into a new Electrum Wallet:
From there you should move the coins to a new address, preferably a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.
After you've moved your coins from your Electrum wallet (which controls the same coins as your wallet.dat, if you knew all of your addresses), then download Electron Cash.  Import the same private keys into it.  This will give you access to your Bcash.  Send those to Changelly in exchange for real bitcoin.  I'm not sure how you would go about getting your bitcoin gold.  I had mine on a Trezor and Trezor did it for me.
Ok now you're done, right?  No, keep waiting for your node to sync.  I thought I was done but then suddenly another bitcoin appeared in my wallet.  It was from a transaction that I had totally forgotten about.

Talk it over with her, discuss where you think the price will go, and how that can work towards your mutual goals in the future (house, security for children, retirement, etc...)
If she says that she wants to save the bitcoin to work towards mutual goals with you, then you know that you've found a keeper.
If she tries to hold you to your promise for a trip and a ring at the expense of your future together.... that means that she isn't so certain that you will have a future together.  That is very valuable information.

$0, day trading is for chumps.
If you want to make money here is what you do:
take your $1400 and set a limit order a few cents lower than the current price.  It should fill pretty quickly unless the price moves upwards steadily.  If it hasn't filled within 15 minutes then cancel it and make a new limit order a few cents lower than the new price.  Keep doing this until an order goes through.
Then do nothing.  Never day trade.

$17,000 can be a lot of money, trust me - I've been poor before.  $17,000 can also be nothing -  if you are affluent.  It just depends on where you are in your life and chances are if you live in a first world country you will be poor at some point in your life, but you will also be affluent at some point in your life.

Click on "Depth chart" in the upper right.  Then move your mouse to the price you are interested in.  The tooltip that pops up will say how many bitcoins need to be bought to get to that price.
Note that this is only for one exchange (GDAX).  So the purchases would all have to be on that exchange, and only on that exchange would the price go to that level.  To get all of the exchanges to that level would take even more money, less on smaller exchanges and more on bigger exchanges.

I was in Iraq.  So much talk on the TV was about the national level government.  It didn't matter at all in real life.  There were completely different power structures, everything was so much more decentralized and local.
For example supposedly we were fighting Al-Qaeda.  That was just a brand name, and people set up their own franchises.  When the US came in we dismissed their army (huge mistake) and started fresh.  All of those dismissed officers needed jobs.  So what you do is you find a local man to be your sponsor.  The sponsor contacts his brother who emigrated to Bulgaria or wherever, to work one of the jobs that "Bulgarians don't want".  The brother in Bulgaria wants to be a good muslim, so he sends money for jihad.  So now the officer has money, so he goes to a town and hires a group of young men with nothing to do.  He contracts them for one mission, maybe shoot some rockets or set up a bomb.  If they do good work he hires them again.  They take pictures and send them to the local sponsor and his brother in Bulgaria.
This model was actually pretty good for us.  It meant that most people were just doing it as a job and so they weren't really committed to actually killing us.  There were a couple of guys who seemed to be making their bombs deliberately too weak.  We didn't make hunting them down a priority.  They got their pictures and got paid for their bombs, we didn't lose any people or equipment to them, maybe a flat tire once.
So then you see news about what Al-Qaeda is planning, who its leaders are, etc... what the Iraqi President said his response will be, etc... and you just laugh.  Its just a TV show with no relation to the real world.
Then they barely mention Muktader Al-Sadr, who was basically the king of a large portion of Iraq.  According to news he had quit, or turned good, or whatever.  In reality he had his area and was willing to kill people to expand it.

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:13:06
Ok, let me explain to you how it works.
When you make an account on an exchange they add an entry to their database showing that you have $0 and 0 BTC.  Every person using the exchange has an entry in the database.  Maybe mine has $30,000 and 2 BTC.
So now you have your account and you send 3 BTC to the exchange.  This is a bitcoin transaction that goes onto the block chain.  The 3 BTC doesn't go to a special account storing just your money.  It goes into the exchange's wallet.  If the exchange had 1000 BTC before now it has 1003 BTC.
Now you decide to sell your 3 BTC for $10,000 each so you put in a "sell" order for that amount and price.  At the same time I put in a "buy" order for the same amount and price.  The exchange matches our orders up and they execute.
So what happens is 3 BTC are deducted from your entry in the Coinbase's database and 3 BTC are added to mine.  This is a database transaction, not a bitcoin transaction.  Only the database is being modified, no bitcoins are actually being moved.
Now lets say that I want to withdraw my 5 BTC.  Remember that the exchange has 1003 BTC in its wallet.  Well now it has 998.
So when people trade on an exchange the bitcoins aren't moving around on the blockchain.  They are only moving around on the database.  Only when people move coins to or from the exchange does the exchange make bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:17


Futures don't actually stabilize prices, that's a myth.  Google "do futures actually stabilize prices?".
The derivatives being offered for bitcoin aren't even real futures because you can't take delivery, so what little stabilization futures might offer won't even be available.
Instead the reality will be: whales will purchase large sums of bitcoin.  Then they will take leveraged positions on the derivatives markets.  Then they will pump and dump bitcoin as appropriate and take huge profits on their derivatives.  Up and down they will manipulate the bitcoin price, creating huge opportunities for them on the derivative exchanges, magnified by leverage.
As more and more big players buy up bitcoin to participate in this, they will start to (mostly) cancel each other out, and eventually the insane swings will settle down, with a much, much higher price per Bitcoin.

Your node is downloading and checking the validity of every bitcoin transaction ever.  It took about a week for mine to catch up.
Once it catches up, it will barely use any resources.  Leave it running always and you'll always be caught up.  You should then change the settings so that it runs in the background and you don't see the icon.
Also, once you are caught up, you should change it and your firewall and router options so that people can connect to you.  Again, there will be almost no resource consumption once you are caught up.

The increase of bitcoin's price is a form of growth.  Growth is graphed on a logarithmic scale.  Bitcoin's growth is not infinite and seems to be tapering off slowly.  Because bitcoin's growth rate is not constant he should not use a linear fit.  He chose another equation which looks pretty good.

They modified their software to include EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment).  If six or fewer blocks are mined in 12 hours the difficulty drops by 20%.  If the blocks are spaced out correctly they can get multiple 20% drops to suddenly lower the difficulty a lot.
So what happens is the difficulty drops really low, then about half of the BTC miners move to BCC.  They mine easy blocks at a furious pace, two weeks worth in three days.  Then the difficulty adjusts and it is no longer profitable to mine, so the miners all go back to BTC.
The result is that BTC and BCC both have swings in block time.  The swings in BTC are much lower (8 min - 15 min) than in BCC (1 min - 5 hours).

The best hardware wallets (those with a screen) all work the same way.  I just upgraded to a Trezor.
When you buy a Trezor is comes with two paper cards.  Then you use your Trezor to generate a new wallet.  There is a copy in the Trezor and you write down the 24 words onto the two cards.  Those two cards are paper wallet versions of your new wallet.  Anyone who has one of those two paper wallets has complete access to your bitcoin.  So you store one at home in a safe, and you store the other one in your parents' home in a safe.  Now if your house burns down things are fine because you have a backup at your parents' house.  Then you put a pin on your Trezor.
So in the end you have three copies: two paper wallets protected by safes, and one electronic copy on the Trezor protected by a pin.
Other hardware wallets work the same way.  I strongly recommend everyone buy a hardware wallet, even if you only have a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin.  You never know when a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin can become a few hundred thousand dollars worth of bitcoin.

Ok, I think you see your confusion.
You heard that you can use Shapeshift to get BCH.  So you sent bitcoin thinking that somehow you would keep your bitcoin and also get BCH.  It doesn't work that way.
You already have the BCH.  You just can't see it with Electrum because Electrum is for bitcoin, not bitcoin cash.  You need to make a copy of your wallet and open it with ElectronCash.  Then you will see your BCH.  Electrum allows you to see bitcoin; ElectronCash allows you to see BCH.  Both programs come from the same source code so they both work with the same wallet files, but each program only allows you to work with the corresponding coin.
So here is what I would do if I were you:
1) Contact Shapeshift support and explain your mistake.  Hopefully they can send you a refund.
2) Buy a Trezor or some other hardware wallet with a screen.
3) Send your bitcoin from your Electrum wallet to your hardware wallet.  This step is probably not essential, but makes it 100% certain that you won't be the victim of a replay attack.  It also upgrades your protection level.
4) Open your Electrum wallet with ElectronCash.  You will see your BCH.  Send the BCH to Shapeshift.  The destination address (where the bitcoin will go) should be from your hardware wallet.  The change address should be from your ElectronCash wallet.

1) Keep your coins on an established and regulated exchange (such as Coinbase) until after the 2X fork.  Meanwhile buy a hardware wallet.
2) After the fork sell your 2X coins to buy more Bitcoin.  Send your real bitcoins to your hardware wallet.
3) If you are thinking about sending money from your hardware wallet do it in two steps: first send a tiny amount and see if it was credited to you, then send the rest.  This protects you from a hacker showing you a bad address.  Another approve is to look at the address on two separate devices (a PC and a smart phone, for example).
If you do this you will be safe from hackers.

Your coins will be safe.  You have BTC now, and after the fork you will also have and equal amount S2X.  Lack of replay protection means that if you try to send one type of coin, the other type might get sent as well.  So if you send your BTC to an address, your S2X coins might move to the S2X version of that address.  This will make splitting your coins manually an activity for experts only.
Ledger has announced that they will support S2X so all you need to do is wait until they handle it for you.  At that point you can send your S2X without worrying about your BTC being lost.  Then you can sell your S2X for free money.

Well the Bitcoin Cash is definitely at that address.  It shows up here on a BCH block explorer: 
I am not that familiar with Electrum.  Maybe you can try the steps from this guide:
If nothing works then you can actually open your Electrum wallet files with Electron Cash.  That will work.  The only downside is that if there is any BTC on there then there is a teeny tiny risk that Electron Cash will steal it.  I don't think that anyone has reported Electron Cash stealing BTC, so it isn't known malware, but I am paranoid about these things.

Gold currently is useful in electronics and other high-tech industries.  However, until recently, gold had no real use aside from being used as money.
Why was gold used as money?  Well something is useful as money if it:
1) is limited in supply (you can't make more gold, and you can't mine much either)  
2) is fungible (all chunks of gold of the same weight and purity are equally valuable)  
3) is convenient in some way(you can divide gold into small pieces, gold doesn't rot or rust, gold is portable)
Bitcoin is limited, fungible, and convenient in some way (digital, highly divisible).

You aren't entirely safe when using a hardware wallet.  For example, if you want to send your bitcoin from your Nano to Coinbase.  Coinbase provides you an address to send it to.  What if an attacker replaces that address?
However the attacker won't be able to steal your other bitcoins, only the ones that you are sending in that transaction.
One way to protect against this attack is to send a small amount of BTC to that address, see how that went, and then send more if you like the result.

Mining is considered income.  Let's say that you mine $100 worth of bitcoin this year.  You count that as income, but you can deduct expenses (such as electricity and equipment depreciation).  You count it as income regardless of whether you hold or sell.  If you hold you pay that income tax, and then that $100 becomes the basis for those coins.  If you later sell for $300 then you have a $200 capital gain.
So to summarize: Mined $100 worth, sold for $300 = $200 of that is capital gains, $100 is income.

It takes some time for blocks to propagate and be verified by all of the nodes of the network.  This is time that the miner finding the block gets an advantage.  This amount of time is the same, regardless of the time between blocks.  If blocks are closer together then a higher percentage of the block time is spent propagating and verifying, and thus a higher percentage of time that the miner who cfound the block has an advantage.  The result is that a shorter time between blocks favors those who find the most blocks - the biggest miners - and thus leads to centralization.

People advise you to take your coins off of exchanges because in the past exchanges have failed frequently and people lost all of their money.

How to redeem them?  Well the safest way would be to wait for Trezor to support them directly.  Here is a statement from their customer support: 
Alternately, you could use your seed words with another BIP39 compatible wallet that allows you to split the coins.  This approach carries more risks.

If you have an account on another exchange it is easy.  I'm going to assume that you're moving them to GDAX (Coinbase's exchange), but there are other exchanges that will work too.
Go to GDAX and pick the option to add bitcoins to your account.  It will give you an address to send the coins to.  Then open a new window or tab and go to Gemini and pick the option to withdraw your coins.  It will ask you for an address to send them to.  Copy and paste the address from GDAX into the box on Gemini.  Gemini will send the coins directly to GDAX and your GDAX account will be credited.
If you don't have another exchange account make one quickly.  You could also buy a Ledger hardware wallet.  Ledger announced that it will help you split your coins.  It won't be as fast as GDAX or some of the other exchanges, but they will safely split your coins.

Most people think that Bitcoin will retain its value while B2X will plummet down to a very small number and eventually die.  We might be wrong.
My plan is to sell most of my B2X to help crash its price.  Then I'll sell the rest gradually to keep downwards pressure on its price.  If B2X has a low price miners will abandon it to mine the real Bitcoin.  B2X will have a low price and a low hash-power and two weeks after the split Coinbase will acknowledge that the real Bitcoin is in fact Bitcoin, and that B2X is not.  At that point the threat from B2X will be over.

Bitcoins exist in the form of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).  All UTXOs are created through transactions.  UTXOs can be thought of as coins of various denominations, as low as one satoshi and as high as.... well all of the bitcoin in the world could theoretically be in the form of one UTXO if someone owned all of the bitcoin in the world.
A transaction takes a number of inputs (UTXOs) and creates a number of outputs (UTXOs).  It also defines rules for each of the UTXOs specifying how to spend it.  The normal way it to make a UTXO spendable only by someone who can prove that he has the private key to a certain address.
So let's imagine that you have a $5 bill and a $10 bill.  You want to send me $11.  You need to use both of your bills, so they are the two inputs.  You want me to have $11 so one of the outputs is an $11 bill.  The rest of the money you want to keep, so you create a $4 bill.  That's how bitcoin works.

No, it is the blocks themselves.  Miners are trying to find blocks as quickly as they can, but blocks need to be an average of 10 minutes apart.  So what they have to do is generate hashes (basically random numbers) until they get one that is rare enough.  The rarity required is called "difficulty".  This "pointless" hashing is what actually makes the system work, so it isn't actually pointless.

Bitcoins are moved around by transactions.  You need your private keys to sign transactions, but other people don't need to see your private keys to verify that your transactions are valid.
The private keys are stored on your Ledger.  The transaction is made and signed on the Ledger.  Then the transaction goes through the USB connection to your computer and then to the rest of the internet.  The private keys never leave your Ledger, only the transaction signed by the keys leaves.

That's sort of true.  You have to make sure that you connect to a 2X node when you want to move your 2X coins, and a Bitcoin node when tyou want to move your real Bitcoin.  You also need to split them on address you own before doing anything else because of a lack of replay protection.
For most people moving them to Coinbase is the safest and fastest way to split.  This will also help us get the 2X price down quickly.

Yes, Bitcoin should be treated like a precious metal.  Day-to-day use is unlikely but if it does happen it won't be for a while and will involve additional layers.
No, you should not limit yourself to 10%, yet.  We are still in the price discovery phase.  When things settle down in a decade or two we're going to see the price in the tens or hundreds of thousands per bitcoin.  Until then you're basically guaranteed to profit, unless something goes incredibly wrong and bitcoin is destroyed completely.  The odds of that happening are very slim.  In a couple of weeks we are going to face the biggest attack on Bitcoin ever (S2X).  If we come out of that fine we're almost certainly home-free.
Once the price settles down, then yes you should diversify.  Until then I'm keeping more than 100% of my net worth in bitcoin (my non-bitcoin net worth is negative).

Keep your coins on Coinbase until after the fork.  Actually, move them to GDAX to save massively on fees.  Coinbase owns GDAX so if you have a Coinbase account you already have a GDAX account.

Coinbase and GDAX are the same company so if you have an account on one you have an account on the other.  GDAX has much lower fees, 0% if you use limit orders.
Hardware wallets are the safest way to store Bitcoin.  They cost about $100 on average.
Here is what I would do:  use your money to buy on GDAX.  Buy a hardware wallet.  Leave your money on GDAX until after the fork.  Sell your S2X to buy more bitcoin.  Then send all of your bitcoin from GDAX to your hardware wallet.

If it stays at this price, no.  You could put in $50/month and have a Bitcoin in 12 years.  Of course I expect the price to increase, so the average person would need to hurry up by paying $100/month or something to hope to buy one over the course of 20 years.

Yes, when you send a transaction is gets sent to a node, and then the node sends it to more nodes, and so on until all of the nodes have it. Some of the nodes are mining nodes and will attempt to bundle your transaction into a block.  Each node checks to make sure that your transaction is valid before passing it on; this includes checking to make sure that the signatures are valid.

It is a gold alternative.  If 10% of the people who would normally buy gold coins buy bitcoin instead the price will hit $50,000.

You lost the opportunity to turn hundreds into millions, but you didn't miss the boat entirely.  The price will probably be at around $100k in a couple of years.  Turning hundreds into thousands isn't so bad.

Export the private key for just that address an import it into Electrum Cash.  Ideally, you would install Electron Cash on a computer that you don't use Electrum on, that way you have absolutely no risk that Electron Cash will steal your Bitcoins from your Electrum wallet.

No.  A block chain is a chain made out of blocks... that's really the secret to it.  Messages are bundled up into blocks and added to the chain.  For all practical purposes it solves the Byzantine Generals Problem, a category of coordination fault.  So the Bitcoin block chain is used to coordinate transactions so that the same coins aren't spent more than once.  Mining difficulty makes it hard to add blocks to the chain and thus makes it almost impossible to add counterfeit transactions to the chain.
Banks will not use block chains; they have no reason to.  They can use regular databases under their own centralized control.  The reason that Bitcoin needs a block chain is that Bitcoin is decentralized.  No one owns or controls the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:29:25

This is a recent development, last century or so.  Gold has been valuable for thousands of years.


Gold is used in jewelry because jewelry is a way to wear money.  In the West the distinction has broken down, but in most of the world today, and in the whole world in times past, the money/jewelry distinction was not strong.  Nickamoto Szaboshi discussed this recently on his blog: 


Not really.  To buy gold I have to find and then drive to a coin store, buy a 1 oz coin, and then play a fee over the spot price.  If I want to sell the gold I need to do the same in reverse, but I also have to prove that my gold is real.  If I want to exchange a large amount of money I would have to go to multiple coin stores most likely, because I doubt that Bob's Coins and Collectibles has thousands or even hundreds of gold coins available for trade.


Slow?  No, if I wanted to sell bitcoin I could do it right now.  My transaction would go through within an hour or two, then I can sell it immediately.  The only slow step is transferring the money to my bank account.  Expensive?  Perhaps you are still stuck using Coinbase instead of GDAX or some other exchange?  I would need to pay a dollar or two to transfer it to an exchange, then I would play a limit order and pay a 0% fee.  That's a dollar or two to sell potentially millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.  If I want to buy I don't need to even pay that, as GDAX will pay the transaction fee to transfer it to my account.
I'm not just theorizing.  I was planning to buy gold but I never got around to it.  Then I bought bitcoin from without having to leave the house.


Yep, which is why you can buy BTC so cheaply right now.  Gold has built up a lot of credibility over the thousands of years.  If BTC had an equally impressive reputation we would be looking a price close to a million dollars per bitcoin, because bitcoin is so much scarcer than gold.  Bitcoin is building its reputation right now, which is why the price will continue to go up until we hit a price close to a million, or something happens to make us lose trust in Bitcoin.  I expect to see the price above $100,000 in my lifetime.

The amount of BCH will match what you had on Coinbase/GDAX at the time of the fork, not what you have on there January 1st.  If you had your BTC somewhere else then you will have to figure out how to get access to your BCH some other way.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:51:14


No, none of that is true.  The opposite is true.
Miners choose which transactions to include in their blocks.  They choose the transactions with the highest fees.  If there is more traffic then users need to compete for inclusion into blocks, thus users increase their fees.  When the network is nearly empty you will pay less than a penny for a transaction.  When the network is busy you will pay several dollars, perhaps tens of dollars, for a transaction.

Those people were fools.  I have known for years that a price above $5000 is achievable.  Bitcoin is a great alternative to gold, and can easily attain a price in the $10,000 to $100,000 range without any changes to the code or the ecosystem.
Getting to $1,000,000 per coin requires that Bitcoin go beyond its natural role as a gold alternative.  It would have to become usuable by normal people* for their daily transactions.  People would need to choose it over their government-issued currencies as their main form of money.  That isn't realistic.  Regular people will always choose to use the money that their government tells them to use.

Anyone who owned Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of the fork (August 1st) also became the owner of Bitcoin Cash, an alt-coin (BCH).  Nothing was converted.  One coin became two, like two alternate realities in a time travel story.  If you had your bitcoins on your computer you could access your BCH directly, they were in your wallet file but they were invisible unless you used a special program (and your Bitcoin are invisible to that program).
If you had your bitcoins on an exchange then your bitcoins weren't in your wallet, they were in the exchange's wallet.  You don't have a wallet on an exchange, you have an account.  So your BCH appeared in the exchange's wallet.  You are probably legally entitled to them, but there is no way to get access to them unless to them unless the exchange puts in the effort to add support for the new alt-coin.
Coinbase said that they weren't going to support BCH but then people started suing them, so they announced that they would give access by January 1st.  They probably have it programmed in by now, but it looks like they won't give access until January 1st.

Use this website instead and compare the bars:  
Compare look at the ratios between the bars.  For the 0-10 category the orange bar is bigger than the blue, that's not good.  Now look at the next category, 11-20.  Notice how the blue bar is so much bigger than the orange bar?  That means that your transaction will go through within a day if you use that fee.  So 11 satoshis per byte will be sufficient if you aren't in a rush.
Then look over to the right, it (at the time that I am writing this) says 4-70 blocks.  That means that you can expect it to take at least 40 minutes, and up to 700 minutes.

Well I wouldn't call it an upgrade....
But yeah, the only "feature" is a doubling of the block size.  That would lower transaction fees somewhat in the short term.  In the long term it would force out even more of the small and medium-sized miners.
More importantly, it takes control of development from dozens of highly-skilled programmers who have various ideas and funding sources, and gives that control to one moderately-skilled programmer who is funded by a group of bankers and politicians.
So if you want for Bitcoin to be controlled by a group of bankers and politicians then you should support 2X.

Fees are still quite low.  Think about how much bitcoin you can move with just a few dollars.  Now think about how high the fees would be to move that same value in gold coins.  Bitcoin fees are much lower than the fees to move actual physical gold.  Bitcoin is best thought of as a precious metal.  The original name of the idea was "bitgold".

Actually, it is possible for everyone who buys Bitcoin to benefit.  People who buy before the price stabilizes are the only ones who will see amazing gains, but people who buy in later will still do well.
There are only 21 million Bitcoins (probably millions fewer due to lost wallets).  Governments use inflation to balance their budgets, so that means that they have to print more money.  Thus the number of dollars/euros/pounds/etc... competing for each bitcoin is constantly increasing.  People who have Bitcoin will be able to sell them for more and more government issued currency.  The price will always trend upward, just like gold and silver have always trended upward (except that one time when several new continents full of gold and silver were discovered).
Thus Bitcoin will protect your savings from inflation.  Rather than constantly losing purchasing power to the secret tax that is inflation, your purchasing power will be indexed to the overall health of the economy.

51% attacks can't do anything like that.  If you control the network you can censor certain addresses from making transactions.  You could also reverse very recent transactions, allowing you to spend money but then give yourself a refund, basically it would be like bouncing a check.  It wouldn't be long before merchants wised up.  So a 51% attack can't really benefit you in any meaningful way.  You would probably make more money robbing a convenience store.


It would be incredibly expensive.  Most of the mining that exists today is done by a Chinese mining cartel.  They make the ASICs.  They locate their giant facilities right next to hydroelectric dams for cheap power.  They staff them with workers that live in barracks.  You would have to be incredibly rich to beat them for no real financial benefit.  A government might want to do it in order to be able to censor addresses thought to be owned by its enemies.

1) You are probably overpaying.  Usually you can send a transaction for a dollar or two, sometimes for a few cents.
2) Enemies of Bitcoin have been spamming the network for the last few months.  This can increase fees dramatically.
3) People are working on ways to lower the fees.
4) The thing that makes Bitcoin special is that there are only 21 million of them.  Bitcoin is best thought of a precious metal, like gold or silver.  Even on its worst day Bitcoin can move money much cheaper than gold or silver can.

You should try to do the splits before the 2X fork.  The 2X fork is hostile and you should not attempt to do it on your own unless you are an expert.  BCH and Gold are fine to split on your own (does Gold exist yet?).
To split 2X I recommend sending your coins to Coinbase before the split.  The 2X split will happen sometime around November 16th so try to get your coins on Coinbase at least several days before.  Starting on November 14th (or maybe earlier) stop moving coins around until the dust settles.
If you get your coins to Coinbase in time, they will split them for you.  Then leave them on Coinbase until the dust settles.

One week from now I will move my BTC to Coinbase.  Then on the morning of the fork I will wake up early to cash out my S2X.  I will use it to buy more BTC and then I will transfer my BTC back to my hardware wallet.

Purchasing on an exchange should be unaffected because the blockchain is not involved, just numbers in the exchange's database.  Moving your coins after the fork (and maybe shortly before the fork) is the risky activity.
I can't predict what will happen to the price after the fork.  If things go badly the price could fall.  People dumping their S2X coins could cause the price of Bitcoin to shoot up.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:19:06
That depends on the fee that the exchange pays.  Usually not too long, maybe an hour or two.  Definitely within a day in most cases.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:14:11
If you are a newbie the best way to split your coins is by keeping them on an exchange (such as Coinbase/GDAX) that will split them for you.  I am not a newbie and this is what I am doing.
If you leave your BTC in your wallet then you will have to split your coins manually.  Manually splitting your B2X from your BTC is for experts only.
My recommendation for most people is to put all of your BTC on GDAX before the fork.  Then sell your B2X when it becomes available on Nov 16.  Use that to buy BTC.  Then send all of the BTC to a hardware wallet.

That is the price of S2X futures on one exchange, HitBTC.  On the other exchanges (Bitfinex, OKEX) the price is much lower, about 15% of the value of a real Bitcoin.
Does this mean that the price of S2X will be 15% of the price of a bitcoin when it becomes available for trading?  On those exchanges it will start at that price, but no one really knows what will happen after that and what will happen on other exchanges.
I think that S2X will fail and stay in the 10-20% price range for a while.  I know that I'm going to help make it fail by dumping half of my S2X coins immediately and selling the rest gradually to suppress its price.

I agree with what you are saying about making transactions with bitcoin during a low point, but you're missing out on how bitcoin can be used to preserve wealth during bad times.
Let's say that you are part of the middle class in a mediocre country.  You have the ability to buy bitcoin, so that's where you put a portion of your savings.  Then your country is ruined by a socialist dictator.  Your bitcoin stash probably won't help you, hopefully you have other resources to help you survive.  Then there is a military coup and things get better, back to mediocre.  You bring your bitcoin out of cold storage and have a head start in making your country great again.

Fiat money is routinely inflated by governments.  Inflation biases people away from savings and towards debt.  This results in the misallocation of resources away from capital goods (durable goods that improve efficiency) to consumption (stuff that gets used up and replaced).

If they falsely rename things then it will trick new people into buying the wrong thing, but it won't actually mean that you lose anything.

Ahh yes, that is fraud and it does happen.  Several exchanges run by shady people didn't actually have all of the money that they claimed to have.  They went out of business and many people lost their money.  MtGox is the most famous example.
The way to protect yourself against this kind of event is to keep your bitcoins in your own wallet (preferably a hardware wallet with a screen).

No, there is nothing like that in bitcoin.  There is no central agency attempting to provide price stability.  Exchanges make more money when the price moves so they have no financial incentive to prevent a sell off.

You're making the mistake of dividing all computers into two categories: compromised and uncompromisable.  At a minimum, you need to understand that there is a third categoriy: compromisable but currently uncompromised.
Oh but wait, there isn't a clear border between compromised and uncompromised either.  Many computers, perhaps most, have some relatively harmless malware on them.  Where do you even draw the line between what is malware and what isn't?  There is no clear dividing line.
The world isn't as simple as you think.  There are many shades of gray between the pure white of a perfect computer and the deep black of a computer riddled with malware.
This goes well beyond malware.  There are many shades of gray when it comes to security.  You don't need 100% security to prevent most attacks.  You can prevent 99% of attacks with a 99% strong level of security.  If you make that two levels of 99% security then you can thwart 99.99% of attacks.
So let's bring this back to a concrete example.  Currently Trezor Bridge sends a signal out on the internet every time you turn your computer on.  How is that bad?  It probably isn't... but you are sending a signal out, like a flare gun in a ruined city.  Someone might intercept that signal and then he will know that you have a Trezor.  Then he might try to attack you in other ways.

Nodes are what make the system work.  When you make a transaction it gets sent from your wallet to a node.  That node sends the transaction to several other nodes, and those nodes send it to more nodes and so on, so everyone in the world knows about the transaction that you want to make.
Some of the nodes are mining nodes. The mining nodes are competing to bundle transactions into blocks.  When a mining node finds a block it then sends that block to other nodes, who then send it one to more nodes and so on, and eventually everyone has a copy of that block and now your transaction is part of the permanent record.... unless that block violates the rules.  Nodes refuse to distribute pass along that don't follow the rules.
The result is that the nodes determine the rules.  The nodes decide how bitcoin works.  The nodes also help connect the various rival miners and rival wallet services.  The more nodes there are, the harder it is for a cartel to seize control of bitcoin and ruin it.
A node can be run on any desktop PC.  Just leave it running day and night, and it will work to keep bitcoin strong.
This latest version of the software is particularly important because it defends against hostile network behavior on the part of segwit2x.  Bitcoin cash, as much as I dislike it, at least had the decency to not engage in the behavior that 2x nodes will.

It refers to the latest version as Satoshi:0.15.0 and shows it having 12.14%.  However, it is counting other networks in the denominator.  So the true upgraded percentage is higher, probably in the 15-20% range, if I am reading it correctly.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:51:49
It doesn't work that way at all.
When you store your coins in coinbase or some other web wallet you don't really have your coins.  The company has them and owes them to you.  It is like money in a bank account.
When you use a real wallet (such as Trezor or Electrum) you actually have your coins.  Trezor doesn't have them and can't give or take anything from you.  It is like having cash in your wallet.
Now we're just using analogies, so things are going to get a bit weird here.  We're also using the word "wallet" to mean two different things: the software/hardward AND the data used to control your coins.
Ok so imagine this.  You pull your leather wallet out of your pocket and look in to see your dollar bills.  They're invisible?  Oh, I forgot to put my DollarCore glasses on.  Now I see my money.
Ok now I read the newspaper and it says that were was a fork and now we all have DollarCash in our wallets!  Great, I look in my wallet and I don't see it.  Oh that's right, I need to go to the store to buy some DollarCash glasses.  Now I switch to DollarCash glasses and look into the same wallet.  I see my DollarCash instead of my DollarCore.  Another fork, Dollar2x!  Time to get some new glasses.
So each new fork creates a new kind of paper money that requires new glasses to see.  The paper money appears in your leather wallet but you can't see it until you put on the right glasses.
Bitcoin forks work the same way.  Here is how I handled bitcoin cash:
I was using Bitcoin Core (DollarCore glasses) to store my bitcoins in my wallet.dat file (leather wallet).
Then I imported the addresses from my wallet.dat into Electrum (not DollarCore glasses, but sees the same kind of money).  Then (for extra safety) I took my money out of there and put it into a hardware wallet.  Then I imported the SAME addresses (like the same leather wallet) into ElectronCash (DollarCash glasses) and now I could see my bitcoin cash.
So the trick is to use the right wallet software/hardware to see your coins, using the same wallet file each time.

You have to wait for the wallet to synch.  For most people it only takes a few hours, but I have a bad connection and it will take me another week.
You can actually still work with your coins by exporting your private keys and importing them into another wallet, but if you're not an expert I wouldn't recommend it.

Bigger blocks make it harder for regular people to run nodes and also make it easier for large miners to dominate the mining process.  Both of these effects result in centralization, making bitcoin vulnerable to falling under the control of a hostile entity.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:17:23
Nodes are what make the system work.  When you make a transaction it gets sent from your wallet to a node.  That node sends the transaction to several other nodes, and those nodes send it to more nodes and so on, so everyone in the world knows about the transaction that you want to make.
Some of the nodes are mining nodes. The mining nodes are competing to bundle transactions into blocks.  When a mining node finds a block it then sends that block to other nodes, who then send it one to more nodes and so on, and eventually everyone has a copy of that block and now your transaction is part of the permanent record.... unless that block violates the rules.  Nodes refuse to distribute pass along that don't follow the rules.
The result is that the nodes determine the rules.  The nodes decide how bitcoin works.  The nodes also help connect the various rival miners and rival wallet services.  The more nodes there are, the harder it is for a cartel to seize control of bitcoin and ruin it.
A node can be run on any desktop PC.  Just leave it running day and night, and it will work to keep bitcoin strong.
This latest version of the software is particularly important because it defends against hostile network behavior on the part of segwit2x.  Bitcoin cash, as much as I dislike it, at least had the decency to not engage in the behavior that 2x nodes will.

Right now you have your coins in a hardware wallet.  That hardware wallet contains your private keys to those bitcoins.  If you leave your bitcoins in your hardware wallet then those same private keys will also become the private keys of an equal amount of S2X coins.
At that point you can try to manually split the coins yourself.  I do not recommend this unless you are an expert.
If you don't split your coins manually then you will have to wait for support from the hardware wallet company, or from another company that makes compatible wallets.  This shouldn't be too hard, but is a bad strategy if you're looking to liquidate quickly.  Hardware wallet companies are likely to take a while before they can provide support for S2X, and might never support it due to S2X's lack of replay protection.
So that's what happens if you live your bitcoins in your hardware wallet.  What if you send them to an exchange that plans to support S2X?
The exchange company has its own private keys with huge numbers of bitcoins.  When the fork happens they will take steps to safely split the coins, using their internal nodes and addresses.  Once they are certain that they have successfully split the coins they will make them available to their users.  Your bitcoin balance will remain the same, and you will also be given an S2X balance.  You can then dump your S2X immediately.
The only downside that I can see with sending your coins to an exchange is that you have to trust the exchange.  I think that most exchanges are pretty reliable now.  The MtGox days are (mostly) over.  Of course you have to make sure that you send your bitcoins to the exchange before the fork.  Sending them after won't help you split your coins, and might result in you losing some of your coins due to a replay attack.
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:45:27

I'm aware that the miners prefer 2x, but that doesn't mean that they will mine it exclusively.  Look at bitcoin vs bitcoin cash.  The miners that support bitcoin cash are still mining regular bitcoin too, because that's how they can maximize profits.  Ultimately miners don't have any power to support a coin unless they are willing to forgo profits.  The miners aren't going to stick to the NY/HK agreements unless doing so will make them money.  Unless....
I'm suggesting that the Chinese government might force the Chinese miners to completely shift to 2x.  If that happens bitcoin transactions might slow to a crawl while 2x transactions would be plenty fast.  It is possible that in that scenario new users would decide to purchase 2xcoins instead of bitcoins.  If enough people switch it would be a major setback for bitcoin.
I'm not saying that this will happen, it is just one possibility.

Instead of forming their own network with their own rules, the 2x nodes are going to try to stay on the main bitcoin network.  If you have two types of nodes on the same network enforcing different rules it will cause chaos.  The 2x nodes need to have their own network.
Bitcoin cash was created with its own network, so the transactions from one network don't get mingled with the other.  2x didn't take any steps to create its own network.  So that's what this new release is about, the bitcoin core software taking steps to defensively exclude 2x nodes from the network.

No, all bitcoins are stored in the internet.  The Trezor stores your ability to access them.

The time to verify a block is approximately proportional to its size. BCH blocks can be about 4X the size of BTC blocks, which means that they can take about 4X as long to verify.
The faster blocks can be verified, the less advantage the largest miners have over smaller miners.  The outcome is that mining is no longer competitive, simply controlled by a few miners that collude with each other.  Do you really want to buy into a coin that is controlled by a Chinese mining cartel, which is in turn controlled by the Chinese government?  That's what BTC is.
Larger blocks also make it harder to run a node.  The more nodes there are the more resistant the software is to being supplanted by those who want to seize control of the rules about how bitcoin works.  If all of the nodes are controlled by a small number of bankers and miners it wouldn't be too hard for them to change the rules entirely - giving themselves as many bitcoins as they want, blacklisting your coins, etc... if you control nearly all of the nodes you can do anything.

Let's say that you perform a service and you charge $100 worth of bitcoin.  That counts as $100 worth of income, even though you did not receive dollars.  You must pay the appropriate income tax on that.
You then hold that $100 worth of bitcoin.  The $100 is your basis.  You sell it a week later for $110.  You have a $10 short-term capital gain.  You pay the appropriate tax on that.
So at the end of the year you have $100 in income, $10 in capital gains.
Alternately you hold for two years.  You have $100 in income and then later you sell the bitcoin for $1000.  You have $900 in long-term capital gains.  For most people long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%.  If you make enough money they will be taxed, but at a lower rate than income or capital gains.

You are legally obligated to report your capital gains.  From what I understand, Coinbase/GDAX will tip off the IRS if you do more than $20,000 in business with them.  If you expect to owe taxes on your capital gains you are required to make quarterly payments to the IRS.

I'll address your specific questions at the end, but here is some information first.
Coins don't get converted when there is a fork.  Instead you get a matching amount on each branch of the fork.  The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork happened in August.  Another fork called Segwit2x is coming soon, Nov/Dec.  If you do absolutely nothing you will end up with three kinds of coins by the end of the year.
Ok imagine that you had one bitcoin in an Electrum wallet before the bitcoin cash fork.  Now you still have that bitcoin in the Electrum wallet, but you also have a bitcoin cash coin in that same wallet.  You can't see it, because Electrum only deals with Bitcoin.
In order to see that cash coin you need to take that Electrum wallet and open it with software that can see Bitcoin Cash.  Electron Cash is a copy of Electrum except that it has been modified to see Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin.  So you if you open that same wallet file with Electron Cash you will see your cash coin.
So depending on which currency you want to work with you use different software to look into the wallet.
Electron Cash is newer software so it doesn't yet have the reputation that Electrum does.  So usually people move their bitcoins out of their Electrum wallet before opening that same wallet with Electron Cash.  This way there is no possibility of Electron Cash stealing your Bitcoin.
As for 2x, it will probably all be pretty similar.  However 2x won't have proper replay protection so it will probably be trickier to avoid mistakes.


Yes.  If you move your BTC from your Electrum wallet just remember that Electrum will only move your BTC.  Your BCH will still be in your old Electrum wallet.


No, coins don't convert.  Instead you get free coins with each fork.


That is smart.  I waited a week before cashing out my Bitcoin Cash.  2x is likely to be even trickier to successfully cash out, so you should wait until you are certain that you know what you are doing.

Step 1: move your real Bitcoins from your old wallet to a new location.  Ideally you send them to a hardware wallet, one with a screen.
Step 2: using different software, move your Bitcoin Cash from your old wallet to a new location, ideally to an exchange to sell them.
Step 3: wait for the B2X fork coming in mid-November.

2X is inherently bad, because bigger blocks increase centralization.  The more centralized Bitcoin is, the easier it is for a government or cartel to take control of it.  This is a problem that would play out gradually and thus is a long-term threat to bitcoin's security.
2X is also bad because it would also mean that control of the bitcoin software would be taken away from a large and varied group of very competent programmers who are funded by a variety of sources.  Control would be given to a tiny group of less-competent programmers who all seem to be getting their money from a single source controlled by the enemies of Bitcoin.

I don't want to get into a big discussion, so here's a quick summary:
1) Total production = production of consumer goods + production of capital goods.
2) Total income = total production.
Thus 3) Total income = total production of consumption goods  + total production of capital goods.
4) total production of consumption goods = total consumption
Thus 5) Total income = total consumption + total production of capital goods.
Whatever you don't spend increases the production of capital goods.  You don't actually have to invest to cause this.  Merely producing more than you consume shifts supply and demand curves, resulting in investment.  Think about it this way:  If an economy consume 60% of what it produces, what is it producing the other 40% of the time?  It must be capital goods!  It isn't going to be extra consumption goods, because then the price will fall so far as to make production uneconomical.  This will free up more resources, making production of capital goods cheaper.

Step 1: Download and install Bitcoin Core,  this is the basic node software.  This is easy.
Step 2: Wait until your node has downloaded and processed the entire blockchain of 140 GB.  This can take days.  This will take a lot of bandwidth but once this step is done bandwidth usage will be very  low.
Step 3: Configure your computer and router so that your node can make outgoing connections.  This can be tricky.

Here's another approach.  Say that we are 20,000 blocks away from 494,784.  Find out how long it took to do the previous 20,000 blocks and use that directly as your value.   So if the current block is 474,784 you find how long it has been since 454,787.  That would then be your estimate for how long until 20,000 blocks in the future, 494,787.

Yes, those bitcoins will be lost forever.
It will be sad for those involved, but won't affect bitcoin.  Bitcoin is currently divisible to 8 decimal places.  If a single bitcoin is worth a million dollars then the smallest unit (a satoshi) is worth a penny.  If so many bitcoins are lost that a satoshi starts to be worth more than a penny it would be easy and uncontroversial to add a few more decimal places.  The amount of bitcoin in the world remains the same, but now people can divide it into smaller pieces.

They will support both coins when the fork happens.  You will be able to dump your 2X coins immediately without having to manually split the coins yourself.  Manually splitting your 2X coins from your 1X coins might be very difficult, definitely more difficult than it was to split your Bitcoin Cash was.

If you have it in a real wallet (where you own the private keys) then you will get 2X coins, just like you got Bitcoin Cash.  However, it is likely to be tricky to separate them.
I am considering moving all of my bitcoin to Coinbase so that I will have immediate access to my B2X so I can sell them before the price crashes.  Well... assuming that we don't crash their site.
If I leave my Bitcoins on my Trezor then I will probably wait for Trezor to add support for B2X, which again will make it easy to cash out.
Or I can try to do it all manually, but this will probably be tricky for me to do on my own.

Coinbase is a broker.  They buy and sell bitcoins directly from people.  When you buy bitcoins on Coinbase you are buying directly from the company itself.
Coinbase also owes an exchange, GDAX.  An exchange mediates purchases between buyers and sellers.  You put in *orders*.  A market order happens immediately, and you have to pay a small fee (still much cheaper than buying from a broker).  A limit order might happen immediately, or might never happen; it all depends on how the price fluctuates.  GDAX doesn't charge a fee at all for limit orders.  If you put in your limit order very close to the market price then you can be almost certain that it will execute in a few minutes.  It is basically a simplified version of stock trading.
Since Coinbase owns GDAX if you make an account on one you will have an account on both.  GDAX has slightly higher verification requirements though.

Think of it like a timeline in a time travel story.  If you have coins at the time of the fork you will have coins on both timelines.  At the fork two universes are created, one in which the block size stays the same, and one in which it is doubled.  You will have coins in both universes (blockchains).  If you sell your coins on one chain then you will still have your coins on the other*.  The coins are in two separate universes now, making their own separate paths through the economies.  However they share the same history before the fork.  The same private keys will control both.  It can take a while for your head to wrap around it.
Coinbase has announced that they will make it all simple: if you have your coins on Coinbase at the time of the fork they will separate your coins for you.  You can then cash out of S2X before the price crashes completely and then put your BTC back into your Trezor.  Trezor will likely offer this service as well, but it probably won't be anywhere near as soon.
*actually this might not be true, due to the lack of replay protection in 2X.  This is why we call 2X an attack.

It actually works better, because there are 100,000,000 satoshi's in a bitcoin, and 21 million bitcoins.  If a "bit" became the basic unit we could then say that there are only 21 trillion bits.  That would be much better than saying 210 billion bits.
