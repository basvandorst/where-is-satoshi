But they still live in a scarcity paradigm, where they get the new iPhone because not everyone can get the new iPhone.  Once we're at post-scarcity, I don't see even how primitive human psychology could be tricked into competing for meaningless power.

In a post-scarcity society, there would be no such thing as doing violent things.  Stealing $50 would not get you more resources as a result, and wouldn't be something that even deranged people would do.

Because those are losing values in our system.  If you change the people but not the system, they end up worse off.  Spending time with your family is still anti-profit.
Teaching an inner city family to spend Saturdays together instead of working overtime is not the best action to take *because of the entrenched system*.  Telling the young inner city entrepreneur not to be exploitative, to give up profit for fair working conditions and an eco-friendly business is bad advise in today's world, as the business will not succeed as well as its less altruistic competitors and is more likely to get bought or swallowed up.
No, first and foremost you need to change the system, or you make a bunch of people who are very nice, but that the system will just eat up.

Of course, we were all raised in a stressful society where you're competing for resources from the moment you're born.  How come Native Americans didn't have as much distrust of each other, and shared resources in common?

Eventually, once we get to post scarcity, there would be no reason to take over a neighborhood.

The whole argument hinges on there still being a scarcity based society with limited resources, giving everyone the incentive to get more resources at the expense of the other guys as much as possible.

What about science and basic research?

Wow this place is a real circlejerk.

Exactly.  Now that the bubble has burst and the media attention will go away, I want to start buying a little in the coming weeks or months, and experience a nice steady growth.

Just curious, what kinds of news sites *do* traders use as a source for news?

Why do I still go to this subreddit?
