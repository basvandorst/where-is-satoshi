Yes if we think Litecoin, Bitcoin copies, Nano, etc. 
No if we think Ethereum, VeChain, Stellar, Cardano etc. 
Neither from the latter group is really trying to become the next Bitcoin. Bitcoin does a good enough job already.

Alright, any thoughts is appreciated

And well now it got confirmed finally. I guess thanks Reddit...

It kinda depends on, how well versed with crypto exchanges are you? And crypto wallets? Do you prefer simplicity and ease of use over lower fees? I use Coinbase also, but other times Binance, Kraken or others.
Coinbase with a bank account transfer is always a good choice IMO. You can find some alternatives that I use here

Lol, ok ;)

That's interesting. But only 3 out of many are actually verified according to this site.

Do you mean KYC or is it a fun little joke like ‘Fuck Your Customer’?
In any case you you probably have a bank account today? Maybe you have insurance? Maybe you have drivers license? Etc. 
Given your information for all those haven’t you?

Not really. You connect it to a computer and the Ledger Live app and click on update/upgrade and 1 minute later it's done. Not really that complicated.

That should be on the list, but it is listed in another section than the 'Bitcoin' one.

Cheers. Some good stuff!

Hey, thanks for your input. Useful to help us all get a better idea of ATMs and the benefits and downsides with them.

Sure. 
But there are step by step guides to help beginners use all three. Not everyone knows about Coinbase Pro and have to send funds from their bank to Coinbase but then buy on Coinbase Pro. 
A list of the names won’t give you that :)

Well you can transfer funds from your bank to Coinbase and then buy via Coinbase Pro which has much lower fees. Don't think there's any fee difference then between Kraken and Coinbase (Pro). (more about Coinbase Pro [here](
