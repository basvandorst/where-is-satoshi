While I was tempted to debate you about your initial statements, your last one was the most fascinating.  
Can elaborate on how people are "using it wrong?"

Can elaborate on this comment a bit?  It appears at first glance you're attempting to justify or apologize for Bitcoin's massive carbon footprint somehow. 
Please continue.

Really?  
ETC is a top-twenty coin...  even today they had $120 million in volume.  It can happen with any POW coin.  
I'm honestly not saying this to create unnecessary doubt - I *truly* believe Bitcoin is not as centralized as many believe.

Satoshi never said this!  This is your subjective opinion:  And even if Satoshi - or *anybody* - said this, who are they to say what can and cannot be created with code? 


I think you switched topics from 51% attacks to forking; the funny thing is that I didn't even bring up 'forking' as a criticism of POW, because that's something that can be done for *any* cryptographic network.  It's not specific to POW.  I'm not sure why you're bringing it up here, other than to express irritation that there's more than one cryptographic network in existence.  (which is a preposterous point to make IMO)  


Uh, no.  There can be as many forks as people want.  You can't stop people and projects from creating new cryptographic networks.  Game theory has no impact on people's right to code up new cryptographic networks - most of which are far better than the 'model T' of crypto.

Energy consumption is only one of the intractable problems with proof-of-work.  
It's also not secure.  51% attacks are much more common and tempting than POW maximalists would like you to believe.

1) Pose an honest concern about proof-of-work energy consumption.
2) Immediately an ad-hominem attack ensues.  
Not impressed.

There should be a gif of world governments expelling Satoshi for using the equivalent amount of energy as Austria.  ��

Right now, Bitcoin consumes more power than the nation of Austria.  One analyst from Wired magazine said that Bitcoin is on its way to eclipsing the energy usage of the United States if un-checked.  
At what point would you say it's 'enough?'

Happy you asked.  Visa (fiat) is included on this comparison of energy consumption:

Verified facts = ridiculous propaganda?  
Well, I admit that for Bitcoin maximalists, these facts are quite inconvenient.  Why are you calling Bitcoin energy consumption facts 'propaganda?'
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:20:32
You just avoided all my points and questions, and then resorted to a personal attack once again.  
So your strategy: 
1) Avoid all facts and rational discourse
2) Resort to ad-hominem attacks
3) Hope readers have poor critical thinking skills.  
Good luck.

Well we're on the same page then: Proof-of-work is not secure and can be stolen from with a 51% attack.  
Thank you for agreeing with me?

Completely wrong.  Most electricity is generated by the burning of fossil fuel.

Also, you didn't answer my question:  "At what point would you say it's 'enough?'"
