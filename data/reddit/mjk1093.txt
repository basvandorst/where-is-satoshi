If you have a deposit in a bank, you are a creditor of that bank. If the bank cannot meet its obligations, expect to lose part of your investment (unless it is insured.) Bank accounts are NOT cash that is being "held" somewhere.

Yep, I received a bunch of spooky messages on reddit a few months ago that arrived one by one and were so accurately targeted to me that I looked for a camera hidden in my room. This person seemed to know what was in my room, what activities I'd been to recently, etc. Each was from a different account.
Then one more arrived to the effect of "when did you sign up for welfare?" Fortunately I have never needed welfare. That's when I knew it was just random stuff sent to millions of redditors that was designed to look "targeted" to the few it actually fit. I checked the accounts that sent the messages the next day and they'd all been deleted/banned.

No. Banks are a particular kind of financial firm that borrows short and lends long. Owning some Bitcoin as a long-term store of value is a good idea but it doesn’t make you a bank.

Yes, but you can already do that with anything of value. Nothing special about bitcoin in that regard.

Yeah, I think we're in the oligarchy phase right now.

Either way, that country really does seem to have a death wish. It should be a warning to others: Corrupt oligarchic government --&gt; incompetent and extreme Socialist government --&gt; collapse

Because this is what gets the headlines. And the crazy price predictions haven't panned out. And anything associated with McAfee gets his crazy stink all over it.

I meant the combo of routing+account number, obviously.

If there is fraud on a credit card, isn't the card company liable for the fraud, not the merchant? Or is it that because of fraud, credit card companies won't deal with Coinbase?

I was thinking about doing that, but free checking accounts are actually quite rare these days.

Interesting - why would I have to buy an altcoin first?

I have fraud protection through Visa on my credit card, but I don't think the same protections would apply if someone had my routing numbers. I could be wrong - not an area where I am an expert, so that is part of why I'm wary.

Ok, but then why don't they just let me use a credit card? Basic prudence dictates you just don't give out your bank routing numbers to people.
