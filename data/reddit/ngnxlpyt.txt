Only sell or spend bitcoin when you absolutely have to. Hoarde it! Recognise its value. If others want some of my sweet, sweet bitcoin then they had better offer me an exceptional value proposition.

Yep. Especially the first two.
@_date: 2018-09-25 00:06:29
It's your loss.
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:20:56
You're completely wrong.
Prices are established through supply and demand. If more people are trying to sell or spend their bitcoin, they will depress the price.
You will buy more after spending some? Well, you'll end up with less bitcoin than me because you incur higher transaction costs. If you prefer waste money on transaction costs associated with buying and selling, go right ahead with your futile plan.

Nope. You can, if you like, but I won't.

I understand better than you do. You're a chump. Oh well. I'll just go on holding out until I feel like diversifying or treating myself. You'll go on churning coin and wasting money.

You always lose some money this way to transaction costs. It's better to leave your bitcoin untouched and just spend fiat. If other people want bitcoin, they can go to the exchange and pay the spread for themselves. I'm not a charity.

Ah, you were only kidding!

Wrong. Your idea is stupid. A pedal-powered bitcoin miner! Ride flat stick for 5c/h? Think about it!

How is a currency backed by a military?
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:17:37
I'm not convinced. I thought gold-backing and Bretton-Woods schemes made the US dollar such an influential currency.

By enlarge! Haha. A new eggcorn.

I haven't used localbitcoins since late 2013. Is this true? What the hell?
@_date: 2018-12-16 03:36:11
Freudian slip?
