Thank you so much! Why does a large growth cause centralization? Would you say then, bitcoin cash has a limited future?  If you were to invest for 1, 5, and 10 years, in bcash and bcore, where you you put $100? I'd like to know what future you see each having.

Well that poses an ominously looming problem, doesn't it...

Bcore and bcash?

Why so much hate here for BCash? In an analogy, it seems like 3DS hardware vs PlayStation vita hardware. The DS is bitcoin, with higher support but inferior specs. The vita is cash with better hardware but less support. Why not support a faster transacting and lower fee coin version 2.0?

Why not?

Indeed, hoping they were the right terms xD

I think bitcore is the $6, as per recent posts

Ah sorry. Any thoughts on the hostility towards each other?

Thank you for your patience and explanation!

Another question is, if you could explain, why we need miners? I'm to too sure on the technical terms, but it has to do with processing sales and purchases of bitcoin, correct?

Very very interesting. That helped my understanding here a lot! So would you say core aims to, in the end, achieve low fees and fast transactions like cash, with aforementioned decentralization?
