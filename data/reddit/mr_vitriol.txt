Google "alex jones white supremacy" and you'll get a cogent critique of Oprah's white supremacy by our Mr. Jones.

Lol I'm all for freedom;  and this ain't it.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:04:53
well, justice is ultimately communal. But for precisely that reason it's extremely difficult to pin down. And history teaches us that its nature depends on the tribe in question. All tied up with territory, history, etc.  
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:15:24
You can't handle the truth.
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:31:12
It's always both;  in currency exchange, there is no prime mover.
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:00:45
You can probably exchange to, but not withdraw, fiat.
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:08:42
Lol your fantasy land sounds like a nice place.

You need to read more history. Read Plato's Republic again too;  the whole book attempts to answer the question "what is justice."

Bitcoin is an impenetrable fortress. Impenetrable fortresses always fall in only one way:  betrayal.  But Bitcoin is stronger than a keep, in that you will need to bribe a supermajority of all programmers now alive.
