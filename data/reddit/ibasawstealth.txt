A majority for alcohol alone. I think you can figure out the rest when you add non-prescription drugs.
The numbers support what I'm saying, and it supports my argument that there is a clear demand for drugs in America.

When the numbers support my answers, you fall back to insults as usual. As of now alcohol is not obtainable through the internet. People between the ages 17-21 can not legally obtain alcohol, but statistics show they're consuming it (they could be college students or military personnel).
We can go about semantics all day, my main point still stands. I suggest you go back through my posts because I did mention alcohol. I don't need to explicitly say I'm being general about drugs to make a general argument on the demand of drugs.

It's a billion dollar industry and there's a clear demand for it. Whether it's alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, mdma, coke, shrooms, and etc, the US has a large consumer population for drugs. These are all items that will be on the DarkMarket.
Call me delusional all you want, but the numbers back what I'm saying. I don't see you putting forth a real argument.

Damn that's crazy. Erowid just reported that Alexander Shulgin died.
This is truly a wonderful site, they obviously cared very much about him.

Why? google.com is right there. I see that not only are you incapable of arguing, but ALSO incapable of researching.
If you think I'm going to crunch the numbers for you, you're sadly mistaken.

Today I learned. I actually have Mylar laying around somewhere.

To some extent, yes. This is a really good breakthrough.
I'm going to tell it like it is. The vast majority of Americans want drugs. Since the government is doing everything in its power to prevent this, startups such as the DarkMarket/Silk Road will always be popular. There are not enough resources to check every single package of every single delivery company. Somehow or someway, the trades will go through if the dark market desires it. Ultimately, it will become so out of hand that the government will give up; people will wise up, and the laws will finally change (it's obviously already happening, but state by state). If drug laws are correctly reformed in the United States, then the elephant in the room disappears. After that, every country follows suit, and the drug trade becomes the next legal norm of business.
I believe this is huge, but it will take some years to see its effect.
