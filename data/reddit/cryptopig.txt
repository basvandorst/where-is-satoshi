The only good exchange for Bitcoin that I am aware of is Bitstamp. They do batching, segwith since 7th of September, and as a nice bonus, they also pay for all outgoing fees.

Last time I did it was 2 weeks ago, and I use the good old Bitcoin. The catch is that I keep a small amount of BTC on Bitstamp exchange and use it as a hot wallet because they send transactions in batches, support Segwit and they pay the mining fees. And because they transact in batches, they pay a high fee and transactions get confirmed fast. I know it would be better if I'd be able to do it from a wallet I have a complete control over, but until 2nd/3rd layer solutions mature up, it's good enough for me.

I am absolutely 100% behind this. FSF's founder is Richard Stallman (aka rms), who invented the concept of free software, defined it, and gave it legal framework by writing the General Public License (GPL), which is the most spread copyleft license.
The word free in free software doesn't stand for price, but for freedom/liberty. Through the years a bunch of people coined the term open source to diminish the importance of ethics of the free software movement and gave the movement a substantial blow.
I think it's important that this community supports FSF, because it's values are much in line with what Bitcoin tries to achieve - a greater freedom for the society. They accept bitcoin directly

What is very much need is that the owners should have some kind of a license before being able to own a dog, some kind of a short curse and evaluation of future owners, because too many times it happened that the owners not only return the dogs, but sometimes they outright abandon them, even on highways and other dangerous places. Or they keep the dog, but the dog is utterly unhappy. 
People should be ready for the responsibility that owning a pet brings. 
I know my views are extreme, but we as a society should make a shift in the way we treat animals.

It's not a fault of Armory, Ledger nano (and all other HD wallets too, as far as I know) has the exact same behaviour, what you refer to B address is called change address, and this is meant to improve your pricvacy, so that the recipient (or anyone else observing the transaction) can't know all of your holdings, but just a fraction.

Everyone that's mainly trading in/buying Bitcoin and is concerned about it's network should start using Bitstamp. They transact in batches, has been supporting Segwit from 7th of September, and they  pay for all outgoing fees. We should all show our fuck you to those exchanges that doesn't care by moving our business to those that care.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:28:48
Yes, paper backups. Although storing it digitally is feasible, but you have to know what you're doing. Basically you have to be good at using computers, and be 100% sure your computer is clean from any kind of viruses/malware/spyware (best to do it while running a GNU/Linux live CD like [Tails]( The way to do it is to use Veracrypt to make a smallish container with cascading encryption (meaning it is encrypted 3 times using different algorithms), and encrypt it using a strong, long password you never used before (or after), you never write that password anywhere and only remember it (and never forget it). If you do everything right, than you can have a safe, quantum-resistant backup. But you really have to know what you're doing because 1 misstep could compromise you.

I am not reverting to character assassination, this is just my personal opinion, and what I saw from those three, in my eyes, they are pure scum, and there's nobody that could convince me otherwise. But that doesn't mean I like blockstream, because I don't. This is a multi-billion market, and of course there are financial interests on both sides. Bitcoin (the BTC one) is still the good old Bitcoin, but with added segwit support. And until Bitcoin will remain censorship resistant, permissionless and trustless, I'll support it. Not the people behind it, the technology itself. As far as I understand lightning won't break any of those. Tho I think it would be nice if the blocks would double in their size right now, but not in the way Segwit2x tried to achieve.
The problem with scaling only on-chain is that once you get a shitload of transactions (much, much more than what we have now), you inevitably get such big blocks that you lose decentralisation, which is the means to achieve a trustless, permisionless and censorship resistant network. Once I will perceive that Bitcoin is losing those qualities, I'll stop supporting, but I don't see it yet.

But Segwit addoption is practically zero. Might be because "spam" transactions are all non-segwit? Damn those centralized miners. I am not being sarcastic, I put spam in quotes because from a protocol point of view these are valid transactions.
At any rate 2 mb base block (non-weighted) wouldn't hurt decentralization and would give us some breathing room until layer 2/3 is ready.

Yes, since 7th of Semptember all new addresses made on BitStamp are segwit addresses, and all outbound transactions are segwit. At least since I've been using them, about a month and half. They also pay for the mining fee when you're sending out transactions. Overall I am very happy with them.

Your question is not stupid. SegWit addresses on Bitcoin start with a "3", while old addresses start with "1", and for segwit you have to use a compatible wallet. I personally use a hardware wallet, Ledger Nano S, and on the phone I use Samourai. One other desktop wallet that I am aware that it supports SegWit is [Electrum]( Once you setup a compatible wallet, you'd have to transfer the funds from a non-segwit to a segwit wallet with the means of a transaction. Or if you have a lot of coins, in more transactions for better privacy :)
Which wallet are you using now? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:27:04

To each it's own. Being regulated brings a piece of mind by being protected from shady behaviour on the behalf of the exchange, which is not only good for the users, but also for crpyto in general (avoiding situations like Mt.Gox). If you, on the other hand, want to steer clear from the regulators as much as you can, than decentralized exchanges are the best. One good example is Bisq.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:44:23
I think that's the main problem, influx of new customers. CEO of Bitstamp recently twitted about 100.000 new customers every day (it was posted in r/bitcoin, I don't have a link at hand), which I am sure is a great load for Bitstamp. I hope they will hire a lot of new people for customer support and accounting, so things can be smooth again.

@_date: 2017-12-01 14:05:17
All good and well... until one takes the people behind bcash in to account... a lot was said on Roger Ver lately, than there's Jihan and fake satoshi. It's OK if you believe that a banking cartel has taken over Bitcoin, everyone can have their opinion, but even if that would be true it still doesn't make the backers/creators of bcash any less malicious and selfish. I mean Ver thinks bcash is *his* project, Jihan as a big miner is selfish per default and fake satoshi... I won't even spend any words on the account of that weasel. I think litecoin is ethically a milion times better than bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:43:00
Pure speculation on my part, but as I understand, Jihan/Bitmain owns 3 mining pools (antpool, Viapool and I don't remember which is the 3rd), so it's a possibility that Bitmain could be sending transactions between their pools, as most of the spam transactions would be mined by them, so they'd get a big portion of the fees back. Plus given the wealth they gathered with covert ASIC boost (allegedly they didn't use it, but I see no reason they wouldn't use a technology they patented and included in their miners, was invisible in its usage untill Segwit, and it gives you a 20% advantage), they have a lot of financial background to use in trying to leverage their influence over Bitcoin... or to simply replace it with their pre-segwit coin (let's not forget that Roger Ver is not only a friend of Jihan, but also a owns a mining pool himself). Not saying it is like that because I don't know anything, but it's a possibility. And how they act, I wouldn't be surprised it is so.
As for the centralization in regards to block size - I red recently that the size of a block doesn't impact mining, because all they mine is the header of a block, so it wouldn't affect it much. As for validating nodes, going from 1 to 2 MB base block size would increase the total potential size of a block (100% segwit transactions) to 8 MB, if I got it right.
So having potentially 8 MB blocks every 10 minutes would mean at most (100% segwit transactions, every block is full) about 900 GB of storage in 2 years. With storage being so cheap and only getting cheaper, I don't see it as a problem for anyone that's willing to run a full node, and also it's not that big of a deal in terms of bandwith, at least not in Europe, because this one too is getting cheaper and faster all the time. And this is the worst case scenario, which is pretty unrealistic IMO (having 100 % full blocks with 100% segwit transactions).
EDIT: Bitmain's pools are [Antpool, BTC.COM and ConnectBTC](
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:05:30
I was using them prior of them becoming unusable. Tho as far as I know, they don't support Segwit, right? And also with Bitcoin surging in price their fees are probably quite hefty (in comparison to no fees on Bitstamp). Not trying to shit down on anyone, just looking for best quality. Overall Kraken is pretty great.

We're talking about Bitcoin and it's high fees, so I was reffering specifically to Bitcoin. I asked if he uses segwit addresses because he was paying a pretty low feet. And yes, LTC has also SegWit activated. But SegWit is just a new format for addresses that separates witness data in another part of the block so transactions are smaller. Both old and new formats are valid and compatible.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:02:38
I can feel your pain. They are overflown with new customers (apparently about 100 000 daily, at least according to their CEO), so you will have to be patient.

7zip has a great encryption but if your holdings will be worth billions dollars one day and quantum computing becomes a thing I wouldn't trust it because it's very fast to brute force. 
TrueCrypt only if you have the safe version, and not the version that was posted as official at the time when the devs disbanded. Might be even better to upgrade to VeraCrypt, they made bruteforcing even slower. IMO VeraCrypt with cascading encryption and a long complex pass is the safest digital stronbox currently in existance.

That's not completely accurate. Less and less bitcoins get mined because every 4 years the emission rate cuts by half. Right now 12.5 bitcoins get mined roughly every 10 minutes. The difficulty adjusts dynamically in accordance with the total hashrate of the miners to ensure we get a new bitcoin block every 10 minutes. The more are people mining bitcoin, the more difficult it gets, and vice versa.

You are right they should lead by example, and I believe that developers of Bitcoin Core are too slow to react, wish they had someone like Linus Torvalds leading the project - someone capable of keeping the project at a steady peace and taking decisions fast. 
Tho for Segwit specifically it was planned for an earlier release but Jihan &amp; co. managed to distract the devs with Segwit2X. And let's not forget that Core is not a simple wallet but a full node, so they need to test everything and make sure nothing bad starts happening with the network. So it's a complex issue, while devs of simple wallets don't have such complexities at hand, and should act faster if they care for the health of Bitcoin's network.

I moved from Kraken over to BitStamp when Kraken became unusable for trading/buying Bitcoins, and I love them. It is similar to Kraken in that you can buy/sell in the tradeview or on the normal webpage, but they also offer sub-accounts (cool feature because I also buy Bitcoin for some family members so I can keep everything separated), support SegWit, and no withdrawal fees whatsoever.

ADDENDUM: If you'll go with a VPN, than give Mullvad a try; I just checked, and they have a server in Japan, so you could use that; also what's nice with Mullvad is they accept payments with Bitcoin, so if you have some funds on Bitstamp, you can pay directly trough it since Bitstamp covers mining fees :) But that's just a suggestion because I know how great Mullvad is, it's up to you.

If you're OK filling up additional KYC questions, than go with Bitstamp, they are great all around, are fully regulated etc... they are not doing additional KYC checks for their own protection (as I understand it, it's in case you'd do any kind of money laundering or tax evasion they can show the document to the authorities that you filled up and say "we checked/done everything we could")

Standard verification - an ID from both sides and a proof of residence. If I remember right, no need for a selfie.
No limits whatsoever, but when you're cashing out (moving money to your banking account) they might require some more info from you (how much gains you made and such, for tax purposes). More info:

If it's a  small sum, than it's OK to go with Bitstamp. But if you're trying to fiat a larger amount, than you'll have to do a KCY questionnaire and give them details about your investments, which is shitty. Kraken is a good alternative to cash out for Europeans, because they have a Bank in Germany, might be your best bet actually. Wouldn't know about any other.

Exactly, the only way you can really make a stance in a market is to vote with your wallet so to speak, so moving our business to exchanges and other services that support segwit is the only sensible thing to do. 
Don't know how's with support for the US banks and customers, you'll have to check it out for yourself. For me, everything works smoothly, but I am from Europe, and SEPA transfers are very fast. 
They are fully regulated, and licensed in Luxembourg, so no funky business like at so many other exchanges. But the fact is that they are Europe-focused.

As far as I know it should be a legit site, but I don't know much about it and I never used it, so take it with a grain of salt. If I were you (or liad), I'd put the minimum required money and move out Bitcoins you/liad bought immedietly after.

Bitstamp is the best for Europeans (and they have Segwit, batch transactions and no outgoing fees - they pay the miners), but you have to initiate bank deposits on a computer, tho once you have the money on the exchange, you can trade on their mobile app.

I recall community was outraged because of how it was executed and because we didn't trust the sole developer that Jihan and friends brought to the table. And rightfully so, did you see how the fork imploded when said developer tried to push it through even if Jihan&amp;friends called the fork off.
But I personally support extending the base size of the blocks to 2 mb, just not in the way Segwit2x tried to do it, and I am sure I am not alone in this.

I think that Bitcoin core is not the most used wallet. Leger, electrum, samourai and a few others support it already. Bitstamp is an exchange that supported it since 7th of September. Users have options, we just need to move our asses a bit.

If an address starts with "1", it's the old format, while if it starts with "3", it's SegWit. With a paper wallet it's probably the old format.

OK, than don't do anything yet, and when you'll be configuring the Nano, chose Segwit as your default wallet, and you're all set since you will move your funds on it.
Also when you'll be sending the coins on nano, I suggest you to send a very small amount on it first, and than wipe it by entering a false PIN 3 times, and try restoring your wallet with seed words. Once you're sure that restoring works normally and after the reset nano shows you your mini transaction, you're ready to send the rest of the coins there. This way you won't lose your coins at a later time if something happens to your nano and restoring doesn't work as expected (mistyped word or something like that).

I know about AXA being an investor in Blockstream. When I say spreading misinformation I mean "The governance of bitcoin is no longer in the hands of independent devs, but a few private entities like Blockstream". Where is the evidence that the development of Bitcoin is in the hands of Blockstrem? Which other private entities? What portion of Bitcoin source code was merged that is specifically there to benefit AXA/Bidleberg? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:20:33
Glad to be of assistance. 
I've only seen now that you are also questioning it in terms of security... VPN offers you a way better security than being connected directly, because it's an additional layer between you and the network, and hides your IP, so anyone that would want to act maliciously towards you, would attack the server that's proxying your connection instead of your computer, while attacks that are executed remotely like through javascript in a webpage - the VPN is neutral here, doesn't affect you neither positively, neither negatively.
Also it's more secure because all traffic from your computer to the server of your VPN provider is enveloped in an encrypted tunnel, so neither your ISP, nor any governmental agency, nor any other corporation can spy on the traffic and doesn't know where you're connecting to. And a good VPN also acts as a firewall because all ports are closed by default. So it's definitely a plus to your security, you just have to use a trustworthy VPN provider.
I can't recommend any other except Mullvad, because my research stoped once I found them. Just don't use services like HideMyAss, they are known to doxx their customers so their neither secure, nor private.

I have used Kraken, but a few months ago it became unusable because their trading engine was overflowed and it only screwed up with me, so I moved over to BitStamp, and so far the experience is great. Plus they use SegWit, and they pay for all crypto transfers out of their wallet. Very happy with them

You're absolutely right, a lot must be done before we'll be anywhere near ready for mass adoption. Like Andreas Antonopoulos pointed out many times in his fantastic talks, Bitcoin and crypto in general is technology wise about at the same point as the internet was in the early nineties... we're still in the phase of laying foundations to the whole infrastructure/ecosystem, but once we get the scaling and usability right, it might spread like wildfire.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:01:49
There's no indication that they are ready to increase the block size right now or in a very near future. I know that if miners wouldn't spam the network would be a lot healthier, but it's the users and Bitcoin's public image that suffers from that. I hope new, non-Bitmain ASICs come to the market place soon and we see some decrease in power of Bitmain.
While for a user-forced increase of the the blocksize... if the sentiment gets enough widespread and we all install a modified full node that would enforce this new consensus, we could go for a UASF.

As far as I understand, Trezor's firmware is all under a permissive license, while at least a part of the firmware on Ledger, namely the one on the secure element where the keys are kept, is prioprietary, and because of the licensing of the secure element itself (which is not produced directly by Ledger), they are not permited to distribute or even show the code of this part of the firmware. I don't know what's the situation with the licenses for the client software that runs on the computer.

It may not be ideal for the player himsef, but it's good for Bitcoin economy if people are getting payed in it and also merchant start adopting it more. All we need now are 2nd/3rd layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:50:53
Bitcoin Core is the most private in the sense that it downloads the whole ledger ("blockchain") on the computer, and it acts as a node for the network, so if you use it to transact, you don't broadcast your transactions directly to a 3rd party in order for them to propagate it to other nodes for you, but you broadcast the transaction directly to other nodes, and other nodes don't know if that's your transaction or you're just passing someone else's transaction to them.
Electrum or any other light wallet needs to pass your transaction information to a node for you, which gives them the ability to log your transactions, thus making them a lot less private.

But what I have, I am hodling, not selling a cent! I'm keeping my fingers that crypto will turn my life for the better too.
Tho I'll be real, the real reason I want crypto to go to the moon (mass adoption) is because of the whole tech behind Bitcoin and the potential too disrupt the current financial system, making money is just a nice side effect :)

@_date: 2017-11-26 15:00:24
I use segwit addresses, which are a new type of address that takes less space in the blockchain and thus you pay less fees for them and right this instant the low fee with the ledger is 0.0002 BTC (1.80 $), medium is a few cents more and high is another few cents more.
But ledger is not that brilliant in guessing the right fees at the moment, as even the low fee would get you confirmed in the next block, so you should go with custom fees and set it for about 70 cents and have it still confirmed in the next few blocks. I personally am OK with that, but it's still not ideal for microtransactions, tho we'll get there.

Not having a private key means that the one that has it (Coinbase in this case) have control over your Bitcoins, but they still let you move your coins out.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:44:40
You don't actually own anything... You have access to the account which in turn has access to the coins you bought/traded. But the coins in terms of ownership on the blockchain belongs to the exchange, unless you move them in your wallet/to your private keys.
What this means is that in case the exchange goes down, say bye bye to them, or if government orders them to freeze your account, they will just do that. If the coins are under your direct control, than, unless someone coerces you with force to surrender them, nobody can touch them.

Mass addoption means that less and less people will care about ideology/ethics of the underlying technology, and will focus on the more pragmatical sides and basic things like greed. Sadly. The same happened to Free software when the newer generation coined the term open source in order to lose the ethical side of it and make it more appealing to the corporate world, because they thought that ethics are hindering the adoption of free software, but with simplifying their message they also undermined what they were fighting for (freedom and revolution in the software world). The one that coined the term and created The Open Source Definition, Bruce Perens, later regretted it and realised the error in thinking they could cut corners in order to "conquer the world".

Definitely this. 
But if you still insist on your strategy, and since you'd be uploading the encrypted file online, I'd suggest to use Veracrypt for encrypting the container instead of making a dmg, because with Veracrypt you can make cascading encryption (for example encrypting the container with AES-Twofish-Serpent), plus its containers are very slow to brute-force, so in case of quantum computers sometime in the near future your wallet should still be safe. Just use a long and complex passphrase and never forget it.

Implying that bcash=bitcoin is what's repulsive. Yes, it's a viable asset to transfer wealth, but so is eth and all the other alts. Currently bitcoin/BTC is also viable if one is using segwit.
And if someone supports THE bitcoin, than they shouldn't buy bcash with it. At least that's *my* opinion.

Same for me! Saw this video before I had any idea about anything, and before I knew who Roger Ver is, and it just stuck me as... fake, forced. Once I got to know more about him and his work it just confirmed to me he's a faker.

I hear it's not possible at the moment, which is a little bit worrisome. I use ledger with Segwit addresses and knowing I can restore it safely in a non-Ledger environment in case it gets stolen/broken/whatever would give me a bit of a piece of mind.

I think we're all disappointed
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:22:27
I also reported the video... fecking scumbags!

I can confirm this... it's really weird that regular fee is a lot lower than the low fee.

Hey man! It suck what happened to you... I sent you a PM yesterday.

Talking about VPNs and Bitcoin... with mullvad (mullvad.net) you don't have to even provide an email address to them, so it can be 100% anonymous (and they are great with privacy, with a really simple privacy policy, and they even accept cash by mail for those not holding cryptos). 
Not affiliated with them, just a happy user.

Apparently it's advisable to avoid this site
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:10:05
I only see **Coin**source
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:39:02
Well it's on bitcoin.com, so it's probably showing you the Segwit2X value, thus the charts are working 100%

Because I got the Ledger very recently and didn't know about that, and since I was making a new wallet, I chose Segwit over legacy since I wanted to support the network (and myself with lower fees).
I don't remember where I red that for now Ledger's Segwit addresses are not importable in other wallets, but I believe it was in the official Ledger subreddit. Tho it was also said that the Ledger is working on a fix for this.
Hopefully it'll come out soon. I am not overtly worried because my mom also has a Nano Ledger and in a case of an emergency I could use her's.

From the phone wallets I tried, my favourite is Samourai. I think it's the most privacy-respecting wallet for phones, it's very solid, and supports Segwit addresses.
