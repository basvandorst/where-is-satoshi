No inheritance of BTC should be allowed! We are heading to a "no trust" society defined by merit, and that's fine so!

If you think about it timeless... yes, BTC value in US$ can go infinitely.
If you think about it at one specific point at time... BTC value in US$ can go this much.
value is timeless, money is not

Dotted paper and still can't draw it symmetrical

Please go on! I am waiting to read it!

Please elaborate!

Yes, new fiat money can be printed at will. This will drive inflation very high... with infinite inflation will come an infinite high value in US$ for BTC! Unfortunately that is also true for other things, like eggs for example. Very high inflation is ridiculing money but not value itself.

I couldn't find any numbers for worldwide M3 and M4. Also I think there is no legal basis and no technology to include all assets...
Even a BTC loan can't function at this time. If you give away your BTC there is no guarantee that you will get them back or even claim them legally back. Once in the blockchain, forever in the blockchain!

Of course! Mr. Robot is fiction after all!...

That's interesting! So even if the machine (or machines) with the longest chain die for whatever reason some other machine can with a honest node, as proof of being the longest chain with most accumulative work at this time, continue working.
My thought is that a big enough hacker attack targeting all these machines could in theory destroy the ledger... After all Bitcoin is just software running on machines! Right?

It's not about investing in Bitcoin. It's about principle.
For example, to destroy a fiat currency you could burn all existing bank notes, coins and printing forms of that currency. In this way a particular fiat currency would be de facto be destroyed.
However, Bitcoin has to evolve beyond just an investment if it wants to be largely accepted as currency.

Today I saw a video about the 184Β Bitcoin Bug in 2010 that has been fixed...
There might be some other bugs that are still not discovered or did not get public yet. Thanks for your advice!
EDIT: Thanks for the corrections.
