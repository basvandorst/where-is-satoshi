Fair point, and noted.  For $25,000 i hope you got good use out of it ;)
Ended up using PIA and satisfied so far.

We all understand the fact that Bitcoin is a public ledger of transactions, but how does that tie me to a transaction from one randomly generated public key to another?

Rogers unfortunately.
Here in Canada we have bandwidth caps in addition to paying for a level of service speed, but those are complaints for another thread!

You are correct.

Yes there is weird activity coming from the United States (Im in Canada).
No password reset emails, but its apparent that this is how they got into my wallet ..
This is incredibly frustrating and Im really at a loss for words, but thank you for taking the time to reply and help me out.
I'd tip you but Im all out of coin!
Edit: Can I do anything with IP addresses that accessed my gmail account?
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:41:22
It sure was.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:57:26
Could you explain how?
@_date: 2014-04-09 01:20:08
How would they have accessed my wallet without the 2FA code that would have been sent to my mobile number?

Sweet username ..

I upvoted E-GovLink's response but just wanted to add that the reason BTC is appealing to many people lies in the fact that they cannot be minted at the whim of central planning authority, increasing the supply and devaluing the currency.
