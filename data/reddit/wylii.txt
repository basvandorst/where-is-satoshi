Most modification is a gainful use of time, admittedly, some people do stupid shit. You learn mechanical skills, can typically fix your own vehicle, and the friends you make are great. 
For the most part, car culture in general is an amazing experience and is comprised of a group of people in constant pursuit of improvement. I don't understand why you're so hostile about it.

Go to the eth or ltc apps in your chrome and open up the ledger app on the device.
For eth I always use MEW, in the device open eth app, go to settings, click the browser setting, turn to on. Go back one menu, go to contract settings and turn to on.
Then go to Myetherwallet and click the open ledger device and if your app is open mew will let you explore it and you will see your public address to send to.

I no longer matched public records. My last name had two "R" at the end instead of one. But they verified me once with that mistake and I traded for months before this was an issue. Then when I pulled out $1,000 (about 33% of my bittrex portfolio, at the time) to pay an unexpected bill I was unverified within 6 hours of withdrawl. Leaving thousands in an account I cannot withdraw from.

Think about what you just asked... Why would they hyper inflate the world economy to destroy one extremely small facet of the economy? That rate of inflation would be about 1,000x worse than the Bolivar situation and would pretty much solidify crypto as a primary means of exchange.

It just needs to hit the stop price and it will sell or buy at whatever the market price is, as quickly as possible, but only if it hit your stop price. But like I said, it will be a market order price order to get out or in as quickly as possible

I reread that and feel I need to clarify. A Limit will not guarantee sell or purchase of your entire order, a stop will sell the entire order at whatever the market is at. If your stop loss is at 10k but there is a flash crash it will sell everything in one order regardless if it rebounds immediately to $10,001 or can't fulfill the full order until $6,000.

Do not touch your 401k, take half your savings if you really want to invest 10k. 10k at 25 with 8% yoy returns on average is worth over $400,000 after 40 years.
The same cannot be said about your savings with it's measly 0.1% returns.

I do have two Nano S, one brand new in box in my dresser and the other is used for storing my keys. I figured buy two in case one fails or the company goes under. Probably not necessary but makes my feel more comfortable. At the end of the day the extra $75 to protect thousands of dollars just gives me a little more peace of mind. To each their own though. As stated above you can always recover without a Nano, I'm just not sure of the process and don't trust myself to set up a truly secure wallet.

A stop creates a market order at a certain price. A limit order creates these sell walls and buy walls. 
Say you have a stop order at $10,000usd for BTC. If it hits 10k it fulfills your sell stop or sell buy at whatever price it can as quickly as possible, just as long as that specified price was hit.
If you have a limit order it will sell whatever portions it can at the exact specified limit price.

Go to a credit union and ask them their thoughts on transferring a sum that large into their bank if you open an account. Then maybe GDAX, my buddy pulled a few hundred thousand out with no issues. You're on another order of magnitude though.

Just like in manufacturing. I can have great efficiencies on one of my production lines, making tons of parts a day with minimal down time but did I really create any value if our sales guys can only sell 10 units a month?
Just because it costs something (time, materials, energy) to make some thing, does not mean it will have inherent value.

Same here, were you verified before and all of a sudden you have half your portfolio stuck on an exchange also? They did list my tickets as solved though, I guess that is some sort of response...

That would make their year end taxes a nightmare, between keeping track of usd values when payment is received, reporting losses due to price fluctuation and on the reverse side reporting capital gains, which would be taxed at a much higher percentage since all of the payments would most likely be extremely short term holdings.

You do realize student loans will, even while deferred, accrue interest right? Please, do not do this. You're setting yourself up for break even at best or massively in debt at worst.
As someone in a massive amount of debt (~ $30k on credit cards, was $40k last year so I'm improving slowly) due to previous drug problems, I beg you not to hamstring your financial stability like this.

Eventually it could, you don't start with full blown assault on citizens. You lump them into subcategories and slowly strip rights. Then add more subcategories and strip more rights. Then you end up with Nazi Germany's antisemitic policies that were accepted by the people. Then you add people of African descent, then you add homosexuals, then you add Gypsys. 
If you can make it "us" against "them," people will be open to many surprising things you wouldn't think could be a possibility.

Yeah but I don't plan on having millions in crypto when I retire. Having a few thousand in it now is fine for the offshoot it could be worth tons. As of January I was up 1600% from my initial investment in July, that is now around 800%. The swings don't bother me because the money I put in would not leave me homeless. As far as your 2% down-draw comment:
At my current age (28) with $40k in my 401k and my current contribution of $10.5k a year over the next 37 years and a 6% annual growth (extremely conservative), I will have ~$1.6M at retirement with 0.2% fees. Same value and same growth in same period of time at 2% fees I will have ~$1.03M, that is a $570,000 difference because of 1.8% difference compounded over 37 years.
Now if you add in my contributions to my Vangaurd Roth IRA fund that are at 0.08% fees (and returned 28% growth last year, might I add) I would be losing well over a million in fees by retirement.
Fuck that, give your money away but I won't be joining you. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:34:05
Not necessarily, it has been proven many times that index funds regularly outperform managed funds on a point for point basis. I plan for 6% but expect an average of 10% YOY for the next 10-15 years. In 10 years I will begin gradually reducing my risk exposure to begin to protect my assets.
But if you could "guarantee" 10% YOY growth with 2% annual fees I would most likely reallocate 10-15% of my portfolio right now and  would increase gradually increase my holdings in your fund as I approached retirement.
Unfortunately, no one can guarantee any growth and when the market slump I'm losing points plus a guaranteed 2% fee on top of any loss.

Peaky Blinders is my damn favorite show, been watching it since season 1, you got lucky because it took damn near 2 years for season 2 to come out.
Tom Hardy's character is amazing in it. 
But still waiting on the Real Rock n Rolla to come out, probably never going to happen...

Any Vanguard index fund should be around 0.04 to 0.1%, not sure about minimum contributions because after my first job I had enough to roll over a decent sum. I set my girlfriend up with a Vangaurd Roth IRA with $1000.

Negative, Miller's planet was tidally locked in a stable orbit around the black hole. The reason they said this is "possible" is because Gargantua was a rotating black hole which bent space around it. The planet has 130% of the gravity on earth but is football shaped and moves 99.9% of the speed of light. The waves on the planet are actually not moving, they are locked in place, the planet was rocking* the Interstellar crew into the stationary waves.
*edit: change rotating to rocking
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:57:49
It doesn't rotate, I misspoke, the planet rocks back and forth since it is oblong.

From all of the theoretical papers by Kip Thorne it appears the movement around the black hole pulls and pushes the planet causing it stretch and squeeze on the sides of the planet.

But typically rental prices won't fall too far, if you are making the passive income and the price bottoms out you will be ok because your payments are still covered if you maintain your tenants. This gives the flexibility to weather a pop. If it is not costing you any money out of pocket to maintain the properties, you keep them, collect the monthly profits and wait 5 to 10 years for a recovery. Then decide to sell or continue to hold and take the monthly dividends.
