It would be hilarious if bitcoin increased the block size to 2 mb now, not because lightning network is deployed, not because of segwit, not because of high transaction fees -- but merely to fuck with the bcash guys.  Transaction fees would drop to nothing so fast, and it would be obvious that bcash is just a wannabe coin with no real long-term utility.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this case doesn't seem to be about bitcoin or money laundering at all.  This is the first document (the charges) from 
People who use controlled substances are "prohibited persons" under federal firearms laws.  Basically, if you smoke weed you aren't allowed to buy guns or ammo.  This person bought some ammo after having been convicted of marijuana possession, and that's illegal.  What does that have to do with bitcoin or money laundering?  Were the charges amended later to add new charges and now it has become about that?

Lightning Network is no more risky than accepting bitcoin payments the normal way.  Either way, you have to run a node/wallet and protect against malware/hackers/etc.  Either way, if your computer is compromised you are at risk of losing all your cryptocurrency stored on that computer.
LN is trustless, so your node being compromised only risks YOUR funds.  Nobody else's funds are at risk if your node is compromised.

I don't think it's suspect.  It's just defensively maintaining control in case there are bugs.  If there's a bug/exploit that say, allows someone to steal a million btc, as long as there are no withdrawals they can always roll back the transactions.
It would be suspicious if they kept withdrawals disabled for an extended period.  If you don't trust them, you can just wait until they enable withdrawals.

Proof by induction:  In the extreme case, say 100 exabyte blocks, how many individuals/organizations in the world could have the storage necessary to be a full node?  A handful?
Therefore if decentralization is harmed a lot in the extreme case, then decentralization is harmed a little with each increment.
Or, run it the other way.  Imagine if bitcoin could function fine on a 1kb block size instead of 1mb.  Now imagine all the additional nodes that could easily be run on all the raspberry Pi's in the world, on older smartphone, hell even your refrigerator could be a node.  Decentralization would be greatly **improved** by reducing the block size.
Of course, bitcoin eventually needs a larger block size for other reasons (scale).  But from a "decentralization is good" standpoint, smaller block size means better decentralization.

Well, if you have a big input and a big output, it's not a problem.  If you have a little input and a little output, it's not a problem.  If you have a big input and a ton of little outputs, it's not a problem (assuming you're spending your bitcoins in small amounts on multiple occasions, not talking about a single transaction with many outputs here because only exchanges will probably do that, not people).
It's only a problem if you have a ton of little inputs, and a big output.  In that case, it makes sense to pass the cost onto you directly by making everyone pay for the **size** of their transaction (in bytes), rather than some other solution which passes the cost onto everyone.

Your professor is smart. There are over 200 countries in the world, and many if not most of them have their own currency.  The US dollar is the primary currency of the world, mostly because countries agreed to buy and sell oil denominated in US dollars (google "Bretton Woods agreement"), but still the US dollar hasn't replaced the Euro or the Japanese Yen or the Chinese Yuan or the British Pound.   They exist alongside each other.
There's no reason to think anything other than that, even if bitcoin gains preeminence in *some* countries, most will prefer to keep their fiat currency even if only half its citizens are using it and the other half are using bitcoin.
Eventually...  eventually...   maybe like 500 years from now, we will have a single world government and a single global currency, and maybe that currency will be bitcoin.  That could happen.  But it's so far in the future that it's pure speculation.  Generally, when predicting the future, the farther out in time you go the more the future will be different from anything you could imagine.
Do you think people from 50 years ago could imagine smartphones, or cryptocurrencies, or self-driving cars, or... the list goes on.  So even 50 years from now, let alone 500, who really knows what the hell is going to happen.

The system is set up with a "difficulty" starting at 1.  Miners compete to see who can solve the puzzle the fastest according to the difficulty.  The miner that solves it the fastest, gets the block reward which started at 50 bitcoins. Then the puzzle resets, and all the miners are competing to see who can solve block 2.  Every 2000 blocks, the difficulty adjusts based on how many people have been mining, so that on average a block is solved once every 10 minutes.  Every 3-4 years, the block reward is halved, which has happened twice already so currently you only get 12.5 bitcoins when you solve a block.  The miners that are solving the blocks can include whatever transactions they want in the block, or none at all, but they can't include more than 1 megabyte of transactions in a block (block size limit).  The transaction fees, in addition to the block reward, are given to the miner that solves each block, so it's to the miners advantage to include as many transactions as they can so their profit is greater.
Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined block number 1.  In fact, he mined for a few days before anyone else mined, so yeah he was getting 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes for a few days.  No one knows who Satoshi actually is, or if he's still alive, or if he still has those original bitcoins.  However on a long enough timeframe, bitcoins do get lost, so although there were actually quite a few people that had thousands of bitcoins those first few months, most of that is gone now.  As the price of bitcoin rises, it gets more and more tempting to sell some or all of what you have -- plus sometimes they get stolen, or lost when a hard drive crashes with no backup, or accidentally erased, or people that just gave up on bitcoin and forgot about it back when the price was less than a dollar a bitcoin which was actually quite a while at the beginning.

The problem isn't what happens in the first few blocks after the block size is increased.  The problem (and the reason they are delaying increasing the block size) is that over time, the entire blockchain will grow twice as fast.  This harms decentralization because it's more difficult for the little guy to run a node if the blockchain is super big.
Also, transaction fees incentivize segwit and LN adoption.  So if they increased the blocksize now, everyone would say "why bother implementing segwit and LN? fees are basically zero".  Then we'd be back in the same place a year or two from now when the 2mb blocks were full, and a bunch of people are screaming "implement LN it's been ready for 2 years now!" and a bunch of other people screaming, "why put us through all that work? just increase the block size again, it worked last time."

Yeah, well, transaction fees are back too.
300 satoshis/byte transactions and below are getting stuck in the mempool again.  If you want your transaction to not get stuck you have to pay more than that right now.
I know fees go up and down like the tides, but the high price of bitcoin combined with it results in bad publicity ($30 fees to send any amount at the high point two weeks ago) for bitcoin and ANTI-adoption (people dropping bitcoin) such as Steam.  It makes baby Jesus cry.  :(

Coinbase is not a wallet, it is an exchange.
You should never use an exchange as a wallet.
Keep your bitcoins on a paper wallet or hardware wallet.  Transfer them to an exchange like coinbase or gemini only when you intend to trade/sell them, and then move them back to a paper/hardware wallet you control for safety.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:16:40
So you asked a few different questions here, but I've got some answers for ya.


Many/most wallets are configured by default to use a new change address for each transaction. You don't even have to know what it is, it happens in the background and your wallet keeps track of all your addresses.


Well that's why bitcoin is called "pseudonymous" not "anonymous".  You can indeed see the full history of all transactions that have ever taken place by anyone, ever.  However, it is just a list of bitcoin addresses and money flowing in and out.  You have no idea who owns those addresses unless you discover it by means outside of bitcoin.


The supply is limited, but it can also be infinitely divisible.  Right now, bitcoin goes to 8 decimal places -- you can own 0.00000001 btc (1 satoshi).  If bitcoin becomes so expensive that each satoshi is more than a penny (so each bitcoin would be at least $1 million), then they can without too much trouble modify the code so that bitcoin is divisible to 12 decimal places, or 20, etc.

Currently everyone must pay between 50-100 satoshis/byte to get their transaction included in the blockchain.  You can set whatever fee you want, but if you pay too low of a fee (or none at all), then your transaction will not be confirmed for a long time, or never.
GDAX lets you withdraw without fees because they do enough business to swallow the fees.  They pay the fee on your behalf.

This actually makes sense.  Airports love to do stuff extra-national like sell tobacco and booze duty-free.  In that context cryptocurrency fits right in.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:34:27
Correct.  If you have a lot of little inputs, you can just send all your money, in one transaction, to a new address you control.
That new address will then have one input, so any time you spend money from that address (to a single output address), the transaction will be the smallest possible (one input, one or two outputs depending on whether you get change back which you do if you didn't spend your entire balance).

You have to have a btc savings account (on-chain address), because part of how LN works securely is that if any intermediary tries any funny business, the other parties can abort and send the refund to the btc address (on-chain).
Basically, I pay you $5 and tell you to then pay Bob $5, and SIMULTANEOUS with my payment to you, you sign a contract that says if Bob doesn't get the 5 bucks within X time, I can abort this channel and send the $5 back to my btc address.

It's not ignored.  The lightning network slides clearly show that they plan to eventually have a 133mb block size which, with the lightning network, allows everyone in the world to do 2 transactions/day or something like that.  The same usage without the lightning network would require 10gb+ block size.
It's just that, full blocks and decent sized transaction fees incentivize everyone to implement segwit/batching/LN.  If you raise the block size prematurely, everyone breathes a sigh of relief and then no one bothers to implement LN because it's not needed...  until the new bigger blocks are full too and now you're back to square one.

Transactions are stored in the blockchain forever. Right now, the entire blockchain is verifiable, which is a very useful property. But it's already 240 gigabytes in size, growing by 1 mb per block (per 10 minutes).
Altcoins that are new and don't have 9 years of history, have no problem using 8 mb or more blocksizes because it's no big deal. But in 9 years, their blockchain will be so much larger that it could be hard to manage. Eventually a blockchain could get so large that you couldn't easily verify transactions all the way back to their origin, which would be undesirable.
That's the centralization argument.  If the blockchain gets to be say, 20 terabytes in size, you can't even store it on a single hard drive at current capacities. Even if it doesn't get that big, there are RAM implications because you have to load large portions of it to verify transactions.  So the bigger the entire history gets, the bigger and badder a computer you need to be able to properly do the job. That's centralization, because the little guys are shut out.
The bitcoin devs accept that eventually larger block sizes will be needed. The current transaction rate isn't going to cut it if people all over the world actually start using bitcoin daily.  They estimate that eventually, if everyone in the world uses bitcoin and makes 2 transactions a day, but uses the lightning network, a 133mb blocksize will be needed.  Without the lightning network, something like a 200gb (GIGABYTE) size PER BLOCK would be needed to accommodate that much usage.
They have the lightning network, it's usable, it just needs to be adopted/implemented by wallets and exchanges now.  The trouble is, the high transaction fees are kind of an incentive to implement segwit and LN.  So if they raised the blocksize, the blocks wouldn't be full, transaction fees would come down to nothing, but then nobody would implement LN until the blocks got full again at 2mb/block instead of 1mb/block. Then we'd be back in the same situation we're in now.  Might as well let the transaction fees incentivize adoption of segwit and LN, and increase the block size later.
That's the argument anyway.

@_date: 2018-01-12 21:01:06


Absolutely not.
First of all, no software is bug free.  So you're arbitrarily picking some point to say it's "fully developed and tested" in the first place.
Secondly, estimating the time software development will take is notoriously difficult when you know the specific software that needs to be developed.  Figuring out a time that would apply to "new features" in all cases is doomed *ab initio*.  What I mean is, if you wanted to answer the question, "How long does it take to fully develop and test new features of this software?" without saying what those new features specifically are, is a question that **cannot** be answered.  It's not just that your idea of "1-2 years" is a wrong answer, it's that this question cannot be answered period.  It's too vague of a question and the variance of software development/testing is too high.  Some features will take a day to be "fully developed and tested" (however you define that) and some features will take much much much longer.  Now you have to define, "what is a feature?"...  good luck with that.

It seems to me that the person saying "no one will ever retrieve those lost coins, ever, for a million years" is the extraordinary claim.  We have no idea whether we'll have the ability to retrieve those coins (crack the private keys) 100 years or 1000 years from now, but it seems damn likely.  Think about the technology from 100 years ago and whether that would pose much of a problem for a determined attacker with modern technology.
Bitcoin could change to a more secure algorithm before then, but that too is not guaranteed.  My only claim is that you can't say definitely those coins are lost forever.  Because there is some possibility, no matter how small, that they could be retrieved, the probability is not zero and therefore it is not guaranteed they will be forever lost.  Forever is a very, very long time.

If you receive a lot of small inputs, it doesn't matter whether they all go to the same address or not.  They are still "unique inputs" so if you send a larger transaction that has to use multiple of the inputs, the transaction size will be larger and the fee will be higher.
So what you're proposing won't help.  What will help, is after you have received a bunch of unique inputs, wait until the transaction fees on the network are low.  Then create a transaction that sends all your money to a single new address (of yours).  This combines all the inputs so that when you need to send it later, it comes from a single input.
The trick is to combine your inputs when fees are low, so that later no matter what the fees are, your transactions come from a single input.

Yes, someone has to know **one** of your addresses to send you money.  Your wallet can create infinite addresses that all belong to you. So you can give them an address that has never been used before, and thus it reveals no information to them.
The reason you would still spend money in a deflationary environment is that some spending is nondiscretionary or inelastic.  For example, if you are literally starving, you will buy that pizza no matter what you have to give in exchange.
However, in reality it is unlikely that bitcoin will ever be the *only* currency, in use.  I think it is called Gresham's Law that "bad money chases out good" or something like that.  Basically people will spend the inflationary money and save the deflationary money, as long as they have a choice.  But there is some spending that can only happen in dollars (like taxes) and there is some spending that can only happen in bitcoin (use your imagination) so spending will never drop to zero.
Besides, people can grow their money in the stock market by an average of 7%+ a year, but a lot of people don't do it, they spend everything they have every time they get more.  Why?  Because people aren't good at delayed gratification I guess.  Even some of the wise savers, though, eventually decide "I'm gonna die soon, might as well spend it all."

1. Fees are coming down.  This is a chart of the mempool for the last 4 days.     -- Transactions are now clearing with under 140 satoshis/byte.
2. Many wallets have bad algorithms for calculating dynamic fees.  Some of them are still recommending high fees when they are not necessary.  You can fix this by setting the fee manually, if you set it to 140 sat/byte right now the transaction should confirm within the next block or two.
3. You can also save yourself on fees by sweeping all your coins into a new address, this way it reduces the size of future transactions.  You can do this when fees are low, and then if fees get high again it still won't cost you much to spend btc because your transactions will all spend from a single address instead of multiple.
The only reason you are being asked to pay a 0.0005 fee to send 0.0002 btc right now, is because either the wallet you are using is recommending a higher fee than necessary, or because you have a dirty wallet with lots of micro-addresses that is causing your transaction to be large.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality ( is a fan-fiction alternate universe version of Harry Potter where he was raised by Muggle scientist parents instead of Muggle idiot parents.  So he is highly intelligent and rational, and sees all the obvious flaws that make intelligent people cringe about the normal HP story.  For example, the fact that the Snitch ruins the game of Quidditch, because it's worth 150 points, normal goals are only worth 10 points, and most games only have at most 10 goals or so.  So the most the rest of the team can accomplish is about 100 points, then the Seeker comes along and gets 150 points by catching the Snitch, ending the game and making everything the rest of the team does pointless.  That is a completely absurd, idiotic way to set up the game of Quidditch, and this is but one example of things that are obviously stupid about the original Harry Potter story.  In HP:MOR, Harry is smart and points all of these things out, and it's unbelievably awesome.
Also, in HP:MOR, Voldemort is just as hyper-intelligent as Harry.  He makes over 100 different horcruxes (any one of which protects his immortality), and scatters them in places even he can't reach, like dropping them into a volcano, dropping them into the Mariana Trench....   he evens makes a horcrux out of the golden plaque on the Pioneer 11 NASA probe that is currently departing the solar system.
So yeah, if you like HP but might prefer a more.... adult/intelligent/nerdy... version of it, check out HP:MOR, you won't regret it.

A few days ago, the 100-140 sat/byte bands were starting to clear, but now fees are climbing again.  The 140-200 satoshis/byte bracket is now growing again.

Thank god he put a space in there, because 900000!!!!! (5 factorials) would surely overflow the factorial bot.

What are you doing, trying to start a religion?
No.  No, he did not.  The timing was coincidental. He invented bitcoin because he could, not because of some grander purpose.

Why would you say paper wallets aren't a great idea?  For cold storage I'd say they're ideal.

Really?  Everyone knows how to keep important paper documents safe, like:  birth certificates, SSN cards, passports, tax documents, house deeds, car titles, etc.
I think newbs are much more likely to succumb to malware, or to forget to securely wipe their hard drive when disposing of it to get a new computer, or to lose their phone if using a mobile wallet, or to get their exchange hacked if leaving their coins on there, etc etc.
A paper wallet is not only secure if used properly, it's easy for everyone to understand how to use it properly.  "Put it in your fireproof safe and don't tell everyone you have a safe."

What you guys are missing is that if a person buys bitcoin on Coinbase, and leaves the bitcoins in their coinbase account, it would not necessarily show up on the blockchain.  It's just an entry in their internal database.

I tried to create an account at Gemini.  They made me give them scans of my driver license, etc.  Then they said "sorry, we decline to give you an account."  Then I asked them to delete my personal information from their databases, to which they responded, "sorry, KYC laws require that we keep information on customers for at least 5 years."
Fuck you, Gemini.
