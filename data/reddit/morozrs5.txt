if you live in China and I live in the US? Not really. Regardless of how money is sent the government and banks would control it on every step of the transaction. Its only possible if the exchange of cash is done physically, then yeah.

UK is still quite soft in Europe in terms of taxes, but the NHS is bankrupt and it pays much less welfare benefits than other countries. Try to run a business in France or Finland, you will pay 2 euros of taxes for every euro you will earn.

great stuff! All I see is people wanting the government to take care of them, provide them with everything, and still just EARN MONEY with BTC. Most people can't see that the point of crypto is getting rid of the government and not "earning money because I saw it on the news" and continuing to worship government services and taxes. Bitcoin allows me to buy your services and vice versa, without the government telling us how to do it, it is just wonderful. The fight will be tough though, governments and banks are already doing everything they can to stop it.

Yes, every Western European nation is having a record emigration year after year(especially Sweden and Germany)from locals who are the real work force and are tired to pay taxes to support the benefit earning community.

Europe is doing so well in tech that Linus Torvalds lives in Portland. Good luck for you if your best bet in life is relying on the government to survive.

I didn't say anything about manufacturing, I said innovation. China has a high number of patents though, so does the US. The US creates 4 times more patents per year and has half of the population of the EU.

Australia does not have Universal Healthcare and is not in Europe. Canada is embracing socialism with Mr. Trudeau and becoming a worse place to live by the minute. Finally, compare IT salaries (or in any innovative field) in Canada to those in the US - are they pretty much the same? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:36:13
Universal Health Care is making Europe over-taxed, unattractive for business ventures and stagnated. Just count how many big tech companies are from the US/Asia and how many are from Europe. NHS in the UK is bankrupt.

You should read about the economic history of Sweden. The country did not thrive with socialism, and its currently into a downward spiral because of socialism.

Malmo has a higher crime rate than Saint Petersburg (not the one in Florida). Perhaps if one considers living in a region where crime skyrocketed in 20 years as a sign of development, then Sweden is indeed not in a downward spiral.

I use both, the only difference is that I use chrome some for accounts that are always logged in and Opera for other accounts. Speed, UX, everything is the same or has a similar quality. Opera has the advantage of giving less of your data to the big G.

Another one for you: 
quoting: "he largest increase was seen in the Stockholm region, where the number of cases nearly doubled from 26 cases in 2016 to 50 cases in 2017. "
How about an almost 100% increase in Stockholm's murder rate in ONE YEAR.

I can entertain you with such data, absolutely! First of all, on the data you have provided, sexual offences are on the rise in Sweden (downward spiral). Secondly you should compare the current Swedish data with Swedish data from the times before Sweden started its leftist insanity, not with the USA.
Thirdly, civil servants in Sweden are pushed to provide fake data and to hide the actual reality of Sweden social collapse.
Finally, let's compare the Swedish reality with other not-so-leftist European countries. Here is the data:
Stockholm crime vs Prague crime: 
Stockholm crime vs Bucharest crime:
Stockholm loses on almost every aspect versus Bucharest in ROMANIA, a country that was living in complete totalitarianism and planned economy just a couple of decades ago. 
To leave you completely without any argument, let's check European cities crime index:
5 out of 20 are in the socialist Scandinavia. Considering that the population in the region is just a tiny fraction of the whole continent, using the data you have provided plus the links I have added, we can together conclude that Sweden is in a downward spiral. Thank you for the cooperation.

I do not want to compare USA to Sweden, you want to do it, so you will do it alone. The USA and Sweden have nothing in common: population, type of economy, trade partners, ethnic groups, nothing at all. Even the USA within itself has absurd contrasts, and yes, there are cities in the USA with lower murder rates than the Sweden: 
You have to understand what the concept of a downward spiral mean, it is comparing Sweden of the present day to what it was before adopting socialism. And yes, 100% in that case is a lot, and yes, it is because of socialism, the data shows that crime is on the rise in Sweden as much as leftist social policies are. If you want to continue in denial, do not count on me for more arguments.

I cannot give an opinion on that, I use them for different purposes with different accounts, but I often check the same sites using both so from that experience they (opera and chrome) perform equally good (and better than firefox).

where do I see the tx fees that are confirming and the ones that aren't?
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:41:07
they do pay fees on debit cards. the advantages of a debit card over a credit card for a merchant is that he usually doesn't have to wait 30-45 days to receive the money.
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:20:32
I think the fees are similar as the credit card, I've heard different stuff from 2 to 3,5%. But they are variable depending on somethings like the POS service provider or the type of arrangement you have with it. Some POS terminals also charge a monthly fee just for having it.

good that it is not only me to think that.

The article has some pretty inaccurate info. The volume is because of Venezuelan refugees in Colombia (first destination for them) and Peru (second). Peruvians and Colombians are not so worried about hyperinflation as their government is far less insane than those of Venezuela. Peru's economy is actually doing well and growing well above the world average. Of course BTC is better than their fiat, but they do not have any urgency unlike Venezuelans.

not sure about that "wishful thinking". More and more people are using facebook less and less. Those who did not delete their accounts share much less stuff like photos, vacations and other personal data. At the same time check how duckduckgo is growing on alexa rank. While their search is worse than Google (IMO) I prefer to use it as the default SE for privacy/data.

Rent in Prague is quite expensive, more expensive than many cities in Western Europe, even some in the UK like Belfast, or various mid-sized cities in Italy, Spain and even France. If you want to go cheap in Europe right now go to Skopje or Tbilisi. As an US citizen you can say 360 days per year in Tbilisi without any formalities whatsoever, taxi rides are often $1.5 and meals $3. The main advantage of Czechia over other countries in the region for US citizens is that you can get papers fairly easily using the živnostenský list option.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:41:52
Tbilisi (Georgia) you can stay 360 days without any formality whatsoever, and you can go in and out as much as you please. Skopje(North Macedonia) and CZ you can only stay 90 days as a tourist. If you become a freelancer you can get a residence permit to stay but it is a rather bureaucratic and lengthy and not necessarily very cheap process, but for a New Yorker, it is cheap.

As an affiliate, I've been also scammed by CEX.IO. When the commissions became frequent and high, they simply suspended me out of their referral program without any reason.

Danske Bank: the one always involved in scandals:
 [ 
The same bank that eats cards at ATMs in Baltics and asks for customers a 150 euro fee to see whether you are good enough to open an account with them. 
Now, also the one that blocks crypto.
