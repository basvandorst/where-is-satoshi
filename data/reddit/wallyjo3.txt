yes, brits also played big part.  adam back, referenced in satoshi white paper and CEO of Blockstream, also a Brit!
gives more support to bitcoin being created by an english man in any case.

satoshi wrote that when bitcoin was like a cent or a dollar.  he left before scaling became an issue and would realize that big blocks do not scale bitcoin solely.  
also, szabo, satoshi, finney, back (all guys who pretty much created bitcoin or led to the creation of it) said we would need 2nd layer solutions like Lightning to scale.

also, it's not "both sides".  the big blockers are either ignorant or paid govt actors looking to sabatoge bitcoin.  watch the video.  you cannot scale via big blocks solely without becoming another centralized cuck coin like PayPal/VISA/dollar/etc.  which is pointless.  and no one will use it.

until we hit the S-curve of adoption (which will happen this year/next year and continue for perhaps 5-10 years) into the 2020's.
then, you can still spend it because the value is just going to go up up and up and crashes will be less less and less (in quantity and in how long the price stays crashed).

it does.  the central bankers could not 2x fork bitcoin so they attack it by pumping centralized shit coins.
this in turn will only make normies rich, and the normies will realize eventually how pointless shitcoins are and use their profits (given to them by central bankers/govts/etc) to buy bitcoin.

just because jihad wu spams the network to get n00bz like you to lose your shit doesn't mean bitcoin is going to give two fucks.  we are not sacrificing decenralization beacuse some paid govt actor like jihad wants to destroy something that frees humanity.  sorrynotsorry.
and for fuck sake, stop transacting in bitcoin for daily shit.  it is a store of value only at this point.  your fiat shit is inflating more than these bitcoin fees and you're being ungrateful and whining?
go use a centralized coin like mETH.  by the way, their average tx fee is now around 3 bucks.  and they got worse scaling probz

do not idolize ANYBODY
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:01:02
um, SegWit is already a 2-4mb block increase... just so u know.
also, if you ACTUALLY want to know why it's not too smart to scale via block size increases (altho i'm not saying they can't be done in the future, but they are NOT the primary way, that's for sure), watch this video on what would happen if we used blocksize increases alone to scale to VISA levels(100k tps)
also, patience is a virtue.  decentralization and security comes first.  bitcoin is NOT the first.  there were things like the Liberty Dollar but the creator got shut down and went to court and penalized/etc.  full nodes must be able to be run by average folks.  yes we can run nodes on 2mb but the trade-off is not significant enough especially with jihad wu spamming the network.  watch the video if you really want to learn.

no, it's a conspiracy fact.  just like the govt funds terrorism, child trafficking pedophile rings, drug trade, etc.  the big corporations fund these horrible things, the goverments fund these horrible things.  and denying it is guilty of promoting/conspiring with these things.

the fact that dictator vitalik (russian/communist/dictator/etc) used the DAO as an excuse to Hard Fork, makes u wonder how many "false flags" he could use in the future to Hard Fork.  he could hack mEth himself and use it as an excuse to Hard Fork.  it's no different than the scammy dollar.  i'd rather use fiat than mEth.

yeah, you're one of those 2012 bitcoiners who had cheap fees because there was no adoption and thought that was what bitcoin was.
you weren't technically literate to see what would happen re: scaling.
satoshi, finney, szabo, back, have all said we would need 2nd layer scaling like Lightning.
i'm listening to them over you or any other big blocker paid govt actor.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:19:00
i edited the post to show that most of these bitcoin creators were american libertarians (aka true republicans).
anarchists are more republican than they are democrat because they believe in no govt.  left=big govt.  right=small govt.
bank the unbanked = smartphones are so cheap nowadays and getting cheaper, internet is getting cheaper/freer, that it will bank the unbanked in the next 10-15 years for sure.
Lightning Network which will come out this year and will slowly be mainstreamed for the next few years will bring bitcoin back to its currency attributes.  THUS, it will be a Store of Value AND a Transactional Currency, THUS potential to replace the dollar as world reserve currency.
Store of Value still applies over long term because store of value implies ppl hold it for more than a few years.  And with bitcoin, if you have held it for more than 2 years, your value has either been neutral or gained value, eradicating any concerns of dips/volatility.  and the gains far exceed concerns about stability because you're still up in value since the principal.
how can you trust banks/govt after 2008 great recession? banks got a bailout from govt with taxpayer money.  Fast and Furious scandal.  scandal after scandal.... freezing/closing accounts... imposing things on people.  sure, some of it is because a lot of stupid ppl can't take responsibility for themselves and do bad shit, and that means the responsible good ppl suffer because of those bad ppl and so the goal is to lift everyone out of poverty/bad situations/etc through govt, however, we are entering a time where govt/banking/fiat has become unstable, impractical and sovereignty and the free market must reign.  i.e. 20 trillion in debt that is impossible to pay off mathematically unless we switched to bitcoin or perhaps a gold-backed currency.

sigh, BCH is a centralized coin.  only the sheeple will be fooled by him.  he's NOT a coder.  he is just a guy with money just like jihad wu.  cypherpunks who CREATED bitcoin like hal finney, nick szabo, and adam back all said we would need 2nd layer payments systems like lightning.
why?  because if running a full node can only be done by a few corporations/govts, then they can CHANGE the rules of bitcoin and even INFLATE the supply to their liking since THEY control the nodes.  it's not about financial nodes, it's about VALIDATING the RULES.
bitcoin has been tried before in other forms and they failed because they were centralized like bcrash.  men with guns showed up to their door and shut them down and jailed them.
even if bcrash "succeeds" it will be because govt let them and because govt controls them under the guise of "it's decentralized!".

you're recommending watering down a financial system that will be used for centuries.  the foundation must be "dogmatic".  now, if you want your watered down stuff, that's what second/third/fourth layers and sidechains are for.
perhaps we will increase the block size, but only when bandwith technology increases for the average everyday user at an affordable price.

synergetic effects must be taken into account.  if you're only getting one bad frequency without any good to offset it, then now you see.

look at the Double Slit experiment.  youtube it.

bitcoin's growth has been a lot more organic than bcash.  i think bitcoin price has been manipulated to an extent but it takes real cash to do it.  jihan makes tens of millions a day from mining.  he has a lot of cash to manipulate.  also, the federal reserve/central banks who pay actors like jihan/roger can print trillions out of thin air.

it's not about More/quantity.  think in terms of quality.
some frequencies are good.  some are bad.  or rather, some are more in alignment with our own frequencies and some are more harmful.
also, you cannot rely just on "studies".  a lot of studies are funded by corporations who steer studies into biased funded bullshit things.  also, govt lies about a lot of shit.  
you also don't always need a study to prove something.  see how it affects you.  put a cell phone to your ear for an hour everyday and talk on it.  see how it affects you over time.  however, at that point, u may not notice until you get hurt.  and then you may not be able to reverse the damage.
for me, i know i get a headache if i'm on a cell phone call too long.  
i'm also NOT discounting placebo effects.  but this is multi-factored thing.  people like to put things in boxes and put them away instead of admitting that the truth is complex and has multiple factors.  it's easier/lazier to just be like, this is black this is white, peace.  rather than admit, wow that's a crap ton of colors/shades/hues/etc.  no one is expecting you to grasp it all.  the ego needs to stop trying to understand every single damn thing.  this is why emotional intelligence is far superior to mental intelligence sometimes if not most times.  altho it's not a competition, they both work together

yes, i have heard bigger blocks do centralize the mining aspect as well.  my concern was more with costs of running a full node since that seemed to be the major reason why Core was opposed to a block increase.  
mining i am not sure is as big a problem.  we may see more mining competitors in the next year or two.  hopefully that halong dragonmint thing is legit.

majority of ppl aren't the brightest.  going by majority isn't a feature, it's a bug
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:17:35
except they went out of their way to activate segwit before august 1st which was when UASF was set to occur.  i was there.  they scrambled once they heard that UASF would win.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:57:14
erik, we all know your history.  we've seen your tweets, your likes, your posts, your actions.
we know.  if you continue to lie, we will continue to expose.  do not lie.

crypto cannot be regulated.  the exchanges can be not the blockchain itself.  unless you shut down the internet.

erik dear, the more you lie, the more i will expose.  
also, it's bcash.  try not to promote people losing money.  karma is real.  and karma is a BCH
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:27:38
you know, the 2x that didn't activate because UASF and the bitcoin community showed they didn't want it.  that 2x.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:29:49
use Changelly
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:02:31
lol, believing the liar.  that's rich!
stick around a while.  then you can say some ish.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:42:37
Putting up with you, I agree.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:52:33
apparently you have cultivated a culture of mistakes at your company.  that's on you, bud.  there is no sympathy card here.  you are playing with people's money.  you do not pass go, you do not collect $200.  see yourself the F out
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:08:52
you're new.  this isn't his first "mistake".  
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:05:38
wow since july in the future it's been stuck?
we're in america bud.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:18:36
um, they were taking their time with activating segwit, they weren't even signalling.  so, UASF came.  and they decided ok we're gonna activate before UASF on august 1st.  they did it deliberately because of UASF.  dont get it twisted
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:59:30
aren't you supposed to be on r/btc with the rest of the sockpuppets?
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:23:24
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:28:55
they wouldn't have unless we called him out.  don't you get the point?
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:09:35
what's even sadder is that we have two scam artists, tai zen and tai lopez with stupid first names.

use Changelly instead of shapeshift

none of you watched the vid.  sad....
but unknowingly smart
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:44:56
this was redacted and corrected
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:36:20
no one calls it Bitcoin Core coins but roger/sockpuppets.  it wasn't a mistake.  someone at their company has a bad attitude.  and either the culture at shapeshift promotes such attitudes or erik didnt even discipline this employee
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:13:06
but what about bech32 addresses?
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:45:14
again, not the first mistake like this.  wasn't a mistake
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:32:43
You shouldn't if you have to ask that.

true story
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:12:04
lmao, wtf?  it isn't a drama in the community!  one of your stooges called it an antagonistic name only used by bcash shills.  the drama is at your company.  no one has to be up to speed to call bitcoin.. bitcoin.  this was an attack by someone at your company.  period.

when a "pattern" forms and it becomes "predictable".
that's when.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:08:29
did you apologize for 2x?  
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:42:56
yet you are charging 20x fees to everybody on shapeshift.  you can say it all you want, doesn't mean you're following through
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:56:23
THIS.  IS.  NOT.  THE.  FIRST.  MISTAKE.
GET THAT. THRU.  UR HEAD.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:06:45
it's bcash.  calling it bitcoin Anything is losing people valuable money they can never get back.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:26:12
ethereum is NOT decentralized.  research DAO hard fork, it is equivalent of a banker bailout a la 2008.  only bitcoin is truly decentralized.  look up UASF and how it activated SegWit and took out SegWit2x.  ethereum was also pre-mined 70% of its supply and 97% is already mined

considering you have nothing to back your words up, i'd say so, n00b
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:54:20
agreed.  thanks for all you do, greg.  hope you're enjoying life
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:47:05
so ur sayin ~2 million bucks per BTC in 2025?
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:58:56
yeah cuz ppl haven't lost their money and savings over mistaking bitcoin for bcash.  
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:41:59
it's a way to manipulate n00bz into thinking a certain way that superfically seems right but is not when you truly study decentralized blockchain.
goal of HF if really control, centralization, money.  roger/jihan are not scientists, they are all about $, marketing, dollars.  
they dont care about science, truth, freedom, decentralization, the everyday guy.

costs of running a node.
also, increasing blocksize is not best way to scale.  it's like a monkey way of doing it

vitalik said around 103 million before.  also, you're only helping my point
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:42:10
100 million?  how so?
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:10:09
this reflects upon management and the cultural views at the company.
anyone who posted that obviously felt very comfortable posting it.  
now, if you're saying that's not the culture there, then this individual would not have felt free to have posted such an antagonistic post.  so, which is it?  is this the culture of shapeshift or was there disciplinary action done with this "employee"?
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:46:05
could you show me how to do this on turbotax?  i used bitcoin.tax
