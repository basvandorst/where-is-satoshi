Dude.  What brought this on?
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:45:32
just like in every other aspect of your life nobody can predict the future.  unless you are a weatherman.

Meltem Dimirors at 5:03:47 made some major points on how Bitcoin is good for the U.S. economy, and compared Libra to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:45:50
No.  The bitcoin blockchain will not be forked and fixed to address that problem.  I am a newbie but I think I can speak for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:26:40
I would like to see CRYPTO widely adopted as a method of payment.  The more coins the merrier.  I am also OK with bitcoin as a store of value if that is what it has evolved into.

Where is your residence?  Unless people know that, their answers are worthless.

misleading graph comparison.  same size peaks yet one graph shows peak of 20K and the other 14K I assume USD.

So if my investments lose a dollar, some other man gets a dollar he didn't work for?

Dude. Chill. There are people from all over the world on reddit.  Not everyone speaks English as a first or even second language.  I would encourage people to continue to post even if their English is not always correct.  Usually we can understand what you are trying to say.

Nobody gets a 5% return.  That is why there is a bubble in real estate and stocks.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:36:45
That is a very large ball marker.  I don't think that would go over very well.
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:39:59
Our forefathers said that taxation without representation is tyranny.  What we have now is even worse.

I assume you are in the U.S.  If you start trading on Coinbase, they keep track of every trade you do and at the end of the year they will (or may)  send you a 1099 that totals up all the proceeds of your trades in dollars.  If you do a few hundred trades you may see some really big dollar numbers in proceeds.  Then you will have to do a cost basis calculation on every trade.  Major pain in the butt.  Only use Coinbase to get in and out.  Not to trade.  Use a DEX for that. 
On edit, your strategy is not very good as ETH is not a stable coin.  I don't know anything about trading strategy but selling BTC and buying ETH with the intent of buying back into BTC at some point is basically crazy.

APMEX seems to be a little more Bitcoin friendly judging by their website.  I would be interested to know how or if  they report  Bitcoin purchases of bullion to the IRS.
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:48:28
FIFO. Google it.  Why don't you want to disclose that it is BTC you are selling?
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:55:52
Apologies to Bitcoin.  I will choose my words more carefully next time. haha
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:46:27
Very few are spinoffs of bitcoin.  I think litecoin was the first, bitcoin cash was the second.  The others are not worth mentioning.
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:21:14
You should have defined "later".
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:58:46
Don't stop playing around with the tech.  If you drop out for a couple of years you will forget everything you knew.  That is how people lose BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:45:36
Try drawing some different lines until you get something you like.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:38:10
Go to [bitcoin.org](  All of those wallets are good for BTC.  Be very aware that there are some very good phishing attempts out there through email concerning wallets.  For ETH based tokens [myetherwallet.com]( is good.  It can be linked to IDEX easily for trading small cap tokens.  Have fun with the tech dude!  I am 58 and it keeps me young!
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:26:09
I prefer not to use the word retarded, but I find other things more annoying.  Like reddit people that start their posts off with acronyms such as WTIB, AIAT, AIAV, (just making these up) etc.  I do not have time to use google to figure out what you are trying to say.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:51:46
I don't buy anything with bitcoin.  But my favorite hooker takes Litecoin.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:52:15
I think it needs a few more days to recover from the whiplash of a few days ago.
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:17:47
They could.  It would be a shitcoin.  Why do you think it would replace bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:19:01
I don't know why you would deposit USD into coinbase, I would only deposit USD into coinbase pro if the limit on pro is higher.  There is a huge lag now on when you can use your money, a year ago it was instant, now is 3-7 ? days.  You may miss the dip or get lucky and get a bigger dip.
I had the same experience today with ETH.  I bought some on 6/24 and today an email stated that it was available to transfer but when i tried it said I had zero ETH.  Their business is computer based and they cannot even write programs correctly.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:53:24
It is a decentralized exchange that only trades ETH (ERC20) tokens.  Most new coins start out as ERC20 tokens and most promise to start their own blockchain some day.  Right now, VIDT is a hot coin and is on IDEX.  I am mainly a bitcoin guy but I do like to gamble on alt coins occasionally.

Somebody got nervous and covered their short.  That is not bad news to longs.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:19:59
for one minute
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:06:35
The correct answer is never.  I am pretty sure we will have some dips coming up.  With bitcoin there will always be dips.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:30:25
this is disturbing that people are so willing to pay taxes.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:16:35
OK we will all stop
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:10:15
If you bought BTC with coinbase it is already in a BTC wallet.  Do you mean you sent it to the BTC vault?  There are not any other coinbase wallets that I know of.
@_date: 2019-05-28 00:48:11
You should do it, but hold on to the wallet yourself until they are old enough to comprehend.  Kind of off topic but when my youngest daughter was about 5 or 6  I told her she could have a one ounce gold coin (krugerrand) when she could beat me in a 100 yard dash.  She tried for a few years and never beat me.  Now she is 22 and would easily beat me, but she must have forgotten about that offer.  Her loss!

In 2017 I did not like Bitcoin.  I held zero BTC.   I didn't want to just buy a currency.  Plus, the Bitcoin fork (BCH) was a cluster.   I bought into "blockchain projects".  Blockchain was the future, not Bitcoin.  I sold all my alt coins in early 2018 and took a break from crypto.
Came back in 2019 and Bitcoin is still chugging along.  All my old altcoins are in the gutter.  Started DCAing into BTC at about $6K.  No more altcoins for me at this point in time.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:58:05
At least you get to sleep in every day.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:22:15
I do not disagree, but calculate the premium before you buy.  It is generally around 20-30%.  ( One share of GBTC represents 1/1000 of a bitcoin)  I would only buy the dips and try to keep it close to 20%.  But if BTC moons, it really doesn't matter.  Owning your own private keys is better, however.
@_date: 2019-05-23 02:27:48
They must have used some kind of virtual currency on that show, because I never saw any coins pass hands.  Even with all the hookers.  Correct me if I am wrong.
