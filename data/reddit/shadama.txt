Im going to assume that i have to get a bitcoin wallet to send money to that wallet? But now i can send the $.10 to anyone via changetip?

So is antminer si/s2 a piece of hardware that you are using to mine bitcoin? I had seen the butterfly labs had equipment for this? and am assuming that the 1 bflabs little single is their smallest unit? 
Since this seems to be your earnings how much would you say you make off of bitcoin in a given week. If you mine religiously? Though I still wouldn't be able to afford a piece of hardware atm i would love to know the amount i could make a week adn possibly start saving up to mine later. 
Thanks for this.

Okay, honestly atm i wouldn't be able to afford spending the $70 even on equipment, however, that may change in the future. I wouldn't expect it to make me rich either, just to have a few more bucks to spend on the no so trivial stuff in life. Ill definitely have to look into it more to see if it would even be worth it. I dont happen to have to most top of the line computer anyways so i doubt i'd be able to make much of a dent. Thanks for the info though!

Calling me nice and then sending me money, man i feel like im living the dream right now! Thanks for the Tip!

I wouldnt mind mining with an Asic, especially if it could make me money in the long run, however, the upfront cost isnt really something i can afford atm. Now, what exactly is an asic? Is it just a piece of hardware optimized for mining?

See i also have this free utilities deal where i live everything from internet (which is a business connection i believe as i average 6 mbps downloads) to electricity is paid for. So i originally wanted to mine via my computer. It's decent, would be considered top of the line maybe 2-3 years ago but pales in comparison to today's machines. At the moment with school and work I manage to have about $20 left over at the end of the month. So I cannot necessarily but the things I want but I do have everything i believe that i need. During summers i can usually make a few thousand dollars if im not taking classes and that helps throughout the year. So if i do end up mining. Which I would love to do it would probably start mid-end of summer 2015. Though i would love to spend less than $200 or so to make an investment I wouldnt mind working a little extra to help me make money in the long run. Hell i usually end up keeping my computer on most the day anyways and feel that having a mining program running wouldnt do much. Ill probably end up making a thread about how best to spend my money for btc mining this sumemr but this whole process has me very intrigued. 
Thanks for the input.

No lies guys, Thanks, only really started looking at this with some enthusiasm because of the microsoft announcement. All of yall pplz have been extremely helpful so far in making me understand.

Thanks for the tip! it feels like Christmas came early this year :p

I guess that im just a little butt hurt that i could have been mining in high school, when i had 2 relatively high power PC's available and probably saved up a bit of money. Ill definitely attempt to assimilate myself with bitcoin mining as much as possible withing the next few months. Though if i could even make 5 bucks a week/month on my current pc it would be awesome. 
Since you seem to be a miner i have added you to my friends list on reddit ( oh lord how did i not know that existed) and will probably hit you up when/if i have the capability to mine. Hope you wouldnt mind helping a brother out.

Interesting, does this mean i have $.10 floating around somewhere now? 
And thanks for the tip. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:13:55
Thanks for the tip chief. Y'all seem very generous with your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:56:09
now i feel like my head is exploding. So, offline wallets are more secure? and online ones more privy to getting hacked or such? 
&lt;.&lt; &gt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt; i should probably be studying for finals right now. But this, this is interesting. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:38:05
what would returns be? 
Being a relatively broke college student with free electricity and internet i wouldnt mind earning even $5 a week or a little less.

 Why yes you caught me, im stoned outta my mind... but many currencies are actually tied to different currencies, depending on the strength of their (sister?) currency to know their value. Most middle eastern currencies are like this including the qatri riyal and UAE's dirham. But i really think has hit it for me. As he said with gold it seems that just the fact of it being deplete-able gives it value. If more people will want bitcoin each btc will end up increasing in value. has also stated something similar. In the end it is esentially a good that has been given value and it finiteness gives it more value based on demand. Since supply is (or i guess will eventually be) finite the value will always increase unless something major happens to change this. 
The point of confusion for me started when i looked at the value of bitcoin in the past, it had jumped to &lt;$1000 in the past and quickly shot back down. I would love to know what event caused this to happen. And how we can learn from it to maybe implement positive growth in the future.

correct me if im wrong, but i thought fiat was just a type of currency, which technically is every currency that exists. My question is more so along the lines of this: Most currencies (USD, PKR, QR, Euro, AUD) are calculated to be of a certain value depending on the economy of the nation/their gold reserves etc. How does the value of change/what influences the value of bitcoin? I've spent quite a bit of my day today learning about bitcoin however this is something that i cannot seem to come across. I would wager that there is some formula or system that influences its value and would love to wrap my head around it. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:38:46
Damn, was really hoping i could mine for a while and maybe get a game or two a year with the earnings.

what do you mean by breakeven? are there hidden costs to mining? 
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:19:31
How exactly would one go about increasing the purchasing power of Bitcoin? I know that it is a ever changing currency and is finite in the amount that will eventually be available. However, how does the value change with respect to ownership? What is there to compare to the value of bitcoin/who sets this value? 
Really liked this response though. It just left me with a few more questions. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:47:19
Aww. Now i wish i had jumped on the bitcoin mining business earlier, maybe could have stocked up for the future. Also any wallets that people reccomend? I say wallets as changetip says there are a list of online wallets.
