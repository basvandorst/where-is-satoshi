Technically you owe capital gains on the change in value from when you bought the coin to when you used it to purchase goods/services

I had originally read that comment after reading similar comments above, rereading it in the context of the OP I see he may have been being sarcastic. However, there are definitely people who do seem to think this way on here. All I'm saying is we shouldn't look down upon and threaten to boycott a company that is just attempting to comply with the law.

Coinbase. If you go to account settings and then Bitcoin addresses there's an option to print paper wallets at the bottom

Doesn't Coinbase alone claim to have 1million+ users? 
Edit: I checked, they claim 1.3 million consumer wallets. Since they require some amount of identify verification I'd think that should be close to accurate for number of users
@_date: 2014-04-30 14:46:51
This is true. We should probably reach out to some local Bitcoin clubs and see if there's any way we can help them out in this area

I'm planning to let it sit and (hopefully) appreciate, that's just a reminder to myself not to give up/get greedy before then

I think that I saw somewhere that they claim they don't. But yeah, point taken. This was more of just a first time trial run for me(hence only .01)

But a smaller reward would accomplish what OP wants as well as maybe allowing mining to start being more evenly distributed (there'd be less incentive to buy specialized hardware). Getting the current miners to accept this though would never happen

If everyone on this subreddit signed we'd be done(granted, we're very likely not all U.S. citizens but still, y'all get my point). And even though the answer will be no it'll still drive conversation on the topic which is a good thing.

I mean if you're offering..

Exactly. Shady exchanges typically don't comply with regulations which is what Bitstamp is trying to do here

Thanks for the advice. Is there anyway to edit the link in my post? (There's usually an edit button below posts..I'm not seeing it now though)
EDIT: Just realised I forgot to copy down the imgur deletion link anyway. Guess I'll just write myself a note on the wallet to create a new one for any future deposits

Do y'all have a way to place an order on Android? I tried looking on your website but I only got to the point where I had an account created, where do I go from here?
EDIT: Disregard, I got it to work.

Feel free to come help out :)

Finally decided to take the plunge and create a paper wallet today. Mostly out of desire to put off studying physics, but I mean whatever it takes, right? Anyway, I know it's not much but it's a start. I'm in for the long haul now. 
EDIT: I just reread that, one of the most poorly worded things I've ever written. Too much caffeine, too little sleep.

I've thought about this problem some more. One way to try to mitigate this would be to make them sit through a Bitcoin presentation before receiving the coins. In the presentation it could be made clear all of the cool things you can do with them, how there is a good chance they could be worth more in the future, etc. This wouldn't entirely solve the problem, I'm sure there would still be those that immediately sold them, but it's a start
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:18:28
Great job! 
Small correction though, about half way down on the right:
"Because [it's] transparent"

They also have some of the political science majors that may have policy influence in the future. Introducing them to Bitcoin and showing them its usefulness while they're still in school might not be the worst thing ever..

A good place for us to start would be contacting a Bitcoin club at another university and seeing if they are interested in setting something like this up at their school. A quick search shows that Berkeley also has a club (Bitcoin.berkeley.edu). Anyone interested in coming up with a message we could email them?

You can use a wallet that doesn't need the whole chain downloaded (ie won't take up hundreds of gigs) such as Electrum.
Also adding funds means you'll need to first trade USD for Bitcoin on an exchange and then send it to the address for your wallet (there should be an option that says receive or get address or something)
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:55:50
What was wrong with Circle?
They decided they wanted to move in a different direction and dropped Bitcoin buying and selling support but still let users send and receive the Bitcoin in their accounts. I wasn't happy that they dropped support but once they decided to I think they handled the aftermath perfectly. No one lost any coins.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:40:46
If you encrypted it properly (say Veracrypt or something) it would be extremely safe. Sure, there are risks to everything but they'd be much less than loosing your paper backup to a fire. For extra security only opening the Veracrypt vault offline would probably be a good idea
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:21:36
That's not true. If you buy coins and leave them in Coinbase then when(if) a hardfork occurs there is the possibility that they only give you coins on one side of the fork. If you buy with Coinbase (and let's be real, it's one of the easiest way for new people to get into cryptos) and move the bitcoin to a wallet you control then you will get coins on both sides of the fork. To say otherwise is to mislead new investors.

It's from a long time ago (late 2013). Let me see if I can find a link to the original.
