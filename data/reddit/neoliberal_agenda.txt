Seems arrogant, I'm not impressed. Either have the address, or leave it out. 
Let the market decide what the best cryptocurrency is.

If Bitcoin developers had increased the block size, as CPU, hard disks and memory capacity increased, none of this would have happened.
Imagine if Google would set a limit of 300 000 searches per day. People are bound to go to other search engines, regardless of how talented the developers at Google are.

As I understand it, the cap of 1 MB has been in place since 2010.
During that time network bandwidth, RAM, CPU and hard drive capacity have increased by a factor of 10. It seems reasonable to me that the block size should keep up with Moore's law. So if Bitcoin Core would increase it by a factor of 8, it would still be easier to run a node now than it was seven years ago. 
Is that correct? 
The sizing could even be built into the algorithm, so it would adjust to some aspect of Moore's law. This would guarantee decentralisation. Even if Bitcoin Core developers don't want to do that, the block size could be raised temporarily, i.e for 2 years, and the algorithm could switch back automatically after that time, when we have better tech in place.

I agree, it was a reasonable compromise.
If it would have been put in place a year ago, BCH would probably not exist, and BTC would be worth at least 15% more today.

I don't know about BCH, but I do think the block size needs to increase.
Average transaction fees should never be allowed to go beyond $1. If it can be fixed by the Lightning Network, or some other technology in the future, that's fine, but a solution is needed now. Even with LN in place, the block size can't be stuck at 1 MB forever.
Network, CPU and hard disk capacity are growing exponentially. The cost of a hard drive is a tenth of what it was in 2010 and the network capacity is also a magnitude faster. I used to have 8 Mbps in 2010, now I have over 100 Mbps and thinking of upgrading to 1000 Mbps.

I understand the argument about decentralization and that an off-chain solution is the only way in the long run. but If people can't use Bitcoin before those solutions arrive, they could go somewhere else, perhaps to a currency that is more centralized.
Once Segwit + multi-layer are ready, the centralized currency could just copy that solution and perhaps even decrease the block size. We could get the same technical solution in the end, but now in the wrong hands. That's my worry.
How do we combat that?

Good questions. 
I also like to know details, now it feels like vapourware.

Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.

The argument for increasing the block size is not that it should be THE way to handle more transactions for the next fifty years. 
The argument is that it can be increased a bit, until technology for side chains are in place.

There are soon 8 billion people on the planet. 
Mustn't everybody have one on-chain transaction at least? 
If that is the case, it will take years before that has happened with the current transaction rate.
