Also, solving launch costs is the wrong problem to solve. Launch costs are high, but that's not the reason we don't explore space. We don't explore space because there's nowhere to go. And, there's nowhere to go because we don't advance our energy research like we should so that we can easily support colonies anywhere.

No, it's simply a public aggregate of whether or not people want to read what someone has to say. It is no different than a large crowd of people engaging in discussion. What some people say is appreciated, and sub-crowds form around said people. What other people say is ignored or even shouted-down. Both sets of feedback are valuable. I may want to come to a thread merely to find the people who are being voted down, if only to find valuable but perhaps unpopular opinions.
The trouble with people in the developed world, is they think a downvote is a vote against their intellect, and thus a personal offense. This is juvenile and stupid.

Really? You think all those pensioners in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France, and Germany want to and were already prepared to see their fixed incomes drop because Greek debt purchased by other European banks is now worthless?
Loss of liquidity is never expected by the system that we've been living with for decades. The whole purpose of QE is to create liquidty from nothing so banks don't fold. The loss of Greece from the Euro is a small-GDP hit, but a potentially domino-starting liquidity problem.
If the ECB takes a Greek default and goes nearly full Weimar creating new bond liquidity to make up for the defaults, then the Euro may be saved. But in the process Europe will suffer the same wealth-transfer that the U.S. just went through with it's QE programs, which means political disaster, if not more financial disaster.
There is no good side to this, don't be fooled into thinking Greece is a non-issue.

In the short term, it does make the Euro stronger if Greece leaves. However, Greece is only one indebted nation among many in the EU. If Greece gets to say "F-it" and avoid debt by leaving the Euro and redenominating (as horrible as that is for the layperson), then Spain, France and Italy could easily follow suit, especially if their debt becomes more expensive to pay back with the strengthening of the Euro on Greece's departure. If all that happens, bye bye Euro. The Euro can't survive the loss of those three.

The biggest risk to centralization, imo, is the Bitcoin foundation losing autonomy with updating the software that runs BTC.

It's true that fiat currency is not a requirement for war. The U.S. could actually have a balanced budget and still have exactly the same defense budget as it does now, as it spends significantly less than it's full tax income on defense alone.
However, war isn't really waged on yearly budgets, war preparation is. Unless it's a very low-level war. Just a quick reading of Sun Tsu and you'll see that preparation is by-and-large the biggest determiner of victory in war. The only way to make up for a lack of preparation is with enormous initial expenditures, and that means debt and fiat currency.
Yes, you can still have war without fiat. However the war you will have is much more likely to involve actual substantive grievances between nations, instead of simply letting the debt-financed war-machine stretch for a while.

I would not yet bet my future that Wall Street is going to be replaced by forms of blockchains. I also agree with you that decrease in volume is the exact opposite of encouraging.
However, you can't say this is a myth, mostly because that's the wrong word. A myth is something that is rumored *to have* happened already, and this is something that if it does occur, has not occurred yet. This is more of a future prediction, and as such, it's either soothsaying or it's an accurate prediction.
Now, I also agree with you that the financial power that exists in Wall Street means they could entirely buy and hence destroy the BTC market if they wanted to, or even replace it. They do hire top mathematicians and PhDs and programmers to do their bidding. However, if those people are truly working to their top capabilities, why didn't they come up with the blockchain concept? Think about it, Chase or Citi could have invented the blockchain 15 years ago, the software technology easily existed before that. With a blockchain running their financials, they could have literally replaced 80% of their operating overhead, consisting of people, office buildings, and support staff to keep all their transaction auditing and authorization working. All payment processors and credit card companies could literally move to a blockchain and turn it into an automated system requiring almost no human oversight. The only support that would remain would be their customer service department to handle charge and order disputes.
So, big money, with lots of truly bright people working for them, failed to solve the Byzantine General's problem like BTC did, even though there were tremendous financial incentives to do so. What does this tell us? I want to give the nerds working in the finance industry the benefit of the doubt and believe that they did in fact think this stuff up, but corporate culture or management direction did not allow it to come to pass. That might be premature, but I believe it to be the case. The marriage of encryption and p2p fileshare is almost too obvious. So, I have to believe it was either corporate culture or management directives. If it was corporate culture, then it seems more likely that some smart people after the 20007/08 crash would have said, "hey, here's something new," and gone off to create their own new ecosystem for finance. Or even without a crash, I have to believe that one of those nerds would have done this.
They didn't. Only some open-source programming nerds and an academic solved this problem. 
So, I'm left to conclude that the higher-ups do not want a decentralized barter system like BTC provides. BTC represents disruption from below for big money. It does this by potentially removing the middleman in all transactions. Those guys' (financial services/banks/etc) only source of regular income are interest payments and fees on transactions. Without those two staples, the financial industry is no different than a bunch of people speculating on BTC, meaning they only make money when they guess correctly. Now, fortunately for big-money, this situation can only occur if people start getting paid in BTC, and for 99.9999999999% of earth, that just aint true. 
An open BTC removes all of their ability to charge interest on credit card payments, fees on overdraft, credit card balanced, late payments, talking to a teller, breathing the air inside the bank branch, etc... All those fees and interest vanish under a system populated entirely by cryptocurrency. They still have time to buy out this new system and install themselves as the masters of BTC blockchain, but the technology is already out there, all it takes is more consumers *choosing* to exchange some new cryptocurrency instead of fiat and they can cut out the middlemen.
The rest of your post I happily and sadly agree with.

Everything you're describing is simply an ethical exception based on presumed value for what is taken. All of those things were provided by the mafia at some point.

It often never occurs to the sole shop owner who pays for protection that their competitors 5 blocks over, who don't pay for protection, make a lot more money than they do.

@_date: 2014-07-07 14:19:49
Actually, Bitcoin has all the properties of money, and improves on most of them...
Bitcoin is currently a medium of exchange. This function is expanding in use day by day.
Bitcoin can be a unit of account (in the economy) just as any other money but currently it's not serving that function since everyone is valuing it according to FIAT. When bitcoin begins getting valued in gold or silver primarily, then it effectively becomes a unit of account (because it will start accounting for fiat confidence changes). That will change when the dollar gets corrected-out of the world monetary system.
Bitcoin is more more portable than any other form of money.
Bitcoin is not quite as durable as gold, but as long as people take care of their private keys, it can be almost as durable.
Bitcoin could stand to be more divisible in the near future. However this is not a stumbling block as its divisiblity is limited only by computer software. Even gold is not so divisible as it eventually becomes dust and that's just not storable.
Bitcoin needs more fungibility, but every new business that decides to accept it increases its fungibility w.r.t. fiat every day.
Bitcoin is currently volatile, so it's ability to store value in the short term is questionable at best.. but long-term the prospects are good based on what the current software allows.
There's something else that most standard definition's don't use when defining money, the network effect.
You see, Gold coins have no value to me. I can't eat them, I'm no jeweler so I can't make myself a gold watch or jewelry. I don't even like jewelry. And while I do have electronics expertise, I have no need for raw gold in my hobbies. In short, gold coins have no intrinsic value to me *at all*. They can't feed me, shelter me, or keep me warm at night, and they make up no raw materials that I need to produce goods and services.
So why then would I easily take a gold coin instead of a paper dollar if given the choice? Because of **NETWORK EFFECT**. Gold was established, worldwide, as a widely-accepted medium of exchange long long before any of us were born. The network effect of gold as a currency/money is unchallengable because everyone on the planet is taught from an early age what it is and how valuable it is. 99% of the humans on this planet have absolutely no use for gold in their daily lives, but the strong and now permanent network effect has communicated it's value as money, this means that anyone will accept it.
Examples of this ancient process of establishing gold's network effect still exist. For instance, there are still native tribes in the world who shun contact with the developed world who barter with goods. If you brought them gold, they might actually reject it as being worth exchanging for their goods.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value because intrinsic value only exists for things you need to survive. From this perspective, even gold has no intrinsic value to most of us. Gold get's its value from the fact that everyone in the world is taught that gold coins have value. And that value is itself derived from confidence that it cannot be debased. That's network effect at work. The rest of the value placed on non-survival commodities, goods and services all derives from the network effect. Amazon knows this well, as their product reviews dictate what products get sold on their website. Amazon reviews are the network effect at work, people telling people how good a service/commodity is. This means, that as long as the BTC "network" is growing, the future of it's value looks bright. It may someday sit right alongside gold as a store of value.

It's overall a fair article, but I took issue with these sections...


There's truth there, but there are far more volatile currencies that still get used as currency. I think the fears of volatility are overblown when you consider how easily BTC can be transacted as compared to fiat.


Actually, no, not really. Best practices involve pulling out an old pentium, slapping a usable modern Linux on it from a CD, generating some key-pairs and printing them out via a serial port or usb, then storing the private keys in any manner you wish. Inside the leg of a couch, tucked into an appliance vent, etc.. the keys can be hidden anywhere, any way the user likes or finds secure, no need to use a bank vault. For added security, you can pull out some dice for randomness, and/or encrypt the keys further. But that's for a store of value. Best practices on active wallets involve encryption stacked on the keys, and/or encrypted volumes. These are hardly the same as described.

1) m-pesa transactions are conducted in fiat. This means that m-pesa is not competition for bitcoin, rather another currency in which m-pesa could start dealing. Realistically, m-pesa should simply start offering transactions in bitcoin, particularly in countries with high fiat inflation.
2) Most of those countries have large populations that are extremely rural, people who have never even seen a bank much less had the proper documentation to use one. As such, the statistics championed are highly suspect because it is easy to replace a mostly non-existent or unused banking system.

This is like saying, "It doesn't matter that the magna carta came from England, the only thing that matters is that it is a successful state." It's a ridiculous thing to try to claim, because it denies the value of history and generational momentum. The moderately-wealthy citizens of Britain decided they no longer wanted to be oppressed by a dictator who could change the laws at whim, rather they wanted agreed-upon laws to dictate what happened to citizens. As a result, the west has passed down this idea through it's generations, and it benefits from the respect of law rather than single-man-authority in it's perspective on life.
Now compare that to your average post-communist/failed-state, where you have generations who were taught to regard their leaders as their food suppliers, moral authorities, and agents of protection, and you can see why it's ridiculous to say, "it doesn't matter what the previous incarnation of xxx country was..."

"Lawful money of the United States..."... so technically, exchanging foreign currency for U.S. dollars at L.A.X. is a transaction, and technically one of the currencies in the transaction *is not* the "lawful money of the United States."
It could also technically be used to bar any kind of barter transaction, since no lawful money was used.

So this graph is bullshit?


Price and value are not as functionally connected as you would have me believe. Price follows human instinct which is often wrong. The prices themselves are not "wrong", but the human behavior driving them often is because humans can be deceived.  Value is best measured by dividing price with other valued commodities, as that gold chart demonstrates. This eliminates human herd behavior by comparing an asset with another asset.
When I see an 80% decline in home prices relative to an asset class that cannot be printed into oblivion (and thus does not rely on calculated numbers to correct for things), I tend to believe that inflation has always been higher than advertised.

Because they do not understand the limits of their own understanding. In many ways, humans understand less about human economics than we do about the weather. We can predict the weather 3-5 days out. When has anyone ever made solid stock market predictions even 2 days out? Yes, lots and lots of very very smart math people work in the finance industry. It doesn't matter, the full compounded complexity of human nature is on display in the marketplace, it is literally the most complicated math problem known.
Consider weather reporting, which allows us to warn people of hurricanes and tornadoes far enough in advance now to get to shelter. Now consider financial reporting, did anyone receive any warning about any of the various market sell offs? Did you receive any alerts from the brokers you pay of the housing markets collapse? Sure, there are usually leading indicators that we know precede these events, but they're still like earthquakes.

Don't dismiss this guy right off the bat. There's nothing wrong with credit except for the whole double-charging or charge-backs and bailout nonsense. Stores used to offer credit to their employees all the time, and it worked fine on a local-level where people knew each other, and credit cards used to have security requirements (i.e., you had to demonstrate sufficient assets), which is why only the wealthy used to have them. It seems reasonable that credit does have a place in a currency ecosystem where people can't simply run the printing presses to make up for their lack of ability to pay back. 
Credit does not have to look like it does today, where any fool can get a 35% APR piece of shit plastic, and spend spend spend, then declare bankruptcy.

It actually is more basic than that. It's a question of free will vs slavery.
In a deflationary currency regime, all spending and investing is of your own free will. You have absolutely no pressure to spend what you own save maintaining your life and the lives of your family members. This situation actually already exists in some industries. For instance, if you own a home in a good neighborhood. Families who do this have no incentive to sell and move, and would rather sit tight and only move when they absolutely have to. This is fantastic for families and communities, as it provides some stability for kids to grow into adults. People still buy and sell property, for a variety of reasons. Mostly because they know that they can make money on the increase in value of the asset over time, so they pick an asset that meets their needs, and they stick with it, but they do eventually sell. Now, homes are extremely non-liquid assets, as there's tons of regulation and bank regulation that is added onto the transaction cost. But even if moving your family was painless, people would still follow their own self interest and either buy-improve-sell/rent, or buy and hold. They'll still do this because there's still money to be made doing so.
Now, suppose that every so often, someone deliberately dumped sand salt-water and acid rain from planes all over your neighborhood, say once a week. This means you have to work on your home in order to prevent it from falling apart. This means you must continue to spend your own hard work to keep an asset from becoming less valuable. Worse, because it's being dropped all over the neighborhood, if all your neighbors do not maintain their assets, you still lose value despite all your hard work. This is akin to slavery since you are now forced to work extra hard, and surround yourself with similarly hard-working people purely to protect what you've already done. 
Now imagine it was the real estate agents, the gatekeepers of the asset, who were dumping all that crap all over the neighborhood. You would rightfully call them frauds, liars, cheats, scoundrels, and they would be.
This is how a central-bank, with a currency controlled by elites to be inflationary actually affects people. It is a deliberate heel on the throat of the poor and middle-class, forcing them to work harder just to keep from falling behind because they *do not* have the resources to join asset classes that actually increase in value. It is effectively slavery if not kept at obscenely low levels all the time. Keep in mind that in 1945-1965 America, families were buying homes just fine, because of population increases. Increase in population will drive the economy forward regardless of existing deflation. It doesn't matter how deflationary a currency gets, **people still gotta eat, sleep, etc**. And people are always giving birth to more people. Deflation is only risky in a shrinking population, it's perfectly rational in an expanding population.
What bitcoin can possibly do, is bring deflationary (increasing value with time) assets to the poor and middle class. Your average upper class elite probably doesn't give two spits about how poor or rich anyone besides themselves are. However, if everyone has access to deflationary asset classes, then the rich don't have the masses of nearly-starving people to slave away for them in jobs that suck. The poor and middle class would have more options to grow wealth, and that means that the employment that does exist, must actually remain attractive to the people willing to work those jobs.
I know this sounds terribly marxist, and I did not intend that. However, inflation does truly screw the poor and middle class out of what they worked for. It's part of the reason retirement schemes were created, to give these classes of people "hope" that they can have a few years of not working at the end of a 50-60 year career by beating inflation. Remove inflation, and those who would employ large masses in corporations have to provide a reason for coming in to work each day, besides inflationary stores of value.

* Equities are in central-bank-created bubbles, and ready to pop.
* Bonds have negative yield in most of the developed world. CB's say they'll raise rates, but they've said that for several years now and it hasn't happened. It's *possible* that Bond price will skyrocket if equities tank, but their yield will probably suck hard for as long as the central banks are stuck in their current mindset.
* Retirement accounts are based on lots of equities/bonds and thanks to G20 are now considered bank-stabilizing assets instead of your money (Cyprus solution).

You can make arbitrarily complicated algorithms that make it very very very difficult, if not impossible for ASIC designers to design something. But that isn't satisfying because it means that *only* big money can afford mining, so it doesn't help decentralization.

What bitcoin needs, is financial instruments attached to it. This is how all currencies work. The more desirable financial investment instruments that are attached to a currency, the more money/value gets thrown into that denomination, and the stronger the currency gets. Right now, the biggest upward pressure on BTC/USD price are speculation (which is highly volatile), and essentially U.S. preppers and unbanked, which don't have big money. Interestingly enough, the USD has been strengthening lately, which makes speculators and survival-minded people less likely to buy BTC. This easily explains why merchants and miners could win out for a long while to come.
With this in mind, the real stability in price and attractiveness of bitcoin won't emerge until ventures like Ethereum start becoming reality. Until then, this is just an experiment.

The reason is, corrected-for-inflation stock market prices are basically zero for the last ~80 years. So why would I give up a deflationary asset to invest in inherently inflationary investment products that are currently waaay over-inflated and likely to see a significant drop in the near term.

A ponzi scheme is where an item that may have investment value is sold an alternate or packaged form rather than it's original form. It is a form of fraud in which belief in profit from a vacuous proposal is created by quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors. Ultimately such a scheme does not deliver on any of it's investment promises, save for the original investor(s).
A currency is an item that has all the proper values of currency, namely..(1) Divisibility, (2) Fungibility, (3) Portability, (4) Exchangeability, (5) Accountability, (6) Durability, and finally (7) Store of Value.
Bitcoin may be in a bubble, or it may not, but it's definitely not a ponzi scheme. It has never been sold as an investment mechanism. Gold is likewise not sold as an investment medium, but rather for it's store of value. Both are viable forms of money, but you would never call Gold a ponzi scheme.

Murder happens anyway, even when it is illegal. Do we now measure the effectiveness of laws by degree of crime deterred or by number of crimes brought to justice? If we are going to measure the effectiveness of laws by the degrees of crime that are deterred, then we might as well outlaw free speech so that people are deterred from speaking lies and committing fraud. Your method of applying law leaves a lot to be desired because you frame the world as if laws are necessary as deterrants to crime, but there is no end to this argument and it begets a world where damn-near everything is illegal because all possible illegal behavior must be deterred.
If instead you want to embrace a world of the empirical, then you must acknowledge that laws are *only* designed to punish those who actually commit crimes, not those who might *consider* committing crimes. When you can acknowledge that, you might have a worldview that is humane.

That's a fair point, but it also ignores one other point. The only way to get deflation that severe is through the expansion of credit. In a sound-money economy, where it takes actual effort to create all new value, you cannot have that kind of runaway deflation because there are expansion and innovation forces at work that motivate new business.
In point of fact, all severe inflation and deflation episodes can *only* happen through central manipulation of the monetary supply.

This is a banker's solution to a banker-created problem, don't go for it. They're inviting you to peg your BTC holdings in the currency that they control. This makes their currency more valuable, inherently. Don't buy it, it's snake oil meant to keep crypto down.
I agree that bitcoin's main problem as a currency is it's volatility. The volatility is actually a function of market cap. This small market cap on BTC means that large banks still have (essentially) full control over the BTC price since very few (if any) commodities are priced in BTC. The big banks do this with every small commodity market, there's lots of price manipulation that can go on when the players in the market have capital exceeding hundreds of billions, and the market moves by a few million or less a day. Losses incurred by unsuccessful manipulation are easily absorbed, and depending on the commidity the gains can be large on the geopolitical front (which is where big banks operate, don't fool yourself otherwise).
What BTC needs, as a currency, is to start having necessary commodities priced in bitcoin. As long as all transactions using BTC are priced in fiat, BTC is still just a proof of concept. In order to get commodities priced in crypto, you first have to have a significant confidence loss in fiat somewhere in the globe such that a majority of consumers/merchants begin pricing things in BTC. 
Ironically, this makes the ISIS announcement of their own new currency experiments actually good news for bitcoin. 
Banks aren't scared of crypto yet. They know they could crash all crypto markets any time they want. It's the confidence in fiat that scares them, not potential replacements. Fiat has actually always had a valid replacement that banks have successfully destroyed, that replacement is gold. Nobody uses gold as currency now, banks did that. Banks will be scared shitless when people can survive their entire lives without ever touching fiat. It is when you can earn in crypto, buy food with and/or eat out with crypto, put a roof over your family's head with crypto, and invest long-term in crypto when banks will know their doom is at hand.

When you add back all the saving that should have occurred to pay for all the social programs that will come due in the next 5-15 years, we were always running a budget deficit.

The value of anything used as money depends on how well it is satisfying the basic properties of money, and how well it is expected to satisfy those properties in the future. Those properties are:
* Portability. This hasn't been a problem since paper currency became standard. Bitcoin excels at this, better than any other form of currency.
* Divisibility. Currently bitcoin is probably the second most divisible currency form in existence. Dividing paper currency beyond pennies is a PITA. But this property is less important when it reaches greater-than 4-5 decimal places of divisibility
* Durability. Gold is the standard for durability as the only way to destroy it is to throw it into a supernova or black hole. Bitcoin is not as durable as gold, however, with care it can be durable enough to use.
* Unit of Account. Almost all real currencies are this, Bitcoin is no different.
* Fungibility. This goes nearly hand-in-hand with it being a medium of exchange. Bitcoin's fungibility increases with each new product/service that you can buy with it.
* Medium of Exchange. Bitcoin is currently growing in acceptance. Every week, major companies are offering to accept bitcoin transactions. It is not at the level of most Fiat in this department yet. However, Precious metals haven't been used much for regular day-to-day currency in a while either. People still buy PM's for their store of value, and for SHTF emergencies.
* **Store of Value**. This is the tough one for Bitcoin. Currently it can easily claim to be a currency. But to be Money, it needs to be a good long-term store of value. It's only existed for 5 years, I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt considering how well it satisfies all the other properties of money, AND the fact that the software that runs it is open-source, peer-2-peer, decentralized, and software-limited in number (21 million).

Governments in the developed world are very very used to being able to track and control money. It is a primary method by which the elite remain elite, and the bigger elite punish the smaller elite they feel are criminals. Economic sanctions are exactly what modern governments use to discourage behavior, they freeze you out of your accumulated assets that are valued in their fiat currency, and suddenly you're very very willing to do what they say. This is no different than mob rule, really, when gangsters would steal shipments of your goods before they arrived at your store, then extort money or services, or concessions out of you in order to get your goods back.
Those governments do not want to lose that power, so their only method of combating cryptocurrencies at this point is to try to throw tons of CYA requirements onto those people who change their fiat into crypto.

From your link:


No, Ivan, that's not the question. Any fool knows that cryptocurrencies have zilch for market penetration. Demonstrating the possible penetration says nothing about what actual future penetration will be. Worse, you answer this question by creating an equivalent of the Drake equation to back up your answer, which is about as non-scientific and as close to soothsayer as you could get.
Thumbs down on this "prediction" method. Hopefully he's right in his conclusions tho.
edit: I'll will say, however, that comparing daily-used wallets to bitcoin price might yield some short-to-medium term predictable movements. It may not be that novel, but it's a coarse measurement of activity, and with activity comes value into the system (in theory).
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:17:54
Price fluctuations are just a measure of how many people want to buy or sell an item for another medium. All the dropping price says is that in the last few months there've been a lot more people wanting to sell BTC than buy it. This happens in other currencies as well, and significantly so in smaller-country currencies when speculation is one of the biggest driving factors. The advantage BTC has over those small-nation-currencies is that it can't be printed into oblivion, and it's merchant acceptance (particularly online merchant acceptance) is growing in spite of volatility. That wouldn't be the case with a small nation currency, which would see it's vendors start demanding dollars or euros.
What bitcoin needs, is financial instruments attached to it. This is how all currencies work. The more desirable financial investment instruments that are attached to a currency, the more money/value gets thrown into that denomination, and the stronger the currency gets. Right now, the biggest upward pressure on BTC/USD price are speculation (which is highly volatile), and essentially U.S. preppers and unbanked, which don't have big money. Interestingly enough, the USD has been strengthening lately, which makes speculators and survival-minded people less likely to buy BTC. This easily explains why merchants and miners could win out for a long while to come.
With this in mind, the real stability in price and attractiveness of bitcoin won't emerge until ventures like Ethereum start becoming reality. Until then, this is just an experiment. Just imagine if a new online vendor of merchandise or services also started offering "Shares" of themselves using Ethereum, *as well as* selling their product online for BTC, and you get an idea of how far this ecosystem has to go to strengthen.
@_date: 2014-08-25 15:42:54


This is absolutely true, and another reason why "inherent value" does not actually exist. People seem to want to attach this term "inherent value" to harder forms of money, but really all they're doing is speaking of the degree to which the network effect has established itself in that medium. All money is supposed to be little more than a ledger on what value you have created that humanity owes you for.

The community has made their belief clear. Centralization of auditing is a risk to the network.
So why not simply audit the auditors? If Ghash wants to continue growing, so be it. Growth of any single pool isn't really the thing the community fears. What they fear is loss of control over what is supposed to be a decentralized system. So what really needs to happen is to force Ghash to play fairly. That means near-instantaneous auditing of every transaction going in and out of their systems. It also means the community as a whole must be ready to literally sue Ghash out of existence for any misdeeds, any double-spends on the blockchain. Is that even possible?

2) You cannot double-spend coins that are not already yours, that's entirely wrong. Without a private key, no one can spend your BTC.
3) It would *have* to be a group, pulling it off solo would likely require a level of automation that is simply too complicated for an individual to pull off.

Engaging with a politician over their own proposed regulation is a tacit agreement of power taken without permission.
Feel free to downvote me as some kind of ignorant fool. Arguments towards engaging and attempting negotiation are eloquent and speak of an active mind. However, they miss the most basic point. That point is this... Any time you say, "ok, lets engage with politician Y because if we don't, things could be worse," you are essentially saying that this person has authority not hitherto granted to them. It is surrender to their presumed authority to regulate. No one granted them power over cryptocurrencies, such power was never written down anywhere, nor spoken of, until a politician proposed regulation. By working with the politicians on this, you are agreeing that regulatory capture is appropriate for cryptocurrencies. 
Elected representatives and executives need to feel the sting of being ignored. The attention they receive only encourages them to try to regulate more of our lives.

*Most merchants accepting bitcoin don't make significant cost savings*
Your average mom &amp; pop with low volume, doesn't make much savings using BTC over the big 3 credit... if you're talking only about costs/fees for POS/EFT services.
*Paying using bitcoin in a physical shop is still not simple, it takes longer than a normal transaction and there is always a risk some part of the technology chain will break down.*
It takes longer to "confirm" or "finish" a transaction if you wait for BTC confirmation as compared to swiping a credit card, but once confirmed it's set in stone. Compare this with a credit agency that can simply say, "no, that transaction was fraudulent." for a month or so after the transaction and proceed to screw with the merchant. I think you underestimate the value of a BTC transaction over standard EFT or credit transactions, which have inherent 2-way capability that allow for error and abuse by consumer, merchant, bank, etc all down the line in the transaction. BTC is slower if you're a consumer buying coffee at Starbucks, but actually more secure for the merchant in the end. BTC is mostly superior to credit/EFT both for merchant and consumer for online purchases.

That's because most people are raised to believe that they must submit themselves to being governed. Most kids are raised these days seeing their parents afraid of screwing up on their taxes, afraid of raising the attention of police, etc..etc.. 
This is completely contrary to what a free society is supposed to be like, where the government should fear it's people.
To most of the world, taxes are some kind of force of nature, like the tide. They come and they go, and it's better to just avoid getting wet. To people who stop and think about it, they quickly realize that taxation is actually theft. Someone is telling you that you *must* give up money you earned under threat of force. That's no different than being held up at gunpoint.
"most people's" immediate reaction to my words up there^^ are a mixture of indignation, guilt-tripping, and defense of the actions of government. This is precisely what indoctrinated people do, they defend the systems they are intellectually-invested in, because to admit error on such a colossal scale is to admit that they've been duped.

I watched that, and your interpretation is biased. Stefan does overstate his case and Schiff does make him concede some basic realities, but it is not the "shredding" that you make it to be, because even Schiff is forced to concede that the future of cryptocurrency is unknown and unknowable. Schiff does not paint a negative picture even in his own thoughts, he simply refuses to accept blind optimism for an unregulated digital barter system as an investment asset, and well he should.
Most of Stefan's optimism regarding bitcoin is unprovable because it's a futurist kind of "prediction" if you can call them that. But that doesn't mean he's wrong, and his reasoning is pretty sound. Stefan is right to think that widespread adoption of cryptocurrency will break the monopoly on financial transactions that is currently held by the politico-elite. And he is using correct thinking to extrapolate from that that todays elite will find it terribly difficult to persuade a free people into supporting large expenditures for war in such an environment. The only problem with his presentation is he is overstating things when he says, "cure for war". There is no cure for war, humans will have conflict, in fact, human conflict is a natural part of our state. Without human conflict, humans would be herd animals that still fed on raw hunted animals and lived huts or caves. Conflict gave us just about every single technology we have. That's also not to mention that there may be some other as yet inconceivable way in which the elites (who will always exist) will convince the masses to go to war. All cryptocurrency can do is reduce the scale of conflict, but who knows just how much it can actually reduce that scale, it might be quite substantial.

I'm not convinced that a credit card company is threatened by an electronically traded, completely transparent, non-debt-based currency. Their ability to issue credit in fiat currency is not being threatened. And lets face it, most of their expansion since the 1990s has been issuing credit cards to people who had no business charging the things they bought on them. Those people probably don't own much bitcoin. Credit card payment systems are still faster than bitcoin in most consumer applications, and likely won't ever fall far behind bitcoin in that department. Their credit reporting services serve as an early-warning to identity theft these days, so they even have use outside the financial realm.
The areas where they are going to have the most trouble is being accepted anywhere. Cryptocurrency exists wherever the internet does. No POS system can match that. It's hard to me to be sure they feel threatened by that though, perhaps they do.

Technically incorrect.
DOD spending is something around 600-700 Billion dollars a year.

Total federal internal revenue is about 2200 billion dollars per year.
You can have a balanced U.S. federal budget and still have the exact same defense spending as the U.S. has now. Of course, Social Security, Medicare, etc... would all have to take severe cuts, but it could be done. Realistically, it's the non-discretionary spending, the mandatory spending that causes the perennial overruns, and most of that mandatory spending is social programs. The defense budget could be cut at any time, in fact, DOD has to justify their budget to congress every year, whereas all the social programs do not.

You can, in fact, be the most staunch practicer of the scientific method ever to walk the earth, and still believe in God, because there are areas of knowledge where the human mind still fails to come up with an explanation. Hence, there is always room for imagination.
Similarly, why can't inflationary and deflationary currencies exist side-by-side? Gold and the Dollar have existed in a separated fashion for decades, and while Gold cannot be traded so easily, it is not inflationary. One might argue that inflationary(debt-based) currencies allow for more speculation and high-risk investing that is ultimately good for mankind's technological progress where a deflationary currency would be destructive to such ends (limited currency means not every dreamer can get funded). Likewise, deflationary currencies satisfy the desire to secure value in a form that is easily traded, where inflationary currencies encourage few people to save, forever decreasing the OODA loop and creating nightmarish crashes.
I suspect a more stable economy would require a proper mix of both inflationary and deflationary currencies, allowing consumers to exchange them freely (at a free market exchange rate) depending on their desired purpose.

Money Laundering is a made-up "crime". Literally, there is no moral violation, no ethical violation of any kind in this "crime". This "crime" was defined by the elites of society so they could go after organized criminals, and that's it. There is no other reason for this definition to exist. Nobody should give two spits what people do with the money they have. Whether that money was gotten from criminal activities or not, the fact remains that the actual moral violation was in the crime to get the money, not in that money's transfer or "laundering".
Money laundering is a purely evil and arbitrary criminal construct that gives power to elites at the expense of the free.

1) There is nothing behind bitcoin save for the cryptography that guarantees that your private keys keep your coins in your posession.
2) You shouldn't have faith in the U.S.'s credit.
3) Those countries will likely always accept dollars, but at what exchange rate? If they end up wanting thousands of dollars to the Yen (unlikely in the short-medium term), that's just as bad as not accepting them for the average middle-class person.
4) The value does technically decrease as more are produced, but they're not being produced at nearly the rates that the U.S. dollar is, and the rate at which bitcoins are produced is slowing down by laws of mathematics and physics.
5) Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. This isn't as scary as it sounds, neither does any government currency. They're all backed by faith that someone will pay off debts. Well, if you're a student of history, you know that governments have this nasty habit of not paying back gigantic debts.

Actually, calling Bitcoin a payment system misses the point entirely.
Credit Cards are a pure payment system because there is no net positive balance in the system. All that exists is debt that needs to be repaid with interest. There is no value in putting money into a credit card system because it exists purely as a ledger to resolve the absence of value.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is the inverse of this. It is a positive-balance, push system. That means that value exists in the system, and it is transferred around in exchange for (presumably) real-world value. Purchasing bitcoin is not at all similar to "buying debt" in a payment system. It's more like buying gold that you think/know someone else will need/want to transact with in the future. Owning bitcoin is a bit like owning a portion of a major bridge over which international commerce will need to transact in the future. This means that it will have value, the question is only how much.
You can always create more debt so that a credit-card payment system is liquid. You cannot always create more of positive-balance-asset-A such that the payment system is liquid. This inherently means that holders of BTC have a squeeze position on future transactions using the bitcoin network.

The lack of an upcoming big bubble has no bearing on the market fundamentals. MtGox was a bad actor, of that there can be no doubt. I also have no doubt whatsoever that the price was manipulated by MtGox based on what you say, and the report, and just watching things happen.

Indeed. The gold market is small, and has significant periods of low low low trade volume. Bitcoin in it's current state mirrors many aspects of the precious metals markets. It is being used as hoarding material by people who understand it's currency value. It is not behaving as much like a fluid currency yet. 
If bitcoin is boring, but stable, that simply demonstrates that it has value as a fungible, divisible, exchangable, non-debase-able item, which it is. What the market does w.r.t. fiat almost doesn't matter. As long as the number of people who are learning about it's preferred properties continues to grow, then crypto will continue to grow in value, period. It is **ALL** about **network effect**, and that's it. Gold, and silver had their network-effect period thousands of years ago. Those metals for centuries had absolutely no use besides their value as currency. Bitcoin is the same. 
Fiat-trade volume doesn't matter. Transaction volume doesn't matter. None of these things matters. What matters is the number of people on this planet who understand what bitcoin can do for them. Just keep the network effect going and keep the network stable and BTC will be the new gold.

Yet it is essentially prior restraint. You are restrained from growing certain types of plants in your front yard. However, how much control do you really have over what ends up growing on your property? Not 100% really. If the wrong seed falls into your lawn, you've suddenly got a "crop" that's illegal. This then becomes a law where positive action to avoid running counter to law is required by ordinary citizens, which is not the purpose of laws at all. The purpose of laws is to sort out good (socially justifiable) from bad (antisocial) actions, but only when conflict exists. If there is no conflict (i.e., your growing/smoking activities do not harm me), there should be no crime.

No doubt I am not addressing them. There can be no doubt of that. The steady decline in the opening of new businesses in the U.S. in particular tells me that the never-ending stampede of new regulation on developed-world business is more important to stop than to try to compromise with. 
You can tell me, "This doesn't help me run a business, in fact going-hands-off hurts me." You may have a point. But the reality is that individuals, and small business have next-to-zero impact on the regulations that affect them:
And, those regulations are strangling the generation of new businesses:
So, take your pick. You can continue kissing the ass of politicians who are making it hard for you to open business and exercise your economic freedom.

She's getting it, but she doesn't quite get it fully yet. She says...


Actually, no, in such a hypothetical future the "digital davids", will be busy generating value for which crypto-money is an acceptable store of.
The banks will have to scramble because their old business model wont work *at all*. I'm not going to say that banks will fade into history, that's clearly hyperbole. Their entire business model right now rests on margins of interest charged and gained. They do not generate value in a monetary system where people can be their own storehouse, their own lending institution, and their own payment network. Charging interest in a monetary ecosystem with a fixed asset supply is basically putting banks in competition with banks for charging the highest interest rate possible. If the currency supply is zero-sum, then interest paid on a loan of this asset has to come from someone who already owns some of that asset, which is (ultimately) another bank. That would mean that banks have a natural check-and-balance on their rates. Charge too little interest, and another bank will simply accumulate more of the fixed asset than you. Charge too much interest, and no one will dare accept a loan from you.
Bitcoin to banks who only lend and charge interest in fiat is something like a liquid gold standard. It's an instantly transferrable asset that can be used to back up the fiat they are based on. All bankers in existence today have never really dealt with such a thing. For banks who continue to loan in fiat, a crypto-currency standard would mean forced transparency of reserves, something quite quite painful to the about-to-collapse bankers we have today.
Ultimately though, why wouldn't the "David's" simply do all their business dealings in crypto? In such a situation, banks then become revealed for what they really are, which is basically a loan shark with a tie. Sure, you can go to them, and get lent some money, but their business is one of profiting off of the debtor, and always has been. Their business has customers, and always will, just like prostitutes have business. But just as everyone knows that prostitution is a poor substitute for a loving wife (if you're lucky enough to find one), everyone should know that getting a loan to attempt to profit at a rate higher than your interest payments is a poor substitute for hard work.

You couldn't eat it. You couldn't farm with it. You couldn't feed your livestock with it. You couldn't build a house with it. You couldn't kill anyone with it. What "intrinsic value" did gold have before it had industrial uses? And why was it valued so highly despite having no use other than money?
If you say it had use as Jewelry, and it's color was aesthetically pleasing, therefore it had value, you are using a circular argument since jewelry and money were basically interchangeable things in those times.

It loosely makes sense. Still, I wouldn't put my name on a paper using that explanation. You should justify why you can treat BTC like a meme, and why treating it like a meme transfers into the realm of actual usage. I'm not saying that that's a bad thought, but the ideas need to be thought through some before writing that as an explanation.
Meme's spread because they're easy to spread, and they offer an instant rush of humor/emotion for very little expense. Bitcoin reaches into people's saved value from work, so it's difficult to convince the average person that there's no risk of large expense to them for trying it, and it isn't the easiest thing to spread, you have to install new software and trust that new software.
IMHO, bitcoin is far from a meme, but that doesn't mean it couldn't spread like one.

People don't value homes like they did in 1980. In 1980, people were still getting married and trying to raise children *in a home*. That culture is all but gone. The housing bubble increased home ownership, but it was all just government pumping and deception cast at the middle class that home ownership was the only ticket to long-term wealth. The real value of a home to a society *will drop* if culture decides they no longer want to marry and have kids and raise them in a house. That is precisely what has been happening over the last 30 years.
Here's the marriage rates since 1950:
Notice the monotonic decline since about 1973. People in the developed world are not reproducing any more, they're living single for decades (see: Japan for a horrific example of this).

Whenever I have to explain why I'm involved in bitcoin, I have to explain currency to people from the ground up. My canned story usually goes something like this...
Before money existed, people bartered things for value. This worked well enough when you had villages that were mostly self-sufficient and you only occasionally needed to exchange value perhaps twice a year between villages. However, it was extraordinarily inconvenient for people with significant value. For instance, if you are a rancher, all of your value is in your cows. Well, in order to transfer value, you now have to drive some cattle 20-40 miles to the next town in time for the market. That means a major disruption of your life, just to buy one thing you need. That's incredibly inconvenient and a huge deterrance to exchange of value between anyone. It is a factor that actually destroys any chance of a real economy. To get around this problem, the concept of money was invented. Instead of driving all your cattle to a marketplace, you could create essentially a paper record of a transaction, and the transaction could occur in stages. This had the potential to free you from risking loss to your cattle from bringing it to market, and the customer from losing additional value from driving the cattle he bought from the market to his ranch. This was win-win.
From this humble beginning of coinage, we have evolved into a world financial system with hundreds of government-backed currencies, each one subject to the political whims of the politicians and their friends in those countries. They're all moved around digitally though a system of trust that is attached to the wealthiest people on earth, and they are the gatekeepers of that system. If you want to make lots of money (literally, make money by offering debt on money you don't have), you have to have the approval and acceptance of that system, and it's quite exclusive. This is why there are only 3 major brands of credit in the world, Visa, Mastercard and Discover. These systems exist because we abandoned the gold standard many years ago. This unlocking of currency from an established physical asset essentially opened the floodgates to allowing money (value) to pop into existence merely at the creation of debt on paper. No longer were people exchanging cattle for wheat in a fair exchange of value, now we have financiers putting numbers into databases, and then charging interest from the people they put into debt. In this system, currency value has almost lost all meaning. The systems of currency and monetary value that we have today are all based on some nebulous concept of trust in politicians and debt creation, and not on anything solid. This happened because governments were put in charge of the monetary systems on this planet. The politicians themselves create debt and thus pay friends and enemies into silence of their poor leadership, and they also control the financial regulations which allows their friends the bankers to create debt in specific ways, profiting both politician and banker alike on the backs of debt that you carry. If there's one thing you can never trust a politician with, it's a blank checkbook with "approval" from the population. This allows our current political systems to be entirely disrupted because politicians can simply print money to satisfy the constituents that voted them in office. This cycle of election-and-debt-generation has existed for at least the past 1000 years (possibly since before the Romans) in the developed world. Argentina has never escaped from it.
What bitcoin/cyptocurrency does is take control of currency out of the hands of politicians, and debt creators, and puts it into the hands of the people (essentially). With this fundamental change, the flexibility of computer software, and the distributed auditing services of thousands of extra CPU cycles the world over, you can never have the cycle of election/debt-creation/revolution/election again because politicians can't simply write a blank check to make people happy when they want to cover up their faults as leaders.
Furthermore, with cryptocurrency, you have a currency system that runs contrary to the old fiat currency system. It actually has a tendency to deflate with time, rather than inflate. While fiat currencies will likely never go away, the very presence of cryptocurrency in the world marketplace will force political forces the world over to reconsider their debt cycles, because no one will want to use a currency that is being printed into oblivion. This is already happening right now in Argentina.

Waste of time to write. Waste of time to vote on. Waste of time to pass. Waste of time to engage in.
You might as well try to pass laws forbidding your citizens from bartering between each other. Ultimately, you can't do it. This is why BTC is impossible to stop, and no one should try, and no one should try to stop anyone trying to legislate against it, because ultimately all attempts to prevent people from bartering will fail.
It's like trying to forbid anyone from dealing in gold coins. Unless you're literally going to turn your nation into such a police state where every square meter has a policeman on it, you can't stop the underground economy.

Inflatables are typically used as liferafts. For that analogy to work, Bitcoin would have to be a last resort that always existed. I think Gold/Silver fits that bill better. Gold &amp; Silver are the tried-and-true-always-available forms of money. They're the lifeboats.

Except for that total lost of dominating market position, absolutely no inroads into emerging markets (where Android is something like 90+% of some of those markets), and being behind the innovation curve as evidenced by their latest offering only measuring up to an Android phone that was released in 2012, and their watch mimicking something Korean companies announced in 2012, yeah, I guess they're "winning".


I said no such thing. What I've said is, Apple is a loser in winners clothing, with a stock price propped up by buybacks and fed-induced stock market bubbles.


They don't. As evidenced by their three most recent announcements all being things that other companies have had out or announced years ago.


Yep, because their stock price is inflated beyond all reasonable measure.


They are a joke. They sue companies that make competing products simply because they "look" too much like Apple products. Does that sound like quality innovation to you? Turning into a patent troll? They haven't come out with a single new thing that someone else hasn't already released or announced in over a decade. They defend their "tech" position by not innovating and suing people that violate their form factor trademark. They're little more than thugs in the tech sphere of the world.

This is what I got from that article, which to me says everything about it's author...
Yishan Wong: "Dogecoin is great."
Yishan Wong: "...the userbase for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly-informed about currency systems and macroeconomics."
Yishan Wong: "In contrast, the dogecoin community doesn't have anywhere near as much of an ideological bent."
Yishan Wong: "Speaking of brilliance, one of the key stated aims of dogecoin is the collective journey to the moon, a source of long-time brilliance throughout human history.  I consider this a worthy goal, and for those of us without rocketry-aided means, we too can journey to the moon - in our imaginations and with the aid of computer games."
So, who exactly is he calling crazy?
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:04:34
That doesn't make sense from any kind of principled standpoint, to hell with what regulations say. It was an exchange of good, not an increase in value of anything. If the free market is operating at ideal conditions, no net value is added to the system, simply an exchange of ownership of services/property.
Taxing such exchanges is like taxing a handshake. No net value is created by economic actors, but the government decides it's going to steal from both of them because they shook hands.

1) Government's try and fail at blocking internet access time and time again. Even in times of significant upheaval in countries, the population is generally able to tweet, facebook, etc... they're able to get the word out about what's going on somehow. So internet access is becoming impossible to deny to the population of Earth without literally just turning off the power generation facilities (and even then, difficult to eradicate completely).
2) With internet access, you have access to the bitcoin network
3) With access to the bitcoin network, you can transact in bitcoin.
So... what government support does it need? It seems to me the only thing government needs to do is get out of the way and adapt to a world where fiat must compete with non-fiat.

The 70s up into the early 80s was the actual collapse of the dollar. We have been limping along ever since on a petrodollar standard. See, a funny thing happened when Nixon took us off the gold standard, we floundered for a while with significant price inflation and financial uncertainty, and then we suddenly became good friends with the Saudis. We've been friends with the Saudi's ever since. We offered to be their muscle, so long as they used their vast oil reserves and influence in the oil export market to keep oil priced in dollars. Since then we've attacked every single nation that dared to suggest it would sell oil in anything other than USD. The only oil exporting nation we can't threaten and are not friends with is Russia. This, btw, is the real reason Iran wants nukes, they want to be able to sell oil into any currency they want without the U.S. threatening war with them. Forget Israel, Iran's ruling elite may hate them, but they went for nukes because of the U.S., not Israel.
The reality is that all expanding economies need cheap energy. The U.S. is the best example of this. We made a deal with the Saudi's to keep the oil flowing, and flowing for dollars (I am not going to dive into the gold-for-oil theories here). Without cheap oil, the U.S. economy would have hit a brick wall in the 1970's, it would have stopped catastrophically. Because economies require cheap energy, and because oil is the most universal source of that energy, oil became a more valuable "monetary" commodity than gold. With this, some rather strange bedfellow arrangements were made to keep the USD strong by pegging all oil sales in USD.
So yes, 34 years ago, the dollar did not go to zero, and it hasn't since. That changes nothing because the conditions for it's collapse remain and they're actually getting far more tenuous with every threat of war we level at other nations for daring to buy oil in anything other than USD.

Nobody forced you to save the man either.
If medical professionals find money so important that they would let someone die rather than spend a few hours effort at rescusitation and an ambulance ride and have a chance at not getting paid for it then I believe they chose the wrong profession. 
If those same medical professionals whine and mope about all the lifesaving they do that they don't get paid for, then frankly they should STFU. I don't know how many times I've consulted friends and acquaintances on things I know that might help them, or fixed their technology for them, all without any expectation of getting paid. That's me doing work, offering expertise, and consulting people without any contract or expectation of payment between us. I do this because I know that it is good for my business.
Doctors, and medical professionals should save people's lives purely because every life saved is a potential new lifelong customer of theirs, just as every other profession gives freebies out in order to try to capture new customers.

All elements above lead are stable, some simply oxidize easier. 
You keep dancing around the properties of money, while outright denying that bitcoin can have any of those properties. This is rather sadly myopic. You recognize that gold has value, but you've never stopped to consider that gold's "value" in the eyes of others was once just as volatile as bitcoin, just as subject to manipulation, and just as strange to consider for people who had never used it as a medium of exchange in ancient times. There are still cultures to this day, who will turn down gold pieces, but would readily accept food/meat/hides, etc...

It also ensures it's long-term failure. Currently, JP Morgan cannot simply "print" dollars. It can leverage itself into more numeric wealth, and move leveraged debt around to position itself as best it thinks it needs to. But ultimately it does not have the authority to create new currency. If you give such a centralized ledger structure, with a history of monetary and market manipulations (read the history of the Fed) the ability to create, it's literally like handing a nuclear warhead to a psychopath.
The temptation to simply generate themselves new wealth is too great. Buying into a JP Morgan backed cryptocurrency would be little different than going all-in on confederate dollars at the start of the civil war. A gang of bankers cannot be trusted to not vote themselves more money. However, the masses can be trusted to resist the urge to not debase their own stored value. This is why decentralization, if it can truly be achieved long-term, is so much safer.

It doesn't quite cover it though.
Gold coins were unfathomable to people who had only ever bartered with goods before. They had to be convinced over generations of their utility as a store of value.
The internet was unfathomable to a generation of people who spent their entire lives learning the dewey decimal system by heart so they could be well-respected academics. They had to be convinced that this communications medium could be trusted (it still can't, but neither could your average non-fiction at the library).
Bitcoin is currently unfathomable to a generation of people who believe there's something "special" about government issued currency. The full implications of it won't be felt for many generations from now.

How would you do this? Any decentralization of the BTC mining process is probably impossible at this point. There's too much momentum carrying us towards a single mining "authority" and there's too much computer power towards that end in their hands. There's no way to overcome the hashrate of the large pools, even if you turned every full node into a miner, because those miners would not have the hash rate. And if someone with real VC funding put their money towards mining BTC? Even the current pools would see themselves replaced.
I can see how, if you had easy decentralized mining from the get-go, this situation might have been avoided. However, if you decentralize the mining while distributing the gains, what incentive is there for anyone to mine?
If mining had never left the full nodes, and every wallet was a full node, I think this situation might not have happened.

If the politicians in power suddenly have to react to a population with sound money again, they can't keep printing themselves into oblivion to get elected. The only regulators/senators/ representatives you'll convince of BTC's virtues are the ones who do not understand the hand that feeds them, i.e., the morons.... which, now that I really think about it, means it could actually work...

I read everything available on the swarmcorp website last night, including all the whitepapers linked.
I want to be impressed, but I'm not.
All available documentation seems to gloss over fundamental questions. Here are the things investors want to know...
* How am I to be compensated for my investment?
* How am I to be compensated for my investment?
* How am I to be compensated for my investment?
* What documentation will be provided to me about the company's activity?
* What assurances do I have that this documentation is accurate?
* What control will I have over the company's direction?
* How do I extract myself from this investment if I decide to sell?
**NONE** of those questions were satisfactorily answered in any of the documentation available on SWARM. Only one of those questions was addressed, the question of compensation. But SWARM's answer is less than satisfactory, only mentioning that there will be profit-sharing.
Don't misunderstand my harsh criticism. I see the utility of allowing for truly decentralized and **NO**-barrier-to-entry investment mechanisms. I am as excited as the next person to see this next step in trustless networks come to pass. But if organizations spring up, promising this sort of platform, while asking for BTC donations (which have established value), and giving no real documentation of their planned offering, how am I not supposed to believe it's little more than a scam? Isn't this not much more different than BTC ASIC vaporware companies? I mean, SWARM alone is asking for 4500 BTC. That's currently valued at nearly $3 million, and they only have 4 employees on their website. If they never produce a thing, that's some *damn* fine salary right there, enough to retire on in many places of the world.

*-Too many unrealistically cite that Bitcoin will take down big banking. This is not only laughable and unrealistic, but would take half a century to even begin to happen. It also makes one look like a loon to anyone willing to hear a pitch.*
I recall the record companies saying something similar about Napster in the 1990s. Now they're all in big trouble, and they have no stores to sell their product.
*-Too often bitcoiners attach politics to why they like bitcoin. I do understand that it will probably take a few bold politicians to make bitcoin succeed as a currency, but this board often reads like a chain of ridiculous libertarian conspiracy threads.*
Politics attached itself to currencies when it took total control of all currencies in the world. People seem to think that currencies and the power of politics are inseperable, but this is entirely false, and the average person *should* start thinking like that. Currency is simply a method of lubricating the same thing humans have done since the beginning of time, barter value between each other. As such, it requires no input from anyone besides the two people involved in a transaction. Politicians can frankly, go f-themselves when it comes to two people engaging in a transaction, and that's how it should be.
*-Be the forward thinkers that you are. A lot of people have money tied into Mt Gox. Hopefully, they will retrieve set money and all will be fine in the not too distant future. But understand that something that begins unregulated will attract bad people attempting to game a new system. As more responsive and reputable(hopefully US based) companies rise from the large amount of capital tied in, the insolvent or poorly run companies will fizz out quickly.*
You say be a forward thinker, and then you mention people have value in Gox? Forward thinking would be realizing that you don't need a bank with a cryptocurrency.
*but the tech surrounding bitcoin needs to improve a great deal before everyone you know embraces it.*
Nope. Using cryptocurrency is pathetically simple compared to using dollars, all things considered. I am my own bitcoin vault, storing all my own value any way I like, and I can access it any time I want. The tech doesn't need to improve, human understanding of digital fungibility needs to improve.

I read both your posts. I find point 1 vague. I repeat my request for more than a single sentence explanation of "forgone it's future viability as a currency"
1) All currencies must be exchangeable between themselves, or they cannot be medium's of exchange.
2) You will get no disagreement with me that the exchange of fiat for bitcoin actually poisons bitcoin as it allows those interested in established markets to do very evil things in the "newer" market. That says nothing about it's future, however. In fact, many many currencies started off as valueless, and became quite valuable later in their lives, fiat included.

I was also thinking, why did BTC structure their reward structure the way they did? Why did the largest coin rewards start at the lowest difficulty? What was the decision process there? It seems backwards to me.
If BTC were a natural resource, like gold or oil, that people valued... then it's mining/collection as a resource would follow a known curve. That curve does not (necessarily) start with the greatest reward of resources being taken with the least amount of difficulty. In fact, the difficulty starts off very small, right. Like with Oil, people just had this stuff bubbling up in their grain fields and they hated it because they couldn't grow crops, that early stuff is easy to get. So there's an initial period of resource discovery where the ease of mining should lead to large amounts of resources entering the system purely because of the ease of it. But as time goes on, as the difficulty of acquiring this resource increases, the reward naturally has to increase for people to consider doing it.
BTC is backwards in this respect. The difficulty will continue to increase, but the reward will likely drop to zero (value for energy expended, not zero BTC). I think the reward pyramid should have been inverted, or mostly inverted, with 1 BTC rewards for the starting difficulty and something like 100 BTC reward for the highest difficulty

Controls on currencies do only one thing, they protect people who peddle or have invested in products that are tied to that currency. Since the financial systems in existence today attach themselves to government-backed currencies, a crisis of confidence in what the financial markets are doing means a crisis of confidence in that currency. If you detach the brokers of financial products from the currency, you eliminate those problems for good.
If, in a hypothetical future, there are 100s of major cryptocurrencies in use throughout the world, all legal everywhere. Then there is absolutely no reason for a financial product to be tied to a single currency. In fact you could sell financial products in all currencies. So if a single market or a single financial product type has a major crisis, the impact on the system would be minimal. This restricts the level of damage that the gamblers of the financial world can do, since it would be their products that would tank before the currencies suffer.

I don't mind if an alt-coin becomes superior, I mind that many will claim superiority without proof of work.
I don't believe it's possible to rationalize BTC being the "final" currency that mankind comes up with. It's more like the first virtual currency. If you look at the history of physical currencies, the people using them always found improvements. Just look at the history of precious metals as currency. At first men were just trading random bits of gold that they would weigh by hand and bite into, and ultimately they were using finely tuned scales and x-ray florescence to verify purity.
I've no doubt that crypto-currency will evolve, but forcing evolution before adoption is like asking for maturity before growth. You can't expect a 3-foot-tall 3 year old kid to be mature, but you can expect him to grow.
Let crypto-currencies grow in popularity first, the maturity will come. People promoting alt-coins before the world even knows what the hell crypto is doesn't really help anyone, it only confuses the world. We're just now starting to get to the point where the financial world is waking up to the realities that the blockchain offers the future, so we're almost, *almost* at the point where a "superior" alt-coin (provided one is truly superior) might be recognized by the wisdom of the masses, it would take even longer to choose one.
Keep in mind, the improvements in some alt-coins actually make their protocols *more* complicated, and sometimes simpler is ultimately better.

? What makes BTC illiquid? You can turn cash into BTC pretty much instantly. You can transfer it without fee or trust-check-process also pretty much instantly. Where is this illiquidity you're trying to believe in?


Actually, before those guys got into banking, they created lots of value in the form of entirely new industries for an early U.S.. If the federal government had completely ignored their calls for centralized banking, and further exposed their market manipulation for the criminal activity it was, they would have had absolutely no power to steal via credit expansions and we might not be in the situation we are now, where 1% owns a ridiculous percentage of the world wealth.

Again, this reads like you have no understanding of history.
North Korea is a poor nation because it's people are chattel. Their leader is a joke and in terms of wealth is actually barely worth mentioning on the world stage, because he maintains chattel instead of a "perceived free" population.
Ghengis Kahn could *only* maintain his power through military conquest. He had no talent, whatsoever, for maintaining an empire with the lies of false freedom.
Consolidated power begets poor production and thus a tightening of the screws in finance, social liberties, which in turn begets worse overall production, which in turn.. downward spiral... The reason the leaders of the developed world have the power they do is because their world is one of "perceived free" populations. These "perceived free" populations generate more inherent value in the state-controlled monetary system. This means more overall political power on the world stage for those leaders, to say nothing of their own personal wealth (which is usually greater after leaving office).

Absolutely. What Peter Schiff calls "intrinsic value" in precious metals is little more than the network effect that he fails to recognize.

That's pure network effect at work. But it goes largely ignored by people in finance because they haven't truly explored why gold, silver, and other precious metals became valuable in the first place. It was network effect of the invention of coinage thousands of years ago, by way of Lydia, then Greece, that convinced the world that Gold was the most valuable substance on earth.

The only way to control a currency system in a downward interest rate spiral that is laden with debt is by having the power to control the entire ledger system. If you control the distributed forms of the general ledger (cash/coin/gold), you control the ledger. Once you control the ledger, you can simply re-assign value to people and the problem is solved. 
Cash is actually not good enough protection. As the old saying goes, when fraud is rampant, possession is 100% of the law.

I spent ~1 BTC at Tigerdirect in the past month.
There's something about the bitcoin community that people should recognize, it's about the demographics of it.
MOST BTC adopters are young, single men. That's the largest demographic.
Young single men are SAVERS, not SPENDERS. In fact, men in general produce more than they spend over their lives, but young men especially generally save more than anyone else.
It's women who spend, that's just a fact. It's a fact that women try their best to deny/avoid, because it completely undermines their argument for equal pay. Women in the developed world actually significantly outspend their lifetime income (as a demographic). What this means is that men are giving resources to women over their lives to spend, which means that trying to get earned-income-equality is just retarded, because men give women money and gifts *anyway*. It will always be so, because men love women, and love their children. No money no honey.
If you want merchants to start adopting bitcoin, you need to convince those with vaginas to start using BTC.

I don't think Peter will be alive to eat his words. I don't mean to say he will die young, I just mean that I think it will take a lot longer for BTC to replace gold as a preferred store of value than it will to supplant fiat as a workable system of money.
And actually, I have one bone to pick. This thing called "intrinsic value" that Peter is hung up on, is actually nonexistent. Nothing in the universe has "intrinsic" value. All value is relative, and if this were not so, then pricing in free markets would not work at all. Gold's "intrinsic" value, which I argue does not exist, actually derives from it's use as a monetary commodity just as you said. It is easily conceivable that gold could drop to near zero value for us here on earth. All that is required is the discovery of new, gigantic, and easily minable gold deposits, and it's value will fall. If we started colonizing the solar system and discovered many asteroids were full of gold, it's value would also drop. This can only happen if the commodity itself has no intrinsic value. If it has intrinsic value, then it's value should not change depending on how much of it is available. Bitcoin also has no "intrinsic value", because again, such a concept is a fantasy. With this frame of mind, it is best, as you said, to compare the potential uses as a monetary commodity between BTC and gold. When you do this, you see very quickly that BTC comes out on top.

Ghash is probably going up because future speculative value of BTC is going up.
Centralization of mining only serves the miners so long as their gamble on future value of their currency comes true. If Ghash begins 51% attacks, they will have irreparably damaged their potential future earnings. Yes, some people will still be able to profit from their mining, but it is still self destructive.
If/When the store value of BTC takes a huge hit from 51% attacks, mining will likely immediately become non-profitable. The only way it could be profitable is if 51% attacks become easy enough to simply print money for the largest pool. Is there any research/evidence that that is the case? (that's an honest question). Now, big money could easily simply pay for lots and lots of petahashes per second and take over the network. But would that be valuable to them? I think the answer depends on how ubiquitous BTC becomes, and this foretells (to me) that no single cryptocurrency will dominate, because centralization of store of value provides too tempting a target for the ambitious humans on earth to try to take over.
If mining becomes non-profitable short-term, and offers no promise of future value, all large pools will vanish. At that point, the only people left to perform network auditing will be the altruists, the believers in crypto who aren't looking for speculative profits. I have doubts that the hash rate available from non-speculative miners at that point will be sufficient to maintain the confirmation times that people will have become accustomed to, or prevent a single wealthy party from trying to take over the network. We almost need infinite computing power in the hands of any civilian for true decentralization to persist.

Valuing either Gold or BTC in Fiat is actually a mistake.
This is a very difficult concept to grasp, because most people in the developed world especially, are trained from birth to value their fiat. Hence when they compare the value of anything, they generally refer to it in units of their favorite fiat. 
But the reality is that the purchasing power or *value* of fiat is *always* changing. It's the precious metals (and if the future proves me right, crypto) that are actually *more* stable over time. When you look at Gold's value w.r.t. USD or CNY, what you're actually doing is comparing USD or CNY to Gold. And it gets even worse than that. The commodities markets of PMs are manipulated such that ounces of gold or silver in the hands of the public is treated like a consumable metal, an industrial need... but sovereign governments (at least the smart ones) treat PMs as the highest form of money. But normal people are not allowed into this market, and the two markets are essentially kept separate.
BTC has the potential to put non-fiat money into the hands of the general public, which is something central banks have been trying desperately to avoid since civilian redeemability of USD into gold was suspended decades ago. They've tried to avoid this because it removes their central currency planning power.
Best solution? Stop comparing PM's and Crypto to Fiat, because it gives too much respect to fiat currencies. 
The real measure of BTC success is in how many merchants will accept it for tangible goods. Most anyone in the world will accept gold for tangible goods, unless they are forbidden by law (fiat) from doing so.

You're conflating two things. Access to capital with the measured liquidity of crypto vs fiat.
Right now, if you want to open a bank account in the developed world, you have to fill out applications, tons of paperwork, have a documented citizen-number, and not be a criminal or have significant criminal background. If you want a loan, you have to document what you're doing even more. The blockchain removes those barriers and allows people who are completely broke to accept money, be their own bank, and even pay their employees. That's what I mean by greater access to liquid capital. All of the financial regulations attached to fiat are *removed* with cryptocurrency, which means as far as business is concerned, if you can do your entire business in crypto, you're in a very un-regulated world.

That's hardly a debunking, that guy is delusional. He presumes that a housing price bubble can't exist during a decline in value (what he calls real home price) of those same properties. That's just retarded. You can absolutely have a reduction in value while the street price is spiking, that's inflation 101. He's conflating price and value, which is quite amateur. 
He seems to think that the housing bubble itself wasn't inflationary, which is just absurd. Banks are the primary source of the currency supply in our system. The only reason the federal government created the bailouts was because of the fear of a sudden gigantic reduction in liquidity (read: "currency" that the banks made in the form of shit securities). They feared a huge, sudden, deflation from the failure and evaporation of all the regulation-encouraged securities-expansion that was going on to create the bubble. A housing bubble caused by shady bank loans, is the very definition of inflationary.

I agree, and I see an inherent problem with blockchain technology, the dynamic range of bitcoin transaction size versus bytes transaction size.
Right now, bitcoin works just fine for all transaction sizes, because the network utilization is relatively light. But that utility dies when it becomes impacted and fees have to rise just to get a reasonable confirmation time. When the network gets impacted, only large-value transactions make sense, because only the fees paid on large transactions (relative to transaction size) are what the miners will care about. Miners will completely ignore the small-bitcoin, small-fee, but 3-4 address transaction with multisig. They are right to do this.
Whatever solution is come up with needs to continue to allow the small-value transactions to be confirmed in a reasonable time, while letting the big transactions set their own priority with fees.
I think it would be nice to have something like a fee-rating system feedback loop for wallets. I'm actually surprised that Gavin hasn't done something like this for blockchain.info already. Basically just a quick read-out as to what fee levels are getting confirmed in what time period, dynamically read and displayed as blocks are mined. In order to have a fee market (or any kind of market), you have to have price discovery. Right now there is no price-discovery on fees.

Their problem isn't really block size, though that's part of it. P2SH adoption simply means larger and more complicated transactions. Their real problem is network growth and the speed of auditing by the miners. The 7 transactions per second limit, with P2SH has turned into a ~3-4 TPS soft limit. The block size increase is an immediate allowance for more transactions per second to get audited.
The real problem they need to solve is how fast the network can audit transactions. This may be why they've delayed, but that's a guess.

This line of thinking ignores the current paltry capabilities of the bitcoin network.
Bitcoin can handle, across it's entire network a maximum transaction rate of 7 transactions per second.
VISA can handle 2000 transactions per second without breaking a sweat, and tens of thousands of transactions per second on a major shopping holiday.
Your perspective is one which will limit bitcoin's usability for all time to 7 transactions per second. You're treating the current state of the network as "perfect" and incapable of improving or matching what the trad-fiat system currently handles.
That's why I find it so distasteful. I have no problem with people paying the miners more in fees for their service. I *do* have a problem with people not thinking clearly about how much the network needs to grow up before you start saying things like, "scarce resource".

I'm not even debating what size increase is appropriate. I frankly don't believe that even if you set the block size to 20GB right this minute that we would ever see the actual block sizes mined increase beyond 2MB for a year or two at least. The fearmongering from *both* sides is a problem here, just because the max block size is increased does nothing to increase the actual transaction rate that might cause an increase in sizes mined.
The fact remains that only one side took action, put their money where their mouth was and tried something. The other side just talked and talked and talked. In the absence of action from someone who means to lead, people will follow those taking action regardless of their standing.

Not true.
When you are insolvent, you do not have assets to cover all of your liabilities. You are essentially entirely up-side-down on your balance sheet. When you are illiquid, you do not have the cash flow to cover your short-term liabilities, it means you simply aren't bringing in enough income to keep your operations going. You can easily be illiquid but not be insolvent.

Either we're a nation of laws or we're a nation of elite/oligarchal rule, it's that simple.
Martin Luther King recognized that he would be arrested. He knew that what he was doing was illegal and he would have to face a judge and possible jail time for his actions. He did it anyway. While people tried and were sometimes successful in getting him leniency, he did not pretend that what he was doing was excusable under the law. He accepted the consequences of his choice.

It can't work. For instance, all nations have at least some of the civilian population that work with that nation's secrets. They would have to make an exception for every single one of those civilians or they would just be opening up their own secrets to the rest of the world. And what of those civilian's daily financial/social activities? Do you want opposing nations spies to be able to fully investigate the lives of every single cleared person? That's just retarded.
Even more importantly, a much much larger section of the civilian population work with national infrastructure, or nationally important intellectual property, forcing all transmissions from those people into plaintext is just retarded.

Well, presuming there were no block size limit, then individual miners could set their own block sizes. This incentivizes large incoming data pipes, because the faster you can gobble up outstanding transactions, the faster you can mine them. While this works great in theory because it's a freer market, in practice only large institutions can pay for the largest pipes. This means those with lots of resources now would have an easier time dominating the mining of any crypto they choose to "control".
If bandwidth itself were not a resource that must be paid for, an unlimited block size works great. Then again, there's no bandwidth like collaborative p2p bandwidth...

A couple of quick Google searches for you, don't take my word for it if you don't want to.




When you are insolvent, you do not have the assets (in total) to cover your total liabilities.

But they are central repositories of ledgers and customer information. They are literally a storehouse for these things. Their only value is in maintaining an accurate ledger and keeping it secure from thieves, and maintaining your personal information (also valuable in todays internet-based economies) and keeping it secure from thieves. How does a storehouse for information implement a system that suddenly, trustlessly gives up and distributes the very things they hold dear? I would venture to say that that is an impossible task. They've painted themselves into a corner and Bitcoin and other crypto will run circles around any attempt by them to incorporate it.

There was one video, a few years back, where Stephan made claims about healthcare that were completely untrue.

It doesn't follow. What you're really upset about is the actions of ambitious and unscrupulous leaders. You're upset about the concentration of power that those in charge are responsible for. Those are the people who are violating their oaths to everyone and they should be held to account just as much as Manning. The problem is they are not being held accountable...

If you end up with total *financial* collapse, Gold is most likely to be a great store of value and even useful monetarily until the system finds liquidity again.
If you end up with total *economic* collapse, Gold isn't going to be as useful monetarily because the systems that deliver food "just-in-time" to our local markets are going to break down. It might repair itself quickly and keep going, but who knows? In that situation, you might be able to use silver/gold to buy food from local farmers, might. It depends on what the farmer thinks.
If you end up with a total *civilizational* collapse, then gold and silver are mostly worthless as money, but they're not worthless as a store of value. You can hold those PMs and essentially "store value" until civilization gets on its feet again.
Bitcoin is almost the same really. In a financial collapse, Bitcoin still works just fine as both money and store of value. In an economic collapse, it's use as money still exists, but might be harder to conduct transactions in. In a civilizational collapse, your coins still exist on the blockchain, and when the worldwide internet "restarts" or becomes available again, you'll still have value.
Basically, Bitcoin and PMs have the exact same use cases in all forms of human social structure collapse.

In that scenario, I have no problem with him keeping his wealth. The reason I have no problem with a crony keeping his wealth in that scenario is that the only option left for extracting any wealth that people might find "ill gotten" is by force. I cannot on the one side blast such people for taking value from others by force, and with the other side approve of taking wealth from those people by force as well.
Wealth moves around on it's own, and always finds it's way into the hands of those who generate value in the long run. **ONLY** when government and their men with guns get involved do you have an artificial weight on the scale, but it doesn't last forever. Remove the tipped scales and value (wealth/money) finds it's level.

All laws exist with their exceptions. Whether or not you are part of the group of people allowed an exception is an arbitrary assignment based on class and income.
Don't kid yourself, laws in finance punish the poor and protect the rich because they always manage to find themselves exempt from the laws.
If you want a free market, then *yes* you have to accept that some people will be scammed. If you want government to protect you from scammers, don't be surprised if you see elites allowed to break those same laws you asked for whenever they want.
Edit: Hilarious, people vote me down even though they were certainly alive to watch the very same organization (Federal Reserve) that is required to regulate the banking industry become party to bailing out the banking industry for breaking the law. It's amazing to me how people can't see that laws against finance, regardless of how well-intentioned, only restrict those willing to abide by them. Since significantly wealthy people can simply claim economic catastrophe unless they're granted exceptions, they get exceptions from the politicians. It's literally the same as gun laws, they only punish the law abiding among us, cronys/criminals and elites wont abide by them.

No, my words from the beginning have been "personality cult." I am very aware of the difference in those terms as I grew up in a religious cult.


I have watched a large portion of his videos for the last 3 years. I am well aware of the sane, rational arguments he employs. Just because his arguments are sound does not exclude him from creating a personality cult. Such things crop up all the time. Martin Luther King had one. Lots of intelligent, well-reasoned people have personality cults following them. All that is required is that you're famous and people want to hear what you have to say. The moment you ask for money in payment for your words, you've effectively crossed a line. That line is governed (or, in our modern era, *should be* governed) in the media by journalistic ethics. Stephan, as much as I agree with the guy, does not follow those ethics nearly as well as he should.
My intent is absolutely not to inflame. Again, I agree with most everything Stephan says and agrees with. However, what I cannot do is remain silent when someone like that breaks with the healthy habit of admitting error publicly. Stephan has crossed the line into public figure, and his intent is to bring rational thinking to the masses... you cannot do that unless you are literally beyond reproach and absolutely humble in discussing and admitting your own mistakes. Stephan has parted ways with that form of ethical behavior.

WRONG, by definition that makes you illiquid. It does not mean you're insolvent. You may have assets that can be sold to create more liquidity.

I don't say this lightly. The reason I say this is because if you've watched any of the response videos to his, he is called out in some cases and his response has been to stop admitting error. He basically just ignores valid criticisms of what he says, which unfortunately means I have to now question most of what he says. He didn't use to do this. I've seen videos of his where he directly read e-mailed criticism of videos he's made and admitted he was wrong. But, he has started doing this never-admit-error bullcrap in the past year or so.

No, their intrusion method does not rely on key leaks from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. What they say they're doing is monitoring EM field emissions from the crypto-device while it's attempting to decrypt their injected cyphertext. That's a different side-channel attack than what you're worried about. Technically those things still work, so long as your laptop itself is not leaking readable EM emissions.
But, honestly, their method sounds a little sketchy. It's hard to imagine something they are claiming is so small being able to read such leakage from so far away. I should think you'd have to put your sensor directly on top of the CPU doing the decryption, and it would either need to be a very sensitive hall sensor (perhaps I didn't realize how materials science have advanced those these days?), a superconductor (LN2 cooling), or perhaps a very precisely made fractal antenna?

Actually, the reason bitcoin is not a solution to this problem is scalability. Bitcoin has not yet overcome the scalability requirements to service two billion people. If/When that changes, the price stability will come of its own accord because the number of people holding and using bitcoin will increase, this will increase the "inherent" value flow of the system and essentially dampen out what is now considered a "large" transaction between fiat/BTC.
scalability, scalability, scalability. Bitcoins future moon-shot (if it gets one) hinges on that and that alone. Everything good that we all want to come from this system rests on solving that problem and deploying a network that preserves what we love about current bitcoin, but is available to be used for daily transactions by billions of people.
If you want to know the future, watch what the people who code for this network say about future scalability improvements. I predict when they start deploying changes that allow 1000-5000 transactions per second, then real moon-shot time has come.

So individuals are incapable of digging up gold by themselves? No one ever farmed their own land? No one ever mined their own land? No one ever fished their own waters on their own boat?

@_date: 2015-03-07 18:59:41


That's actually entirely backwards. You want value to be created first, only then do you want that value entered onto the shared ledger we call "money". If you create "money" first, you're creating a deficit that must be made-up for on the backs of others. It is inherently anti-freedom, regardless of intent. The reason for this is that in order for that system to exist, you have to have someone in charge of creating currency to represent value that has not yet been created. The temptation of those in control of where the currency is created is simply too great to resist. It's like handing the chains to billions of slaves to a single person and expecting no evil to come from it. Eventually the system just starts borrowing from the unborn. If you create value first, you are not borrowing from anybody, and so entering that value into the shared ledger known as money creates no obligations on anyone.
But, this is actually beside the point.
The example was, in a debt-based money system, how do you pay back the first "dollar" borrowed into existence. The answer is you cannot without borrowing more. That's factually correct, even though it hides significant nuance.
If you or I simply created a new currency, and issued the first "dollar"... why would anyone want to use it? You just printed the first dollar, why the hell do I want it? I'm used to dealing with people in gold, silver, grain, cows, etc.. I'm used to dealing with exchanging value for value, so how are you going to convince me to use that dollar, it is worthless.
The answer is, you "promise" that you will redeem that dollar for a certain amount of "something". You tie your currency to a fixed asset, or an asset that can only grow with physical work that is in short supply. Gold was the standard for thousands of years. So, governments tied their currencies to gold. This worked just fine for a while. The problem started when individual banks (particularly in the U.S.) got greedy. In the U.S. with total freedom, the banks started issuing their own paper currencies/claim-checks on known value. They were allowed to loan out more than they had in assets, and people got smart about this. Bank runs were born. Rumors would spread that individual banks were not holding deposits in trust, they were loaning more than they had.
Banks were still doing good things. Holding deposits securely in trust is a valuable service. But given the freedom to print currency, banks do what any greedy person does, they attempt to make themselves more wealthy, to create money that ultimately has no matching value.
The banks do try to convince you that in order for the economy to grow, you need the ability to loan out money. This is a tempting argument, mostly because there is truth in the fact that a lending system does indeed help. But it is ultimately a falsehood because it presumes that all of the advances humanity created prior to banking cannot happen. It presumes that humans will not work to extract resources in order to create value themselves. This is simply wrong. Humans have always worked to better their environment/surroundings/lifestyle. In fact, there are still people today who live and improve themselves and their wealth without ever getting into debt.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:34:27
Let me understand something... you're on a bitcoin forum and you honestly believe that individual humans can't band together on their own and create world-changing advances without loans? You need to re-think your world-premises.

@_date: 2015-03-07 16:57:14
Your example is incorrect. Your example presumes that the bank had $1.00 to begin with. In fractional reserve lending, it only had $0.10, created $0.90 out of thin air, and expected $1.00 to be paid back with interest. This makes the customer in this case forced to create 90+% of the value of the loan, provided they can pay it back. If they can't then bank-ledger-presumed value is destroyed.
In such a system, with a certain expectation on money velocity, you must keep the new debt flow at a certain rate or (depending on economic conditions) old debt begins to be called in faster than new debt is created. The only endgame for such a system (unless it is literally balanced perfectly by god himself with matching value increase) is an ever-spiraling rise to deflationary collapse.
You are incorrect because you are presuming that debt is not being created at a faster rate than exchange-able value. The simple truth is that banks, including the central bank, all create debt far far far faster than they create currency. Hence the system can collapse onto itself and demolish a currency supply in very short order. This is known as a deflationary collapse and it's not theoretical, it's historical.
Mike's example was simple, but not incorrect in it's presumptions of what the system does and what can happen as a result.

47,000 is the theoretical limit of VISA, not their peak load. You're comparing theoretical peak of VISA to real-world peak of BTC, that's apples-and-oranges my friend. Read your sources again. You're still wrong. 
At 47,000 transactions per second, VISA would be transacting 4 billion transactions a day. Your math is so off you don't even realize it. 4 billion transactions a day? Half the worlds population uses VISA once a day? Are you insane?

Wiki says it can scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second.
Personally, I would prefer that TPTB in bitcoin move in that direction sooner rather than later. Better to have the capacity in preparation for any possible sudden moves by the world economy than to have a sudden shift in currency used and not be able to handle the load.

So, using your own link, the current average transaction size is:
* 0.00056049887 megabytes per transaction
* that times 4000 is 2.2 mb per second
* that times 60 is 134 mb per minute
* that times 60 is 8 gigabytes per hour
* that times 24 is 193 gigabytes per day.
So, who's lying here? 3 TB a day doesn't work by your own links and some simple math. You can correctly point out that there are problems to overcome, but you can't accuse others of being insane while lying yourself.

The dollar only has worldwide value because an alliance of ww2-era countries jumps whenever the U.S. decides it has to "prevent" someone from pricing oil (the real fuel of any economy on earth) in anything other than dollars.
See, gold is fine as a store of value. But the real commodity that every nation on earth *must have* in order to have any power on the world stage is cheap and portable energy. Oil has served as the "gold standard" in cheap and portable energy for over a hundred years now. So long as the U.S. and her allies can keep, by hook or by crook, some major link between oil and the dollar, the game goes on.

I'm not speaking of *when* and I'm not necessarily speaking of the *dollar*. I'm simply pointing out that if TPTB want bitcoin to eventually replace fiat, then it is important for the network to be able to scale *very quickly* because when fiat dies, it dies FAST.

What evidence is there that the velocity of money is at all controlled by anyone? There's no law, natural or otherwise, that tells people when or where they must spend the currency they have.
If you can say, for certain, that the velocity of money is stable and controlled, then your thinking has merit. Since the freedom to exchange value must include freedom in time, then such a system is exactly how Mike described it, impossible.
I think you understand all of this very well, 2007-2009 demonstrated this clearly. So, again, if your system relies on a narrow (and shifting) window for velocity to be maintained, your system is doomed and the debt can be presumed to not be able to be paid back.

The difference between AUD and USD is that one is a reserve currency and the other is not.
It is impossible to run a trade surplus and also issue a reserve currency. This is basic mathematics. If you are exporting more of your goods/services than you import, then you are importing the currency of the countries you export to. This results in a buildup of foreign currency in the trade surplus nation that is typically held as "reserve". More interestingly, since the transaction that involved a value exchange (goods for currency) did not involve your own currency, this effectively makes your currency less common, and hence less desirable for liquidity. Basically, if you're the one buying up everything, then everyone in the world has whatever paper you dish out, and the price discovery of your currency is well known, these two factors (and others) then combine to make your currency a world reserve currency.
Australia does not run trade deficits like the U.S. does. They do occasionally run deficits, but overall their plot straddles the zero-line much more than the U.S.
The U.S. is actively engaged in attempting to maintain preferred world reserve currency status. This means that they *MUST* run a trade deficit, or they effectively reduce demand for the USD worldwide. The demand for USD is a powerful economic/political tool that the powers that be generally do not want to give up.
So yes, the AUD is valued more directly on the value of Australia's exports vs imports (price discovery), whereas the USD is effectively a manipulated currency, manipulated for the purpose of maintaining worldwide reserve status.

There's cost/benefits to everything. I hear your fears, and it doesn't bother me because I know that the governments of the world are just going to make the standard banking system harder and less free in the years to come. Eventually, legitimate businesses will have no choice but to switch.
