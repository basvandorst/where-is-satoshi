An audience member asked about that. Evidently with the Braintree integration (for Paypal) you can use Coinbase for Uber. But Brian would love to setup a direct relationship as well.

I love Bitcoin and I think its killer application should be international money transfer.  BUT for me the math doesn't add up yet, specifically because there is some really good non-bank non-altcurrency competition in this market right now.
I primarily transfer UK-&gt;US for $4k. I used Natwest(UK)-&gt;HiFX.com-&gt;Chase(US) and Natwest didn't charge a fee, HiFX charged 2.7%, and Chase charged $15 because HiFX's 3rd partner used an international wire transfer in the US instead of a free US domestic ACH transfer.  So then I used Natwest(UK)-&gt;xe.com-&gt;ING/CapOne360(US) with only a 2.7% fee.  However, my friend just recommended transferwise.com and I just submitted a transfer with 0.86% total fee. Natwest(UK)-&gt;transferwise.com-&gt;ING/CapOne360(US).
Compare that with Bitcoin.  You have to get your money to the exchange, pay 0.2%-0.6% for fiat-&gt;BTC, then do the same 0.5-0.6% fee for BTC-&gt;fiat and local domestic transfer to your account.  That's nice and sounds like 0.7% total, but it all depends on which country you live in.  The key is that whenever you don't have an exchange in your country, you have to do an international transfer to get money into/out of an exchange, which sucks up the savings.
So in reality, UK-&gt;US for me would be Natwest 10GBP transfer to BitStamp, 0.5% EUR-&gt;BTC, 0.5% BTC-&gt;USD at campbx.com, and then ACH free transfer to my bank. (I usually see campbx prices lower than coinbase(+1%fee))
That might allow for some nice BitStamp/CampBx arbitrage to make the deal work, but right now they're only $2 different on price, so no advantage. Total cost = 1.25%.
Long-term, this means that for fiat-&gt;fiat transfers in the short/mid-term we would need more BTC exchanges so that there's one in every major country to reduce fees.  However, there's not enough fiat/BTC volume right now to support that many exchanges yet and thus why we don't have $7 exchanges/trades yet like the stock market.  
So right now, BTC exchange rates aren't yet competitive for pure fiat-&gt;fiat international transfer. We'll get there, though.

BTW, my USD/GBP exchange rate on transferwise.com (referral link:  was 1.6302 vs the current market rate of 1.6388.
