Yeah I’ve realized that now...

that was my tx. you link a different tx id or am i wrong?

I would but my electrum when I’m trying to replace the fee it only lets me max replace it by .0005 and that’s what you see in the second tx is that I supposedly double spent my coins now.

Yeah I definitely wasn’t paying attention. I have replace by fee but on electrum it isn’t allowing me to pay a lot for a fee.

Check my new post I listed a new tx I’d that is also the same amount. Why are there two?

When I do that even for a small amount like .003 btc to replace the fee or bump it as electrum calls it I get the error (cannot bump fee: could not find suitable outputs)
