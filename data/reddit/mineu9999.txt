Thank you so much, is there any article on how to do RBF with the bitcoin core wallet? Your help is much appreciated

This is not really true it's only the most valued because it was the first one. Asic resistance is better, POS is better. I'm not hating on bitcoin and it still has a lot to grow but there are alternatives 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:41:42
I understand your point of view, it comes from "When the shoe shine boys have tips the stock market is too popular for its own good" basically saying when everyone has advice its time to sell. But stocks aren't currencies, the whole point of bitcoin is for everyone to use it
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:49:59
You could, but it would have no value and no miners. So yes you can as long as only you control it. Would not be viable at all
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:37:36
Well it is a possible outcome regardless of your opinions. I hope it doesn't go with cash but it's not stupid to buy some cash just in case (i didn't but i did consider it)

Ok thanks, I'll make sure to read it in the morning

I can send money with vertcoin with half a cent transaction fees
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:09:36
Then there will be even more expensive Asic miners that make the cheaper ones not viable for the average consumer. Asic miners also require a place to have them constantly running and to have proper ventilation.
Here's a good resource on POS

Yes there is a lot going down such as Hurricane Irma, harvey, healthcare, debt ceiling etc. However simply using the arguement that it's "small potatoes" is ridiculous, otherwise many necessary laws won't exist today.

While I personally don't own the Trezor and have yet to received my ledger I'd recommend the ledger as it supports far more coins than just bitcoin if you do plan on going into altcoins in the future
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:03:28
He's right to an extent, there has been unprecedented growth in the past few months, stating that it'll always be green is ridiculous. Do i think there's going to be a crash? No not for at minimum 6 months. I am heavily invested in crypto, I'm just trying to be rational

Nate silver had a 71.4% chance of HRC winning and a 28.6% chance of trump winning, that's not that low of a chance so i don't really get what you're trying to prove, saying someone has a 30% chance of winning and they win is not implausible 
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:05:09
How does that make me fascist you retard? So do you have russian friends that are connected to the russian mafia, friends that have been tried (the case was dropped because the prosecution brought incorrect evidence not because he was acquitted and they are seeking a repeal) for money laundering 250,000,000. Also that was to prove that they were business partners and that I'm not making it all up, look up the dubious friends of donald trump the russians, it was done by a Netherlands news organisation so you can't claim fake news because it's MSM. Also just because its Wikipedia doesn't mean it's not true, if it is indeed not true then prove it

The cnn article had 49% HRC and 44% DT with a margin of error of 3.5, HRC got 48.2% of the vote and DT got 46.1%, how is that wrong. The wapo article is not using stats just using that as a headline so that's invalid and yeah huffington post is retarded. NYtimes said 15% to DT. The only reason why they didn't expect a win is because of the rust belt

Giving free housing is not communism (you don't seem to know the definition of communism), it's a socialist program. Europe is a mixed market economy with capitalism and socialism (in terms of healthcare, education and housing)
Now where did I mention CNN, please look at my above post and pinpoint the exact area where I mentioned CNN
And also you seem to miss my point, they are treating them the exact same way as other convicts in Sweden (also the jihads are Swedish citizens in the first place, not foreign born it says returning in the article), they are not getting any other benefits over other people in their class the independent article you linked me too proves this.
Also regarding your point with murderers, yes obviously no shit there actions were horrendous but they get punished, serve there time and are let back into society. The death penalty doesn't exist in most countries (nor should it, it's cruel and also risks killing innocent people) and simply leaving them in jail for their entire life is too expensive, that is why Norway and Sweden focuses ob Rehabilitation rather than punishment, a system that has proven to work time and time again. This is why criminals there are entered into programs that help them find housing etc. You can disagree with it even though it does work but those terrorists are being treated the same as every other murderer in the country so using it as a form of attack in a situation like this is stupid because everyone (who has committed such a high crime, regardless of religion etc). The independent article states "Local authority says jihads will be treated similarly to criminals and neo-Nazis". Also they are as it states in the article RETURNING Swedish citizens, obviously if they are foreign born they will be deported this is why my rehabilitation point matters, you can't simply deport them from their own country and all matters of a crime would and should be investigated for the safety of citizens.
You can read more about it here: 
Now onto your other points
Yes they are from a warzone, unless you don't classify Syria, Iraq and Libya as a warzone. This goes into my point on the war on terror, the US and other western governments toppled governments in Libya and Iraq leading to the situation they are in now, now it could've happened anyway because of the Arab spring but it would've there would be no where near the extent of Terrorist attacks in Western countries if we didn't infiltrate their countries since we wouldn't have been bombing their houses and killing innocent civilians (hence why the war on terror increased terrorist attacks  especially in the west)
On to your point about nazis, this just makes no sense whatsoever. Your simultaneously comparing every german (in the 1940s I know), every Nazi soldier and all arabs and muslims to see some connection. Once again not all muslims are terrorists or agree with the crimes of other muslims and the vast majority are against them.
On to you calling me a communist, I was right you do think I am one even though I'm far from one (also communism makes no sense, if you called me a socialist i see where you are coming from since i support some socialist programs but communism is really different). Also on to giving stuff to refugees in the first place, if you do think are society is so much better than shouldn't you be spreading our way of life and what makes you such a moral person if you'd be fine sending them back to Syria where their house could've been blown up or someone is out to kill them

I think you're forgetting that when senators and members of the house are not in DC they are still working on legislation. Also bills are passed most day that you would apply the same logic too, but the media loves the drama of the debt ceiling and healthcare whereas most bills passed lack this drama

Go onto GDAX or coinbase (both are owned by the same company but GDAX has no fees but a not so simple UI) deposit money into the site and buy bitcoins. Make sure you downloaded a wallet such as Exodus to transfer the funds too. You can then sign up to an exchange such as Bittrex and transfer your bitcoin for some altcoins if you feel adventurous

Ok ik you love trump but how do you seriously believe this? Trump has made his wealth from dealing with banks such as deutsche bank and russian banks since no one on wall street deals with him since he had a terrible reputation. Plus he's 71
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:14:24
Ok so he was in a financial crisis in the late 80s early 90s, no wall street bank would lend him money for his projects so he goes to deutsche bank and other russian banks to get money for his buildings. That's why it matters
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:15:11
No, literally no one on wall street lent trump money look it up

Good luck suing banks privately, most people would go bankrupt 
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:08:53
You don't get it do you, it's not that he has a russian friend or two. It's their backgrounds, how they keep popping up, how multiple surrogates have had contact with them, how there is evidence they interfered in the election (this is without a doubt even if trump had nothing to do with it)

Breitbart..... Breitbart..... The most untrustworthy news source of all time, breitbart under no circumstance should be used as a source in an arguement.
Also sweden has a different justice system than the US, it focuses on rehabilitation into society rather than punishment (it's actually working far better than the alternative). I say good, you don't kill a hateful ideology (being a jihad or being a murderer) with violence, the same way the war on terror increased terrorist attacks seven fold. If you want to change these people into being good citizens you don't banish them. Also in the link you provided it even says they are treating them the same as other criminals and neo nazis so you must be equally outraged over that? No? (BTW those 2 quotes are not from that article)
In europe unemployed locals do get housing (if they don't have it already), there is usually a waiting list but they do get it.
Yes what happened in Germany was horrendous but judging someone for the crime of others is also horrendous and wanting people to be sent back to a warzone is terrible as well. Both you and I have gone off topic. Well I just crushed your "anti Communist propaganda" not that I'm communist, but you probably think I am because you're you

How quickly will i see a return? And pull it out right away? Unless you are planning to day trade why would you invest in something that you were only planning to have for a day. Bitcoin has a lot of room to grow so yes you can just leave it or you can watch it and try out altcoins (I'd recommend vertcoin, litecoin, WTC, NEO and Ethereum however the ethereum price action is stagnant currently because of ICOs). Investing can go both ways, if you don't want to actively manage your investment you don't have to however you should go for safer picks (bitcoin, ethereum) but if you want to actively manage it you'd have to keep on top of the news (r/cryptocurrency is quite good). Only invest what you can afford to loose and do your own research.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:02:47
If you look at the sites and look at the data most polls were within the margin of error. Giving them a % chance is mostly their opinion, and no the NYT did give a 15% chance to DT and the data did show HRC winning  and they did get the popular vote right as well and also why are we on this, the fact of the matter is regardless too election night, he's still a terrible president that seems like an idiot at times

That being said, if war breaks out do you want gold or bitcoin? Obviously this is extreme but they are not in direct competition, gold will always be high valued and it's a physical asset rather than a digital one
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:50:41
There's life after war. I'm just stating, there is a benefit to have a physical good, it's better than keeping money in the bank. Also it's exaggerated

i think you dont understand. That comment was made 4 years ago when bitcoin was like 100 euro. Thanks man
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:34:14
Yeah your mentality is the same as my dad. In comparison to his other assets I've been trying to get him to buy more but to no avail. But the way I'm looking at is that most of the money I'm investing in Bitcoin is just saved up over the years as I haven't had a job yet (I do plan to get one so thats why most of my money is going towards bitcoin as i would bee more annoyed if it reached 10k and i didn't invest then i would be if i did invest and it went to 0). I do owe a lot of my interest in starting to invest to my dad but he has a stock portfolio and i think there iis much more money to be made in crypto then in stocks
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:22:26
Yeah i do fully intend to go into the technology as i am quite interested in it however with tests etc i cant do that for 3 weeks. I'm planning to buy the bitcoin today and so is my dad. Thanks for everything

Ok so i haven't invested in bitcoin yet (Im 16 and when i first heard of it i wasn't allowed because i was too young, i would have made 20k....) should i invest now or not. Thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:41:32
Thanks for the help. I understand the technology a bit but not great. This is my first time hearing about the split i only saw it as UASF before and just ignored it. On august first I'm well aware to not have bitcoins in the exchanges (coinbase im using) at all because its not a guarantee you get them back but when it splits into the 2 different coins what do i do and what signs will show if its going to be bad/good? Sorry for the questions just a bit confused
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:27:51
Well you see i first heard about bitcoin when i was 12. It was around 100 euro a bitcoin then. I asked my dad if i could buy a few bitcoins and told him he should invest a good bit in it as well. He replied "Im not taking financial advice from my 12 year old son" and that was that. Then i told him to buy it again a few months ago when it was 900 just before the rapid increase and he said he just doesn't understand it. He's regretting it now considering hes buying some with me today. Yeah i understand that mentality with people my age but my dad does take investing pretty seriously and wanted me to buy stocks for a while.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:32:35
I do know a good bit more about stocks then i do about cryptocurrency but I think the US stock market is more unpredictable at the moment not only because of Quantitative Easing but the current political climate. If I was to buy stocks I'd invest in the German markets for  the long run anyway. I do plan to do more research on it. Thanks
