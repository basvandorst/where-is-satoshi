Is exchange account address and deposit account address in the same wallet (BitGo wallet) or this are different wallets entirely? u/zanetackett

You've made my day :)

Run it with:
Bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=yourdatadir (e:/bitcoin - for me)
if you have problems beacuse of not using deafault directories but custom ones for blockchain data(for example with bootstrap.dat - torrent blockchain data) 
If we want more people to use bitcoins we should make bitcoin-qt more user friendly in terms of synchronizing with blockchain.
I just spent 15 minutes of my time to google out and remind myself how to use blockchain data from my local drive instead of downloading everything again (5 years of data).

Rember, TREND IS YOUR FRIEND!

TO THE MOON!!!!

And is the problem many newcomers have.  You have to wait now till it sync, you can download data through torrent though to make it faster. I wonder how many  people just end they bitcoin adventure here, beacuse wallet is synchronizing too long. In my opinion Bitcoin Core (bitcoin-qt) should not be suggested as the first wallet on bitcoin.org. It confuses too many people and they give up.

imo it will confirm, but it will take some time, 24h max from my experience
@_date: 2014-11-10 07:20:21
Yep, I voted for it couple days ago.

the most important factor at the moment in my opinion is that dollar gains strength a cross the whole globe!

Dunno, but imagine what will happen with the price, when someone will sell MTgox btc  to pay back in fiat money :)

Works like a charm -&gt; Tip delivery bug :( But I'm sure it will be fixed ;)
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:06:21
Hi, why did you change your name?
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:41:00
Hi ;)
@_date: 2015-05-14 07:23:58
I've been waiting for this for a long time. Now I can show my appreciation in a very easy and funny way. I listen to soundcloud almost all the time I sit in front of my PC and sometimes a track can makes me feel really good :) Now I can say "THANKS" in a way that actually matters for the artist I think :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:42:21
You might be right, but I think this link is legit too:
Anyway I plan do ChangeTip them on Sunday via Twitter:) Imagine a lot of tweets with tips being shown on polish tv whole Sunday long. This can really attract some attention.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:22:07
They have twitter too:
so spread some change there via ChangeTip ;)
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:53:16
Thx, updated :)
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:14:22
Oh, you are right, I forgot, I mean unconfirmed of course ;) How many unconfirmed transaction were waiting at some peek in BTC history.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:58:23
Do you know what was the biggest amount of UTXOS ever? Peaked at 12k+
@_date: 2015-07-11 04:21:06
No fundamental there? How about that: 
P&amp;D for sure, but this might just be a START for this rollercoaster :)

KRAKEN could also switch pricing methods from BTCLTC to LTCBTC for example, this way I can compare prices to other exchanges without any calculations. Please, consider this KRAKEN, thank you.

I think the only ones that will get those coins are miners. They can create their own transactions with those inputs and add them to the blockchain with 0 miner fees. This seems really viable for me.

This is huge actually. Many young nerds can now see 1$ or "cookie" being tipped in a chat room. This service can become the biggest place for ChangeTip a specially when a streame would be advertising tips on stream what may actually happen. Donations are very popular on Twitch and tipping is so much easier in my opinions. Just let some big streamers see advantages of it ;)

It sounds very good. The think is I would really like T-Mobile to actually see some use of this. Since I am from Poland, here is my idea:
Buy some of those codes and private message them to me if you feel like trusting me. I will fund a new mobile phone number with those codes and send sms messages to charitable organizations like:
I can pick an organization myself or you could suggest one to me. How about that? :)

This is great, because installing wrong Berkeley DB confuses a lot. Have one free donut @_date: 2015-03-05 08:36:16
Interesting, there should be something like "white listing" sender address, so some emails would be forwarded without charging for them.
@_date: 2015-10-17 10:09:08
imo related
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:52:19
And as we see with 3 up front it is multsig address :) Interesting way to combine keys from different coins.
@_date: 2015-10-17 08:32:56
Maybe Chinese/investors there want to escape with their assets outside of China. BTC looks perfect for this.
Remember that Goldman Sachs and Circle started working together to help Chinese use other currencies. In my opinion it all fits perfectly for such scenario. Something big might be coming in China. Big boys are working hard here ;)
