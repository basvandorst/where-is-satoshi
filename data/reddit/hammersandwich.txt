No company of this size will be frightened about volatility on a tertiary payment option. They will have good enough in-house money managers to profit from volatile price moves. Same with Steam "protecting users from high fees". Not convincing, tbh. 
Id guess it is something to do with managing tax exposure. It must be a complex process completing tax declarations for orgs of this size. They probably want to close the window during tax season, so they can be sure of exact profits and offset then accordingly.

Exactly, they have offset measures. One of the reasons I don't see the volatility as a convincing reason for stopping payments. But they have to know their tax exposure at least a little in advance, so I wouldn't be surprised if this was just big orgs drawing a line under their 2017 crypto takings, and restarting later in the year. Just speculation, obviously. But the reasons given are unconvincing to me.

Finally. If there is one thing we all need, it's another way to give politicians free money.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:44:43
While that's true, it is all but impossible for a large, high volume market to remain volatile. 
If bitcoins are valued at (eg)$1mn each, then current 10% swings become 0.1% swings. That's still nice profit for whales, but if you're buying groceries in Satoshi amounts, it is suddenly a much more stable proposition.

This is a different issue for me. You are looking at this wholly from the customer experience: "I want to buy in BTC. Amazon can do this tomorrow, if they cash out into fiat immediately, and price everything in dollar values with a spot conversion to BTC at point of sale."
I am thinking of a situation where Amazon does NOT cash out into fiat, but runs their whole logistical operation on crypto. Because that is when it becomes important.
If you just want the end-user experience of spending BTC and getting Amazon products in return, I'm sure you could find one site that sells gift cards for BTC that isn't a scam. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 09:44:49
Amazon has incredible logistical efficiency and operates on some really tight margins. That cannot work if they start making sales with such a volatile currency. At the barest minimum they would have to update their price in bitcoin prices every ten minutes, at least.
Also they can't risk customers playing "market arbitrageur" and holding off making a purchase until their currency has crashed. They need constant, consistent, predictable sales volumes.
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:35:25
Amazon runs on predictable, consistent sales. Their logistics are not built to support feast-and-famine sales. Volatile currencies create spikes and troughs in sales that Amazon does not want to enable. It's not simply about cashing out a "losing" amount into fiat.

I'm more than aware that Max is a propagandist for many things - and AGAINST countless others. But that doesn't alter that he was amongst the first broadcast professionals to get on to BTC. 
Also, I never understood the idea that this style of partial, propagandised media coverage should never be used by "the good guys". Like it's ok for mainstream media to call it "a virtual currency used by cartels to launder drug money", but it's not all right to combat that with overhype and sensationalist promises of the moon. 
One balances the other. Understanding that the status quo is just as rabid and irrational as Max is when in full flow - but in the opposite direction - is step one to realising why so many are in such a stinking mess right now.

This is 'buy to a thousand' type news. Seriously - I'm not even going to waver until we reach 1200 previous high after reading this. Here's a guy who is on-board in a big way and is actively looking for ways to make our 100k-per-coin Moonbase a reality.
Also: he won THE LOT. I would not be surprised if he bid a high flat fee across the board, of a thousand or more.
@_date: 2014-06-15 13:08:45
Soooo... the Feds are planning on selling BTC to the BTC community in large volumes and this will drive down the price. And your idea is for the BTC community to club together and buy our BTC at a higher price than we could get them for, thereby handing the Feds a whole lot more money than they would have got....
Why wouldn't we just buy them as low as they will go, and then hold until arrival at Moon Base 1?

Not accurate. I bought my first BTCs on Intersango (lol) on Xmas eve 2011, having been hearing about them for months on end from M&amp;S on their Truth About Markets show. At the very latest, they were in already by the first few months of 2011, but my hazy memory makes me think it was 2010 they first talked about nearly killing a computer by trying to mine. 
Either way, I bought my first coins for about $2.50 each, and have Max and Stacy solely to thank for my investment decision. 
They have been good for bitcoin awareness and uptake, no question.

It's a great infographic.... if you already know everything on there. As an entry into understanding BTC, you will lose newcomers at the first caption.
A good rule for making infographics/flows is that every node should generate more answers than questions. Right away you are thinking on this one: "What's a "wallet? How does a wallet work? How far do I have to read before they explain wallets?"
It's a good reference sheet though.

When you mine bitcoins like Gary does, you're too wealthy to give a damn about your conformist "pants".

Soundbites, my man. BBC only deals in soundbites these days, sad though that is to admit. Make bold, positive statements: 
"In many ways the battle is already over: we now have major retailers and online payment services &lt;like Paypal&gt; looking for ways to not compete with bitcoin, but to utilise it and make their own services more appealing."
"People have learned from bitter experience that we have to treat business dealings conducted behind closed doors with suspicion. The beauty of bitcoin is that every transaction is transparent and out in the open."  (&lt;&lt;&lt;touches a nerve for every football fan post "Qatargate".)
"Bitcoin is not about 'beating the banks'; it's about helping the banks to operate in a way that people want them to."
Always positive, always smiling. Bitcoin is your shiny happy future. It's your handsome new boyfriend who drives a Porsche. It's everybody's favourite sports team all winning at the same time.

a 30,000 sell wall at $300 is a pretty strong indicator that someone wants to buy 50,000 BTC.
But that they only want to pay $100 for each.
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:12:51
Spoiler: you don't need to actually dump your entire sell wall to drive down prices.

Thinking about it, does 'paying a ransom' count as sending money to known criminals, for the purposes of Know Your Customer (KYC)? Would an exchange reject your membership application if it were obvious you were joining to pay a ransom?

Okay, I know not to judge a research paper based on filleted soundbites lifted from it and used in mainstream media. But it does sound a lot like "People bought whenever the price went down".
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:24:17
Like I say, it's not worth judging a paper by a news article, but it says exactly what I said: "tether was used to buy bitcoin at key moments when it was declining, which helped "stabilize and manipulate" the cryptocurrency's price."
I mean, who cares at this stage? All open markets are susceptible to manipulation by monopolies and whales. It'd be childish to think people don't try to game crypto. But by its nature, bitcoin is more difficult and more costly to fix the price of than any fiat.

This has long been my opinion. People will chuckle about that dead ol' bitcoin while spending Sats from a mobile app. 
The only thing we need to do is to change the name Satoshi to Credits. Anyone with any appreciation of speculative fiction knows the world's next global currency is the 'Cred'.

In the previous crashes, a relatively high proportion of hodlers had bought in early and even an 80% crash left a whole lot of profit that was basically free money if you'd bought in sub-$10. 
Nobody *preferred* BTC at $200, compared to BTC at $1,200. But relatively few people lost money either way. The ultimate support price in 2013 was still about zero.
These days, there are comparatively more hodlers who have bought in high. They will hold rather than sell for a loss.
Also, I would disagree with the earlier suggestion that it is the people who are here to speculate on prices who are the "smart money" any more. There is big investment and entrepreneurial interest in blockchain tech now. Currency trading is now a very primitive use of your bitcoin.

The mistake here is thinking the time periods are fractals that are going to steadily grow. The 2013-14 dip was unusually protracted due to a series of 'black swan' events. Gox went down, Silk Road was busted, DPR's treasure trove was slowly auctioned off by the US government. All of these were timed to depress bitcoin's growth over a sustained period.
We have had nothing like that this time around. This graph just looks for patterns on its own graph, then extrapolates them.
