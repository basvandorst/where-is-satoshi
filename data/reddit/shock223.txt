The NSA in all honesty is pumping them out by the truckload. 
What? You think that massive complex was mining your data? we don't need to, we got facebook/linkin/google for that shit. That entire story was cover for the greatest bitcoin mining operation of all time. 
and yes, that was a joke.

currently dropping to 96-94 which given the history of the bitcoin, I pegged the actual price at low 80s-high 70 usd. 
Meh just waiting for the rise now.

In all honesty, I would hold off on buying them. Historically, the bitcoin has hovered around 20-30 dollars and only has swelled to 80-90 in recent days due to the EU acting up again. Unless it stays up there for a few months (enough for vendors to supply the price with real value), the price bubble will eventually drop into the 10 dollar range before getting back at the actual value of 20-30 dollar range. 
Starting to see bitcoin less of a currency and more of a commodity really.

considering banks have no problems in dealing with [mexican cartels]( I highly doubt that is the case.
