The fiat value of the transaction fee swings by more than that in the time it takes to sign a transaction.

Because "salt" also refers to a major component of Bitcoin-style cryptography, the opportunity to market a bespoke-type Bitsalt to us seems rather salient.

Keep it in the box and hope it gains value as an historical artifact.

Everything tastes better when you pay for it with *the future*.

If this could be translated into Hungarian, it would be very clear. It'd be nice if you're correct!

"a" is ambiguous -- it can mean a "single/particular" or it can mean "any". This is *dei rei* vs. *dei dicto*. E.g. All the students read a book. a) That book was To Kill a Mockingbird; or b) They could choose which book to read.
Some languages make this distinction with two separate morphemes, but English just uses one, "a". Usually the interpretation in a legal document is spelled out somewhere (else).

"Tortuous" means "winding", but your point still stands.

A kudos to you for doing this. It really takes the mystery out of the process. I'd also love to see a non-electric, mechanical Bitcoin miner -- how steampunk would that be?

This reads like a high school essay. The provocative title is followed by sophomoric text, and I stop reading when a writer tells me to "think about it".

Yes, like gary_rowe suggests, it's more of a milestone for the ISO/banking system.
I don't see why Bitcoin needs to move away though.

This is probably true for the *vocal* Bitcoin community.

I don't think you can do that in a single instance, but you can duplicate pool entries to divvy up mining power by using Load Balanced: 2 Slush entries + 1 backup gives Slush 2/3 of your shares.

It sounds like this would threaten the jobs of bankers who are not also cryptographers (and those who are probably work at Google instead). 
How is Bitcoin represented in the curricula of public and higher education? I couldn't find a Bitcoin-centric course being offered anywhere. Are tomorrow's money handlers talking about this in class?

I love a good doubles match: Grover/Shor vs. Lamport/Merkle. I've got my money on the latter, but only as much as I'm willing to lose.

I blame my mother. Make sure that if your hat spills BTC when it tips they go to SeansOutpost!

The original article confuses the company with the currency. This is either naïve or deceptive journalism.

Will OP deliver? (couldn't resist)
I was just thinking today about how it's probably not very pragmatic (yet) to give BTC to a homeless person. This makes much more sense currently. I hope we can make too much work for you!

Even if you get it too late to generate much profit, the device itself could increase in value as a landmark historical token.
