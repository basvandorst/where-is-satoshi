My company has done about 1.5 million pages of fax this month so far.  Fax is alive and well in finance and healthcare. 
In fact our volume grew like 18% in the last 12 months.
I'm not saying it SHOULDN'T be replaced - I'm saying it hasn't been.
Sure, for the guy who used to send 2 faxes a year, fax doesn't even exist any more except as a distant memory.  Don't let your personal anecdote generate your statistics.

Stupid title.  Fax machines were not/are not being replaced by the internet.  
"Fax machines make the case that they are safer and faster than a scanner + email"
Or something.
A sarcastic bad analogy...
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:27:37
And... I own a bunch of bitcoin - I'm not an enthusiast, but a medium term investor.  I make maybe 1 bitcoin transaction a month for real-world services or goods.
This was just a stupid analogy. Fax is NOT being replaced by the internet.  It is slowly being replaced cameras/scanners and email.  
"The Internet" has a few other services besides smtp, carrying pictures of documents.  For example, the bitcoin peer-to-peer network...

Some people sold, but... at the same exact moment, someone also bought.  Shrug.
@_date: 2018-08-28 04:34:06
I realize that this is probably most of the cause.  I am subscribed to n but I don't just browse it generally.  It seems like the ONLY posts that make it into my feed are these same stupid memes over and over.  Perhaps those of us that aren't in negative positions in BTC just don't feel strongly enough to bother posting?  I don't know.  I'm just a bit frustrated.
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:10:04
I'm not complaining about their purchases.  I'm just tired of the endless 'Woe is me!' memes that are here every day.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:18:37
I don't need it.  I have btc, I spend btc.  Sometimes I buy more btc with other currencies.  Shrug.
@_date: 2018-08-28 04:35:38
There isn't a particular price that would make me stop buying (and selling), but there are other factors that may.  "price right now" is a poor metric for that kind of decision.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:05:17
Why is it that ONLY people who bought at 17K+ are posting here?  Like every day, there is at least one post about how terrible the exchange rate to USD is.  Over and over, meme after meme.  Is this really the only interesting thing about Bitcoin to discuss?  
Could the probably-small-but-too-vocal minority of people who are in a large negative position please please stop making memes for a week or two?  Thanks.

Is the likelihood of both copies of the wallet going bad and/or being destroyed by fire, theft, flood, etc higher or lower than buying dedicated wallet hardware as suggested by other people here?
I would suggest that the 5-year recovery chances I have with my two usb sticks is better than using dedicated wallet hardware, which a) may also fail, and b) costs quite a bit more to be redundant.  
The long term-obsolescence of my solution is better also.
I do need to rewrite my data completely, and occasionally move to a new device.  Which I can do and have done cheaply.

Encrypted bitcoin-qt wallet on an encrypted filesystem on a usb stick in a safety-deposit box.  
Plus a backup copy of that file-system on a different stick, stored in a family member's safe.
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:01:43
In my case the whole stick isn't encrypted - it is fat32, with a file that  I mount as a filesystem (and it's encrypted).  I will likely take your advice to make multiple copies of this  file-on-fat32-that-is-a-filesystem.  I have a script that I use to mount/unmount/backup/etc so I will likely just have it make 500 or more of my file, after unmount.  I already keep a copy of the previous version.  
As for cloud...  I confess to being uneasy.  dropbox? google-drive? scp to a vps I have to a shell account somewhere?  None of those inspire me.  Yes, there are a couple of layers of encryption but... I have enough btc that I do need to be careful.  
The other issue here is that I have to keep authentication credentials somewhere.  Paper, keypass, etc - not just my head.  My spouse would have no possible way to get to this non-trivial btc if I didn't keep a couple copies of the passwords, and some general instructions elsewhere, separate from the encrypted file. Fortunately I have a couple of trusted family members that also understand and are enthusiastic about BTC.  So my spouse has access to the credentials and there are enough instructions to get access to the BTC if I were hit by a bus.
I'll have to think about cloud... hm.
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:55:44
Agree to both recommendations.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:00:26
I understand why you're suggesting both dropping the encryption, and writing many copies...  Both increase the likelyhood that a few bytes of corruption don't render my wallet unrecoverable.
BIP32 looks interesting though I didn't know it existed before now.
I've been sticking with bitcoin-qt because it is the standard reference - and will more likely have forwards-compatibility than some other bitcoin software.
From this list,   or from elsewehre, what software do you think has a good chance of not being abandonware in 5 years?
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:11:21
I understand.  I just dont think you've ever had to deal with software obsolescence very much.
I have VCDs of home movies that I made early in my adulthood that every piece of hardware I own can no longer read, and almost no piece of software.  The only software that I could actually get to read it PROPERLY was ffmpeg, by forcing particular bit-rates and aspect-ratios.  I thought surely quicktime or VLC would be able to handle the MPEG2 files out of the box... but no.  I picked the wrong format for long-term storage, by picking something that was currently popular and relatively new.  I didn't loose everything, but it was a giant PITA to recover that stuff.
I can tell you several other stories about "popular" software and file formats that become virtually unusable/unreadable in less than a decade.  Dont get me started on recovering AMIPRO files.
Anyway, I understand that it is "clunky" and that there may be better options out there right now.  I am not yet convinced to abandon what already works for me, which I have reasonable confidence will continue working for a good while.

So what you appear to be saying is that you want to live in your society, get benefits from it, but not pay the associated costs?
Do you also oppose paying taxes?
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:33:15
As a society we all need to participate.  If he doesn't like his local laws, then he should work to change them.  He's not a slave - he is a member of a society that decided that spending time serving others is important.  
There are a bunch of benefits to Austria's system, and we can debate those if you want, but he is definitely NOT a slave.  Calling him a slave trivializes the real plight of actual slaves.
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:05:27
The only way laws in a society can work is the (eventual) threat of violence.  
Don't pay your parking ticket?  you get a fine - dont pay the fine?  you get a bigger one .  Don't pay that?  You might get a bench-warrant issued for your arrest.  Or you might get a lean placed on a property of yours, or get your car repo'd etc.  For some people, not all, escalated punishments, up to and including physical detention (and beyond) are a major factor in why they behave in social (as opposed to anti-social) ways.
Does that mean the laws, or the punishments are perfect? no - they're made by fallible creatures called humans.  It's still better than the alternatives.
TL;DR - you can't have a working society without laws, and laws dont work without the (eventual) threat of violence.
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:40:45
The guy with the forced service option in this thread has plenty of options in his life that A) avoid the service entirely, and B) don't involve violence.
Sure, they might be net-negatives compared just doing the service, but there are options.
Calling it slavery, and calling it "being forced to work at gunpoint" are hyperbolic arguments that don't help convince anyone to change the law.  If you want to change the law, do things that will effectively change it rather than present sensationalized arguments that will have little or no effect on public opinion.
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:08:35
I never said the system was perfect - but would you care to suggest something better?  people have been trying for a long time to come up with something that works better...  You have pointed out some negatives to current societies, without suggesting working alternative.
I personally don't need the state to force me to be involved in my community, or to serve others, in some ways at least - though I do admit to being selfish in many ways...
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:37:04
Move permanently to another country.  Create a new identity and live under a new identity elsewhere.  Go into hiding.  Commit some crime and get put in prison for that other crime.  Any of those options would get you out of your service.
Like I said - you have options - just not ones that are better than just doing the service.  That other guy is saying that it is like someone is LITERALLY pointing a gun at your head and forcing you to work.  This is not the case.  You are not a slave and could easily make a life for yourself elsewhere in many other places.  I'm not suggesting you do that - the difference in cost is crazy - the 9 months or year is clearly the easier path.

A way that I strongly think is better than Anarcho-Capitalism.  
My personal feeling is that human nature simply wont allow Anarcho-Capitalism to work.  It seems like a great idea, but .... people.... 
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:10:19


What was the percentage of men over 25 who had done the service?  I imagine that many of them found that there were unexpected long-term benefits to their service.  I don't know what the stats are but I wouldn't be surprised if a majority of over 30 men voted to keep it too.
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:30:35
I think that the world is a better place when people focus on helping others.  Sure, taking care of yourself is important, but we're all better off if we look out for each other.
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:26:27
I'm not mincing words - I'm disagreeing with your premise that he is working at gunpoint.
He's not working at gunpoint.  Sure - there will be negative consequences to not doing the service, but there are options that don't end in violence.
Like I said elsewhere - living in a society is not perfect, but it is better than the alternative.  Yes, we all have limits placed on us by the societies we live in.  No, it's not slavery.
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:48:44
You are doing a great thing for your society though.  Focus on the positive.
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:28:46
Rather than debate and refute your points, I'll just say that you and I have vastly different opinions on several things:
* On how existing and hypothetical societies work
* On how what is or is not practical and possible in the long term given the existing real-world-constraints
* On the the morals and basis of rules of behavior of societies (e.g. laws)
* Whether it can be ethical for there to be externally imposed limits on a person's behavior
Possibly also we differ on:
* What is the "greatest good"?
* What can be achieved even on a small scale,  when taking into account how individual humans act in a society
&lt;more but I'm out of time...&gt;
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:16:14
Neither type of society would last long because some other differently aligned political group of people would conquer it via violence.

Your shopping cart didn't like my email address for some reason.  PM me for details if you want them....  I was in the step where you enter name/shipping-address/email address and then click 'Continue to Shipping method'.  I get returned to this page with the email box highlighted in red, with my valid email address in it, with the text under saying "Please enter a valid email address"
EDIT:  seems to have something to do with having the 'save for next time' box checked on that page.
