These guys gave much of their professional lives to Bitcoin. Working hard at it everyday, so you can enjoy the benefits and rewards. Everybody here owes them a great deal.
No, running a node and passing out BTC stickers is not on the same level as these guys.
They tried something bold and admitted to have made a mistake, how great is that.
Everybody should forgive them and move on (...to the moon).
FYI: I opposed SegWit2X

This is great! Great work :)

I just hope the bitcoin hackers don't have huge amounts of GPU power all bundled up in pools, and specifically built rigs to calculate hashes and unencrypt all the hashed passes. 
Ooh wait a minute...

If bitcoin is a regular means of payment, exchange entry and exchange exit are not part of the process.
**Anonymous bitcoin wallet X &gt;&gt; Anonymous bitcoin wallet Y**
 
End of transaction.
Untracebility could also partially be achived with:
**Anonymous bitcoin wallet X^1 &gt;&gt; Anonymous bitcoin wallet X^2  &gt;&gt; Anonymous bitcoin wallet Y^2  &gt;&gt; Anonymous bitcoin wallet Y^1**
  
End of transaction.
There is no central registry of wallets and corresponding names. But the wallets you do business with, offcourse are known to other parties.

I thought of this while contemplating about the set number of bitcoin in the world eventually being 21mil. When people die and bitcoins die with them, the 21mil will never be in the market. Allready there have to be a lot of BTC lost forever. If arrangements are not made to pass them allong to next of kin, all BTC will eventually slowly get lost in encryption of wallets. (like a asymptotic graph reaching zero)
On a personal level, how to pass them along?
On a greater level: 
Is this a realistic concern for BTC in general?
If yes, How to effectivly combat this?
Very curious about your insights, reddit.

That harddrive could possibly be recovered/repaired. I hope you didn't throw it out.
A lot of errors in HDs are partition tables being scrampled, or connectivity hardware giving out (like a light bulb). More often than not, the data is (partialy) recoverable.

Right you are. They are clearing some things on [twitter](

In my opinion this is very insecure. Someone with a (telelens) camara could steel your key from across the street.
 
A lot of ATM fraud is done by "over the shoulder looking". The QR code being that big on the screen and or on the ticket just made that easy, so it seems.
Love the concept of the machine though. But it needs usability work.

I think this will be a lot easier, if we keep to the metric way of counting BTC. (Like a lot of commenters suggested.)
 
A couple of commenters point out, that that sounds complicated, but I think it will be easily adapted by countries that already use the metric system. And it is already a agreed upon standard for lots of measurements.
[Wikipedia on Metric Prefixes](
That would mean calling it "Millibitcoin" or mBTC. 
"Millibits" as suggested, sounds cool, and could perhaps become a slang for mBTC (Like "a buck" is for a dollar), but using a worldwide standard seems like the way to go.

I know about Ripple. Not know the details though. The most important argument not to use Ripple seems to be missing here.
  
If it is really true you dont own the bitcoins on your PC (but own a debt). They dont need all the bitcoins to be available on all the accounts. Because not all the Bitcoins will be spent / accessed at once.
They could easily operate with only 90% of even less of the bitcoins inside their system. 
  
This is a model modern banks also use, and have been using for ages. A avarage bank has 10% or less of the money that is in the accounts of its creditors. This is not necessarily a bad thing when managed correctly. But it is totally against bitcoins basic principles.

Well as long as you got the MySQL creds. You should better make a backup of their database. In case something might happen to it...

FYI: They accidentally all the emails at once. So now the website is down with everybody confirming their order (or at least trying). I got a quick look when logged in before load error from cloudflare. I didn't see any confirm button.

This talk shows great functions in bitcoin covering things like this. Thanx.

Thank for your reply, I regularly visit this sub, but still must have missed it. Looking it up right now.

Well I guess you have something to do tomorrow. My advice is to really read up on the subject, or get a pro on board.
You might get the BTC back! If you want to know more about starting with this, send me a PM (will not charge a thing, would just like to help out a fellow BTCer). 
Best of luck!
