Bitcoin only contributed to only 1% of Overstock's monthly revenue, which just happens to be one of Bitcoin's largest merchant and that is the evidence you are using to dispute Forbes' "useless" claim? 
Besides, I thought your *challenge* was that you were going to dispute the claims of any leading economist, but so far all you have done is focus on the word "useless", and you haven't successfully disputed that claim either. 
I think it's fair to say you failed your own challenge. Sorry, bro. Maybe next time.

Naked short selling is NOT illegal. Some aspects were controlled after 2008, but naked short selling is still a legal activity.

Now this is getting aggravating. You clearly did not read the lengthy explanation in under 3 minutes, and therefore stopped after the first sentence missing one of the most important parts.
**A currency can be either floating or fixed
Fixed: To stop its exchange rate going up and down all the time a country fixes it at a specific rate; this is also called pegging. China has a fixed / pegged currency. A country maintains this by selling lots of its currency to lower the value or by buying lots to increase it – the timeless law of supply and demand. Also, raising interest rates increases demand, and vice versa.**
I've indulged you as much as patience will allow. You claimed you were an economist, but you don't have a grasp of even the most rudimentary concepts of currency and velocity. You obviously didn't know the difference between a floating and fixed currency. You probably don't even know that prior to the US being on fiat model we fixed the price of the USD by basing it on 40% of gold and we permanently set the price of gold at $35 for 43 years. 
So, I hope you have learned something but I can't have an economics discussion with you. You have made it intolerable.

@_date: 2014-03-10 17:46:00


No. The metric is the total amount of global trade. Currencies are compared to the amount of trade each represents in the global marketplace. 


When you hear that a stock has "outperformed" it means that the prediction made by investors was less than what the stock actually returned. 
That definition means absolutely nothing here because we are comparing two currencies together. We are not comparing an investor's prediction of a stock's return to its actual return. 
When you compare two or more currencies the most important metric is the percentage of global trade. There is $90 trillion in global trade, and you simply compare big (or how small) the percentage is for each currency. That is how currencies are compared. 
Throwing in the definition of "outperform" as it relates to stocks is irrelevant and absurd. 


Which is why claiming that Bitcoin has outperformed the dollar is a ridiculous statement. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:04:17


You are making an argument based on a wild prediction that the NYSE will not only accept Bitcoin as a method of direct payment, but will change the value of all the stocks into Bitcoin (which is the only way to avoid a conversion fee). 
This thread was all about how Bitcoin could be shown to have outperformed the dollar. You can't prove that with a prediction that essentially means that the United States would replace Bitcoin as a form if currency - which is frankly, insane. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:32:41
Maybe Overstock keeps a few percentage (although that would be contrary to the reports that have come out), but he doesn't own any personally. He does own gold, but no Bitcoin.

As a currency, he is still correct. In his defense he wrote this is April 2013, yet it still proves accurate today. As a currency it is still irrelevant and useless. That could change, but major changes need to occur. 


Yes, because it was written in April 2013 before volatility dropped at all. If anything you just proved how recent some of those volatility improvements have been. He didn't fail to mention it, because volatility didn't decrease. 


His entire thesis was that Bitcoin was not a currency. So the other functions are irrelevant. You tried. I'll give you that.

Do you think Steve Forbes, the editor-in-chief of Forbes magazine, and CEO of Forbes Inc., is unaware that there are thousands of vendors that accept Bitcoin? If so, we can stop right here. 
Perhaps you don't know this but at one time Diamond Card was accepted at well over 10,000 restaurants nationwide, but people didn't use it. Eventually, it died. 
Just because vendors offer it doesn't mean people are actually using it in any significant or meaningful way. That was his point. It's not being used in any significant way as an actual currency.

He is actually a neat guy, but let's remember why he fought against Wall St. He wasn't being altruistic. There was an overwhelming belief that Overstock was overvalued, and many investors were shorting his stock which led to the company, himself, and his investors with a lower evaluation. So he sued investors involved in naked short selling, even though it's completely legal. Some is still under litigation. A few small cases have been settled out of court - nothing big. 
It's also interesting to note that he admits he doesn't own any Bitcoin, himself. Even Overstock immediately converts BTC to USD. If someone believes that strongly about Bitcoin why wouldn't they at least own some out of at least curiosity?

By anyone that follows Bitcoin. More than $60 million changes hand (depending on what week you look at) in the Bitcoin market, but Overstock took one month to do just $1Million.

Brink of collapse? No. Are there problems that need to be corrected? Absolutely. 
One thing to remember is that if the USD collapses so will the value of Bitcoin. There is simply not enough inherit value in BTC yet. The average customer can not buy groceries, put gas in their car, or pay taxes with Bitcoin. They have to convert their funds to some form of currency. Since 60% of the worlds trade is done in dollars the entire global economy would collapse - bringing down Bitcoin in the process. 
Until Bitcoins do not have to be converted into any other currency it is incredibly dependent on the dollar, which is why Steve Forbes any other economists do not yet consider it a *true* currency.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:09:57


No. Gold is valuable no matter what. I can make jewelry out of gold and sell it. In fact, 45% of all mined gold is used for this purpose. Only 30% of mined gold is used as a means to store assets. Gold also plays a viable function in the medical, in technology (it is in the device you are using right now), and even in aerospace. There is an inherit value to gold. 
Bitcoin has none. In addition to have no real value, it is also not backed by any government (or even private) institution. It's value is purely dependent on investor speculation.

@_date: 2014-03-10 05:37:29


Yes, but 60% of world trade is conducted in USD, This is a very important fact. 
USD is also the number one currency used to store cash reserves. China alone has $3.6 trillion stockpiled (in addition to owning $1.3 trillion of our debt). Because other countries use USD on the global market and keep large cash reserves, their economy (and therefore their own currency) would be devalued if the USD collapsed. That would have a trigger affect on any country that buys global goods and services. 
Japan and China, which have depended upon American consumers, would be severely affected. The German and French economies which are heavily invested in US securities and exotic financial products would be affected as well - that would drive the entire Euro into disarray.  Essentially, the collapse of the dollar would throw the world into a global depression. 
Since Bitcoins can not be used directly to pay for groceries, rent, taxes, or to put gas in your car it must be converted to some currency - any currency. It is virtually impossible to convert your Bitcoins to a usable currency that isn't going to be affected by the collapse of the dollar. 
If Bitcoins could be spent by the average person without converting their bitcoins to another currency this would not be a factor, but it is. Thus, if the dollar collapses so will Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:55:02
In how long? That would mean Bitcoin would have to increase in trade volume (not market capital) by 539,900% - not to mention that 180+ countries would have to adopt Bitcoin as the standard in global trade. 
Are you really that optimistic?
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:11:53
What you quoted has absolutely NOTHING to do with what is being discussed. The claim that was made was that Bitcoin outperformed the US Dollar. 
That is a very specific metric. 
You are defining the term "outperform" as it relates to stocks that are traded on the stock exchange that beat investors expectations of a public company's quarterly earnings report. 
You would have been better off quoting the Bible, or a even a potato. The fact that you have received upvotes speaks volumes about the ignorance that some Bitcoin investors have. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:01:49
It absolutely is and I've explained why several times. 
Until Bitcoin can be used to purchase every day goods and services it will be tied to the value of the dollar because you need to convert Bitcoin to USD. 
The United States dollar is the world's dominant reserve currency and is the currency in which oil is priced. When you can pay for goods and services without the help of companies like Snap Card or Coinbase then Bitcoin will no longer be tied directly to the value of the USD. Until then it will remain dependent on the value of other currencies.

Firstly, price per unit is not a metric that can be used to judge any form of currency. Bitcoin is not a good or a service. Secondly, in many markets the price of unit is less than a penny and these trades are conducted using a fraction of a penny,  thus debunking your claim that Bitcoin outperforms the USD in divisibility. 


That's not really analogous. Currencies have real-world metrics. The two that I just stated: total value of trade, and % compared to other currencies are objective performance metrics. It would be ridiculous to assume they meant something intangible. Though, like I said you could easily read them if you are unclear as to their intention.

I didn't block it. But the customer couldn't place his order. I had to manually place his order because the order expired. I'm trying to find a way to prevent that from happening if we start getting lots of Bitcoin purchases. It looks like the way to do that is to increase the transaction fee but I use Coinbase and I can't figure out how to do this. Any help?

Context, my friend. Context.

Unfortunately, for a merchant those pesky 3rd parties are required to function. We can't risk the volatility so we have to get an immediate exchange to USD. Right now the only ones that seem "credible" are Coinbase &amp; BitPay - but for us both of them didn't work out flawlessly...I came here hoping for a solution, but so far haven't really found one. Plus it's those 2 providers that are seamlessly integrated in Sprite and other checkout solutions.

Ah. That doesn't seem fair to a buyer though. Merchants typically pay the fees for a transaction like credit card fees, etc...
Services like Coinbase should allow merchants to cover the cost to have a fast transaction rate.

For a merchant it is indistinguishable.

BitPay has a different way of authorizing merchants which they changed since we signed up. Merchants that want to accept over $1,000+ need to have a "special" type of approval which includes sending them corporate documents, etc...
That has all been sent to them but they take forever to approve it. So when this customer tried the transaction failed and we're still waiting for approval. Haven't heard a peep from them in 2 days either. 
Then that will get us to accepting $1,000. Then there is another process to accept over $1,000 in a day. Our average order is $1700, thus right now we couldn't use them at all. Mind way this was not the process when we signed up. When we launched Bitcoin acceptance it was months ago - we got our first user yesterday.

Yet, that's how economics works. 


You are the only one that keeps bringing it up. Neither Forbes nor my own comments referenced it. Are you able to comprehend the difference between understanding the basics of economics, and following one particular economic theory?


Big words, bro. Do you understand them? If you did, you probably wouldn't like what it means for Bitcoin. The basic concept of the theorem is that nothing cannot become money unless it was at one time a valuable commodity. Of course, bitcoins were never a valuable commodity which would violate the Austrian regression theorem meaning that Bitcoin can never be a true currency.

Do you have any idea how to increase the transaction fee in Coinbase so this doesn't happen again? If not, I'll ask support. So far it's been 24 hours since I requested help and I haven't heard anything back from them - so from a customer service perspective it doesn't look great. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:06:05
Here is the record I have. Are you familiar with Coinbase? Is there a way to increase the fee that we pay to expedite the transaction confirmation?

It can accept card or cash. Not Bitcoin. I would use a separate Coinbase app, and then I'd have to place the order manually afterwards. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:18:48


Thank you for your explanation, but that is what annoys me. As a merchant I obviously want every transaction to go smoothly - from the purchase, to the delivery and installation of our product. Not being able to *control* that aspect makes it harder to scale up and promote Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:19:58
Correct me if I am wrong (I may very well be), but isn't all this available publicly on the blockchain?

So Coinbase actually creates the 10 minute expiry. The flow is that the customer comes to our store &amp; chooses Bitcoin as an option. Then they are sent to Coinbase to make payment after it is confirmed they are sent back to the store to confirm their purchase which actually places the order and starts the fulfilment process. Because it expired they were not able to confirm it they the store so the order had to be placed manually once we (the merchant) recieved confirmation from Coinbase that the transaction was valid.
