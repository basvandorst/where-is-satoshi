@_date: 2016-08-15 22:29:47
Whether this is true or not, this is the very reason why we should not be okay with governmental agencies having the extent of data they do, because they can be breached, and when that info gets out, there's no stopping it.

I would actually implement it into my business if the transactions weren't fucking insane.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:33:13
Last time I checked, the sender can have the option to set a transaction fee. And the higher the fee, the faster it is processed. I've heard stories of lower fees resulting in transactions never getting processed, as the miners determine it is below their acceptable threshold, which seems really stupid.

The problem isn't that banks exist. They were created in a time and place where they were needed and helpful. The problem is that time has passed, and it's going to take a lot of work for us to move on from that.

Yeah, we have been considering accepting Bitcoin for our events, and at this point, these are the reasons we're holding off:
1. Transaction times are too long (we need something within seconds, not 10 minutes or more).
2. Transactions used to cost very little, making it appealing. Now they are absurd and too much.
3. The fluctuating value makes it hard for us to plan around the ticket price facet.
These problems are solvable, but not by us. The Bitcoin network and community needs to figure this shit out, otherwise Bitcoin will flop.

@_date: 2018-08-07 23:49:25
Splitting tasks on a GPU doesn't increase any "risk" a GPU can experience from heating. If you're going to tax your GPU with a game and it's being 100% utilized, this is very similar to if you were mining on it too. As long as you're cooling it properly, you're just fine doing whatever on it. Now, if you're overclocking, whether it's gaming, or mining, then it gets complicated, but can be safe too if you know what you're doing (spoiler: most miners most certainly do NOT know what they're doing in this regard).

If you bought at $700, and buy more at a lower price, that reduces your average buy price across your portfolio. Buying as the price drops not only helps to stabilize, it gives you a better position as the market recovers. As with anything, you should always decide for yourself how you should spend your money, and never spend money you can't reasonably lose. That being said, investing your earned money into something is never a sure thing, but it's usually better than buying a TV or a Car, which has immediate and continual depreciation.

Since you failed to properly increment your numbers for your points, I'm going to just do it for you.
1) BTC being too slow for retail is a concern, however when I bought 1BTC the other day, my wallet app on my phone showed the payment completed on my account in less than a minute. Yes, it took a bit of time to verify, but perhaps adding a paper receipt to the process will fill the gaps in this area.
2) Digital security in any regard can be done poorly. The fact that there are those who do it poorly is not inherently a failing of BTC, just how it is interacted with. This is not a legitimate point against BTC in any shape or form.
3) mtgox imploding means nothing. More money has been lost to banks over the centuries and millennia that makes mtgox look like pennies. I take it you haven't heard of the "great depression"?
4) Consumer protection is important, that's why it's the responsibility of the consumer to be wise with their money. In the case of BTC, you paying for a product that wasn't immediately available was your own choice. Swindlers happen in all currencies, in all industries and in all countries on this planet. The fact that BFL has messed people around and other companies the same, doesn't mean this is inherently the fault of BTC. There are other one-way payment methods that have been used in the past to scam people, such as bank drafts, money transfers, etc. This is a failing of the consumer and the retailer. The failing of the consumer to properly identify when a transaction is not safe. The failing of the retailer to properly implement methods to provide refunds, the products/services promptly, and the ability to do business properly.
At the end of the day, you're panicking, and not thinking straight. These points are not anywhere near enough to remove BTC from being a legitimate method of paying for something.

It's not an end-all-be-all strategy, but it is _a strategy_ that has it's applications.

@_date: 2017-08-01 19:30:50
It's a very long-winded explanation, but it stems from automation of jobs and guaranteed minimum income.
I see a future where we have automation (robots) help us achieve whatever we want to do as humans, and there being no need for money to facilitate the dreams of the individual.
Quite a few parts of the world (multiple States in the USA, Canada, others) are talking about guaranteed minimum income. The majority of this topic stems from industry after industry being automated to the point where you (almost) don't need any staff. In a world where robots do everything (and this is a certainty) that is involved with the foundation of Humanity, what do people do? Why does money matter?
Consider the following. Let's say you wanted to build a house, and the entire supply chain, construction, the whole process is automated front to back. Collection and processing of lumber is automated. Construction of concrete is automated. Lumber to house construction is automated. Electrical, HVAC, etc is all automated by robots. Where does the money go? Why should you even pay for it to begin with, if robots can build robots, and the secondary built robots can enable humanity to just do as they please.
I see there being a tipping point where Humanity as a whole is going to experience a ludicrous renaissance that will dwarf the Information revolution. I see Humanity shedding the need for any currency, be it FIAT or digital.
When will this happen? I'm not sure, but with how Humanity has accelerated in the last 20 years, I bet the tipping point happens somewhere within the next 20-50 years.
edit: I am completely not surprised that I am downvoted and people don't want to consider this as a possible future. I mean, it's completely the opposite of how you understand your world today. But this wouldn't be the first time humanity has had such radical changes to how life works.

It's important to stay skeptical, how else can we actually properly vet information? I'm not even the slightest bit offended :)
This is one that I found really quickly : 
However it isn't exactly clear if it was influenced by the gold standard at all.
I don't think I can find it quickly, but there is documentation out there that demonstrates that certain entities in the USA get money from the fed before anyone else in the USA. This gives them a significant advantage over the rest of the country, as they can distribute that money and make investment actions before USD valuation fluctuates in response to fed printing.
For example this means that the person who had $100 USD (in their pocket) before the fed printed money, that money is now worth less to them because they don't see any of the money from the fed printing, aka Quantitative Easing. Now think about how many people are in that situation in the USA, pretty much everyone.

Many people only want to pay with cc, and will just go elsewhere if you can't provide that payment option. This is a real thing and it happens to every business.
If processing cc with a 2%-3% cut means you gain hundreds to thousands (or tens of thousands) of clients you wouldn't have otherwise, that clearly is worth doing.
I'm not saying cc fees aren't worth budgeting for, but typically there is a substantial client base that will only want to pay with cc. Especially in the USA where there is no uniform debit system (like Interac in Canada).
This is why I say they are "doing your business wrong", because you're fixating on the loss of margin but not the actual net-effect of being able to accept cc payments.

I haven't tried World of Warships very recently, but their World of Tanks game is fucking awesome. It is the best Free to Play model I've ever seen, and I've been playing such games for in excess of 5 years now.
Why? Because:
* It's actually Free to Play, you never, ever, ever, have to give them money to have an absolutely fabulous time
* I've played it on and off for 3+ years now, and I never _NEED_ to give them money, I choose to (I never get brickwalled if I don't)
* What you get is additional features, but without them you are not stuck
* There are lots of options for how to spend your money, it's not just a few options, there are maanyy!
* The pricing model is extremely flexible
* They have repeatedly made the F2P model better over years (for example, made "gold rounds" purchasable by silver (earned) as opposed to the  purchased gold currency)
I have significant confidence that they have the general interest of gamers at heart, even if it may not be apparent just yet. World of Tanks is far more mature than World of Warships (in terms of development time).

This is the logical fallacy of Reductio ad absurdum.
No, ALL the extra revenue should not go to the operator. However, they should see some gains from such a thing. Otherwise, as we are seeing now, it erodes the "middle class" which will eventually lead to nobody affording anything (as we are seeing now), which will kill markets.
I'm not even saying MOST of the gains should go to the operator. However those that do the work that "gets more done" from increased productivity should see proportional compensation for what they do for the company. What that looks like, I don't know, and it probably should not be a static figure/percentage. But what has happened/is happening really is working against everyone.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:44:11


Uh actually that's false. The majority of jobs (in the USA) aren't given raises to match, let alone exceed, the inflation of the currency. Furthermore, the increases in productivity per employee also is not compensated. These two things are major contributors to the wealth gap that we currently see.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:16:00


Uh, it already is.


100% Agree.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:34:48
And the productivity improvements? Where's the compensation for that? Same people, same work, more output, and the gains go to management/executive. Again, the wage gap is real.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:18:35


I would argue the majority of it is from technological advancements. Yes, education has probably positively impacted it, but not as much as automation, or IT systems drastically positively impacting productivity for staff and/or business systems.
Consider how much work it was to write just a document not too long ago. Now you can do it on your phone, email it to anyone in the world, and get a response nearly instantaneously.
I agree about the being allies thing. And one thing I think we both can agree on is that it is _not_ a simple situation.

Okay well my assumption was that auditing was not being done already. But since you mention that is being done, that addresses what I was talking about.
I can see why having the fed separate is a good idea, but I am extremely sceptical about it not already being influenced by outside entities, political or not.

If you want to be actually cross-platform, it should influence development from square one. Even if you don't initially test against it, setting yourself up to use a language/API that is only _emulated_ on other platforms, is not actually cross-platform.

From what I understand they _might_ be able to point transfers to a particular wallet, but how do you tie a wallet to a person? I still have lots to learn about it, but from what I understand the wallet is a unique string which doesn't inherently have any personal identity in it beyond the serial.
Now, what if those funds continually transfer between wallets? Which one is it in now? How about now? Who owns them? What if they were converted to another currency several steps ago?
I suspect it will be either impossible, or incredibly elaborate to track down those funds. Assuming they're even somewhere.
