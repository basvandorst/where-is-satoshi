Think of all the money he missed out on not being able to mine or the bitcoin he wasn't able to purchase while the money was tied up in the mining rig he was waiting on. Man that sucks.

Eth hasn't done anything good for awhile. Do you expect it to jump up anytime soon? I'm sitting on 1.2 ETH haven't made much profit from it yet. I was thinking about dumping it and going all in on BTC.

What ever happened to butterfly labs. I remember them from 2013 and they didn't ship product then and people were getting worried. Did they scam people?

Keep buying your shit coins while they're in a shit bubble!
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:30:05
Awesome thanks for the replies. I normally buy on Coinbase. But I think they have been kind of shite with the delays/fees etc... but they do make it easy to buy, just not when the price dips!

My bitcoin ticker widget is reporting Bitcoin at 4250 I ran to my computer to see what's up. At last it's still 9239
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:04:25
What in the fucking fuck just happened ... Manipulation
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:20:50
Yeah it was only worth around $100 when they got hacked. Which is why I didn't care much about it. 
EDIT: some words
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:19:15
So they don't give back the balance of BTC that was in the account? Hmm
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:59:17
Yeah a little bit so that's good 
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:34:46
100k by September
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:57:02
Yeah I did but you know what ... Once again I lose. I sold at 5k because I had a bill to take care of. Life loves to shit on me.

Bullish bullshit

This is stupid
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:20:39
Heh I didn't get a claim. Why didn't they just keep accounts on file? I guess I'm out of luck?
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:33:40
This is great!
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:05:50
This pisses me off... I lost coins on gox

Sore loser!
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:55:55
I still believe this site is partly the reason for BTC not being valued at what it is really worth right now. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:51:40
Bitcoin will fall then it will rise again then it will fall then it will rise higher then it will fall again .... this cycle will never end folks. One thing I can almost be certain about is that it will always have value and it will never be under $2000 again
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:50:37
Yeah as soon as I bought at 6200 nothing but good news has been flowing like wine. Now I wish I had bought more.
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:39:38
Looks like one of then ponznan schemes
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:20:42
I literally bought at the peak of the mountain. It immediately began crashing after I hit the buy button. My gut told me to wait until noon. I figure oh well it will be around 5k next year. Just hold and wait.

Except that shoplifting there is a possibility of being caught. Double spending may never be brought to justice. Maybe I'm wrong? No risk in double spending, huge risk in shop lifting.

Seriously? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:58:38
I bought $300 worth at $2805 on Coinbase the very top of the ice berg! Only minutes later it crashed. Worse feeling ever. I felt like they were waiting for my dumb ass to buy in. Can only hold now. At least I didn't bet the farm on it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:01:52
Your shit coins are going to shit rot on that shitty media! 
Edit: Dear down voters I was trying to do my best impression of Mr. Lahey from Trailer Park Boys. No matter how many times I call bitcoin shitcoin it's not gonna hurt the value. Also if it does... well cheap coins for everyone.
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:21:10
Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, and Woods bitcoins! You press their center to reveal what type of coin they are!

I didn't get in on the class action law suit. I tried logging into the site a few weeks ago because they say that you can view your account balance. My user name no longer exist. Yet I have email records showing I did have that account. I guess they deleted it so I'm one less bloak they would be responsible for paying back. Could I still get something back?
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:46:12
Thought it meant hold on for dear life

Same here I had .8 btc on gox when that happened. I want it back now! This asshole stole almost $2500 from me at this point and then how much in 5 years! Painful loss. I know mine is peanuts compared to some but damn it!!!

That dirty son of a bitch! How can he just go on national television and laugh about that crooked shit?!? I'm enraged!! 
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:53:17
Of course! It was hilarious! 
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:10:15
I'm done with Coinbase fuck them. I couldn't buy the dip
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:39:53
Feels good to have hold. The value is back, and I bought the dip at 2200!
