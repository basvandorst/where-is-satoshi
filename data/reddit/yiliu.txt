When people started saying that everybody was going to be buying their groceries online back in the 90's, it was really premature. Companies started up to do nothing but sell socks, or pet food ("We'll be the Amazon of marshmallows!"). Any company that started up with a rough idea got money thrown at them. But the infrastructure wasn't there. The Internet wasn't ready, payment systems weren't ready, delivery companies were too small and too slow, tech companies didn't have the capital. The whole thing flamed out spectacularly in the dot-com bubble, and naysayers laughed at how foolish all those futurists and techies had been to imagine that the Internet would change our fundamental way of life, and at the time, they seemed to have the weight of history behind them.
The implication I'm making is: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are currently in the "red-hot hype with little real-world application" phase. Some people see amazing potential, others laugh at the whole idea, but it's kind of undeniable that the hype has far exceeded the real, current utility. We're going to continue to see cycles of hype and despair, but in the long run...well, you can decide where you think it's going to end up.

NoSQL as a fad came and went. Many of the major players proved fundamentally flawed and are gone. Others proved their worth and are here to stay, but since the excitement died down you don't think about them much. Behind the scenes, another generation of databases are being developed.
The same thing will happen in cryptocurrencies, eventually, but since it's going to have major social impact that day may be a while off. More like the Internet itself than a particular style of database. I'd reckon we're about '95 to '97 in equivalent internet hype, when everybody was yammering about Information Superhighways and making ridiculous pie-in-the-sky suggestions like "people are gonna buy their dog food and cars and socks on the World Wide Web!", but few people had even seen a web browser. The difference is, people are _making money_ off of the growth, so that's what everybody is focused on.

As a veteran Bitcoin holder: believe me, it always felt like that. There are certainly new risks, but many of the old risks are gone or mitigated (a simple bug causing total collapse, banning by the US government back when that would've been trivial, small markets being easier to game, etc).
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:48:17
I was implying that it doesn't really matter whether you think you'd rather Bitcoin not exist...it's gonna stubbornly continue to exist even so.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:44:05
Uhh...right. And public-key crypto dates back to the 70s, and distributed networks to the 80s. Bitcoin ties those and other technologies together to make something new. Implying that all there is to Bitcoin is a Merkle tree suggests you either don't understand the tech or are trolling. If that were the case, where were all the digital currencies back in the 90s, when the concept first started getting press?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:59:57


lol wut. That's a new one.


It's really too bad nobody stopped to ask your opinion, huh?
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:26:30
Right now it's a bubble that needs to pop. That'll scare away the Ponzi-scheme crowd, leaving the "something there" there. Then it can develop quietly again for a while. It's happened several times before.

Bitcoin has a stable decade-long track record behind it, it has massive name recognition and software support, and it's got some of the best devs around (with proven records) working to improve it's shortcomings. I'd be fine with some other cryptocurrency surging to replace it, but I'd also be fine with Bitcoin evolving into a more functional currency, which is entirely possible.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:16:41
Yeah, you're right. But UBI is not communism. It has many of the biggest advantages (people don't have to worry about basic survival, and are more free to be creative and entrepreneurial) without the big disadvantages (removal of all financial motivation).
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:12:27
You can want both. I want to see Bitcoin continue to inflate in value until it's large enough to stabilize and be just a gently-deflationary currency. That means massive gains for now and a reasonable currency in the long run.
Anecdotally, when the price was pretty stable at ~$400 for years, I was using it as a currency. I bought Steam games and stuff on Overstock with Bitcoin. And then I bought an equivalent amount more Bitcoin to offset the sale.
This says two things: 1) if the price is stable, people will happily use it as a currency--and it works wonderfully (or did before the fees exploded), and 2) because it will tend to grow in value over time, people will prefer holding BTC to USD or other currencies.
When you see 10x jumps, that obviously fucks with things. But to fulfill the needs of an international economy, it _has_ to have a proportional valuation, and the only way to reach that valuation is with big upward surges. If and when we reach a point where things balance out, where the market decides it doesn't need another 10x rise or 50% drop, where we just see minor fluctuations up and down like you do with any currency (but still trending gradually up), then it's utility will have a chance to shine.
And in the meantime, _weeeee!_
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:58:10
So, speaking as an old-timer, I remember when people talked exactly this way about the Internet. Nobody was actually using it, it was all hype, the novelty would wear off. Look, some major site shut down--that proves it. Gopher is failing, and that "world wide web" stuff is too CPU-intensive to be useful. Established media companies and the government would never allow it to take off and replace them, or to provide unrestricted, untappable lines of communication. They'll step in and shut it down. In ten years, nobody would be using this 'Internet'! They'd be reading books and newspapers like always, and all that would be left on the Internet would be a few companies and universities.
And yet here we are.
Maybe you're right and Bitcoin is a short-term gimmick. But sitting here, having survived something like 6 major crashes, having watched Bitcoin's value rise from pennies to dollars, to tens of dollars, then hundreds, then thousands, in defiance of all the naysaying by clever folks like yourself at every stage (and in lockstep with the early optimists who said: I know this sounds crazy, but this could be worth thousands soon)...I'm gonna go ahead and hold, thank you kindly.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:00:48
There's a pretty big gap between "money is not literally the only source of motivation" and "money is completely worthless". I work for money, then I go home and 'work' more (i.e. program) for fun. I get no financial compensation for the latter. Why do you figure I do it?
That's one of the nice things about UBI--it _doesn't_ completely remove the financial motive. You could always be making more money. But OTOH, it does remove the fear and stress of having too little money, and gives people the breathing room to study, to try out other  occupations, or to take a shot at starting a company.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:03:28
Well, it's an anecdote, but for a long time when it was fairly stable (around $500), I was using it as a currency, as were a few people I know. It was really handy to pay for stuff on Steam, say, or send some money to a friend.
Then the transaction fees went wild, you had the forks, the price went crazy, and I stopped that.
But hopefully after the next big crash we get a nice long lull, and people can get a chance to use it as a currency for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:56:21
Thing is, bitcoin is weird to use when it's so massively deflationary. The idea was always that it would 'inflate' first, which is what it's doing now, and then, when it reached the point where the price stabilized, it would be useful as a currency.
So you're not buying a stock with no value, you're betting that it'll be useful eventually.
@_date: 2014-09-29 06:42:21
I'm old enough to remember when we went through the same spasms with the Internet. It came out of nowhere, surprising everyone but a few geeks, and suddenly it was all 'cyberspace' this and 'information superhighway' that...and then there was a backlash. Laymen don't *need* the Internet. Heck, opening a gopher session, connecting to a search site, searching around for articles, then waiting for them to  download...that was more than enough time to walk down to the corner store and buy a magazine!
There are huge advantages to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but they haven't had a chance to manifest yet. Again, by analogy, people asked "How can the Internet replace my daily newspaper?" and then when the answer wasn't "Awesomely, tommorrow!" they concluded that the Internet was a stupid fad. But in the meantime, millions of people were connected and started building, you know, Google, Linux, Amazon, Wikipedia, etc.
Bitcoin will start off solving problems we didn't know we had in odd corners of the economy. Then it'll *build* to being a daily currency for everyday folk. Remember, the Internet itself took twenty years to become really mainstream, and was the realm of kooks for all of that time.
So, the key word in OP's headline was: 'currently'. Cryptocurrencies will come into their own before long.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:19:59
There was that Morpheus meme from way back when like, "everybody's wondering when to sell...what if I told you, when it's time, you won't have to".
If bitcoin is successful, you use it as a store of value forever, and cash out when you need money for something.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:58:57
There's still a ton of headroom. Before it's actually a useful currency, it needs a much larger market cap. At the same time, yeah, it's not quite the same.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:16:00


But any individual coin is a much more risky investment than Bitcoin was for one important reason: now there's Bitcoin. All altcoins have a major competitor with huge name recognition, which could suck the air out of their environment. It's like saying about online stores in 2010 that "investing in Amazon is a waste, it's already near the top of it's valuation, there are many smaller stores with lots of room to grow!" Sure, Amazon couldn't jump by 100x again, but that doesn't necessarily mean that any _other_ online store could _either_.
Back when Bitcoin was going from $200 to $1000, a lot of people were asking me what altcoins I would recommend, since they'd "missed the bus" on Bitcoin--which is a hard feeling to get over. I even recommended a few that looked interesting, but I always told them I would primarily recommend Bitcoin. They chose altcoins with visions of 10x returns. Peercoin is at $1.50, and Bitcoin is at 10x the $400 it was at then.
If you're investing in an altcoin, ask yourself: do you believe this coin have what it takes to overcome Bitcoin's _huge_ name recognition, and it's first-mover advantage, and the ecosystem of companies springing up around it, and it's proven track record? If you can't give a _really_ compelling argument, you're just gambling with penny stocks. And there were/are a _lot_ of altcoins that were straight-up scams. But, hey, Bitcoin absolutely has shortcomings, and if you're convinced, go for it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:46:10
That's true. That's why I say, if you're convinced a coin has what it takes to catch and pass bitcoin (or take over a niche that bitcoin can't fill), then go for it.
I would quibble a bit with the company metaphor though. Currencies aren't like companies. There are many successful internet companies, but only one internet. It's not clear to me whether we'll stabilize to one currency, or maybe two (store of value and everyday currency?) or three, or seven, or...you get the idea. But unlike with companies, the answer _could_ be one.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:00:35
Finally happened? It feels like it was just yesterday that it broke $3k.
It wasn't, though. It was _a whole week ago_.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:24:24
Just don't forget to HODL when it crashes.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:55:05
The trough of the upcoming crash could be $1k. Or maybe it'll be $4k. Or maybe $8k. Maybe buying in now is a great idea, or maybe it's a terrible idea. Who knows?
To just take the emotion out of it, I started investing a fixed amount every week at  the beginning of 2016, regardless of rises or falls. I'm doing pretty well with that...currently at about 400% of my investment. And I'm still buying week on week.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:13:37
I can tell you that $4000-per-BTC seemed _every bit_ as impossible when it was $3 as $900k-per-BTC seems now.
Of course, that doesn't mean BTC _will_ ever be worth $900k, but from the perspective of the investor, with no crystal ball, it's pretty frickin' similar. You guys seem to think if you'd stumbled across Bitcoin in 2011, when it was worth $1-2, you'd have said to yourself "This is clearly going to be worth $4k some day! It's a no-brainer to invest!" Then, even more than now, 90% of the people talking about Bitcoin were saying "It's a dream! It's a ponzi scheme! It'll never, ever work! That's not even how currency works! You idiots are throwing your money away!" Establishment figures who became aware of Bitcoin said some variation of "lol, wtf guys?" And unlike now, there were only a couple years of history, consisting mostly of some very strange crypto-geeks trading back and forth to point at. It seemed _entirely possible_ that it could vanish overnight due to a software bug, or that a moment's panic could drive the price down to pennies, or the US government could just shut the whole operation down, or that it could hit some unforeseen scaling issue that would kill it or...well, you get the idea.
Now, _every bank_ is fooling with blockchains, and governments are trying to figure out the wisest way to regulate them--or even incorporate them into the workings of government. I really have to say that 100k+ seems way more likely now than 1k+ looked in the early days.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:40:56
Yeah, mom &amp; pop investors will bail when things start to turn. In the last few cycles (the jump to ~100 and the jump to ~1000), the sell-down took months and years respectively.
I expect the price to climb to something approaching $10k, and then another year-plus lull of gradually falling prices. Hopefully it's not 3 years again this time around.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:28:23
Congratulations, and welcome to the party. A word of advice, though: looking at BTC like a regular investment with rate-of-returns is pretty dangerous. Based on past performance, the price _is_ going to fall, and fall hard, at some point. You might wake up in the morning and discover that it's fallen by 20% overnight. It's happened before. And then you might see it fall by 50%...or 75%...and if you treat it like a regular investment your gut is going to be screaming "SELL! SELL WHILE YOU CAN!"
...And then eventually, the fall will stop, and it'll start to creep up again, and then it'll start rising quickly, and then it'll _shoot moonward_. Right at this moment, _every person who ever panicked and sold_ (and didn't buy right back in) is looking pretty foolish. That's why the people of this sub are so obsessed with HODLing.
Just something to keep in mind. Don't be one of the millions of people who will get screwed when the price _inevitably_ crashes. Prepare yourself mentally ahead of time, and HODL right through the crash.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:51:16


Loss aversion... :)
Absolutely, though, I agree. I tried early on to buy and sell at just the right times...I won big once and bumped by 20% or something, but the rest of the time I lost or broke even. You're dealing with mass psychology across dozens of nations, across all sorts of classes and professions (professional traders, geeks, mom &amp; pop investors, eccentric billionaires, businesses, etc). It's way too sketchy. Stuff that seems critically important doesn't affect the price at all (transaction fees were in the 10s of dollars, but the price was still rising effortlessly?!), and at the same time the price can crash suddenly for no apparent reason.
You can try picking the peaks just by feel, but it'll be painful as hell if you're wrong. Maybe we're _at_ the peak and you should sell, and buy back in at $1k. Or maybe we peak at $10k, and the price never falls to $4k ever again, and if you sell you'll just sit there biting your nails waiting for the crash that's _surely coming_ to buy back in--and then when you finally give up and just buy at whatever price, the crash finally _does_ come.
Or, you can give up the day-to-day shit and just hodl. Gives you a sort of zen calm whether the price is crashing or shooting up. You'll just hold on either way.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:28:54
Having lived through the $1-to-$10 jump, and the $10-to-$100 jump, and the $100 to $1000 jump, I feel comfortable saying: It _always_ feels like you've missed the bus, that it's too late to jump in. I don't think it's nonsense to point that out.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:32:08
Yeah, the day traders ran amok when it flirted $3000, what's so different now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:45:51
Those of us who have been here for a while have seen the price drop by 50-75%, a bunch of times.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:00:15
Haha, shit. "I'm gonna bet two years of my life that this thing famous for it's incredible and steady rise in value is going to suddenly drop _right now_!"
Like, maybe start with half?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:26:31
A couple hundred dollars in mid-2015 would've got you a full Bitcoin, and that would be worth $9k today. Bitcoin _could_ go to $100k each. Or $1M. Or $0. So, it depends which you think is more likely.
Word of advice, though--if you do buy, commit. Don't invest more than you can afford, and once you've invested--hold. The price can crash. I've seen it fall by 50% several times, and I feel like we may be due. When it first hit $1100, it turned and fell to $250. A whole lot of people who were invested then panicked, sold, and lost money. And then it stayed low for _years_, and a lot of people must've given up hope and sold. Those that held won in the long run.
If you believe cryptocurrency is a fad then don't invest, it's too risky and too stressful. If you think it's probably the future of money, or are willing to make a bet that it might be, then buy, set an unreasonable goal, and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:28:45
Well...he could've given the guy a hug, at least.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:15:11


Just request a higher limit. I asked, and though it took a while, they raised my limit by an order of magnitude.
For anyone _thinking_ of cashing out in the near future--request an increase now. It took weeks for Coinbase to approve mine, and that was a while ago. I'm sure they're swamped these days. But then, be safe--use the deep store or a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:33:49
Bitcoin isn't a stock. If it's equivalent to a penny-stock exploding, you have to explain how it's crashed and recovered like 6+ times now. And each time it crashed, people celebrated that the bubble had finally popped. They did that when it fell from $1 back to 30¢. And yet...here we are.
We're in an inflationary period, where Bitcoin is inflating to it's useful value. Then it'll be stable, slightly inflationary, and a useful currency. At least, that's one interpretation. There are others. But "it's a penny stock, it's a bubble" doesn't cut it IMHO. It's too simple and it's been wrong too often.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:47:26
You get over that. The third or fourth time you sell only to watch the price keep rising, you decide--you know what? I'll hold.
Eventually you get to roller-coaster-meme state. Price goes up? Wee! Price goes down? Wee, buy a bit! I'm just along for the ride.

I would take the Simpson's president over ours, though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:43:19
We were right then, too. I'm not saying Bitcoin _is_ a bubble, I'm saying this kind of price rise is unsustainable in the long run. So when it crashes don't panic, hold til the next one.
edit: occurs to me you might be talking about the  _second_ time we were at $1k. I'm talking 2014. In January this year I was saying I expected $10k by year end, followed by a crash--if you check my history, the comments are still there.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:59:03
Err... Poor metaphor. I didn't quit six times, I've _witnessed six crashes_, and after each the value stabilized, then eventually went up roughly 10x. I've personally been holding (though not from the beginning, unfortunately). I saw other people panic six times. To my eyes, it looks like a recursive [market curve](
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:46:12
Word of warning, dude--we're definitely in a bubble right now. The price could collapse any time, and we could be right back at $5k. Or $3k. And it might stay there for a year, or more. Don't panic if so--the people who bought at $500 and then panic-sold when it fell back, or gave up when it stalled at $350, are kicking themselves right now. There's a reason this sub is obsessed with HODLing.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:11:51
It was a natural thing to mention back in the day, just a cool new tech you were interested in.
Anybody remember when some guys would post instructions for how to prepare to be rich? It seemed so far-fetched back then, heh.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:59:13
It kind of necessarily has to be first the one, then the other (actually, then both). If it had a market cap of $10M it'd be useless as a trading tool, so the price has to rise to the point where it's stable. Then it'll be useful for trade.
Unless you believe cryptocurrency is just a complete bubble driven by hype, you'll probably believe that some coin or other will end up being widely used. Before that's possible, the value has to hit the point where the price is no longer wildly volatile. Can you see any way for a brand-new coin, with no investment and no value on the market, being used from day one for exchange? How would that work? A cryptocurrency _has_ to have value to be useful--and that value has to be proportional to the market it's going to end up serving, otherwise big transactions will cause major, disruptive swings in value.
So what we're seeing now is sort of worldwide brainstorming about the eventual utility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. What _should_ the market cap be?
edit: Meant to post that underneath all the wild fluctuation, there's a nice stable rise. Look at Bitcoin price on a [logarithmic scale]( and it looks entirely different from the wild swings in the real value chart. We're rising exponentially to the useful market cap, and all the crazy rises and heart-stopping drops are basically just background noise.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:43:49
So, I basically agree with you. I sincerely hope that we do better than "blockchains as a technology might rise in value", I hope it's a cryptocurrency (i.e. not the Bank of America blockchain, for example). And I think that's likely. In the long run, it's no longer easy to say it's going to be Bitcoin, as opposed to some other cryptocurrency, but I disagree that it's foolish to hold Bitcoin--it's still got the name recognition, and it's very, very difficult to predict who the winner is going to be. It might well _be_ Bitcoin, with the addition of the Lightning Network and future developments. If it's not, it's just a matter of balancing your holdings when market caps start converging.


It _has_ to, though, unless it's fate is to be relegated to some niche market. It has to have a high market cap, comparable to a major currency, before it can be used for widespread trade.


The properties of a currency that continually gains value are _unknown_. It's not clear they're awful. We've really never seen such a currency, except possibly for gold, in some places during some periods when documentation wasn't so great. Mostly, we have a bunch of theory about what a deflationary currency would mean. We _have_ had deflationary assets alongside currencies (like gold, or bonds) that people moved their money to, and they weren't devastating to the economy.


I mean, they do, though. They indicate a general interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Take a look at that logarithmic chart--it no longer looks like a couple totally random bubbles that came out of nowhere, and seems much more like a steady rise in value driven by interest in cryptocurrencies, with a bit of noise thrown in for fun. You can argue that this last bubble was over-hyped and went too far, and the actual value should be lower, but that's entirely speculation. My best guess for an endgame is a final bubble and crash, followed by a stable price that gradually increases, but it's not at all clear to me that _this_ was that bubble.


I mean, you're right. I have. Personally, I've been predicting a crash for [quite]( a [while]( The price can't sustain the kind of ridiculous rises we saw in the last few months of 2017. At the same time, I kept most of what I had; this was not my first bubble, and I'd put odds on it not being the last, either.


It's still relatively niche. And we haven't seen much actual _usage_ yet. When an average smartphone user has a cryptocurrency app on their phone, then we can start to talk about cryptocoins peaking. In the meantime, I'm gonna hold what I've got.
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:34:03
Stating his opinion on live TV and then buying on the ensuing drop is a bit sketchy, though.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:46:43
So, hypothetically, imagine that you think cryptocurrency has fantastic potential--that it could really act as electronic cash, eventually providing a nearly-free, cross-border store of value, institution-independent and easily transferred and easily stored. On top of that, the underlying blockchain might provide a host of other services, like digital stocks &amp; bonds with no overhead, reputation systems, digital contracts, voting systems, etc. It might seem to you that it's value would rise accordingly. And [it has]( (note: log chart), for as long as you've paid attention.
In that case, would it be irrational to buy on dips and take long stagnant periods as evidence of an upcoming rise? There are really two potential scenarios: either we're looking at a silly bubble with a bunch of hype, or we're looking at the birth of a technology to rival the Internet in importance. I think the latter is true, and thus expecting the price to rise and buying when the price was relatively low makes all the sense in the world. It's always possible the former is right and the price will crash to zero in the long run. But I think we're looking at a legitimate difference in opinions, not delusional mental gymnastics.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:52:37
OP is taking you for a ride. The hard fork is not "technically superior", it just made different (and unpopular) technical decisions.
The debate over which is superior is...umm...a bit of a hot one. It may yet turn out that they were the right decisions, but the reception and the price suggest otherwise.
TL;DR: OP is not lying to you, but he's giving you a biased and one-sided view of the world. Take with a dose of salt.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:44:57
Coinbase is BTC (or LTC or Etherium, but those are totally different). Other major sellers should be similar. If you're on an exchange, you may see all of them, double-check the symbol is BTC...and that the price is right. If you're paying $200/ea, it's not a steal of a deal.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:41:31
No. If you own coins _before_ the fork, you'll have both (since they share the same history), but anything you buy after will only appear on one blockchain. If you want Bitcoin Cash, you have to explicitly buy it.
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:18:42
I think the opposite is true, actually. At least, I hope it is. Here in the 'first world', we have established currencies, banking systems, trade practices, etc. Bitcoin, at least initially, offers only marginal added value. In Africa, currencies, banks, and trade are all ongoing issues, and virtual currencies are hot. That makes it an _ideal_ place for Bitcoin to take off--not as an investment, but as a currency in use. And actually, an excellent place to start is remittance.
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:07:37
Right, this just means there's a big opportunity for some local developer to make an app that works in place.
Cryptocurrency can work _around_ corruption, that's one of it's biggest strengths. You can't get a stranglehold on it. Corruption may infect the biggest players, but that just means more opportunities for the small fish.

Yeah! Not like, say, the Europeans, who never slaughtered each other.

Because Africa is a hotbed of virtual currencies, for all sorts of reasons, but right now they're all traditional, centralized currencies. Africa is a leading candidate for a place where you could see Bitcoin working _the way it's supposed to, as a currency in daily use_. That would have all sorts of positive benefits, both for us and for the people using it in Africa.

Yeah, autocorrect.

Corner vendors, or a local store. Or via phone apps. Just like they buy M-Pesa and others now. Currently, Africa is leading the world in _actual_ use of virtual currencies (centralized or not).
Once there's a profit to be made buying and selling bitcoins using a laptop on the street corner...the problem will take care of itself.

When Mt Gox got hacked, bitcoin didn't perform a hard reset.
I haven't totally written off ether yet, but a whole series of hard resets in a row, plus a competing fork, looks _bad_.

Oh, it _will_ pop. It did the last six times or whatever, it'll pop again. For a while.

It could pop at 3 or 4k, and fall to $1000.
Or it could pop at $10k and fall to $3000.

As long as we're talking currencies surviving fantastically unlikely scenarios, could the USD survive an alien invasion? Not sure? Then how can people ever trust it for anything?

Yes, that's true. But the space of possible 32-byte strings is huge (256^32), so collisions are...pretty rare. A hashing algorithm is considered broken when someone can deliberately cause a collision without too much effort.
Generating a huge numbers of hashes to find one with certain properties is critical to the core bitcoin network: that's the 'work' that miners do.
