Also they don't get charged property tax until its completed.. But can still live in it (possibly illegally).. So major incentive to never quite finish..

Probably less.. Still world population levels may also be vastly exaggerated too.

Maybe. IMO its almost certainly doomed to obscurity, so much so they may not even bother to go through with it.. But certainly it isn't going to happen in august. At least not from segwit2x... Anyone can do a hardfork anytime.. Its just a question if whether anyone will follow them.

Chances are you bought your bitcoin from an exchange that is fronted by cloudflare. Even if it isn't one where you uploaded your passport such as localbitcoins, cf has plenty of behavioral info and tracking cookies to tie your browser to your identity. Then whenever you spend that btc you can be sure the 5 eyes know who you are or can easily find out.

There has already been a hardfork of bitcoin; bitcore has 20mb blocks and segwit right now.. What's that, you've never heard of it? ;)

You can withdraw from anxpro.com by visiting their office and getting cash from them. Of course opening an account may take some time and you may not have proof of address with you.

Segwit2x is not planning to hardfork in august. Anyone can hardfork at any time.. Most likely no notable hardfork will occur in august.

Its pretty much impossible IMO.
