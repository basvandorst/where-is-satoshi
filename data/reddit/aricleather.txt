280 bits. Looks good, so does &gt;30FPS ;)

Yes, I am on Windows. Thanks for providing the link, I will read through it.

Agreed. Newegg accepts Bitcoin.

According to Youtube it's in 50FPS. I put the greater than sign. I can't stand 30 in games and such :)

Is it still safe to download it directly?
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:02:04
Know anyone who accepts crypto?
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:36:54
Yeah, I feel like an idiot too.

Blockchain.info doesn't support Authy?

Now, with an even stronger password and 2FA enabled, some of my bitcoin was stolen again. Goodbye, online wallets.
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:15:26
I believe I did all of that except for 2FA, which I guess I should have done. I'll look into that.
I blocked TOR as well. 
Thank you!

No, but I have used paper wallets from the offline 
I didn't know you could do that with blockchain.info, actually. Would it be worth creating paper backups often and clearing browser history from the last hour?

Aww shit, Apple didn't make an alt-coin? Damn, I was really hoping for another one... *sarcasm*

I actually downloaded Malwarebytes the day I built my computer, but I found on this particular computer it blocks all incoming and outgoing data. All browsers were stuck on "resolving host" and I could only access my network's gateway. The 'Web Exclusions' menu was blank. I looked around on the internet for a while and couldn't find anything to fix that.
I would definitely use Malwarebytes, but having internet access is kind of important...

I actually didn't click any links in any emails regarding blockchain.info except for when I first created the wallet. However I appreciate the reminder.

This is mostly my fault for not being secure enough. I'm not mad in any way at all, just looking to be more secure.
If you don't like the idea of bitcoin, whatever man. Doesn't mean you need to be an asshole.
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:30:59
Alright, I will definitely stay away from that feature. Thank you for pointing that out.

2FA means 2 factor authentication. It involves sending a message containing a code through SMS or through an application like Authy or Google Authenticator that allows access to an account on log-in. This message is received on something only you own, therefore your account is much more secure.
I choose to receive these codes via text message. Whenever I attempt logging into an account of mine, I receive a text with a 6 digit code which allows access to my account until I log off again.
Essentially, I've been using Bitcoin services so much the last week, I have received more texts allowing access to my Bitcoin accounts, then I've receives from friends and family.
