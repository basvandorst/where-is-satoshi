DON'T USE FEES

I think that would be more along the lines of SPAM and annoyance.  Don't want tap water advocates in a sub for safe drinking water, because they are annoying assholes and why are they there (with the rare exception of someone who came to legitimately learn new information or understand opinions, or who genuinely thinks they have info to dispute the opinion of the sub that is new, not seen before, actually might change minds if the sub is scientific, and is presented as optional and with nice intent.  If that has ever happened even, since normally such information would come from someone who DOES agree with the sub). Whether it "changes minds" or not should be irrelevant, because if it DOES change minds, unless the commenter was lying, then it would presumably be because it should, except in cases where it's all just about opinions, which does apply to Bitcoins anyway.  Muslims who make topics about how all gays should die because their "book" says so will be banned from the atheist sub, because that isn't what that sub is for.    Muslims who argue politely won't be banned though I'm sure that's never happened, however atheists who argue politely will be banned from the Xtian-but-not-Jehovahs-Witness sub because the Xtians did not go look at that sub in order to see people insulting their religion which makes them angry instead of calm.
...Of course, in the case of Bitcoin, I don't see how these reasons can apply...

There is a VERY simple solution to that...   change the transaction fee to 30¢.
