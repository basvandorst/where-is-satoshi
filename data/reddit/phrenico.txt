You are ignorant of the [benefits of bitcoin]( "Hey, want to use bitcoin? All you need to do is download the 60 GB blockchain, devote 80% of your bandwidth for the rest of your life to relaying other people's transactions to 7 peers... oh and if you ever shut your computer down, you'll have to spend a few hours catching up if you want to send a new transaction or check your balance!"

My problem is precisely this. I see people who have no *interest* in getting technical, yet they *still* feel like they must voice their opinion, contact companies to have them back their preferred solution, harass developers, etc.
I'm not trying to make enemies with you, personally, btw.
Note that the fact that bitcoin has potential raises the stakes considerably. Also note that back in the day, before bitcoin was taken as seriously, bitcoiners were *considerably* less hostile to the developers and more open to debate.


As I implied, I don't think these debates matter much on this front. If you've been around for a while, you'll have noticed that we have been taken *much* more seriously in recent years.

This is a critical point:
If businesses are the only entities with the ability to run nodes, bitcoin *will* become regulated just like companies will be. If those companies outsource (which they will), bitcoin has, in effect, *become* PayPal.
The *only* thing stopping this from happening is the *low cost* of running a node on your own. There is no way of incentivizing this, so it instead *must not be disincentivized*.
Don't take my tone personally. I've been around bitcoin for years, have had this discussion dozens of times, and it gets discouraging how easily misinformation is spread.

It requires all of the above except the photo (which I never recommended at all--only for him to have your name and perhaps a signature), you idiot. Where the fuck do you keep your credit card if not in your wallet, right next to your ID ?


You don't trust them but you are *literally* handing them access to a credit line and your bank account?
There is a simple solution (which I can only assume you weren't creative enough to discover on your own): send the bitcoin and swipe your CC or debit card as a backup. That, you are evidently already comfortable using.
But all of this is kind of pointless. Credit cards were pretty well for POS for a bunch of reasons. If you insist on using bitcoin and leaving the merchant with the risk that you will double spend him, then swipe your card alongside it to assure him that you wont steal from him.

If you really don't know, you should have no say in this debate.
The LN will *actually* scale bitcoin to a large degree (much larger than necessary for the next few years given the growth we've seen) and is going to be a major topic of discussion at the scaling bitcoin conference in a few days.
More importantly, once sidechains (more to the point: the ability to create them) are implemented, people will be able to *experiment* with radically different scaling strategies (including XT or Bip 101, or something totally different) *without* conflict and threatening bitcoin's decentralization.
Again, stop listening to redditards and put in the effort to understand the alternatives on your own.

@_date: 2015-12-26 20:07:53
Why would you use ETH as a store of wealth when bitcoin has much more of a network effect, has better developers, and at worst, can always just turn Ethereum into a sidechain.
Similarly, how can ETH win when all of it is open source and anyone can create their own chain, issue it in proportion to bitcoin ownership, and already have a much larger network effect?
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:38:11

There is no bottleneck right now. Blocks aren't even full, and people can economize on transactions very easily.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:15:41
Satoshi intended for mining to compensate full nodes. But you're right, it's impossible. You will always get division of labor (or lying if the labor is not provable).
This is why the focus on the other side of the equation, minimizing the cost of running a full node, is so important.
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:48:43

Ok, bitcoin has price inflation and deflation. Average them together, and you get a deflation rate of 99% in a few years.
Or, define inflation as a change in the monetary supply. Then, in a few short years, bitcoin's inflation rate will be lower than almost all competing currencies.
I am stunned by how inconsistent your analysis was.

@_date: 2015-06-01 01:29:43


*Needless* is the key word. Any accounting shows that larger blocksizes encourage migration into mining pools and a larger cap immediately makes more profitable certain attack vectors. Why do this? 10 MB is unambiguously better. And 5 MB is better than that.
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:49:45

The only reason it takes a while now is that the entire regulatory apparatus assumes their current operating structure and prevents much change.
The bank execs, IMO, assume that "blockchains" are new enough that they fall outside of their regulatory purview. That's why I think they prefer to use the word. This makes the blockchain hype warranted, at least to the people who see through it.

A poisson distribution has a constant rate parameter. In the short run, changes in hashrate have an effect on the rate parameter in the Poisson process which will increase the likelihood of rare events. Gavin's code isn't realistic.

They won't be running an actual blockchain as we understand them. There is no need for proof of work and all that jazz, so they won't waste the money.
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:25:17
Sure, they do now. But as blocksize grows and the community (and true believers who will become more scarce) becomes more diluted, businesses will just outsource this.
Note also that having Coinbase run a node does *not* help decentralization. They are regulated, so pressure can be applied by governments into the software they run.
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:02:04
So let's fix that with a 20 MB block size?
@_date: 2015-12-06 21:59:21
That would have worked too. The point is that Peggy demonstrates knowledge [that the drinks are different] without sharing the knowledge [which is which, or equivalently, how to distinguish between them].
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:51:44
Yes, it's rough. What if the remaining 10% move every 13 months?
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:43:08
$1 is your number, not mine.
The point is that bitcoin isn't responsive to the demand for security on the network. Simply raising the blocksize is not a solution, solves no current problem, and opens up the network to new attack vectors.
@_date: 2015-06-07 23:48:33
That's an assertion, not an argument. Read the thread and back with an argument.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:30:02
That might be nice, but I don't see much use for it economically. What actual use is there that bitcoin cannot do? Doing the exact same computation on 5000 computers at once is worse than doing it on my home desktop. My desktop is fast and free. And even if that is useful, if nobody hodls the tokens, they won't have any value. Money doesn't need to be turing complete.
And I *strongly* feel it's a bad investment re. its fundamentals. It has no adoption and can be incorporated into bitcoin or copied and bootstrapped as a "gift" to bitcoiners, like I wrote initially.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:45:48


We will have no miners if bitcoin becomes too centralized to offer any benefit. This approach dicincentivizes spam yet doesn't impose a hard cap and prevents the death spiral of decreasing difficulty (I'm pretty sure; I'll have to reread and think this through), followed by decreasing fees. Try to understand the issues at play before asserting yourself.
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:53:18
Lol. You *would* say so Erik.
We anons don't always get the benefit of the doubt!
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:16:11
Nope, that's not where decentralization comes from. Businesses are regulated anyway, so they are easy nodes to attack through government. Plus, they can always outsource their running of nodes, which they will if it becomes expensive.
[This is what decentralizes bitcoin.](
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:31:19




I'm an ancap, but I can't stand this simplistic kind of thinking on Olivier's part which is common to many libertarians. Independent people will just *stop* running full nodes if blocks are too big. This is *not* the type of thing you can respond, "well, just upgrade, or bitcoin will die". We don't *want* bitcoin's survival to depend on altruism.
@_date: 2015-12-05 23:34:17

I don't advocate "crippling" anything. Try having an honest discussion?
Do you see no downsides to raising blocksizes 5 or 10x?
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:40:54
I don't think you can resort to "it'll average out". It is perfectly plausible that all coins that are owned move every 15 months, every 13 months, or every 4 months.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:43:15
The question isn't whether there is congestion. The question is *at what price are we comfortable as a minimum transaction fee?*
Blocks will always be full, because empty space in a block, at least for current blocksize, has minuscule opportunity cost.

I think *vastly* more than that.


Take a snapshot right now: you'll see some coins that move every day, others that move every week, others every year, and others that haven't moved yet. Have they not moved because they move every 20 years? Every 50? Never?
That (critically important question) depends on details about the right-tail of the distribution that we just can't know.

I don't mind clarifying:
Bitcoin cannot scale at our current technological state, where "scale" is defined as "hosting and relaying all transactions". There are three long-term options:
1. Keep bitcoin's data structure, let bandwidth determine the maximum TPS, and trust technological progress (while risking unknown-at-the-moment attacks and known centralization pressures).
2. Change bitcoin's data structure to make it scalable at current technological levels (this is hard and perhaps impossible, but I doubt it).
3. Impose a blocksize limit at X MB, let fees allocate the high-value bundled settlement transactions, and the rest will be broadcasted off-blockchain to be moved to the blockchain when necessary. This is a compromise, but can also be thought of as a sub-class of strategy 2, where there are competitive non-blockchains in a hub-and-spoke arrangement with the hub being the decentralized blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:18:45


Nope, this is simplistic. Miners get paid, not node operators. This is a substantial third-party effect and underpins the threat to decentralization.
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:26:48




This presumes you know the shape of the demand curve for txs. You don't. You can in principle fit all of the transactions by making the blocksize infinitely large, but the total cumulative fees can be almost zero.

I just responded to another post of yours. We can move the conversation here.


I agree, it's nonlinear. I think centralization tendencies are already quite strong.


You have a good point on the first half: more users of bitcoin will protect it from excessive regulation. But there is currently *no* economic incentive to run a full node. However, I agree that we can expect more full nodes as adoption grows for altruistic reasons.


I don't think it will limit participation very much at all. Changetip is completely off-blockchain and has gotten people excited about bitcoin. As prices rise, people will consolidate transactions more and waste blockspace less.
My bitcoins, the ones I have saved, are put at risk when decentralization is threatened. If I have to pay even $5 when and if I move them to an off-blockchain settlement service for free transactions, that's fine by me. As long as I can spend a few dollars to retrieve my bitcoins trustlessly, bitcoin will be providing immense value.
@_date: 2015-12-05 02:10:31


2016. If the price increases ten-fold during this period, then also will the transaction fees,
rendering Bitcoin Blockchain viable as an inter-banking clearing system, but not a
payment network.
The economics here are wrong. Transaction fees are a function *only* of the opportunity cost of including a tx in the blockchain. That cost should be measured in a stable currency, not bitcoin. That cost is independent of the price of bitcoin.
That said, very exciting!

That's incredibly simplistic. Raising the blocksize doesn't scale bitcoin. Raising it past a point (somewhere in the 1/2 to 5 MB range) *hurts* all of the other things we worry about. There are no easy optimizations of these core parameters.

I don't think it would happen immediately, although I won't rule out malicious attacks as have been referred to in the discussions wherein miners fill up blocks on purpose and use a Selfish Mining strategy to 51% attack the network.


Doesn't this seem a little glib? Nielsen's Law can't last forever, and evidently it only applies to high-end internet users. During the next bubble, transaction volume will spike, possibly into the 10 MB per block range, potentially causing serious trouble.
We know that bitcoin cannot scale in its current form. Why run the risk of collapse just yet? There is no rush. Meanwhile, people will naturally use off-blockchain settlement companies for unimportant transactions, and the blockchain for high-value ones.
@_date: 2015-06-01 05:23:51
I think that's an abuse of the already abusive phrase "social contract". I'm well aware that the block limit was a kludge and Satoshi didn't intend, at the time, to keep it permanent.
Either way, you say unlimited (?) blocksize is part of the social contract; I say decentralization is. They are, as far as we know, at odds with one another.
All of what I hear about how with a 1MB blocksize for much longer "bitcoin will be for the rich only" is just leftist nonsense. The market will allocate the finite resource of bitcoin's blockspace efficiently. It will likely go to companies that process transactions on an internal ledger and settle on the blockchain only when necessary, or when users are willing to pay to move their spending coins to cold storage.

1. They are almost 0. The hashrate would be 1/200th the size if there were no block subsidy.
2. The only reason they aren't lower is because mining is pretty centralized and the pools impose the rules on their miners. If mining were more competitive, the fees would fall further.

@_date: 2015-12-31 19:36:50
Well, in a long term view it is reasonable to think it is. Funding the network has to, ultimately, come from competition for block space.
In my view, there might very well be better more robust solutions in 10+ years when block reward falls so the technical security concerns are the best argument in favor of a limited block size.

@_date: 2015-12-01 19:30:16


You are incredibly ill-informed. The fact that miners *can* mine big blocks opens up new attack vectors and causes centralization of *nodes*, who have no say.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:21:00
Keep repeating that. It doesn't make it true. Bitcoin will be very easily attacked with no maximum block size. There are no easy solutions (except sidechains and LN).

You're really grasping at straws here. Variance in the number of coins issued per day because of the randomness of the mining process is minuscule. And in terms of the % inflation, even more trivial.


"Average", not "ideal". It was just an arbitrary choice and bitcoin would have been fine if Satoshi picked 8 minutes or 12 minutes.

@_date: 2015-06-01 05:43:13
I wish your first paragraph were right, but you're missing something: people can benefit from short-term changes in the price. If Ghash were to go rogue (or .gov, Western Union, etc..), its operators could profit immensely by shorting bitcoin first.
Why haven't they done this? Probably a lot of reasons, but I don't want bitcoin's robustness to depend on goodwill, altruism, or community activism.
I haven't seen a good counterpoint to the shorting argument and have brought it up many times before.


If everyone were reasonable, we could. But raising is a lot easier than lowering, especially if bitcoin takes off in adoption. Far more money would be at stake and the community wouldn't be as close. I don't expect rationality to overcome.


Not in detail, but the backlog was cleared in a few blocks after people were *trying* to overwhelm it. I think we're good for a while, but I wouldn't be outraged by a increase to ~3 or 4 MB. As fees rise if blocks become full, people will economize. That's not the worst thing in the world.

There was a day when *every* front-page post was about XT, which was threatening a hardfork and would be (by definition) an altcoin. They have always allowed the discussion as long as it's not that excessive and redundant, but they used the fact that it is an altcoin to justify deleting the torrent of new threads about it.
Since then, the only topics being censored by mods are spam and things that violate the guidelines listed on the right of the page.
Plus, there has been a daily sticky'd thread about scaling where XT is mentioned regularly. There is also total freedom with respect to talking about Bip 101.
On the other hand, the Big Blockers have been conducting their own censorship campaign by regularly brigading threads and disrupting actual discussion.


Yes. When the XT brigadiers repeat "you're censoring me!" enough times, people get the idea that XT brigadiers are being censored.

That's not elegant either. Bitcoins can't scale, so raising blocksizes is fundamentally doomed. And if blocksizes are not reached, when the block subsidy ends, transaction fees will not be able to support the network.
Meni's proposal would solve the problem, but is not particularly elegant.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:18:47
~~No~~ Not literally "nobody". But if a blocksize increase is granted every time the limit is *almost* hit, then there is no blocksize max.

A few did, I'm sure. But it's been almost two years since then.


I'm for a moderate increase in block size (a doubling or tripling) just to get you fanatics to shut up, followed by more work into improving bitcoin's scalability. Increasing bitcoin's blocksize is not a solution to scaling, and has other known and unknown risks.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:34:22


Please do so, especially if you continue to bring it up in this thread.


That's what we're doing.


(b) is the only important point. Nobody would require it if there were no financial incentive.
The financial incentive is *very difficult* to attach to operating a full node (and perhaps impossible). That is, after all, what mining was supposed to do. There is always division of labor.
The next best thing is to ensure that the *costs* of running a full node are low. That is what I'm arguing for and what is behind much of this debate. You don't get to say, "the REAL problem is [some irreconcilable issue] thus, let me monkey with the rest of the protocol and prevent the second-best solution."

What kind of libertarian doesn't see the tragedy of the commons here?


Why would businesses run nodes themselves? If it comes to this, there will be economies of scale that businesses can take advantage of by outsourcing their running of nodes to dedicated companies (if, indeed, they care). I guarantee those companies will be regulated and bitcoin will be ruined if that happens.


No. It obviously does by lowering the cost of running a node.

Your "free-market equilibrium" block size ignores the effect on the cost of running a node.

I'm optimistic. Everyone who holds bitcoin has an interest in maintaining a robust network, whatever that looks like.
It can also be implemented directly in a sidechain so anyone who wants to use it can. Over time and as the subsidy decreases everyone will migrate their coins to the tree-chain sidechain.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:42:17


I'm sorry, but this is nonsense. We can begin this discussion again when transaction fees are $1, but until then, people will slowly switch to using off-blockchain companies like Changetip or Coinbase as their small-value spending wallets and use bitcoin's blockchain when they want to store their coins themselves. The market will allocate accordingly.

These numbers are made up.


Yes, this is what will happen either way. Bitcoin, in its current incarnation, **scales poorly**. Every transaction does *not* need to be broadcasted to each and every node on planet Earth.
People *will* be transacting off blockchain through settlement companies which then bundle up transactions regularly (weekly, monthly, daily, etc..) and publish them to the blockchain.
...unless bitcoin's core data structure is changed (or we experience a 10,000x increase in bandwidth, processing power, storage, etc..).
Right now, there is no proposal being seriously considered, so the first option is what we should do until people work out the kinks on a new structure of the blockchain. Changing the blocksize threatens bitcoin's core advantage and is at best a kludge.

Yes, you're right. But as blocks become bigger, the relative advantage of mining in a big pool is increased. Bitcoin's security strategy shouldn't depend on people leaving money on the table by mining solo (or for a smaller pool). This is especially valid when you consider that profits will become small in mining, so large-pool mining might be the *only* way to remain profitable.
Once, or before, that happens, regulation will follow.
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:25:00
The opportunity cost is the *profit*, not the *revenue*! This changes the calculation dramatically.


You might have 51% (or 30% or less depending on economies of scale via selfish mining), have made up your capital outlay from mining revenue, and *then* take out an enormous short which can absolutely be far higher than expected mining profits given as revenue - marginal cost for electricity.

@_date: 2015-12-18 19:47:01


Absolutely wrong. The difficulty is essentially 1-1 with block reward (holding time constant; new tech increases difficulty).
Your thinking implies that if there were no block reward, transaction fees would rise. This is false, as evidenced by the real (constant dollar) value change in block reward as the price went from 200 -&gt; 1000 -&gt; 200. Transaction fees did NOT swing to offset that massive change in block reward.
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:30:52
Yeah. But there are other ways of doing that. More importantly is the ZERO part in ZKPs.
Think about what information Peggy *is* conveying to Viktor:
Suppose Vik tests her in this order: {Switch, Switch, Don't Switch, Switch, Don't Switch, Don't Switch}. 
Peggy responds in this order: {Switched, Switched, Not switched, Switched, Not switched, Not switched}.
All Viktor sees is that she is correct 6 times in a row. If Peggy were bluffing, she would likely be wrong at least once. Viktor concludes that she must know something. That's it. Peggy conveyed ZERO information to Viktor other than "I know the truth".
Peggy is then free to prove her knowledge to anyone in the world, any number of times. She will never leak any information and doesn't have to worry about any sort of statistical analysis or attack to figure out exactly *what* she knows.

@_date: 2015-06-01 05:43:13
I wish your first paragraph were right, but you're missing something: people can benefit from short-term changes in the price. If Ghash were to go rogue (or .gov, Western Union, etc..), its operators could profit immensely by shorting bitcoin first.
Why haven't they done this? Probably a lot of reasons, but I don't want bitcoin's robustness to depend on goodwill, altruism, or community activism.
I haven't seen a good counterpoint to the shorting argument and have brought it up many times before.


If everyone were reasonable, we could. But raising is a lot easier than lowering, especially if bitcoin takes off in adoption. Far more money would be at stake and the community wouldn't be as close. I don't expect rationality to overcome.


Not in detail, but the backlog was cleared in a few blocks after people were *trying* to overwhelm it. I think we're good for a while, but I wouldn't be outraged by a increase to ~3 or 4 MB. As fees rise if blocks become full, people will economize. That's not the worst thing in the world.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:26:33


That's only half of the centralization concern. Raising the limit will also reduce the number of full nodes and push more miners into mining pools.

Sure, in a fixed world where tx fees don't change with demand. There is no theoretical reason for why the revenue maximizing block size is larger than 1 MB. Not saying that it isn't , but you are saying that it is.


You're not familiar with logic. Read what I wrote carefully because your response is nonsense.


Bitcoin isn't a charity. Having every full node on planet earth broadcast and store your transaction should not be cheap. Just transact off-chain and settle on-chain.

This seems so damn obvious it's frightening Gavin and Mike don't see this. Sending every single tx on planet Earth to every single node is a huge waste. You'll need Visa-sized servers to handle that traffic, with correspondingly few full nodes.
The blockchain data structure needs to change if it's to handle that capacity.
Otherwise, you're right; systems will have to be built on it and sent to the blockchain, which will be kept scarce.
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:11:45
You're a simpleton.
Reading a little of your posting history confirms this. It also sounds like you're a libertarian, which embarrasses me, as a libertarian.


Difficulty adjusts, so there is no cost floor over a long time frame. What is the long-run consequence on price of a tx in a competitive market in which costs have no floor?
The price approaches 0, as does the total amount spent securing the network. It is shameful that you can't understand this.
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:54:19
Are you all this dense? 
Thanks for the tautology. Yes, you have to acquire once before you can hold forever.
That still allows for the fact that every human being on Earth can hold bitcoin, while only a fraction of them can transact with bitcoin daily, contrary to jratcliff's silly comment.
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:18:48
And this of course decisively resolves the ridiculous objection, *but using deflationary money, nobody will ever spend any bitcoins!*
I've actually heard people who claim to know something about finance say that.
The counterargument is simple: if the real rate of return measured in bitcoin were higher than the real rate of return measured in dollars, I would borrow dollars, buy bitcoin, lend out bitcoin, and become a multi-billionaire without taking any risk.
Now, while bitcoin becomes widely adopted, bitcoin's appreciation might in fact be higher than the return on dollars, but that's only because there is considerable risk. This will only happen during the adoption phase of bitcoin and summarily explains why Satoshi has a million of them.

* On the block size debate, Meni Rosenfeld has an interesting perspective and understands well the relevant debate points voiced [here]( (regarding the ultimate equilibrium transaction price if the blocksize cap were not reached and the resource--blockspace were "unlimited" essentially).
* [Nick Szabo's]( cypherpunk perspective (and his recent work) would also be awesome to hear from!

My god you're stupid. This implies a geometric mean over each time interval you're looking at.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:07:41


These numbers are made up.


Yes, this is what will happen either way. Bitcoin, in its current incarnation, **scales poorly**. Every transaction does *not* need to be broadcasted to each and every node on planet Earth.
People *will* be transacting off blockchain through settlement companies which then bundle up transactions regularly (weekly, monthly, daily, etc..) and publish them to the blockchain.
...unless bitcoin's core data structure is changed (or we experience a 10,000x increase in bandwidth, processing power, storage, etc..).
Right now, there is no proposal being seriously considered, so the first option is what we should do until people work out the kinks on a new structure of the blockchain. Changing the blocksize threatens bitcoin's core advantage and is at best a kludge.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:23:08
Bitcoin's next patch should require that its value always rises, cannot be used for black market activity, and gives out free bitcoins to anyone who mines regardless of hashpower.
That would solve the problems, right?
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:06:26
Sadly, you're still missing the point. The overall security *should* depend on only how much people want that security. Unfortunately, it doesn't.
To address your question, there is no number that will "make a 3.5tps system secure", only different points on a continuum of tradeoffs. Same for a 1,000 tx/s system. 
The problem with a 1,000 tx/s system (in bitcoin's current form) is that large blocks open new attack vectors and by no means ensure that the network's security is high. At some point, large blocks reduce security.
I don't think you understand the dynamics.

Nobody has any specific incentive to do that.


Regulated companies that have no interest in decentralization. I'm surprised you hadn't considered this.

As someone who typically likes your contributions (although we've argued in the past about similar issues),
there was no social contract for a 1 MB limit. The social contract, if there is one, is to create a decentralized, unregulatable form of money that cannot be inflated nor censored. The reality is bitcoin, in its current form, cannot scale without sacrificing decentralization.
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:31:43
Here goes:
2 x 1.75 = 3.5.
2 x 2.00 = 4.
So if the block size is 2 MB with SW, it is roughly equivalent to a 3.5 to 4.0 block size without SW.
Get it?
@_date: 2015-12-29 05:55:23

"Stress testing" it again and again is just terrorist tactics to promote a change to the blocksize. After the first stress test, you're not testing anything new.
@_date: 2015-06-07 23:00:52
Meni proposes a (larger) soft limit on the blocksize, beyond which there would be an increasing marginal cost imposed on miners for solving large blocks. This ensures that the fees that miners receive will not be bid down to near-zero (a good thing!) which would be the case if there were no blocksize limit*, yet also prevents disaster (chaos, pandemonium, etc..) if a hard limit is reached and transactions accumulate forever.
*For more information on this, [see here](

If I don't think increasing the blocksize by 20x is advisable, it means I want blocks to remain at 1 MB forever?

You forgot "supposedly" and "a single LN supporter".
Also, I would like the link to remark and evidence that it wasn't taken out of context.
For example, if people stupidly insist on sending 0-fee transactions, I think it's also acceptable that they wait. There is simply no other option; demand to transact is unbounded if it's free.

Yes, miners will adjust so profit per miner will maximize. This can happen when total revenue is very small. Security depends on total revenue. Because the difficulty adjusts, there is no floor on costs, so revenue and security can fall while profit per miner remains stable.


The answer isn't a number I make up. I want something closer to a market that is responsive to everyone's demands for security.

Jratcliff's comment:


At 500 bytes per transaction, that's 2,000 transactions every 1 MB. Assuming the blocksize is held constant, I can divide 2,000 into "a few million" to get the total number of blocks. Let's call that quotient 3,000.
Three-thousand blocks is about 21 days. Twenty-one days is not "never" right?
Seventy-years, by the way, is also not "never".
So it seems like a few million people *can* hold value on the bitcoin blockchain. It turns out, any number of people can. I'll say it again: flow vs. stock.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:12:19

My bitcoin balance provides access to investments, discounts, and micropayments that I could not feasibly take advantage of otherwise. I find this so valuable that I currently pay a ~10% fee through inflation to subsidize the strength of the network.
When inflation ends, if blocksize is not scarce, there will be no security on the bitcoin network.

I think that's an abuse of the already abusive phrase "social contract". I'm well aware that the block limit was a kludge and Satoshi didn't intend, at the time, to keep it permanent.
Either way, you say unlimited (?) blocksize is part of the social contract; I say decentralization is. They are, as far as we know, at odds with one another.
All of what I hear about how with a 1MB blocksize for much longer "bitcoin will be for the rich only" is just leftist nonsense. The market will allocate the finite resource of bitcoin's blockspace efficiently. It will likely go to companies that process transactions on an internal ledger and settle on the blockchain only when necessary, or when users are willing to pay to move their spending coins to cold storage.

As someone who typically likes your contributions (although we've argued in the past about similar issues),
there was no social contract for a 1 MB limit. The social contract, if there is one, is to create a decentralized, unregulatable form of money that cannot be inflated nor censored. The reality is bitcoin, in its current form, cannot scale without sacrificing decentralization.

I just responded to another post of yours. We can move the conversation here.


I agree, it's nonlinear. I think centralization tendencies are already quite strong.


You have a good point on the first half: more users of bitcoin will protect it from excessive regulation. But there is currently *no* economic incentive to run a full node. However, I agree that we can expect more full nodes as adoption grows for altruistic reasons.


I don't think it will limit participation very much at all. Changetip is completely off-blockchain and has gotten people excited about bitcoin. As prices rise, people will consolidate transactions more and waste blockspace less.
My bitcoins, the ones I have saved, are put at risk when decentralization is threatened. If I have to pay even $5 when and if I move them to an off-blockchain settlement service for free transactions, that's fine by me. As long as I can spend a few dollars to retrieve my bitcoins trustlessly, bitcoin will be providing immense value.

For off-blockchain transactions, payment processors like Coinbase, Neo + Bee, and competitors can settle bitcoin transactions on the same scale as Visa.

I don't think it would happen immediately, although I won't rule out malicious attacks as have been referred to in the discussions wherein miners fill up blocks on purpose and use a Selfish Mining strategy to 51% attack the network.


Doesn't this seem a little glib? Nielsen's Law can't last forever, and evidently it only applies to high-end internet users. During the next bubble, transaction volume will spike, possibly into the 10 MB per block range, potentially causing serious trouble.
We know that bitcoin cannot scale in its current form. Why run the risk of collapse just yet? There is no rush. Meanwhile, people will naturally use off-blockchain settlement companies for unimportant transactions, and the blockchain for high-value ones.
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:26:30
Addresses are 160-bit hashes of public keys, which are 256 bits. If 160 bits is ever remotely close to not being enough, then you can just add on a few more characters to the address up until 256 bits. If we need more than 256 bits, we'll have to use larger public/private keys, which is a minor, but more substantial change than making addresses longer.

It's funny. The word "instant" to most people is *perfectly* appropriate to describe bitcoin.
Most people don't even consider the concept of reversibility of payments.
And even so, bitcoin *is* effectively irreversible after a few seconds because of the reasons you said. Plus, a 15-minute window until irreversibility should almost never be a problem in practice. Of all potential transactions, the intersection between large ones that are worthwhile to steal, where waiting ~15-minutes is problematic (it takes more than 15 minutes to buy a car), and where no parties have a reputation to uphold or any means of exchanging identifying information is very small.

Happy to help. The relevant comparison is *market capitalization*, not price per unit, because units are arbitrary.
So relative to the dollar, *all* digital currencies are waay less valuable than the dollar. But this doesn't mean that they are all equally good investments; nobody is going to argue that hobonickels is going to approach the market cap of bitcoin.
If you want to own some, first buy a fraction of a bitcoin (it's the most stable by far and you'll need it to buy any altcoin), and *read* and *keep reading* before you risk it all in an uninformed bet on some altcoin. If you inform yourself, you'll most likely come to the conclusion that the vast majority of veteran bitcoiners have: *no* altcoin that currently exists offers enough (or any) advantages that will make it replace bitcoin; most will disappear forever.

1. To me, this is silly. It's a meme that will get old sooner or later. Once it does, dogecoin will slink back into obscurity.
2. I meant **a** Satoshi. I.e. the atomic unit of a bitcoin.
3. I don't think you do get as much doge/day on either pool. And user interface can always be tweaked. The fact is, large pools have a benefit. We've seen how important this was for ghash.io and you'll see an even more exaggerated form of it in dogecoin, if it makes it that far.
4. This is also a weak argument and unrelated to the point I was making. The fact is, SHA2 is likely better for security than scrypt because of what I described. Saying "o well, they'll probably just attack hobonickels" is not an argument. For one, the economics suggests that the ratio of risk/reward is independent of the size of the coin. If you want big reward, you'll attack the big coins.
And dogecoin is new. Of course it's going to have less history. But soon, dogecoin will be old, and (by that logic) a new coin will replace it with less history.

1. People will use what's most convenient for them, so ultimately, I don't think this is an important issue. However, I could say the same about 1 Dogecoin being 1/100,000,000,000 of the total supply (or whatever it is). Lastly, what about the flipside? Will people say "wow, that car costs 100,000 Dogecoin. I can't afford that big of a number."
2. Even if all BTC are lost except for one, you can just change the protocol and increase the integer amount of units. On the user-side, all you'll see is a Satoshi suddenly being more divisible. This isn't a theoretical problem, and is certainly not a practical one.
3. That's not what I mean. I mean that when the blockrate is high, highly connected miners, like in mining pools, have ever-increasing advantages, because they get a head-start on mining the next block while distantly-connected miners still have to wait for the old block to download. A 5 second head start is important when the blockrate is 1 second; it's less important when it's 100 minutes.
4. That's not really a counterargument; that's just an argument that a 51% attack is *hard*. I agree; it's hard for all coins. My argument was that by virtue of the economics, attacks on scrypt coins may be easier than attacks on SHA2.

I agree that the demand indicates that the bitcoin network has *some* value, but that doesn't mean that a change in price means that the value of the bitcoin network has changed.
Say, the velocity of BTC doubles, so the price per bitcoin halves (as does market cap). That doesn't mean that the value of the bitcoin network has halved.

Still, not quite true. If the market cap of money counts as wealth, then rising money velocity would make us poorer.

Yep. You're definitely right in that it's not a concern yet. But predictability doesn't help in any other way than allowing us to rest easy for a few more halvings at least.


It's not exactly about predictability and the self-adjusting fee mechanism doesn't address this problem if it's not hardcoded into the protocol and impossible to subvert. But still, that just begs the question of deciding what is the correct market-based transaction fee.


The adjusting difficulty of the network actually *is* what creates this problem. You're right that it's many halvings away. It's can also certainly be eliminated and is best understood as an interesting theoretical possibility.
I'll describe the problem. It takes place when the block subsidy declines to zero:
1. Because the cost to include a transaction into a block is negligible, as long as there's space in a block (and minimal opportunity cost), miners will include every transaction with a nonzero fee.
2. As more and more people see that txs with smaller fees still get included in the most current block, people will lower the amount of fees they offer.
3. Since there is now less revenue being competed for, some miners become unprofitable and stock mining. The difficulty adjusts.
4. Go to step 1. Repeat until fees are 1 Satoshi, or network is so weak that it can be attacked and/or the protocol is forced to change.

You said you cannot lose your "principle" (sic) investing in bonds. Presumably, you meant T-bills which are guaranteed. If I buy gov't debt and the currency inflates 30% over 5 years, I have lost *real wealth*, in the same way that I lost *real wealth* if I buy BTC and the price falls.
Recall in your comment:


You cannot lose the dollar-denominated value in a guaranteed bond. But you can lose the real value. Same as BTC.

There is no point of saving without spending. I agree.


But the amount they pay is not in proportion to the amount they spend. Someone who uses the network, say a company that processes off-blockchain transactions, can effectively siphon millions of dollars of tx fees from rewarding the miners. They can hold thousands of coins in cold storage and transact on the network almost never, while benefiting from the security that everyone else pays for enormously.


Ok, I'm on board.

I agree. But I said, "(theoretically) perfect". Many markets in real life are theoretically perfect, in that prices always converge in the right direction, or can do so. I'm not exactly trying to be precise, but was relatively careful; theoretical perfection is a weaker condition than perfection.
I don't think bitcoin can ever be theoretically perfect because it is inherently a collective effort; like any other business or organization, there are thousands of miniscule market failures and inefficiencies.

Yeah, I was being somewhat tongue-in-cheek. But I'll respond:
* This can also be implemented in Bitcoin via insurance. With credit cards, you don't have the option.
* Same thing with Bitcoin, except the confirmation is faster. That's unequivocally better.
* No response. I think you're agreeing with me. Surely a flat fee for transactions makes more sense than a proportional one.
* "Denominated in fiat" means that I have to hold dollars to pay off the bill. Dollars are guaranteed to lose value, so I'm hurting myself by holding cash balances. This is a weak point, because I can obviously sell Bitcoins/investments to pay off the bill, but it's a hassle.
* I understand your point, but there is a *fundamental* difference: ultimately, your CC info is protected by non-confidential information, not a 256 bit number that never needs to be revealed.
Finally, keep in mind that disputing identity theft, charges, etc all require expenses in time and money. Bitcoin is leaner and allows you to *choose* the level of protection you want.
If you can think of something (a good thing) that a CC can do and Bitcoin simply cannot, respond with it and I'll agree that it's an upside. But it's *not* fair to call a mandatory feature of CCs an "upside" simply because Bitcoin doesn't come with it standard.

That's the hard part. In bitcoin, this analogous problem is solved by the proof of work scheme.

But in order to entice people to mine it and secure the network, it *has* to have a large amount of value.


That's an absurd implication and you know it. Contracts are not going to cost "B units of ether regardless of its exchange rate". Vitalik isn't stupid. If there is not a lot of ether, then contracts will cost less ether; if there is a lot of ether, contracts will cost a lot of ether. This cost of broadcasting a transaction on through ethereum is completely transparent to nominal pricing.
Again, they *need* ether to have a high market cap and/or inflation rate in order to secure the network. If the inflation rate is too high, the market cap will be small because nobody will want to hold it. Evidently you don't understand this. It is a difficult balance to strike.

By 100% of the miners? Of course not. Not even a majority is necessary. In fact, as long as there are new miners willing to make money mining for bitcoin 2.0, I don't see a problem.
If there is a new POW method that will ensure decentralization, the users of bitcoin will prefer it, and will be willing to pay $600 each for bitcoins on *that* fork. New miners performing the new POW will mine on it, and old miners will howl and complain that the coins they are mining aren't worth anything, but to no effect.
I don't agree that miners have the power that you think they have. This is just a matter of making bitcoin 2.0 substantially better that the tipping point for everyone to be willing to spend money on the new bitcoins is low. Where do I go wrong?

Nonsense. Real affects real and nominal affects nominal (provided the changes are steady). The price of most things measured in oil has been deflating for dozens of years but there's no reason to think that everyone will simply hold oil instead of investing.

Nope. And I'm still not sure that you actually understood what the trade-off is between high and low blockrates. Recall, you missed the point entirely a few replies ago, I clarified, and you didn't respond.


No. It's first-mover advantage is obviously enormous, but if you were actually reading what I wrote, you'd know that I was presenting *counterpoints* to what **you** assumed to be clear advantages of dogecoin. I, as do some developers of bitcoin, think proof of stake is probably a better system than proof of work. I worry about whether bitcoin will be able to have an efficient market in mining fees, I worry about bitcoin's lack of anonymity, and much more. I just don't think any coin yet created can or will overpower bitcoin's first-mover advantage.
If you think *dogecoin* can, you're delusional. It's most significant advantage is that it was created during a bearish period in bitcoin's history, is based upon a silly meme that people think is a new paradigm for cryptocurrency. That's it.

Consider that the same argument ("people will never invest/spend") applies to inflationary currencies equally well:
An inflationary currency has a nominal interest rate that is much higher than a deflationary one. Why would you ever spend your money if you can just put it in a bank and get interest ~= inflation rate + real interest rate?
The answer is obvious: the real interest rate, not the nominal one, is what influences/is influenced by relative amounts of investment vs. consumption.

"Dollars will never catch on because they can't be reversed."

Maybe "wealth" isn't a good word to use. Personally, you're wealthy if you have money. But creating money doesn't increase society's wealth. Those statements are true because they use the word "wealth" in different ways.

Gotcha. I'm actually unsure about the fiat withdrawal status of Canadians. Might want to search this subreddit for that info. 
Worst case scenario, you send your fiat in, MtGox is insolvent, goes bankrupt, and it takes a while to reclaim your funds/they disappear
Second worst: you initiate wire transfer, bitcoin corrects, Mtgox price goes back above Bistamp's and you buy, or withdraw, taking some losses along the way.
Best case: you buy loads of coins, everything is fine, you withdraw your BTC *ASAP* to an offline wallet and enjoy the post-panic appreciation with ridiculous profit.
Edit: At the risk of overwhelming you, and assuming this situation lasts a few more days, you can make some risk-free profit by buying BTC on MtGox, sending them to bitcoinbuilder.com and selling them for "real BTC" (about a 60% profit at the moment).

A local "bank" allows me to denominate some of my bitcoins in a centralized digital currency (don't invest more than you can afford to lose!). Because it's centralized, more money can be created in case my bank lends too much into existence and I can't redeem it for cash, as a safeguard.

Here's another way to think about it, considering that if I reuse an address whose priv key someone long ago deleted from their computer, there's no risk:
There are over a million million million million million million million million addresses. Each of those addresses is 20 bytes. In reality, you'll also need the 32 byte priv key, but that only roughly doubles the size of the storage needed.
To store that information (no priv key), you'd need more than 20 million million million million yottabytes of storage capacity. 
From Wikipedia:


So you'd need roughly 6 billion planet earths full of data-centers to store 1 trillionth of the addresses in the allowed space (and FORGET about searching those planets to find the key that you need to steal the funds). Still, to be safe, once Mars becomes a datacenter for Bitcoin addresses, we can start to think about changing the address space to 256 bits, requiring 10^28 times more storage space.

Wait a minute. GDP is supposed to be a metric *of* economic progress; nobody is accusing anybody of mistaking it *for* economic progress. What is saying amounts to, "some economists are wrong because they believe that GDP is the best current measure of economic progress even though it could be improved by changing a parameter".


It includes military spending, for example. One can call that "production" if one likes, but if GDP is supposed to be a way to measure overall wealth, then something seems wrong when one group of people can tax your money, spend it on destroying other people's property, and are validated by a higher GDP. Taxation and war are involuntary and subvert the price system, which is the only way you can reliably tell how much something is worth.


You're right, there's nothing wrong. The question is, what should the right coefficient be? If governments are providing public goods, then the cost of them is worth considerably less than their value, in which case the multiplier should be &gt;1. If they are causing harm, then the multiplier should be &lt;0. Either way, economists might very well be wrong.

Not at all. There is always an amount by which you can lower your prices when your costs fall that will increase your profit. If costs fall by $10 per unit and you decrease your price by $5, not only do you increase your profit by $5 per unit--you pick up extra sales because of the lower price. The amount by which you should lower your price depends on how price-sensitive your customers are, which depends on factors that only you can estimate.
If you are the only supplier in the area, you will likely be able to get away with capturing more of the savings yourself; if you have many competitors, to maximize profit you'll have to pass on most of the savings to your customers.

Hence, meaningless advice. You cannot, except in theory, know a rate of return on an investment. There are always tradeoffs and the recommendation to "diversify" without any reference to a metric of diversification is unhelpful.
This is like telling someone, "nutritional theory says that eating healthy food and avoiding unhealthy food will make you healthy".
Additionally, is "assuming equal average rates of return, choose the portfolio with the lowest variance in rate of return" supposed to be profound? Maybe I'm just smart, but that's obvious and unhelpful. What's a good trade off for low variance vs. high expected rate of return? Since expected rates of return are never identical, you may *never* have the opportunity to follow your almost tautological advice.

You're right. As an FYI, the network keeps track of 21 quadrillion Satoshis, rather than 21,000,000.00000000 Bitcoins. That is, integer multiples of Satoshis, rather than decimals of bitcoins.
When people talk about further subdividing Bitcoins, say, by 100 times, the method is to add more 'Satoshis'--effectively multiplying everybody's balance by 10^2, so there would be 2,100 quadrillion atomic units of Bitcoin.
You can think about it as inflation, except by a power of 10 and given to everybody in proportion to their own BTC balances. As end-users, all we'll see is suddenly our 1,000 Satoshis are 1,000.00 Satoshis or 100,000 Satoshicents. This is the only form of "inflation" that's allowed--wherein *everybody* gets their balance multiplied so relative prices remain the same and distortion to the economy doesn't occur.
So that's the process for subdividing Satoshis. Hope that wasn't unclear.

But it's even worse than that because the manat has an actual economy behind it; HoboNickels does not.
And even if that were the case, the equilibrium state would be that every cryptocoin would have an equal market cap. Do we see this in any currency market anywhere? No.

Let's use words precisely: it's engineered to have a constant supply. Rising productivity will cause prices measured in bitcoin to fall.
The entire dynamic is on the right side of MV=PQ
As Q (output) rises, P (prices) falls proportionally. It is not implied at all that velocity will change. And even if it does, it won't change continually.


The nominal vs. real interest rate distinction is key. A nominal variable like inflation or deflation only affects nominal interest rates, not real ones. As long as the inflation and deflation is steady, there is *no real difference* between the two monetary regimes (besides for the distributional effects because typically only one type of group gets to print the money).
What I am arguing is basic classical economics.

You are being a little sloppy. In your model, rapid adoption won't affect the supply of ether, so that can't be a cause of supply changes. We were talking about **monetary inflation**--that is, changes in **supply**, not demand.
It can be argued by an additional assumption that more newbies might raise the rate of loss of ether, though that gets a little hairy. I don't know much about locking ether up in contracts, but I don't expect the behavior to change rapidly. If ethereum is successful, the vast majority of ether will be used as wealth storage, and only a small percent will be used in contracts. I think you'd agree with me on that, though I don't know enough about the price of contracts to say for certain. Anyway, in an equilibrium state, adoption is flat.


Yes. But individual losses of ether can be expected to average out, so random events will likely not noticeably contract or expand the supply, especially if the currency is distributed widely that far into the future--thus, little opportunity for black swan events like an early adopter throwing out his hard drive, or cashing out. The amplitude of those changes will be small, and the length of time during which successive random changes happen to be in the same direction is idealized as a geometric random variable.


Of course. Best of luck.

To elaborate upon thoughts, isn't a prediction of Peter Todd's theory that deflation (or less inflation) is ultimately more important than a network effect of a large currency?
I suppose once bitcoin reaches equilibrium, any new coin that is less inflationary but has all of the other benefits of a digital currency can become initially adopted and kick off a positive feedback loop until everyone uses it and it parasitizes the network upon which it is built.
Seems to me like this is am empirical issue: at what point does the attractiveness of lower inflation exceed the attractiveness of using a stable, large currency?

To me, the most frustrating part is that no matter what Bitcoin is used for, it will always have *some* value, because it's still useful. It matters zero whether the average Joe is using Bitcoin to pay for coffee, watch Netflix, hold it in his IRA, or is prevented from doing so; 'criminals' can still launder money. The only thing that changes is whether they launder 50,000 $1 bitcoins, or with 1 $50,000 bitcoin.

Fiat money doesn't make this problem any better. A captor can hold someone at ransom for $1,000,000 cash.
**But** if a high net worth individual holds his money in bitcoin, he can protect himself in a number of ways that are unavailable otherwise. Say, a wallet that can only be decrypted with 4/4 biometric keys present. Or one that can only be unlocked after block 500,000. Cleverer people can come up with better solutions.
The key is that a kidnapper can threaten *people* and *people* control the fiat system. It's the downside to discretion. No kidnapper will bother threatening you if you *can't* access the keys.

I haven't spent much time looking into this, but assuming it solves this problem by imposing a floor on fees (say, pegged to some USD amount), which is certainly possible, it's unlikely to be market based and fully capture people's desires for quick and secure transactions in an economically efficient sense.

Six hundred dollars per coin is not a stable price, so it will oscillate wildly until the market decides.
Keep in mind that the EMH makes a strong prediction against speculative bubbles.

More evidence that bankers are some of the most unimaginative of the filthy rich.
1. Bitcoin would *never* be even as widely adopted as it is today if the reward of a return on investment were stamped out by a central authority who debases the currency so it maintains its value as adoption grows. How can you bootstrap a currency that has no promise of growing in value, and no guarantee that it will maintain it's value?
2. The hypothesis that *perhaps* bitcoin is volatile because it's small and speculative, rather than because it's somehow fundamentally broken *isn't even considered* by these MBAs and PhDs.
3. When has a central bank ever *increased* the value for the holders of a currency to counter inflation with deflation? If we wanted stable prices, we'd need, what 2,500% deflation to make up for all of the debasement over the past 100 years?

@_date: 2014-01-08 19:20:55
No, because it won't always go up forever. Once it reaches its ultimate level of adoption, it will stop rising as fast as it is now. It will rise at the rate of 1 - 1/(1+GDPgrowth), which will always be smaller than the nominal interest rate, so you'll still be better off actually investing your money.
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:50:02


Conveniently missed the part about the 2650 BTC, huh?
By the way, $580 * 1,500 = 870,000 at the time of the post, also right about the time of the downtrend in BTC price.


Got any evidence? If I announce that I am about to sell ~1,000 BTC, the price could certainly fall farther, on larger volume, than it would if I sold into the market bids.

You are getting cause and effect reversed. Assuming you're talking about price deflation, low velocity causes lower prices. 
But this is all nominal and doesn't matter. I could just as easily say, "why would a merchant ever accept inflationary fiat when it will be worth less tomorrow? Thus, merchants won't accept fiat and the price will enter an inflationary spiral and the universe will collapse in on itself."
If you think about it, you'll see that I'm right. Both are bogus claims. Prices are an equilibrium.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:01:48
Yeah. I like that talking about the goal of PoW takes the emphasis off of the "complex math". It's not really important *how* consensus is reached.
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:02:32
The antecedent is unclear. I said the *real* rate of return will be positive, as it typically is. So the rate of return measured in bitcoin would be N = I + R, as usual, where N is the nominal interest rate, I is the inflation rate and R is the real rate of return. If the inflation rate is negative, the nominal rate of return would be below the real rate. That's fine. If R, measured in bitcoins vs. R measured in dollars were different, people would loan out the one with a lower R and borrow the one with a higher R until the supply and demand balanced at an equal R for both of them.

OPs example was good:
If I buy $100 dollars of an asset like Oil with my cash and gov't doubles the money supply, my Oil is now worth $200 nominally, but give me no more purchasing power.
Gov't declares I made $100 in capital gains, which is taxed at ~20%, and takes $20 from me. My total portfolio is now worth $180, having risen by 80%, while prices have risen by 100%. 
In the end, the gov't took 10% of my purchasing power ($20 out of $200), leaving me with 90% of my initial.

Online wallets for now. Forgot to mention, you might as well set up a [blockchain.info]( wallet right now. Make sure you use two-factor authentification when you have any meaningful amount of BTC on it. It's the most popular self-managed wallet service.
By contrast, there are more hands-off online wallets like the service at coinbase.com, which necessarily require you to trust the company a little more. From a user's perspective, those feel and look very much like a bank account
Use offline wallets, aka "cold storage", for the majority of your savings if they're substantial, but blockchain.info wallets can be made highly secure with the right precautions.

Not better than [Robin Hanson]( ([short interview](
In a nutshell, prediction markets happen when people put their money where their mouth is by betting on the outcome of current (and hypothetical) events.
Say you don't entirely trust the incentives of the decision makers on foreign policy and think that intervening in the middle east will cause ISIS to gain power. You can go on a prediction market and buy a boatload of assets that says "pays 1 bit if the UN estimates ISIS killings to be above 2,000 by 2016". If there is a lot of demand for this asset, the price will be closer to 1 bit and the implied probability of the event will be close to 100%.
Betters on prediction markets *pay you* to tell them the truth. As awareness grows, the markets become more efficient (better predictors) and more trusted (voters will *demand* that governments do what prediction markets suggest they should).

If your hypothesis is that demand and supply are unchanged, you would predict a steadily decreasing price at around 10% per year. That cannot explain a 10% fall in 3 days. Inflation is well-known and has long been factored in to the price.
The current downtrend is just part of the chaotic volatility

I'd strongly advise against thinking that you can make money by daytrading off the market. The price might fall to $320 and you may get scared and sell.

Lol. You went to blockchain.info and did a little bit of arithmetic.
1. It's impossible to relate this to transactional velocity because there are off-blockchain transactions between different people, and blockchain transactions between one owner's addresses.
2. Why is velocity important to look at? If velocity is low, value is high. Either way, the same amount of value is spent; the only thing that changes is the price per bitcoin. Put another way, if there were 21 billion bitcoins on a paper wallet in a distant galaxy, the average bitcoin would *never* have been spent. Does this matter?

The network cost is *not* fixed. All the subsidy is is a direct transfer to miners. if the subsidy were removed, the fee would still be ~0.5 cents or whatever it is right now.
The bigger concern is that whatever the ultimate fee is will not be enough to keep the network very strong. So you have it backwards; fees *will* be low. Hopefully not too low.
I'm not actually concerned though because it's so far out into the future; even if the problem is intractable (and network security is spiraling down to zero), bitcoin can be changed. We will have plenty of advanced warning.
P.S. Food for thought: one solution to make mining more market-based would be to dispense with the adjusting difficulty. This would be a discussion that will likely be had far into the future once hashrate more or less stabilizes (and other improvements to factors that influence network latency, large mining pools, fork-resolution, etc.. are better understood).

Spending bitcoin does not increase their value, especially if the BTC are just sold by the merchant afterwards. It's proximate effect is the opposite.
Face it, you're *selling* bitcoin, which is lowering the price, and you're complaining at OP for hodling because you think he's benefiting from all the hard work that you're doing! You're buying things, for god's sake! Stop pretending that that's a sacrifice.

People don't want to wait years before they can buy bitcoins, so they go abroad to an exchange that is regulated chiefly by the Japanese, but also insofar as it deals with US customers, by US regulators. The US regulators confiscate $5.5 million dollars from this exchange for their "services". Neither the US regulators, nor the Japanese ones notice that the exchange is running with fractional reserves. Because of competition from other exchanges like Bitstamp, and businesses like Coinbase, people start leaving the exchange in the second half of 2013.

Not really. The ideal compensation should be only dependent on the value of processing txs given the security of the network.
This is a very hard incentive structure to design and likely won't ever be perfectly economically efficient. Not many real things are.
But for the value of all of the bitcoins to equal the compensation to miners, would require a shit ton of luck.
For example, the total cumulative reward to miners last year was equal to about 25 BTC*5200+transaction fees. There are over 12 million BTC at present. These are only equal if transaction fees are significantly higher, which need not happen.

A couple comments:
1. If people actually do hold off on buying things because of deflation, then at any moment in time, there would *still* be the same number of people buying things. The people buying things today would be the people who *didn't* buy anything last year; the people buying things tomorrow would be the people who *didn't* buy 364 days ago.
2. The *real interest rate* will be the same. That represents your opportunity cost when you spend, so no, there won't be any average change in the time it takes for people to buy new things. Under inflation, people just keep their money in savings accounts with interest at a higher rate than under deflation. It all balances out.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:00:08
Gox wasn't goosing anything. The bitcoins were priced at a 10% premium because a gox dollar was worth 91 cents because of fiat withdrawal problems. In Feb/March, the gox price fell because BTC withdrawals were canceled.

You do off-blockchain transactions for large purchases where you need immediate confirmation. Currently, you can use Coinbase as your online wallet and send to the merchant through their service. Easy and free.
In the future, if Bitcoin doesn't change radically, there simply won't be room on the blockchain for thousands of transactions every second, and likely only large institutions will often settle their balances via the blockchain. There's no need for every node to relay every transaction if there are competitive companies that offer Bitcoin settlement.
Lastly, if you want to transact on the blockchain and are willing to pay the fee, just give the merchant your ID when you pay so they'll trust that you won't try to double spend.

I don't think it's clear at all that Scrypt &gt; SHA-2 for PoW. ASICs offer better inherent resilience to attacks by gov'ts or other parties who try to mine, raise difficulty, and force other miners into unprofitable territory to achieve 51%.
ASICs are a front-loaded cost, while GPUs eat up more energy in electrical power. When revenue goes down, you turn off your GPU but keep running your ASIC.
And the whole "decentralization" argument in favor of Scrypt is, I think, silly. If bitcoin used Scrypt PoW, I still wouldn't be mining them on my laptop...just like I'm not mining altcoins on my laptop right now. It's not worth slowing down my computer.

Also, I seem to remember this same argument being made when the block reward implied that tx fees would be $50 per transaction. What happened, troll? Why did miners suddenly decide to cut their rate by two-thirds?

Then you don't understand the purpose of fractional reserve, *nor* fiat money. A fractional-reserve fiat system reduces the cost of issuing more money, while a fiat system replaces money with a cheaper alternative.
The drawback to fractional reserve is that it can result in large shocks in the money supply, and the drawback to the fiat system is that the issuer controls its supply.
Combining the two allows the banking system *or* government to inflate the currency, *and* creates a giant banking sector that exists to issue notes that are redeemable for fiat. Since fiat is essentially costless to print, this is economically wasteful, just like mining for gold, and is inflationary.

Surely you are talking about real consumption and investment, right? Not nominal?
Because I totally agree that real spending as a way of measuring trade activity is important.
But the number of dollar bills that you use to buy bread is completely immaterial. When you call for inflation and imply that you would prefer a world in which people spent 2 mBTC on a loaf of bread vs. 1 mBTC, it suggests that you don't agree. Nominal prices do not matter. Real spending is unchanged.
In other words, in the velocity of BTC slows because it is deflationary, prices will be at a  proportionately lower level until the amount spent = the value of the goods/services produced.

The problem is that the people operating bitcoin prediction markets cannot be trusted to hold on to your coins and to be fair arbiters unless there is a legal jurisdiction that allows it, because they have to be anonymous.

1. Prices don't adjust instantly. Obviously. But that's completely irrelevant, and if anything, hurts your position equally.
2. Your hypothesis, that 2% inflation encourages spending, is equally countered by your response (why can't it decrease spending? Nobody knows rite, cuz irrational actors?). That you and your upvote posse considers the "economics assumes everyone is rational" [not true] argument to support your position and undermine mine is blatantly wrong.

And finally, think about how easily armies would be raised if there were no draft. Fighting is *expensive* for all parties involved.

Prices reflect marginal value, not average value. If the price rises because there are fewer houses, that means that the marginal person is without a home. It doesn't mean that the actual utility of houses changed. If I'm not explaining well, read the marginal cost = marginal value = price section of a microecon book.

"Deflationary economy" doesn't mean anything. *Economy* is an aggregate of all of the trade in a society. Deflation is a relative term.

Bitcoin will only rise in value for two major reasons:
1. Adoption
2. Prices of goods falls
Adoption is a finite resource. If, in a bubble-crazed moment, bitcoin rises to $1 billion, you can be damn sure it will fall just as fast back down to a sustainable level.
Nevertheless, during the phase of  adoption, you want to accumulate as many BTC as possible (adjusted for risk, blah blah blah), because adoption implies exponential growth faster than any normal returns on investment. Still, as others explained, hoarding is not a problem. When I spend bitcoins, I simply buy more from Coinbase in the same amount.
Once Bitcoin reaches peak adoption, it will only gain in value if goods and services become more abundant due to GWP growth. As explained above, you are better off investing your money productively and the economy will not grind to a hault. Markets are amazing at coordinating investments. Be skeptical when somebody says that by simply exchanging with a unit that isn't being actively inflated, you will cause societal collapse.
Also, I believe that Milton Friedman wrote an article arguing that the optimal quantity of money would be one that results in deflation that is similar in magnitude to the real interest rate. Not entirely relevant to Bitcoin^1, but it is evidence in favor of my position that deflation is not bad.
Hope that helps.
^1 The argument involved the fact that in an inflationary environment, people hold less cash balance than they would like because the money they hold is depreciating. It's kind of a high-level ivory tower criticism and not very relevant, but it must be noted that in his whole essay he didn't say one word about deflation leading to perpetual hoarding and no investment, etc..

A better protocol will definitely come along; there are many recognized weaknesses. But newcoin probably won't be more useful from an individual's point of view.
Take proof of work, for example. It's well-recognized (Satoshi pointed it out, among many others) that it's wasteful. If newcoin still doesn't provide a selfish reason for people to switch to it, they won't. Why should I give up the convenience of using Bitcoin to free up a tiny bit of resources for everybody else? The network effect of a popular form of money requires serious incentives to overcome.
In fact, it's taking more than 5 years for even a *monumental* improvement to fiat money to be adopted at $1.14 per person on Earth. If you think the delta between Litecoin or Dogecoin and Bitcoin is greater than that of Bitcoin and fiat, you need a sense of proportion.

Dogecoiners are completely delusional. Objectively more so than bitcoiners. Underneath the "to the moon" irony is the exact same bubble mentality that Bitcoiners get wrapped up in every now and again.
Speaking for myself, and some others I know, we like altcoins in principle. But the cryptocurrency space is largely a zero-sum game. Unless there's an alt that completely blows bitcoin out of the water, and bitcoin can't be forked (in one of many ways) to implement it, bitcoin is here to stay and won't be beat.
Alts like doge are funny, but they won't ever be anything more than that. If you are a dogecoiner and disagree, you're likely new to cryptocurrency and delusional. We've all been there. But most of us had the sense to keep quiet, listen, *read*, and repeat, until we learned more.

If Bitcoin succeeds it might very well go to 10k. But it probably won't get there without a few more panics and crashes.
Well, if Bitcoin were used as wealth storage, or as an inflation hedge like gold is, but only to 1/20th the degree, each of the 21 million bitcoins would be worth 15 kiloUSD.

I don't think you're giving this a fair hearing. There is a significant flaw if you expect people to altruistically sacrifice some of their bitcoins to pay for *other people's* security. Look at the situation right now; if the subsidy disappeared, the network would be 0.33% as strong. *Who would be better off?*


I've been a bitcoiner for years, and love that you and the community is solidly against inflation. And you're right, it can probably be funded altruistically, but I don't like to depend on that.
In 7 or 8 block subsidy halvings, when this topic becomes important, hopefully we can get a better idea of whether the trade off is worth it. For now, I'm happy that there's a presumption against inflation and meddling with the money supply, but I think it ultimately deserves some discussion.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:30:47


Take it a step further, though. If nobody sells, the price will rise *until* the quantity supplied = quantity demanded. So while that quoted sentence might technically be true, it doesn't describe an equilibrium.


Perhaps not. But can you agree that bitcoin prices are important for adoption? Hoarders increase the price, and demonstrate that there's consistent demand for BTC.


I'm pretty agnostic on what's good vs. neutral concerning what people do with bitcoin. If they do it, I assume it's good for them, and if other people continue to use bitcoin, I assume they all are better off for it.

Once the block subsidy declines to zero, the cost per transaction will be exactly the average of what people decide to attach as fees. Nobody will pay $100 as a transaction fee, and nobody will have to compensate the miners for the 25BTC that they are no longer making from the block subsidy.

Yes, but the economics suggests that stock prices converge to the company's value. The value of the bitcoin network could be a small fraction, or a large multiple, of its market cap, depending on the velocity of money, as I think you overlooked.


I agree that a comparison is the only good way to estimate the value of the network. The clearest way would be in the extreme case where bitcoin replaces all banks and money transmitters. You can add up all of those costs, subtract it from the resource cost of mining, and get your total savings. Notice, though, that that estimate is *independent* of the price per bitcoin. That's the key.

No it won't. If you don't change the relative amount of anybody's BTC balance, the process would not have the same effect as inflation. The end-user would just suddenly see that Satoshis are not the smallest unit that you can use. Behind the scenes, this would be reflected in there being more than 2.1 quadrillion units of BTC.
In other words, what once costs 1 "smallest BTC unit" would now cost 10 "smallest BTC unit".

But you completely miss the point if you ignore the exchange rate. Bitcoins were essentially *worthless* at the time. Don't say that btcveteran somehow was advantaged because he was mining a block a day; he was just smart enough to hold onto them. Plenty of miners weren't.

Well, you don't want to have to trust the merchant with your entire wallet. By choosing which addresses to expose him to, you reduce risk.
I'm sure a crypto expert can solve or mitigate this problem, but I don't know how you can only expose a portion of your funds to an unscrupulous merchant with a tx-signing card. It can't be pre-signed because you don't know to whom you are sending the coins nor how much. If you sign it on-site, you will need hardware, which defeats the purpose.

I wish people didn't have to worry about offending by suggesting a need for an altcoin. This is coming from someone who doesn't own altcoins, by the way.
There are a few answers to your question: 
1. This sort of protocol can be implemented natively into an altcoin. Essentially it just reduces variance yet maintains the proof of work system by automatically distributing coins to the miners in proportion to the work they did. In other words, it replaces a mining pool operator with a provably honest algorithm based on the same exact proof of work that the blockchain uses.
2. An altcoin can also achieve a similar result (that is, eliminate the need for pools to reduce variance in miners' incomes) by speeding up the block creation rate. To get a similar effect, the blockrate would have to be orders of magnitude faster.
 is obviously a better option than  but I personally think that Bitcoin +  (P2Pool) is better than if it were to be implemented directly into an alt. Keep Bitcoin simple and allow for experimentation on top of the protocol is the best way forward in my point of view.

Not really. Every day, each pool finds a Poisson random variable number of blocks. This means that 0.4% of the time, a pool with 36% of the hashrate would find more than 50% of the blocks in a day.

It wasn't forced to move overseas. I never said anything like that and am not sure why you put "forced" in quotes. It didn't even try to open up in the states. There are enormous amounts of money transmitting laws, licenses, and fees that we not know are required. Why do you think SecondMarket's exchange is only open to minimally regulated accredited investors, and not the general public? Why is Coinbase not able to operate as an exchange? Just fucking google some financial regulations; part of the issue was that for *years* the regulators didn't even say what types of regulations possibly apply to bitcoin. Their attitude was "do it, if you dare, and we may or may not sieze assets/freeze accounts/arrest your for money laundering".

The computing power required to mine a block adjusts in order to keep the blockrate at 1 block per 10 minutes.


When two blocks are found almost simultaneously, the network has to decide which chain future blocks will be built on. The one that's not built on is called an orphan.


I think that's just a simplified way of talking about mining. If a miner who refuses to include a transaction broadcasts his block, everyone will "agree" by mining on top of the block that he found.


Yep. The reward is 25 BTC right now, not 50.


I didn't get that impression, but I might be wrong. Anyway, no I'm not particularly afraid. Even if bitcoin is banned in most countries, it can still be used effectively to send money inexpensively and to store one's wealth in. It cannot be regulated out of existence.
Of course, if most countries ban it, the price per bitcoin won't rise anymore and will probably fall, so I'll be a lot poorer. But society will still be able to benefit from a decentralized and open currency.
Recall, bitcoin was used just as effectively in the dark web when the price was only a few dollars per BTC.

Any assumption can be wrong. It doesn't mean that one's reasoning was, though.
Whether or not you win the lotto, it's still unwise to buy a ticket.


"Just as likely". Please.
I bought coins a while ago. I had no idea if they would be worth anything, but I kept them. Lots of people did. Some small fraction forgot about them and lost them. Satoshi is probably in the former group.


Again, you write "just as likely". Sticking to 50%, huh? Sorry, but just because something isn't 100% certain, doesn't mean it must be 50%.
Plus, we *already know* that Satoshi practically never spent his coins. Thus, he's behaving consistently. If he were spending regularly, then suddenly stopped, then you'd have a better argument.
Lastly, you keep ignoring my argument against the counterfactual:
If people lost a large proportion of their coins, there would be practically no spendable inputs left.

*He* is not going to do any of the two. It is not possible to be perfectly protected from external forces, but we can see that that's not necessary to prevent invasions. Many countries don't have standing armies....but that doesn't mean that an anarchist society won't.
What will protect the society from invasion will be the same two things that always have:
self-defense and trade. Aggressors don't want to attack a trading partner, and they don't want to fight a costly war.
But I'd argue that an anarchist society would be *less* likely to be attacked because it won't have many offensive weapons. There will not likely be any provocation going on because the would-be aggressor doesn't have the pretext of self-defense to start its war.

If people stop demanding any altcoin, miners will stop mining it. The vast majority of miners will stop mining when their profit becomes negative. Perhaps you don't realize that price is important when you're talking about what miners do.


Surely you don't consider that to be good evidence. For one, the cost of mining bitcoins was so negligible at the time and the value of a bitcoin was so low that profit-seeking miners were not in the picture.
If there is a bitcoin 2.0 that solves the problem of 50% attacks, makes transaction confirmations happen in seconds, not minutes, incentivizes decentralization, and doesn't change bitcoin's issuance schedule, and maintains everybody's bitcoin holdings, it doesn't matter what miners do or don't do. Miners will have nobody to sell their bitcoin 1.0 coins to; they are irrelevant.

With regard to blocksize, the issues are a lot more complicated than what many of your assume:
**Bitcoin Tragedy of the Commons**
[Bitcoin Wiki](

**TL;DR** (but please don't not read)
The issue is that there's no hard minimum on the cost of including transactions as long as the difficulty can be adjusted downwards. The game theory suggests that once the block subsidy ends (again, without artificial scarcity such as capping blocksize, competition drives the price of including a transaction down to zero, resulting in no network security.
This is a long-term issue--at the minimum, &gt;20 years out in the future once the block reward gets low enough.

That is because the network is over funded due to the block subsidy of 25 BTC. When the subsidy declines to near zero, the cost per transaction will fall to whatever people are willing to pay.
The cost of running the network is near zero. The system isn't supported by mining rewards; mining rewards are paying for network strength that is far in excess of what we need.

Yes. But blockchain.info thinks it's still waiting to be confirmed and won't broadcast a new transaction with those same inputs for him.

Not to be *that guy*, but men do control far more of the world's wealth than women. I don't necessarily see a brick wall. Women will use bitcoin sooner or later.
Personally, all of the women I've talked to about BTC are interested. Equally so as men, I find. They are just more cautious with investments than men and less enchanted with the possibility of making a lot of money so they aren't as obsessive. They're also less nerdy so wouldn't find the computer-science/economics intersection as fascinating.
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:44:41
Yeah. Although a PoS system might solve some problems. Still though, it might always be unsustainable to depend upon tx fees to fund the security because off-blockchain transactions may always be cheaper. But maybe not.
Worst case scenario: in the end, a tiny amount of inflation (or demurrage) might be the only option, unfortunately. After all, people who hold bitcoins do essentially free-ride off the network security paid for by people who transact.

* The Bitcoin software counts integer numbers of Satoshis, not floats. You can have your wallet measure Satoshis if you want. This is a cosmetic and individual issue, and doesn't even require any consensus for anybody to change.
* You *really* have to think about the [equation of exchange]( Hoarding vs. saving affects the money Velocity, which is proportional to price levels, all else equal. That's it. If more people hoard (they hold higher bitcoin balances == velocity is low == each bitcoin is spent fewer times), price levels fall until people feel that they have enough real value in their bitcoin balances. Furthermore, yes, *government economists* tend to like inflation (wouldn't you, if you controlled the printing press?), but inflation is most certainly *not* neutral. A basic analysis shows that people will tend to hold less real cash balance than they would otherwise because it is being stolen from them via inflation. Thus, it is inefficient. Some economists will argue that inflation is good for other reasons: it lowers unemployment, it can prevent bank runs, etc. But it is clearly *not* the case that inflation is ideal under all circumstances and without exception. At best, it is a highly empirical issue, and at worst, it is just apologetics for theft.
* This is a trade-off. It might be better (security is better), but it also might be worse (lead to centralization due to higher ratio of block propagation speed to blockrate). Nobody really knows what the proper trade-off is. What are your thoughts? Ultimately, I'd err on the side of slower blockrates (maybe ~5 min could be better than 10 though..who knows) because you would expect that most point of sale transactions in the future will be performed off the blockchain anyway and settled by third parties; thus, they'll be confirmed instantly. Again, it's a trade-off. I gotta say, I don't see many dogecoiners' analyses on this.
* You aren't looking at the other side of the equation. ASICs have a clear advantage in the economics of mining and network security. GPUs trade energy for bitcoins, while ASICs buy bitcoins with hardware. What happens to the dogecoin ecosystem when an attacker buys thousands of GPUs and starts mining to attempt to raise difficulty and push other miners into unprofitability? The GPU miners stop mining because their marginal revenue is lower than the marginal cost of electricity, the attacker continues to buy more GPUs and the attacker takes control of a significant portion of the network. Because ASICs have high marginal profit because they have high upfront costs, no ASIC miner will ever be pushed into unprofitability because of difficulty increases. They've already bought the hardware and need to make a return. This considerably pushes up the cost of such an attack.

This is a separate issue, but assuming productivity increases (even if BTC adoption stays the same), the price of goods measured in bitcoin will fall.


You missed the point. The FDIC is a tax-funded corporation that insures your deposits up to $250,000.  The FDIC has only a few billion dollars; if many people wanted to withdraw their cash at once, the banking system would not be able to supply it because of its fractional-reserve nature, and the FDIC may not have enough to cover it. The FED would then essentially bail the banks out by expanding the money supply to meet depositors' demands.
I'm pointing out that the FDIC isn't free. We all pay for it and get it whether we want it or not. Banks don't have to worry about making risky loans in the status-quo, because the taxpayer bails them out.

Trading volume on exchanges is different from transaction volume on the blockchain. Which are you talking about?
Further note that you can't conclude everything from the blockchain transaction volume about the transactional use of bitcoin because transactions can be done off-chain through services like Coinbase.
Finally, bitcoin is useful as a transactional medium AND as a store of value. It's price will be much more correlated with its use as a store of value. Take gold as an example. Bitcoin will not have failed if people only buy and sell it in exchange for local currencies...it would just have half of its utility overlooked.

Why does he assume that nominal interest rates will be identical for bitcoin and dollars? Dollars inflate, so interest rates are higher. A bitcoin loan will have low interest rates, because they will have more purchasing power relative to the dollar when the loan is due.
It is just stupid to think otherwise.
Borrowing 10 bitcoins to buy a car is the equivalent of short-selling bitcoin, which is currently very volatile. That is not something that the average low-income person is going to do blindly. So the author is basically arguing that bitcoin loans are hard to price at the moment because it's volatile. Duh. Once it gets a stably-appreciating price, interest rates will be a few percent lower than the dollar. **If they aren't, I'll become a trillionaire by borrowing dollars to buy bitcoin to lend them out for risk-free profit.**

No. Relative to the amount of bitcoins sold on MtGox, that 600,000 BTC was a tiny fraction. This deterrence effect prevented people from, on average, making enormously profitable investments.


You have a slippery definition of "regulated". MtGox was regulated like any other business, but not like a financial business. They had permits, paid taxes, obeyed labor laws, and more. It didn't help that they the regulatory scrutiny that they *did* fall under, ended up seizing millions of dollars from them last summer, which was when their USD withdrawal problems began.

Here, Frankeh has written off the possibility that bitcoin can *become* more stable through the use of financial products, and as it gets larger and more widely adopted.
Of course, he would argue that it will never get larger because it's too volatile, without realizing that the volatility is what attracts investors, the best of whom have a tendency to stabilize the price.
End result: either bitcoin is stable, or it is potentially profitable.

What's convenient for sellers is convenient for buyers. Credit cards have it completely backwards; they give the customer license to steal from merchants, so merchants have to charge extra on each transaction, and collect information on the buyer to protect themselves from scams. This is wasted money and a sacrifice of privacy. Customers have no reputation to protect, so they are more likely to abuse it.
Bitcoin can make it so the merchant, on whose trustworthiness it is much cheaper to get information, must be trusted to deliver on his product/service.
In cases where the merchant cannot fully be trusted (e.g. he is new, has bad feedback, etc..), bitcoin allows the trust to be outsourced to a third-party arbiter, similar to a credit card company.
This means that there are savings to go around; the merchant and the customer save money and are both happier.
Right now, bitcoin is young. If you're more interested in saving money than experimenting with a new technology, stay away from bitcoin until it matures.

Perhaps, but it's important to note that even if mining plummets, none of this influences the blockrate, so isn't important for the tx fee.

I've never bothered with mining. By the time any currency gets on an exchange, 90% of the time you're better off just buying the currency than wasting cycles and hardware mining for coins. I'd say the majority of bitcoin miners would have been better off just buying the coins.
On your other question:
There's no significant difference between the two you mentioned and bitcoin, besides for bitcoin's network effect. Most cryptocurrency users will disagree with me (though I've owned bitcoins for far longer than most crypto users, if that counts for anything, positively or negatively), but 95% of them are chiefly marketed to people who are seduced by the idea "Since dogecoin is just like bitcoin, all dogecoin needs to do is go to 25 cents and I'll be a millionaire, which can totally happen!"
This is of course ignoring the fact that it took 5 years (!!) for bitcoin, which has an *enormous* advantage over centralized fiat money and is (IMO) the most significant breakthrough in that area in the history of mankind, to even get the average person's attention. Any other cryptocurrency that will beat bitcoin has to be *that much better* to break the inertia of an old money system.
Perhaps it is better to have every north american drive on the left side of the road. I wouldn't bet on it happening, though.
This is why other coins that are forks of the bitcoin blockchain, with just a few tweaked parameters, are pejoratively called "scamcoins".

It's something to think about if you have balls of high-carbon steel.


In April, server lag and DDOS attacks precipitated the price crash from $250 to $50. In June, Mtgox encountered trouble with US banks and stopped allowing fiat withdrawals to US customers. Shortly thereafter, they demanded that bitcoin withdrawals must only happen on verified accounts (required a proof of residence, government-issued ID). Last week, they discovered a bug in their software and possibly lost a few coins to scammers, so they halted BTC withdrawals. More FUD, and here we are!

Keep it simple: consider that its utility is so much higher for wealth storage than gold:
* Millions of dollars of bitcoin can be associated with a password that you can keep *in your head* as you walk across any country's border. Can't do this with gold.
* It can function as a trap door: you can bury a paper wallet in your backyard, close it in a tamper-evident envelope, and send a half a coin every paycheck to it more easily than sending an email.
* It can be *spent* much more easily than gold can, so it has utility as a medium of exchange as well
And remind her that gold's market cap is currently around $7 trillion, while bitcoin's is 1,000th that. If even 1 in 100 gold owners switch to bitcoin, you'll have 10x your money. If non-gold owners want bitcoin as a store of wealth, it'll be even higher.

This isn't an important distinction. Difficulty doesn't matter in this context; the only thing that matters is the price of buying x% of the network's hashpower.


This is definitely a good point, but ultimately doesn't vindicate your argument. Everybody will eventually want to spend their coins (unless they solely transact off-blockchain) and until then, they want the coins to retain value. Few people will value a coin that has a high risk of being double spent upon transacting.

I'm strongly opposed to the necessity of inflation on monetary-policy grounds, but I have always had the same opinion that you do.
Gavin is right that perhaps it is not very costly to store a UTXO. It is also not very costly to verify a signed transaction. But as a saver, I would prefer to pay some amount, say 0.01% of my savings per year to strengthen the network and prevent attacks from making my savings worthless.
Ultimately, it's the savers, not the spenders, who have more of an interest in protecting network security. If savers are not paying for security, then security will be underfunded. Hopefully not radically underfunded, but definitely underfunded such that savers *would* be willing to pay a little extra for added security.

You can have another company vouch for you and insure the transaction without leaving your money with them.
Or you can simply show the merchant your ID, BTC address that you're sending from, or any other identifier, they'll query your double spend history and accept the 0-conf tx without worrying.

So you made money off the volatility? That's fine. Thousands of people do that; my point was simply in response to your criticism of bitcoin for crashing less than dogecoin.


It's the simplistic thinking like this that makes me pretty confident that you don't know what you're talking about. Yes, the blockchain was the innovation; but a blockchain can't be maintained without people valuing the coin on it as money. Money demands a network effect, and there's no equilibrium in which more than one money that serves the same purpose exists at once.

* Satoshi creates Bitcoin with 21 million bitcoins

Not sure if you're being ironic. Bitcoins need to be bought with cash before they can be spent and are only arguably more suited to POS transactions than is cash, especially if you're a poor African kid without a smartphone.
On the other hand, if bitcoin can stop their corrupt military governments from inflating the currency and terrorizing the citizens, then that's certainly the more exciting benefit.

Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. If a TV gets delivered, even if nobody signs, there's at least the shipping company to insure/sign off on the delivery and 3+ intervening days to make sure the CC transaction isn't rescinded. Buying bitcoins with a credit card either requires a lot of information so the seller can track you down if you take the coins and reverse the payment, or many days before the bitcoins will be released. You might as well do a bank transfer.
On another note, you think Coinbase hasn't thought of this? They allow credit cards but they *only* charge them if the bank transfer fails. I'm sure the above, plus perhaps dozens of regulatory issues, makes CC transactions very difficult to use with bitcoin.

The point is that bitcoin is not currently entirely compatible with everyone behaving in their rational self interests at this time. If they were, nobody would run a full node, and all miners would mine on ghash. That would be very unfortunate.

@_date: 2015-05-28 13:58:06
I'm gonna check his work:
Global energy consumption is 104,000 TWh, of which 18.1% is electricity. Taking a further 60% of that and multiplying by the lowest price per kWh of electricity I could find (India's at $0.08/kWh), I get $950,000,000,000.
Those are yearly rates, so that should correspond to 1 year of bitcoin's inflation. Using today's inflation rate of about 10% (and falling every day) implies a total market cap of bitcoin of about $1,000,000,000,000, or about $80,000 per bitcoin currently in existence.
Note that this assumes that the total cost of mining will be the marginal cost of electricity. In reality, much of the cost is in the mining equipment, which would further reduce the amount of electricity used, implying that bitcoin's price must be even higher for the numbers to work.
Anyway, it clearly requires extremely fast growth to $40,000/BTC minimum.

Just before you contrasted the USPS with other government agencies by specifying that they are self-funded.
I'm sure you'd agree that the USPS' relationship with the government has the following features:
1. Barriers to competition in the form of monopoly protection
2. Ability to borrow from the government at subsidized rates
3. Favorable taxation policies
4. Direct subsidies for the use of their services
5. Access to bailouts from the treasury
6. Price fixing by legislature
Yes, it is nominally government-run. In practice though, it is a government-protected monopoly. How is this different, in its effect, from cronyism wrt banks? Would bailouts be appropriate if the government just bought out all of the banks and nationalized the banking system?
If you have some soft spot for the USPS because you are under the delusion that they help the poor, then why legally prevent competitors from carrying first class mail?

Yes, it's obviously not 100% certain. Glad we agree.
What I am saying is that Satoshi, being *the freaking inventor of Bitcoin*, and a human being, is probably at least as likely as other human beings to care for their private keys. 
Considering that there have been many more bitcoins sent in transactions than 12 million, it is *highly unlikely* that the average person has a &lt;=50% chance of losing his private keys.

Of what thread? You said


By your standards, it will only outperform the dollar once it has a higher total market cap, even though the dollar and Bitcoin have different relative strengths. One of those differences might make Bitcoin's money velocity higher (or the dollar's higher), lowering its (or the dollar's) market cap simply because it has more transactional use. I think market cap is an insufficient metric, but clearly, the dollar is much bigger.


Actually, it does follow the same dynamic. If we all decided to call an mBTC a BTC, everybody's holdings would multiply by 1,000 mBTC/BTC and the value would fall proportionally. I'm not sure what your point is.

@_date: 2014-09-13 18:40:03


Yes. Each transaction refers back to the *unspent* bitcoins associated with that address.


Theoretically, it might. But if the algorithm is a good one (it is), then the attacker can't get any good information from it. It would be as hard as inverting a hash.
Also, showing the public key from which your private key is derived also leaks information about the private key. In the future, if EC crypto is broken, that will likely mean that people can derive the private key from the public key.
By the way, you don't actually sign the transaction with the private key directly; you sign a hash of the transaction. So if I wanted to sign "I am sending you 2 BTC from address xyz", I would first hash the message, getting a digest that looks like "387er2fheu4tg294ueIYGHf38iufj", which I would then sign with my private key, turning it into "e238URGH873yufhw87h". The nodes would then check if that last message can be inverted via the public key, into the digest "387er2fheu4tg294ueIYGHf38iufj", which they know is the hash of the signature. If so, the transaction is valid.
So private keys and public keys are just function inverses of one another, and the public key is derived from the private key. There is no simple math function that I know that can serve as an example, except for the functions used in RSA, which is also a public key crypto algorithm. Look that one up for more detail into the principles behind it.

This is also exaggerated because it seems to use the current value of the coins. Dogecoin tipbot was created at a relatively earlier point in the currency's creation vs. Bitcoin's.
Besides, tipping is *not* equivalent to using a currency. It might as well have been the same few cents being tipped.
**Edit: wait a minute. For the Bitcoin stats, it appears that it used the price at the time of the tip, while for the dogecoin stat, the math (total dollar amount tipped divided by the # of doges) works out to just over the current price per doge. This is consistent with the OP using the current market rate of doge, rather than at the time of the tip. Although since the price of doge has fallen significantly over the past few weeks, perhaps it's just coincidence and the two are equivalent?

To all of you who ask, "why would anyone *spend* bitcoin if you can just hold it and make money?"

Yes, but he used arbitrary cutoffs for probabilistic "safety" and for total hashrate proportion of the attacker. In reality, safety is a continuous function and never guaranteed.

It's not even close to an appropriate time to think about bitcoin having the market capitalization of gold. Just worry about the short-term trend and try to buy unemotionally. Oh, and internalize the thought that as soon as you buy, your bitcoins can lose value as easily as they can rise, so don't panic.
@_date: 2015-05-11 00:41:08


Assuming constant hashrate, no. 10 1-minute blocks is more secure than 1 10-minute block. Meni Rosenfeld did the math a while ago, but it's intuitively pretty clear.


Why would the network strength be reduced? If you divide the per-block reward by 10 so the 25 BTC per 10 minutes remains then the hashrate will be the same.

People like you make me ashamed of buying a little Ether. Miners cannot just charge whatever they want. If that were the case, why haven't the CPU miners of yesteryear, who are now unprofitable, charging $5 per transaction?
When the block reward goes away, most miners will stop mining, because the miner who charges the least will process all of the transactions, difficulty will fall because the hashrate will go down, and more miners will then become profitable.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:20:02
It's not a fee. Expected payout remains the same, but it increases variance by a small fraction.

Yes, definitely agreed there are other effects. I just think comment wasn't very clear, and the idea that security depends only on elapsed time (holding hashrate constant) is a misunderstanding that I don't want him to appear to support.
Also, 10x higher blockrate *will* reduce the variance in mining reward by a factor of 10. Could make the equilibrium mining pool size smaller, in principle. Dunno how this compares to the orphan + latency effect.


Yes, could very well be. I'm also more concerned about maintaining decentralization than levels of security after X minutes.


Agreed. If brick-and-mortar vendors can't wait for confirmations, they can just ask for the customer's ID so they can retaliate in case he double spends. Many options are available.

You're effectively outsourcing the more likely double-spend risk to the party who has a reputation to protect. That's good.
Note that this opens the opportunity for a different customer-side attack:
* Customer has an associate who initiates a double spend from initial wallet in the tiny window between when the merchant verifies unspent outputs and when his tx propagates through a majority of the network. This is harder to accomplish because it requires coordination between adversaries.
Obviously, you're going to only want to risk small denominations. That means if you start with a wallet with 1 BTC, the most trusted merchant could break it into 20 or so addresses.

Hoarding causes higher prices, which allows the same amount of purchasing power to circulate in the economy.

The technology is dependent on something like bitcoin succeeding. If a better competitor comes along (unlikely because of bitcoin's network effect), you can just trade your bitcoins for it. After all, a bitcoin competitor's ability to supersede bitcoin comes from people regarding it as competitive, so it won't be a surprise.
In case you haven't included the SNI in your reading:
Either way, good luck.

The real problem with Keynesianism is the amount of control that it gives to the government and the diversion of money into political, rather than economic, ends. Economically, a fixed, predictable inflation rate which is awarded to miners (who perform a value-added task) only adds one inefficiency:
**Savers hold smaller cash balances than they otherwise would.**
However, in bitcoin, the inefficiency that *not having inflation* introduces is that of underfunded network security. There are no perfect solutions, but I think a very small, persistent linear inflation is tolerable.
At equilibrium, it would balance exactly with the amount of coins that are lost, and the inefficiency I described above would be eliminated.

That's circular.

Both of which are immediate and perfectly consistent with Bitcoin. Read the devs and early discussions about this. It's been long treated as a given that bitcoin, in its current implementation, cannot scale to 100,000 blockchain transactions per second. Blockchain transactions will always be more expensive than off-chain ones.
Edit: And I should add, all it takes to have someone trust a 0 conf transaction is for you to show your ID to the retailer. Please, bitcoin noobs, read the bitcoin wiki at least before talking out of your asses.

Bitcoin is just as easily used regardless of how others use their coins. If I hodl my coins, it has no short-term influence on you, and will have no effect at all once bitcoin is at equilibrium.
Until then, anybody who finds a use for bitcoin (investment, personal interest, activism, etc..) all help each other. What every bitcoiner should want is more widespread acceptance of bitcoin.

The interest rate accounts for inflation. If inflation is 5%, the interest rate might be 8% with ( 8 - 5 = ) 3% real returns. If inflation is -1%, the interest rate might be 2% with real returns of 3%.
Interest rates solve this problem.
I can describe it in another way:
Say the inflation rate of dollars is 5% and the inflation rate of bitcoins is -1%, but people were demanding 10% to lend bitcoins and only 8% to lend dollars. This is the disaster situation you spelled out in your selfpost--nobody lends any bitcoins and no investment occurs. Thankfully, it would be short-lived. Anyone could just arbitrage the two by borrowing dollars, selling them for bitcoin, and lending out bitcoin until the real interest rates were equal.

Uhh, yeah I know what data you are using. Did you literally entirely ignore my argument and just repost the data that you are misusing?
The price per transaction is high because inflation is high. If inflation were to fall by half, so would the cost per transaction. It has zero predictive value on the equilibrium transaction fee after the period of inflation ends.

@_date: 2016-01-18 17:04:40

I also don't think it will take more than a week. Miners will upgrade because they can pack more txs in a block. And wallets will upgrade because if they don't, fees will have to be twice as high to compete with wallets that do.
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:00:47


You don't know the elasticity of demand for transactions. You're also not considering what will happen when bitcoin is ready for LN and it can relieve tx demand.
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:43:16
It's not clear why miners/users would both agree with this policy. What if demand for transactions spikes and the calculated fee doesn't clear the market? What if demand is too low and transactors don't want to pay the fee? Surely, some miners will break rank and accept a lower fee than whatever calculated. A free market for inclusion into a block is robust to these concerns. Let's not throw it away lightly.
Also, seems to me that to enforce this policy would require a hard fork (yet we'd still run into the price-ceiling issue where fees can't rise to balance supply and demand during a spike in txs.).
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:37:08

Merge mining will be incentivized through transaction fees. There is no marginal cost for the miners (they'll just have to run a node) so it really is just piggybacking on bitcoin's security. But on another level, if a sidechain can't even minimally incentivize its own security, it really shouldn't exist.
Other options for security exist, too. Proof of stake, trust (just regular old banknotes), dilution through demurrage, and so on.
There are concerns with the initial transaction to animate the coins on the sidechain, but in no way can it effect the number of bitcoins.


Maybe, but I'm not sure what you mean. In principle, it can be made as trustless as the rest of the blockchain, though I'm out of my element if you're asking about the specific technical details of the two-way-peg.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:42:47

That *is* the electricity cost. It rises and falls proportionately with the ratio of market cap to # of transactions. But it's only high because the mining reward is high, not because of any fundamental fact about bitcoin; all of the cost is artificial to keep the blockrate at 1 per 10 min.

You're telling us that the % of "fake" transactions has gone down while the total number of transactions has gone up.

Wrong. The costs are artificial and are paid by savers, not transactors. That statistic has exactly zero power in predicting future TX costs when the subsidy reduces to near zero.

@_date: 2016-01-18 05:03:06


Possibly. But the worry is that rational miners will weaponize the nonlinearity to impose validation costs on *other* miners allowing them to get started on the next block while everyone else is verifying. The revenue-maximizing policy for a miner will look something like, "take all transactions with the highest tx fee per kb". They won't care about (to the contrary, they'll select for) costs that it imposes on their competitors.
That's a potentially serious problem that the block size limit puts a cap on.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:32:53


No, it's not. Security is being subsidized by holders right now; current fees are *far* from supporting the network and have no guaranteed way to rise to secure the network without a blocksize cap.
The selling point of bitcoin, from which all other things follow, is the decentralization of nodes.

No, that's not what he means. The number of people running full nodes can be spoofed. And if those people are all employed by the same government (or any government), it is effectively centralized.

But they can only see the balance in each address.  Your wallet can hold unlimited numbers of addresses, so I'd say the correct answer is "no".
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:10:44
No, I don't misunderstand. Miners will be able to fit more transactions in a block, yielding higher total fees (on the margin).
Users who want to pay marginally lower fees can then do so by using a wallet that supports SW. The competitive process will lead the entire network to adopt SW (assuming people want to pay less, miners want to earn more, and there are no other drawbacks).

Sure, the "calculation" of "overhead costs". But the correct analysis, in context, would be to look at the total costs (incl. opportunity) and their trends. I thought you were doing the *correct* analysis.
By that (correct) way of looking at it, *of fucking course* price of bitcoin matters. It, times the # of bitcoins per day, is what the total costs per day equate to.
I see now that you were just playing a *gotcha* game. You are right that summing up numbers in one part (overhead only) of one side (total costs) of an equation (which must equal the block reward, in dollars) doesn't require knowing the bitcoin price.
You are very smart.

@_date: 2016-01-06 00:28:50
**Edit:** I should add, there is no marginal benefit to running a node 99% of the time. The only benefit is that you can audit transactions if you don't trust the network. As this cost rises, the benefit of bitcoin logically diminishes. But there is one more effect: if there are few node operators and if demands on nodes are high, governments will find it *very* easy to find and regulate them, adding to the real "costs" of running a node.


Not necessarily true if decentralization is impacted considerably, or if [attacks are easier to conduct](
And there are solutions!! Sidechains are *the* meta-solution to rule them all. And contrary to the FUD, the LN can make bitcoin scale enormously.
If you think adoption is being hindered right now, then you must think that there are many people who *would* use bitcoin if transaction costs (currently a few cents) were lower. I simply don't think this is realistic.

You were very wrong to suggest that the number of people with large balances is smaller than the number of large addresses.


Volume? That doesn't matter. You can have a high volume exchange with only 10 bitcoins being traded back and forth. You can have a low volume exchange with 200,000 bitcoins in it.

@_date: 2016-01-28 20:48:16


No, it isn't. The demand curve is independent of the supply curve.


Is not. You originally said: "price goes up, demand goes down, new equilibrium is found". This is hopelessly confused. For one, "demand" is not a function of price, so the price changing doesn't cause demand to change.
You *mean* quantity demanded. If we now assume that the supply is bounded above at 1 MB, a price rise is a consequence of a change in demand. If that's the case, quantity demanded does not go down, which means you'd have it backwards.

No. High profits just mean that you're providing a desperately needed service. It's what entices new businesses to enter new markets, and it's what encourages people to think of new products to create. If you demand uniform profits across all industries, you'll get stasis.
Simply open up the doors to competition and let it happen on its own; that's the natural way to reduce profits, and it's good for everybody.
e.g. What would happen if you capped profits on an industry with high volatility in earnings? Are you also willing to cap losses? If so, who will pay for those? If not, that industry will not exist, because risk will be too high.
Further, consider the accounting games that this will encourage. Virtually all blockbuster movies, on an accounting basis, make zero profit. [Hollywood accounting]( This is *not* the type of "innovation" that you want people wasting their time on. Needless to say, this opens the door to huge amounts of political influence over businesses. 
Finally, what happens to a business that makes too much profit? If the punishment is serious, might they just stop producing and close up shop if they were too profitable midway through the year? What if more people want their products? If not, will they just waste their profit on business expenses? Econimically, that money is far better distributed to shareholders as profit and invested rather than making corporate more plush.

It's ignorant of [many possible sensitivities and attack vectors]( related to mining. It's ignorant of the centralization effects of raising the cost of running a full node (which miners rationally don't need to care about). It's a change that relies on democracy (rather than a hardcoded rule) requiring analysis of *every possible* end-state blocksize. It's ignorant of large mining pool operation and possible collusion between them.

What? What did you say?
Do a search on for discussion related to the block size. I have a hunch that you'll find more than zero discussions about it.


Transaction volume at price zero will always exceed space. The point of a block size limit is to limit space. Limited space is therefore not an argument against a block size limit.

At this early stage, I think it wouldn't be. But I don't like the precedent set.
I'm most worried that the market irrationally overvalues it for long enough that its network effect can't be overcome. Governments *will* regulate nodes that are only run by businesses (or more likely, outsourced to Coinbase and other blockchain service companies) and malign bitcoin core which they don't control.
That's the modal failure state, IMO. Not too likely, but most prominent from my perspective.

BitPay's "take the median!" proposal? Thank God nobody takes them seriously. It's completely ignorant.
@_date: 2016-01-12 00:45:44
More importantly, don't trust reddit's lies.
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:50:13


Nice rhetoric; bad analysis. Obviously there are other inputs. Those inputs, such as the risk to decentralization, the structural/governance risks of hard fork, the current costs of running a full node, new attack vectors, the proposed scaling approaches and meta-approaches, **all** feed into this analysis. These things are not easily captured into a single number nor is any reasonable loss function optimized by any simple algorithm that anyone can come up with.
Saying, "take a trimmed mean of a miner vote every month", or "take the median of the miner vote" is *SO UTTERLY* ignorant of the issues at hand and is not a silver bullet.
The complications are the *reason* why hard forks are risky.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:24:58


That's not my assertion. My assertion is only that there is no reason to think that the total transaction fees will be enough to secure the network. Costs and benefits aren't privatized.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:27:35
Segwit is a soft-fork. It's a different animal entirely from raising the block size.
Soft-forks only jeopardize people who choose to use that software. This is dramatically safer.
@_date: 2016-01-11 23:25:41
Yes, that's possible. But it's probably easier to just have you wallet calculate it which is why we don't see that.
The challenge, however, is in predicting those fees.
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:13:26
But they do. The reddit mob didn't discover bitcoin.

No, the simplest thing would be to not raise the limit before it is necessary. &lt;4 cents a transaction is not a disaster.
Raising the blocksize is a *huge* change.
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:46:46
I'm almost certain you have the settings wrong. The tx fee defaults to 0.0001 BTC per kb.
But bitcoin is new and not perfect. Don't recommend it to people until you are more comfortable with it.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:12:17
It is literally not ad hominem. And it is *certainly* not the ad-hominem fallacy.

This is exactly right.

How are they going to profit (in a way that hurts the rest of us) off open-source software? Be specific.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:23:16
Just wanted to counter some of the acerbity here. Many of us still look to you guys as people with the right vision and philosophy for bitcoin. If there's a fork and Bitcoin Classic doesn't have your unqualified endorsement, there is no chance in hell I'm going to abandon Core.
Contrary to what the reddit mob believes, if a fork happens and the devs who matter don't jump ship, few will abandon Core.
I also think it's very likely that major exchanges will allow both bitcoins to be traded in different markets, no matter which coin they think will ultimately be valued higher. Investors have a good reason to be wary of a coin that has set a precedent for forking at the whim of a few demagogues and some activists on reddit.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:49:00


People said that last year too. Yet bitcoin is humming along.
When does disaster strike if we don't?
Or more to the point, what makes you think you know more than the core devs?
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:15:27


The blocks aren't even full now. You clearly just want other people to pay for your shit.
And I'm not even convinced you wanted to transact if you can't even bother to pay a tenth of a US cent.

Calm down.
It's possible that they will incorrectly predict fees, or someone will select lower fees than advised and assume that they can rebroadcast without trouble.
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:16:27


That's debatable. I'd call it something else if there weren't consensus. Anyway, I don't think there is any economic majority in favor of the hardfork.

Yeah for sure. And those same people are complaining about the default *controversial* sorting in the threads they brigade. What a joke.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:13:24
Most of those people I've talked to are *stunningly* ill-informed about LN and sidechains.
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:57:44


I strongly disagree, if that means anything. Bitcoin will adopt any change that is unambiguously good. In fact, it might even be good to delay adoption before things get too complicated (though I don't see this happening).


Mhm. This sub is full of FUD on LN and Sidechains.

It is. It claims:










@_date: 2016-01-15 21:22:17
I'm not pretending that there's no censorship. I disagree with much of the censorship, but I don't like how people are pretending that the big-blocksize message isn't getting out there.


If that's the truth, I'm honestly flattered. Didn't think I had made an impression.


Naturally, I think I'm being reasonable. But I definitely have been putting in less effort in debating lately. I've said all I can in the past and feel like nobody is open to changing their position anymore.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:00:28
If you've been using bitcoin for 2 years, you should have known better. I have no sympathy. Assuming you're telling the truth and didn't change your settings or something.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:57:20


If you think the mob has more of a license to govern than the devs, you're insane. Anyway, it's not really an issue of governance; some things that the mob would prefer just can't work.

The devs have decided.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:19:15

Huh? His transaction was 226 bytes. He should have paid 0.00002260. He Paid less than a tenth of that.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:45:49


This is wrong. Why pontificate?
The tx fees depend *only* on the marginal cost of including a transaction in a block. Block reward falling doesn't influence the fees at all. If it did, fees would have gone up 10,000% during the first halving.
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:36:30
Right, makes sense.
But the guy I replied to made it sound like RBF does something *other than* helping stuck transactions get unstuck.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:36:40
Sorry you're not very bright.
I don't think it implies *nothing* about my goals (and never said as much); though it certainly isn't a clear window into my goals. It just says how I feel about this particular outragefest.
@_date: 2016-01-03 10:13:34
Good refutation
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:36:32


And at this equilibrium, there is no reason to think that the total mining reward will be enough to give bitcoin adequate security. Just because an equilibrium exists, doesn't mean it is nearly optimal.
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:12:23


It's more complicated than that. But we did rely on Satoshi and a few others for the first two years, so it's not a recipe for failure.
More importantly, the current bitcoin experts are working towards making interoperable sidechains allowing *actual* decentralization as well as non-rivalrous bitcoin forks. This is the holy grail and all we need is for bitcoin to survive in its current censorship-resistant (and working) form until then.


LN isn't a single third party system. It's *the* natural way of scaling bitcoin. It's just a clever way of constructing transactions. You should *definitely* read up on it to clear up any misconceptions.


Raising the blocksize doesn't allow it to handle more transactions; it just subsidizes transactions at the expense of introducing fragility. If people need to use bitcoin, they will bid up transaction fees to use it, and people will economize. This happened in the past with Satoshi Dice and it will happen in the future, until LN and Sidechains offer robust alternatives.


If it's a hindrance, we will know. It will be because transaction fees rise. Then, and only then, can we analyze the cost and benefits.
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:53:54


Let's hear it.

Believe me, you're preaching to the choir.

It's not bad. The problem is, he wants them to be uninteroperable.
For the analogous interoperable proposal, see sidechains.
@_date: 2016-01-01 16:04:00
That doesn't dispute my claim
@_date: 2016-01-23 23:27:43
It doesn't take 5 cents each. If the blocks aren't full, it costs almost nothing to fill them up.
@_date: 2016-01-27 04:40:02
Literally everybody here knows about the blocksize debate. The reason the blocks aren't bigger is because it's a shitty idea, not because nobody can hear your whining.
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:23:29
Yup. And Sidechains, which are what make bitcoin future-proof. As soon as they are implemented, I am going all in. No more debate; total freedom to do what you want on your own chain, provably backed by bitcoin.
As people begin to figure this out, hold on tight for 100 billion + market cap.
@_date: 2016-01-08 01:03:42

That's how intellectuals talk, according to dumb people.
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:59:58
This is the right answer. Interest rates will just be lower.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:16:59


No, we don't. Homicide rates are near an all-time low.


I don't know whether this is true, nor do I care about this statistic. The only reason it may be true is because suicide is 55-65% of all gun deaths. I'm not at risk for that, so my expected benefit of owning a gun is clearly positive.


Yeah, because guns aren't easily available there. I wouldn't be afraid of being run over by a car if cars didn't exist. You've proved nothing.
Is this the way political debates work down under? Exclusively non-sequiturs and obvious lies?
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:26:20


The min fee *has* risen. That it was this exercise shows.
Raising the blocksize to subsidize transactors and threaten decentralization is not a solution.
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:35:17
Yup, I was aware of that part. They both allow an effective fee increase. I don't know much else about them though.
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:34:27
Yes, very dumb. The point of bitcoin isn't that it's cheaper. It's not.
The benefit is that it is uncensorable and immutable. The only way it can have these (important) properties is if it's decentralized. That's the purpose of decentralization, and we pay a large cost for it.
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:42:13
Can you people wrap your head (yes, head) around this:
**The average block size says *virtually nothing* about whether the block size should be larger.**
Look at the average tx fee to get included in the next block. That's all. If four cents is too high (weighed against the other interests and risks of hard fork), then you probably think we should fork.
If four cents doesn't seem like such a problem, or if the other interests seem large enough, then you think we shouldn't fork.
Look at the **price of a tx getting confirmed. The fees. Cost.** That's what matters and reflects people's desire to transact. Blocks can be filled by any activist for a few dollars at any time.
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:59:06
Heh. Well, that's how I interpret the downvotes.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:07:29
It's the reddit way.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:22:09


The perception is on us. Subscribe to bitcoin-dev, read Rusty's blog, go through gmaxwell or Adam's reddit accounts to look for good threads were they've contributed a lot, read bitcointalk, etc.
It's a lot of work to inform ourselves, but it's not entirely necessary. We are consumers of the tech, they've done a fantastic job so far, and their interests are aligned with ours.

No its not.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:30:15


I can pile up thousands of unconfirmed transactions at literally all blocksizes. This is not unique to a 1 MB limit.
Also, RBF solves this.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:10:40


Then you haven't been following this debate.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:56:30
RBF is just a policy. Any miner could have done it at any time.
@_date: 2016-01-27 03:38:06
They're also the guys keeping the coin supply artificially low. Is "artificial" synonymous with "bad"?

"Newcomer"? You're very wrong.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:25:00
I have *always* been stunned by the fact that anti-gun people use "well, here in country X we have fewer gun deaths than in gun-crazy America" as an argument against guns. There are no words for how stupid this line of argument is.
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:27:10
Right. They'd obviously prefer further subsidization of bitcoin transactions at the expense of decentralization.
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:52:33


This attitude is shit. I wouldn't want to serve you ungrateful children.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:37:57


What!? But *you* were the one banging the drums on this for the last year!
The average fees have been between 4 and 8 cents per tx and blocks are rarely full (aka it seems like people are voluntarily overpaying). The only reason people are restless is because *you've* been launching this campaign.


That trope is ridiculous. Adam, Mark, Greg, Peter, Drak, and the rest of the guys who chime in on reddit have been *supremely* patient and open, especially given the insane conspiracy theories and hatred they get from a good 30% of this sub (who also happen to be your devotees).
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:14:46
Raising the blocksize doesn't scale bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:07:07
Doesn't that worry you? The experts think it would be a bad thing, while you and all of the other nontechnical people cheer it on because it's something you can relate to?
@_date: 2016-01-04 05:30:58
I don't think you know anything about how LN works. This is fundamental to LN's design.


It can only scale through clever arrangements like LN, where all but the settlement transactions are off-blockchain (but still just as secure).
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:55:20


Hah. The speculative attacks once the forks diverge wil be pretty fantastic.
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:57:38
Yes, I know the technical definition of "efficiency" in economics. But dude. That is *not* the sense in which you meant "efficient" in this quote:


Give me a fucking break.
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:42:08
How do you know there will be more users? LN can scale bitcoin almost infinitely, and once sidechains are implemented, the solution space is much wider.
Likewise, the downsides to larger blocks might cause *very* damaging centralization which would destroy the project entirely.
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:41:33
I see you're jumping from point to point. Have you abandoned your other arguments?


Yes. Bitcoin can be 51% attacked by two pools, last I checked. This is why any sidechain that merge mines (as opposed to proof of stake or some other option) should try to achieve as high and dispersed hashpower as possible. This is very doable considering namecoin's enormous hashrate with almost no value added.
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:01:44
It was closer than you. And you were the one who tried to correct me, asshole.


Really? Irrelevant? Why do you think people mine?
Why do I even try? You can't be helped.

@_date: 2015-08-14 17:46:40


Are you telling us that you know what the bitcoin user demand curve for transactions looks like? Higher price * lower number of transactions is not automatically smaller than lower price * higher number of transactions. 
Also, tx fees make up such a small fraction of the block reward that block reward concerns should *not* drive this decision.
@_date: 2015-08-20 03:05:36
Nodes don't make any money and mining profit isn't completely incentive compatible with bitcoin's health.
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:23:01
Yeah. I'd prefer minimum, but it does sound weird looking back. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:15:03
Sure, 8 x 1 = 8. But 8 x 1/64 = 1/8.
How do you know fees won't be lower if you increase the block size?

Why wouldn't a company voluntarily do this?

In the future? Yeah, they probably agree conditional on certain other facts about the network at the time. 
But "blocks will be increased" doesn't mean that they need to be increased soon or now. Especially when it's likely to jeopardize the network's robustness.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:22:23


Being libertarian doesn't mean believing that *everything* is *automatically* incentive-compatible. Right now, bitcoin is not designed in a way that the mining market will optimize.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:35:10
And bitcoin currently can scale far better than it could have 2 years ago. What do you think they've been working on?

Suppose we can say that this parade brought umbrellas ;)
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:36:52
Yes, obviously block rewards drop by about 50%. Hashrate, however, will not. It's a stupid metric and just complicates things. Network strength is proportional to the total block reward; that's it.
All else equal, hashrate grows with time as technology improves and cheapens. That *doesn't* mean the network is getting stronger.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:01:04
Still wrong. We've had this discussion before. Miners can take out a short, harm bitcoin by [centralizing it, selfish mining, bloating it, DDOS, etc...] and collect a huge amount of profit.
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:20:49
I use a 0.1 mBTC fee for ~ 300 byte transactions. Anything more, I double the fee. This guy is using a fee at about .01 mBTC per 300 bytes.

I don't think the problem of banks is usury; the problem is the government structure around them.
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:33:43


Yeah. That's because bitcoins cannot be reversed; it's just a risk mitigation strategy. Once you have the coins, they're yours, no strings attached.

But superficially speaking, yes. We should worry about bigger problems more than smaller problems.
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:04:28


This is so absurdly premature. The logic behind the Lightning Network is, as far as I can tell, totally plausible. Also, sidechains *completely* [resolve this debate, and many others]( by allowing innovators to make their own opt-in forks with tokens that are provably backed by (and thus, 1-1 exchangeable with) bitcoins.
This is what this debate proves: bitcoin needs a better way to evolve. Sidechains is a brilliant idea that does this seamlessly, without affecting anyone's investments negatively, but providing infinite upside.

@_date: 2015-08-08 22:41:45
Entropy is just the total possible number of choices for your random password, given the conditions you choose.
So if I'm going to pick my password by choosing 5 random words from a list of 1,000 words, my password's entropy would be 1,000^5.
To find the number of bits of entropy, you set 1,000^5 = 2^x and solve. The x then represents the length of a string of 1s and 0s that you would need to write your password out in binary.
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:02:52

Bitcoin fell in price by half twice this past ~18 months. There has been no 51% attack, no Frisbee on the roof, no nothing.
All that will happen is that there will be less sell pressure because the inflation rare will fall. This is a good thing for holders, don't worry about it.

No. They will have the same value as bitcoin, because they are created for free with the purchase of a bitcoin and a tx via two-way peg.

Well, I meant more publicity in the internet realm. I think all of us who read reddit have heard much more noise from Gavin and Mike, which is why so many redditors don't understand why the blocksize increase is controversial: they just see a few bad guys monkey wrenching bitcoin.

For clarity, read my quoted statement as


It's economically exactly like 100% reserve backing of paper money by gold. The gold is not lent out, and the paper money lives on another blockchain, but can be redeemed for gold.


There are many ways. In principle, you can just re-peg the bitcoins to a new sidecoin for each transaction of those sidecoins into a new address.
Check out the sidechain whitepaper. I'm disappointed you don't know more about this given your involvement in the blocksize debates.

lol you have to be an idiot.
First off, that's just the marginal profit; it takes a substantial initial investment first. Second, are you really saying that "the industry" is throwing away a 100% ROI because they think bitcoin is overvalued? Why not just mine more and sell coins? Why wouldn't everyone just do this until the cost meets the price?
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:02:29
Sorry, you still haven't made a case for why the total revenue per block will increase, 21 net upvotes to the contrary. It damn well better increase because more value is at stake if tx volumes are high.


Where did you pull this number from? Hashrate is an effect of the network strength, not a cause. Total revenue in a block is all that matters.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:59:46
Ok, so if 80% of votes are in favor of raising the blocksize, you take the minimum of the 80% of votes. If 80% are in favor of decreasing the blocksize, you take the maximum of the 80% of the votes.
Why cancel out the top and bottom 20% then? The deciding percentile will always be the 80th or 20th; never the 81st or 19th.

Two responses:
1. That's part of my 100:1 margin for error.
2. Sidechains can allow people to diversify their holdings on different networks. Buy three coins and hold one on each sidechain. Also, if you're just buying bit coins to hoard them, you don't have to worry about transactions being rolled back.
I'm gonna be afk for a while, but I'll try to address anything else later.

I didn't realize I was in Thank gov they preemptively shut down Tradehill, a legitimate US company, before it could possibly Gox everyone (subsequently causing most US customers to use MtGox). Also, it's very fortunate that they froze $5,000,000 of MtGox's operating funds 8 months before it Goxed anyone so it couldn't Gox anyone.

But not really. Inflation rate would be roughly double the current rate for a bunch more years, and would approach 0 much more slowly. 1/n is a lot slower than any exponential decay.


Hence the "besides for the fact".
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:45:18
The mode: the most popular floor. This would be influenced by throwing away outliers.
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:49:55


Not hashrate. Hashrate will likely continue to climb, and will only change to the degree that mining is influenced by falling marginal revenue, which isn't a whole lot. ASICs are paid for upfront and have high marginal profit.
Not that it matters. That's why hashrate isn't useful to talk about.


Yeah. I'm not too worried about miners getting adequate revenue from tx fees. It won't matter for a while. I'm more concerned about bitcoin's decentralization and resistance to attacks that result in centralization. Increasing the block reward (through fees or new coins) doesn't change marginal profit (on net) or the opportunity cost of attacking the network.
Also, while Gavin disagrees (he thinks that raising the blocksize will increase total mining revenue) I don't see any reason why the demand curve for txs implies this.
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:55:54

Agreed. We have people who run nodes for a Visa-sized network; they work for Visa and don't do it for free. They are also regulated.
@_date: 2015-08-15 02:39:14
Yeah, you're right of course. 36.6% decay means 1/(1-.366) -1 inflation (in decimal), which still isn't 45.6%. I blame it on redditing while doing work.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:18:40
Sure. If you have a password with 128 bits of entropy, that means it is a random number from 0 thru 2^(128).
Because 2^(128) = 3\*10^38 aproximately, saying "128 bits of entropy" is the same as saying, "you'd have to brute force about 3\*10^38 passwords on average to crack this code".
Bits of entropy is *just* another way of saying the number of digits of this large number, except it measures "digits" in base-2.
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:25:46
I know you do. I find the logic in the claims that it won't dubious.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:35:18
Dozenal seems clearly superior, even on your own terms. In dozenal we can divide by 3 without any repeating digits. Sure, slicing a pizza into three pieces is hard, but at least writing down the desired size of each slice is easier in dozenal.
In tonal (base-16, right?) the *only* easy divisors are powers of 2.
Also, you're adding four extra digits to memorize and you're *losing* one divisor. That's annoying...

They can be traded. The peg is symmetrical, so you can do whatever with them that you might do with bitcoin. The only difference is that the total # of sidecoin + # of bitcoin = 21,000,000, because for one to be active, the other must be frozen.

I still don't understand your suggestion.
For a vote, x, so x &lt; currentBlockSize, sup(x) = currentBlockSize
For a vote, x, so x &gt; currentBlockSize, inf(x) = currentBlockSize.
In other words, the maximum (minimum) of the votes to decrease (increase) is just infinitesimally close to the current block size.

The right approach would be to ask, "how much value, in bitcoins, do you expect people to hold, on average?" Keep in mind that businesses hold large cash balances to operate.
If $1000 per person in the developed world (roughly 2 billion people) , we have **$95,000 per bitcoin**. That is a very modest estimate (certainly at least a factor of 5) for the cash in savings/checking accounts/wallets/safes that people/corporations hold.
Let's also take the current size of the US government (federal and local) bond market: $15,000,000,000,000. That is $42,000 per US citizen. If bitcoin were also held as a risk-free asset because it is unconfiscatable and guaranteed to beat inflation, **add another $700,000 per BTC**.
If you expect that Europeans also will invest in it rather than in government debt, **add another $100,000 per BTC**.
Can it replace gold as wealth storage? **Add another $350,000 per BTC**.
**Grand total: $1,250,000 per BTC** assuming all 21,000,000 are mined.
Is that optimistic by a factor of 20? Call it $62,500 per BTC, and rising while another 2 billion people in Asia discover it. And if bitcoin achieves that success, what would stop it from rocketing to Neptune? This is not an equilibrium.
Nevertheless, what are the odds that you are willing to put against bitcoin's dominance? 10:1? 100:1?
If 100:1 odds against it reaching $62,500, you should be willing to pay $625 for one coin.
But wait. If everybody can do this same calculation, then the price *will* be at least $625 per coin. And as that happens, by self-fulfilling prophecy, bitcoin's chance of success *might just increase*, raising the expected valuation, further increasing its chance of success, and encouraging more investment. All the while, anybody who hangs on to their trash cash sees bitcoin's spectacular potential and thinks, "bitcoin can only dominate at the expense of all other currencies. I might as well buy some, just as insurance, or it'll ruin me".
Does this sound familiar? Bitcoin takes a positive reinforcement, a negative reinforcement, and wraps a positive feedback loop around them both to ensure that it will dominate.

Then you still miss the point of sidechains. Sidechains allow innovation to occur without need for debate. You can experiment with large or small blocksizes on different sidechains and allow people to decide for themselves where to park their coins (in a way similar to that descibed [here](

It doesn't. Bitcoin cannot scale through changing the blocksize, unless you want nodes to voluntarily run Visa-sized servers, or bitcoin to be centralized and regulated (thus PayPal).

I happen to think that the fact of foul play on the side of the investigation is relevant to the charges, by the investigation, against Ross. If it were irrelevant, then why did the investigation not let anyone leak the story during Ross' trial?

Only a lawyer would doubt that.
It's pretty simple.
Does the fact make it *more* likely that Ross committed the offenses?
If not, does it have entirely no bearing at all on the trustworthiness of the agents?
If not again, then it makes it less likely.
Or put another way, evidence that the DEA officers committed serious crimes in connection to their investigation raises the probability that they committed other serious crimes in connection to their investigation. If you deny this, then you think that the commission of crimes is either anticorrelated or probabilistically independent of past commission of crimes, and should try Ross in 12 (or whatever) *separate* trials (for independent, and thus irrelevant crimes; or anticorrelated, and thus each trial would be evidence against further crimes).

This is a ridiculous straw-man.
1. Very few on the anti-increase side want to *never* increase the blocksize under any circumstance. Most of them are just cautious, because if they fuck up, it will be like 100 MtGoxes all over again. *And there are scalable, decentralized ways of engineering bitcoin*.
2. If the price of transactions rise, people will just economize on transactions gradually and naturally. Remember when Satoshidice was on-blockchain? There won't be a mad rush for the exit.
3. Unlimited people can use the blockchain to *store* their bitcoins, even if the blocksize is only 1 MB, which is (IMO) by far the most important benefit of bitcoin. Low-value transactions can always happen, at the very worst, through third-parties (and they already do to some degree...see Changetip).
4. Lastly, we don't want bitcoin to grow too big yet. It's just not ready; end of story. I know all of you want to see your bitcoin investments grow, but that won't happen when the fundamentals are jeopardized.

It's not that hard. Ross didn't kill anyone. He put a hit out on DEA agents who were using one of his admin's accounts as a sockpuppet. Another DEA agent pretended to be the contract killer.
The other alleged hits (no bodies were found and no people were missing) we don't have any information on.


So you're a libertarian who implicitly approves of allowing the government to construct a bullshit case against someone because they are unable to provide enough evidence that the accused committed the actual violent crimes. That's interesting, and you're probably not a libertarian.

But even if they do, it's the FDIC and other subsidies that make fractional reserve so dangerous and overused.

Yes, the marginal cost of verifying a transaction is tiny (less than .0001). The only reason fees rise above this marginal cost is if space in the block is scarce, which it currently arguably is (0.0001 BTC fees are getting stuck), and won't be if the blocksize is raised.

Be precise: it would be the real interest rate plus the (negative) inflation rate. This doesn't have to be near-zero, but would be lower than the real interest rate and certainly lower than the fiat nominal interest rate.
If the real interest rate is 2% but bicoin's value is growing by 10% because it is currently being adopted, you would not lend bitcoins. But bitcoins can't be in the adoption phase forever, so it's ultimate deflation rate would depend upon the overall growth rate of the economy, give or take lost/found coins.
So near equilibrium, you might see deflation of 4%, real interest rates of 6%, and nominal bitcoin interest rate of 2%.
Note that real interest rates being lower than the growth rate of the economy cannot occur in equilibrium--if it did, people would hold more money, raising interest rates back up again.
So all is fine, barring crazy government intervention.

Seriously though, your critiques are problems of regulations, which inhibit the fiat system much more than bitcoin. Once you get bitcoin, you're free from the delays that are inherent in a discretion-based system.
If you aren't ready to use bitcoin, give it a few years. Price fluctuation will minimize, and it will be more accessible.

If you want an easy way of thinking about it:
Your public address is like your email--anybody can send money (email) to your account, while your private key is like your password--only YOU can send money (email) from your account.

You seem to complain about providing your personal information to these companies. You're *spending dollars through an intermediary*. Of *course* you have to provide personal info. What do you think a credit card is?
When spending bitcoin, not a soul has to know who you are, and no sensitive financial information is leaked. Thus nobody can steal your identity *or* your money.
Seems like you miss the point entirely.
This, for example:

Good question; you're confusing nominal and real though.
A real interest rate of 2% means that investments, roughly, grow at 2%. Measured in bitcoin, they would grow at -8%. The bitcoin nominal interest rate would be negative so nobody would lend them, given their hyperadoption rate, because nobody would want to sell/give them up until the price balances out.

Mining was "supposed" to do this. It turns out, it is easy to separate the rewarding part (hashing) from the rest.

It's not clear what you mean by "real variable". We want to know whether or not cops are *worse*, however defined. Nothing needs to be controlled for; we are just trying to find out which population is worse--we aren't looking for cause and effect.


Yes, the results of survey are random, if the survey is conducted well. That's the *point* of a survey. Thus, the statistics you get from the survey will also be random, and you can't say anything with certainty about the populations those statistics summarize.

"Participants" means full nodes in general.

I don't think you're trying to see my point. I'm in graduate school for statistics though, and I know what correlation is.
When you talk about "inversely proportional variables" you are implicitly describing an experiment in which *all else is held constant*. Then, if the variables are actually inversely proportional, you will see some type of correlation (not necessarily Pearson's correlation).
But I can also easily describe another experiment in which a regression on Duration of travel and Rate are NOT correlated (such as on a train where all of the Rates of the passengers are equal).
Hence, inversely proportional does not imply correlated.

@_date: 2015-09-11 19:26:39
You can make the same ("Satoshi never said anything about that!") argument for everything, including sidechains and the Lightning Network.
Fact is, bitcoin has a blocksize limit, so it is *already* part of the consensus. On top of that, there are good reasons to treat raising the block size as a *last resort*.
Bitcoin's decentralization is its *only* advantage, so the cheaper full nodes are to run, the better. Sacrificing that is suicidal.
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:33:55
Sorry if I missed your intention, but there are 2^160 possible addresses, so to be sure a hacker can access your address, they would have to brute force 2^160 addresses.
2^96 just represents the number of valid privkeys, that on average, correspond to one address.
Thus, the entropy is 2^160.


This is backwards. There are 10^28 *keys* that correspond to each *address*. 
There is necessarily one address per key, because you apply (deterministic) functions to transform keys to addresses.

These parameters are not fundamental constants, obviously. As technology changes or as mining pools develop relationships (contractual or otherwise) the equilibrium will change. There is no fundamental upper bound, which was my point.
And all of this talk of course ignores the much more fundamental issue of the cost of running a full node. Mining is a sideshow. Talking about deadweight loss is just misdirection if you have no way to estimate the decentralization value of bitcoin's network and thus treat it as valueless.

You're not thinking clearly. If you raise the debt ceiling, you are just going deeper into debt, so you are *by definition* postponing paying back your debts (by having creditor A get paid back by selling bonds to creditors B and C) and subsequently raising the probability of default.
If they don't raise the debt ceiling, they will *have to* balance the budget.
Anyway, I don't see why default is bad. People should be punished for lending money to a ponzi government that has no realistic chance of paying them back (except with future lenders' money).

There is a functionality called NLockTime in bitcoin that allows you to specify in a transaction that the coins you send cannot be included in a block with number lower than X (all blocks are sequentially numbered, so this is effectively saying "Don't authorize this transaction until a week--or whenever--from now). The idea is useful for a lot of reasons. For one, it is fundamental to the LN's implementation. More relevantly, locking transactions and making your current bitcoins unspendable until some time has passed destroys anyone's incentive to extort you for them.
It's not currently used for these reasons because, AFAIK, you can just rebroadcast a new transaction with the same bitcoins without the NLockTime restriction. Hence, if I use NLockTime to tell the world, "Here is a signed transaction for 1 BTC to Wikileaks, payable next Tuesday", it will find its way into a block no later than next Tuesday (because the recipient can always just rebroadcast the transaction even if some nodes disregard it--he has the signed tx). But if I change my mind about paying Wikileaks, I can simply sign a new transaction without NLockTime (double spending) and render that transaction worthless. This prevents the Lightning Network from working, and prevents you from locking your bitcoin wallet down if you want to keep it safe and are worried about hackers.
In short, NLockTime lets you show people that your coins will be spent no later than in block X. It doesn't, however, have any way to prove that your coins won't be spent *before* block X. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY allows for the latter functionality.

Transacting on the main chain *requires* a decentralized network of full nodes. And the cost, right now, is under 5 cents to transact. It can increase by a few orders of magnitude before it is cost prohibitive.
Additionally, Lightning Network (or similar) expand capacity (and these *are* transactions on the main blockchain, in that they are added into blocks and are just as secure).

I still wouldn't say that. If Distance = Rate x Time, Rate and Time are inversely proportional. But that doesn't mean that any time you measure the two, you'll see an inversely proportional relationship. If you measure speeds and travel time of cars traveling on a highway you would likely *not* see an inversely proportional relationship; they would look approximately uncorrelated.
Correlation between two variables, even ones that are mathematically inversely proportional, depends on the experiment.

This doesn't follow, unless you stipulate that the product is held constant. In the real world, it is held constant almost never, so the pearson's correlation between two inversely proportional variables could be zero.
Are you purposely ignoring everything I write, or do you just not follow?

They are different concepts and serve different purposes. Correlation is a way of describing a relationship between random variables that you observe (and then theorize about a "true" relationship between them), while two variables being "inversely proportional" just describes where the variables are in relation to one another in a formula.
If I am interested in looking at a (silly) regression on Speed of travel X and Duration of travel Y in a traincar, and I collect my data by measuring the current speed and surveying each passenger, *i*, randomly to collect their total travel time, the random variables X and Y will be uncorrelated. The x_i will all be slightly different due to small changes in the train's speed at different points in the experiment, but given the value of x_i, I will not be able to predict the corresponding y_i.
Of course, if I conducted an experiment where I controlled for the Distance traveled, and I tweaked the variables X and Y to represent the Speeds and Travel Times of different trains, I *would* see a strong Y=k/X correlation.
It really just depends on the experiment. "Speed" and "Rate", just like "Velocity of money" and "Price" might have a hundred thousand different relationships, depending on the context, what is controlled, etc.

Please check out Paul Sztorc's (somewhat lengthy and most recent) essay on decentralization.

The fact that many large holders of bitcoin *can* give back to the ecosystem by running nodes is not enough.

ahead, vs. cashing in by just publishing the blocks you have. (or some

keep track of how much the blocks you haven't published are worth to
you, and consider publishing some or all of your lead to the rest of the
network if you stand to lose more than you gain.


is enormous and fees don't matter, but once fees do start to matter
things get a lot more complex. An extreme example is announce/commit
sacrifices to mining fees: if I'm at block n+1, the rest of the network
is at block n, and there's a 100BTC sacrifice at block n+2, I could
easily be in a situation where I have zero incentive to publish my block
to keep everyone else behind me, and just hope I find block n+2. If I
do, great! I'll immediately publish to lock-in my winnings and start
working on block n+3

Good paradox, and it is related to Paul's point regarding divergence between the PM's price prediction and the current price.
Assuming the market prices are correct, the full probability distribution must be as follows: P(Bitcoin price multiplier =2) = 0.5, P(bitcoin price multiplier = 0)=0.5, such that the expected future value of bitcoin equals bitcoin's current value. Note that because bitcoin cannot have negative value, a 50% point mass at 0x and 2x is the only valid pmf (probability distribution) with expected value=1.
But who would take the other side of that bet? How much would you pay for an asset that would be worth 5 mBTC if and only if bitcoin is worth $0?
So, unless I'm being careless, it is an impossible situation (assuming markets are rational and all arbitrage opportunities are gone).

I meant it in a more nuanced sense than that: current price and a futures market for the price do not contain the same information. With a futures market, you can get a multivariate probability distribution of prices of bitcoin AND other events happening in the world, which you can compute conditional probabilities from.
The market price averages over the entire distribution so it contains less information.

This is *key*. You are willing to allow bitcoin's *only* advantage over fiat to depend on altruism. This is *absurd*. If bitcoin can be destroyed, there *will* be ways to make that profitable, such as shorting the price before attacking the network.


They don't now, and I don't see why they will in the future. They will outsource it, or just not accept bitcoins (if they thought the risk of double spends is high enough to make it not worthwhile). In either case, there is no strong incentive for a merchant to run a node.

On your point about spending driving GDP: it doesn't really. The more times a dollar is spent in a year, the higher nominal GDP is, but when you calculate real GDP, in theory, it will all wash out. Yes, without spending, there would be no production, but it doesn't follow that the # of dollars spent changes productivity; it just changes nominal GDP and the price level by the same amount.

I wasn't aware. After all, that's not what was said:


doesn't have any disclaimer about this only being a problem because bitcoin is 6 years old and only a few years (affirmatively) legal (in some jurisdictions).
It's also a very stupid discussion. You're comparing a 6 year old currency with a $5 billion market cap and a few hundred companies to the most widely circulated (and one of the oldest, with more than 1,000x market cap of Bitcoin) currencies on planet Earth, with a multi trillion dollar per year banking system, the authority to inflate the currency at will, and the US Government, and many other governments' policies supporting it?
I don't know what makes you look dumber: thinking that this is a useful discussion to have, or your (suspect) understanding of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-26 04:20:37
Yeah, this is complete nonsense. All of this.
1. Velocity is *not* the # of transactions. It is the average # of times each unit of money is spent in unit time (usually a year). You can have high-velocity bitcoin where each of the 7tps are 10,000,000 BTC transactions and a million tps happens on the lightning network, or low velocity BTC, where each of the 7 tps are 0.01 BTC transactions between addresses you own.
2. Keynesian economists don't believe that money velocity is fixed. That is the *entire* purpose of changing M--to compensate for changes to V to counter certain business cycle phenomena.
3. Austrian economists do not believe that money velocity "should" expand and contract--they just think it does. And "send price signals to the market as to the value of money" is word salad.
4. These "computer software developers" live and breathe game theory. The macro-economic perspective (which you don't understand) is not relevant if it is not compatible with bitcoin's other features.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:19:50


By the same reasoning, using fiat to buy bitcoin to have the merchant sell them back to buy fiat (assuming the merchant doesn't hodl his coins) is *using* fiat.
Do you think you're making fiat more valuable?
In my view, it all comes back to hodling. If more people want to save bitcoin, it's value will go up. That's the only way, because any bitcoin bought is also a bitcoin sold.
Now if instead you're talking about "value" in a sense other than price, then you might be right. Still though, the price is what the vast majority of adoption depends on.
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:03:13


Estimates vary, but at least ~2,700 ([source]( if you have a very high standard for proof. Do a custom search [here]( to see if you find better estimates, but I'd put it at at least 100,000. [Check out this list of threads](


No impact at all.


Nope. There are very few coins that are *provably* lost, i.e. those associated with addresses for which there is no chance at all that anyone has the private key.
All other coins are just *allegedly* lost, until they are spent.


I don't think so actually. Back in the day, losing 50 bitcoins cost you a few dollars. Now, it would cost $20,000. People know this and back up their keys.
Have you ever lost  a $100 bill?

His mind was never fully made up. Peter Todd and Luke Jr are both against substantial increases to the blocksize (at least) and are not paid by Blockstream.
Anyway, Blockstream is not going to directly profit from sidechains and will not profit from limiting bitcoin's use. There is no motive.
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:12:31


More evidence of your unwillingness to argue in good faith. People just quietly shut off their nodes, as you can see by looking at various node counts. It's all public, obviously.
*You* are the one who takes a single thread as "proof" against an argument while ignoring the declining node count.


Similar arguments can be made about paying regulators large amounts of money to regulate in the public interest (a public good).


You're not very inventive then. They can simply attempt to enforce regs that require licensure of full nodes. This would be easy to implement if full node operators were all businesses (or required hardware out on the tails of the distribution of consumer products).
Put another way, ISPs know if you're uploading torrents carelessly. Monitoring Bitcoin's P2P is just as easy.

That chart is ridiculous. The vast majority of transactions are not customer-&gt;merchant.
The reason people move fewer bitcoins when the price rises is because each bitcoin is worth more.
Underneath those spikes is a constant exponential trend in bitcoin transactions, coinciding with adoption.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:50:25
If you were honest about this debate, you would count the "-1"s as well as the "+1"s.
That said, node count is just an indicator of the network's decentralization. The actual metric is the *cost of running a full node*; don't forget that as bitcoin becomes more valuable, governments will have a larger interest in raising this cost through regulation.

I don't care about the number of full nodes (which, as you know, have been *falling* with adoption, not rising).
I care about people's ability to run a full node if they want to. Having 10,000 full nodes that each cost $1,000 a month to run is far less preferable than having 1,000 full nodes that cost $50 a month to run.
In a world where only businesses run full nodes, full nodes will be regulated and bitcoin will be destroyed. I also happen to not think that world will exist, because why would any business pay hundreds of dollars a month to broadcast every transaction on the planet, when they can just outsource to one service with economies of scale?

Why is your personal opinion relevant? Bitcoin *cannot* remain decentralized with no blocksize cap in its current form.

Hodling is contributing. It increases spenders' purchasing power by raising the value of the bitcoin. It all balances.
And there is no need to worry that "everyone will hodl" and nobody will spend, because if nobody spends their bitcoins, I vow that I will spend as the price rises to infinity and subsequently buy all of the world's capital with some dust from old addresses of mine.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:35:41


Don't be innumerate. Benefiting a bunch of people by a small amount is not clearly worse or better than benefiting a single person by a larger amount.

Unbelievably frustrating that we've let them define hitting the block limit as a catastrophe. If the block limit is not hit, transaction fees have no hope of paying for network security because there will be no price competition. Likewise, there will be no real business incentive to offer people other solutions for off-chain transactions.
As long as bitcoin is popular, blocks should *always* be full (at least at current block size).

This will not add to bitcoin's value, that is nonsense. Making 1 satoshi trades on the blockchain increases the value of a bitcoin by approximately 0.

Likewise, if I announce that "whoever holds this Satoshi will be the rightful owner of my house", this will not change bitcoin's value in the slightest.

If there's no good reason why they do it, then there should be no reason to think the following:
1. That they do it often (thus, that most of the volume is "fake")
2. That all of the enormous change in volume over the past few weeks are exclusively due to "fakers".

This isn't true. Look at the actual inflation rate in Venezuela vs. their government bond yields. At equilibrium, it should be true (because there's always the chance that governments will default or increase their inflation rates so the risk must be compensated for), but ask any government bond investor why they hold them: they will tell you that that they do it to avoid inflation.
I don't think you are distinguishing between corporate bonds and government bonds, so keep that in mind. Likewise, lumping all types of bonds together with stocks is *not* the right comparison to make with gold (bitcoin's closes approximation). Gold serves a *very* different purpose from stocks and corporate bonds, as does bitcoin.

On the point about TIPS vs. regular gov bonds, as far as I know, the only reason people prefer one over another is if they think that the market is over/underpredicting the future inflation rate. It's the equivalent decision to getting a fixed-rate mortgage vs. a variable one.
If so, it still doesn't change the central point: government bonds are ways to park your money so you will, on average, be compensated for inflation.
I still think that's true, but I'm happy to concede that the government bond market will be only 30% smaller if there were another way to guarantee that you will be protected from inflation. If so, add about $200,000 to bitcoin's value (due to American hodlers, not their European, South American, or Asian counterparts, which add another many hundreds of thousands).
Lastly, when you invest in TIPS, you assume that the CPI will be honest and accurately reflects inflation rates. To me, that governments have a history of understating inflation, says that the government bond market is a better indicator of the inflation rate. Though I recognize that I'm assuming my conclusion here.

There is no relevant likelihood function here, so all numbers are necessarily arbitrary. Your point wasn't a useful one.

PayPal requires large-scale servers to be able to handle that transaction processing capacity. They don't own, maintain, and dedicate those servers to processing transactions for free. If Bitcoin's decentralization put those kinds of demands on node operators, it would lose its entire competitive advantage. The cost of running a node would be a not insignificant fraction of PayPal's operating costs and Bitcoin would die.
Bitcoin, i.e. the thing that full nodes run, will never be able to compete with a profit-seeking centralized business on its own terms--it would be like asking if the Linux OS is better at designing phones than Apple.
Obviously, this doesn't mean that bitcoin won't be used; payment channels (implemented through the Lightning Network for example) will allow bitcoin's use to scale infinitely, because they will be operated by entities which can internalize the benefit to pay for the costs of settling transactions. Those are what should be compared to PayPal. When compared, they are vastly superior to PayPal.

Yeah, bitcoin core is a full node, so it's in the original spirit of bitcoin. No need to do that though, especially for a newbie. Electrum is a lighter alternative.
I would write down any recovery keys Electrum provides and keep that safe. If you want to store your bitcoin offline, make sure you additionally write down the generated private key (and address, though you can just save that public on your computer because it's public) for extra security in case you lose the recovery keys.
Strictly speaking, the only things you need are your private keys. QR codes are just for convenience. Electrum generates your private keys from a single recovery key (12 words I think), so you'll have redundancy if you write both down. If you misplace them, move all your coins before someone else does.

I've been giving it some thought and can only conclude that Adam Back is an MI6 operative. He's carrying out the plans of a 235 year old initiative that was launched to undermine the American Revolution by rendering the DOI null and void. Countermeasures were put in place by the American revolutionaries at the last minute, wherein they hid the original document that was tampered with by the British (I'm guessing in some elaborate cryptographic way that involves a Church's creepy underground cellar, a treacherous climb up Mount Rushmore, and run-ins with extant Native American Tribes, all of which will finally shed light on the fate of the lost colony of Roanoke) and forged new fake DOIs that declare American independence.
Related developments in Back's work to break the cryptography that hides the real document, as well as mission creep has resulted in Blockstream corp, which exists to undermine bitcoin, which is, of course, a Financial Revolution.
It's the end of the line, Dr. Back. Reddit mob, assemble!

They will use the minimum possible. If this means that they need to hold 100000000 satoshi as tokens to be backed by 1 trillion dollars in financial assets, they'll do it. This will multiply each bitcoin's price, in equilibrium, by 21000000/20999999=1.00000004761 or raise it by 0.000004761%.

Absent from your analysis is the possibility, which I mentioned, of shorting bitcoin and profiting from *disrupting* the network. This is possible *exactly because of long propagation (and validation) time through the network*.

Quick, someone weave this into a new Blockstream conspiracy theory!
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:20:15
He didn't prove anything relevant. Of course large block sizes have a higher orphan rate, and of course in the limit, waiting forever to publish your infinite-sized block will give you 0 expected profit (just because of the linear growth of the revenue vs. the faster-than-linear decay of finding enough blocks successively). There will be an equilibrium.
The actual debate, however, is that the equilibrium block size may be too high for people to cheaply run nodes (i.e. blocks have a negative externality), and may cause some *other* vulnerabilities that are much harder to predict.
It's pretty reasonable to think that raising the blocksize without near-unanimity, especially before safer and more effective scaling measures are implemented, is a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:09:05


I disagree with the premise and the analysis: this isn't a problem, and if it were true that nobody were willing to part with their coins, the price would be infinite. It's not, so people, empirically, *do* part with their coins.
Also, if buying things with bitcoins were so great, then surely people would be ok spending their coins, then rebuying the same # of coins on an exchange. It doesn't matter how "precious" they felt their coins are: there are always more to buy.


Also disagree here. This sort of activity doesn't directly drive up price. The *only* thing that drives up price is more people being comfortable holding more value in bitcoin. This is exactly the opposite of what would happen if you encouraged people to "use" bitcoins more by spending them.
@_date: 2015-10-03 18:14:17
That's essentially what mining pools do. The pool operator runs a full node and delegates to the miners the role of hashing data over and over again until one of them randomly produces a small enough hash.
There's no way that the protocol can know that these miners are different people from the pool operator though, so it doesn't really work. The miners don't need to interface directly with the network; they just need to be told what to hash.
@_date: 2015-10-17 00:15:01


But not necessarily its price. Utility of the network doesn't necessarily translate into a high price, because (in part) velocity can increase.


This is also a high velocity use of the coins, likely. The demand could be satisfied by a single bitcoin.
I don't see more than a very minor change in price due to these factors. Obviously, there might be hypothetical second order effects, but those are more tenuous.

I hope you don't consider that an argument *against* the LN.
Blockstream is the only company funding the LN, and they are also funding the (IMO much more important meta-strategy for bitcoin's success): sidechains.
The work on LN is a classic example of a public good. It is open source technology and there are many competing businesses in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Why would Coinbase spend $100,000 USD on it when, if they don't, BitPay might?
Blockstream's business strategy is, as far as I can tell, to emerge as something of a think tank/brand name for Bitcoin once they've developed a reputation for contributing to its success. The investors in it probably also own tens of thousands of bitcoins and would benefit from a more robust ecosystem, thanks to sidechains.
When you're a group of multimillionaire angel investors with a large stake in bitcoin, it's worthwhile to employ a few developers to help ensure its succes.

Obviously stability is relative. But my point was only that MtGox could not have changed the price (for long) without changing the fundamentals. MtGox is no more, so the current price *is* the correct price of bitcoin.
"Help" is not the right word to use. Bitcoin has risen more than 40x from 2012. MtGox caused it to rise 160x and then "hurt" it by reducing its value by 75%; now it is at 40x and on an uptrend.

Not in money, especially when the digital currencies are so similar. That's probably why bitcoin has the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market cap.

The 51% attack threshold is unchanged, but that is just an asymptotic argument. Day-to-day security is provided by the feasibility of reversing transactions after X minutes. With 10% of the hash rate, reversing a transaction 10 minutes and one block deep is much easier than reversing a transaction that is 10 minutes and 10 blocks deep.

You're backtracking. The subsidy has no causal relationship on the transaction fees. The tx fees are *only* a function of the network imposed floor and the opportunity cost of adding a tx to a block.
In your other comments, you implied that tx fees MUST rise to compensate for the "subsidized nature of tx fees". This is absolutely false. If it were true, then tx fees would be higher by many orders of magnitude (measured in dollars), now that the subsidy has fallen by 75% because the price of bitcoin is lower than its highs.
This did not happen, and if you were smart enough you wouldn't have expected it to.

Why would it stop at 30 or 40k? If bitcoin were stable, I'd hold all of my savings in it. I also wouldn't (not that I do...) own any government debt (there is about $13,000,000,000,000 of this owned by Americans as a long-term way of storing savings to protect from inflation).
That $13 trillion moving into bitcoin would increase its price by more than a half million dollars per coin. If bitcoin takes off, why would anybody *not* store/denominate their savings in it? Bitcoin is hyperinflation-proof and unconfiscatable. There is no equilibrium where its market cap (assuming nonzero) is less than a few trillion dollars.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:14:32

On your calculation though, you're better off estimating the total amount of *wealth* that will be held in bitcoin at any one time. To go from annual GDP to such an estimate is difficult, because I don't know what fraction of the average person's annual wealth they store in cash or cash-substitutes (such as savings and gov bonds).
That's why I prefer to look at the market capitalizations of things which I reasonably think bitcoin is superior to, such as gold, government bonds, and cash in bank/savings accounts. Summing up this total dollar amount (converting via exchange rates as appropriate) and dividing by 21,000,000 is then a reasonable estimate of bitcoin's moon price.
I've done this before, and the rough estimates of the upper bound on bitcoin's price given bitcoin's global domination and no fractional reserve is something north of $4,000,000 per coin.

Yes, that's math that assumes nobody anticipated the halving.

But that's not many, because ASIC profits are capitalized into the cost of the equipment.

@_date: 2015-11-07 19:34:20


Relative to what? Promising to inflate the currency if the stock market crashes doesn't make the stock market less vulnerable in a meaningful sense: it just socializes the risk and supports a higher total market cap. It is not clear at all that this prevents stock market crashes. Maybe it postpones them and makes them bigger, or turns a few small would-be crashes into a large crash that does actually materialize.
You'll have to elaborate on other ways in which they prevent stock market crashes if you didn't mean through inflation.

Could be hundreds. My argument still stands for anywhere more than a handful. 


So the following are your assumptions:
1. All recent growth in volume on both of the largest Chinese exchanges is "fake".
2. Of which, the majority of a *single* person, (thus having traded the majority of 1.7 million bitcoins in the last three days) who, for *no reason* has decided to risk a fortune, totally independently from the fact that the price is rising.
Thus, trends in volume changes are, without a doubt, "totally meaningless" because it is just the consequence of one lone trader, trading $200,000,000 + dollars for no expected gain, and only exposure to risk.
You have absolutely *no* ability to think with any nuance if you believe that story.

This is a terrible answer.

Because the demand is for a tiny fraction of a bitcoin, down to one satoshi. A single satoshi can represent infinite amounts of value when bitcoins are used as a *token*, backed by a real-world asset.

Yep, this is the right answer. Most mining is done by ASICs, which have most of their profit capitalized into the price of the hardware; marginal profit is high, so it won't make sense for almost all of them (save for the least efficient) to be turned off.

All of those come from a money's network. If bitcoin is used much more widely than another money, it will be more convenient/secure/useful.
If a new coin emerges that simply *blows bitcoin out of the water*, bitcoin will just be patched to include whatever new innovative feature that it's competitor has, or the competitor will exist as a side chain.
Or maybe that new coin will do to bitcoin what bitcoin will do to fiat currency. We'll see what that is.

No problem. I think that lifeboatz's plan is still a good one.
Because you will definitely want to be able to spend/move your bitcoins at a moment's notice, you either need
* A brain wallet
* A CD or two and/or a USB stick with your cold storage bitcoins. Or if you have access to your email address, then you can just access an emailed backup if you aren't too paranoid.
The trade-off, as always, balances ease of access of you to your bitcoins with ease of access of thieves to your bitcoins.
The USB stick/CD requires more hardware and software, so if you're short on time, it may not be the better plan.
Edit: The most secure way to do both of these is to download and liveboot or install [Ubuntu 10.04.4 desktop version]( and either:
download [armory for Ubuntu, offline version (64-bit most likely)]( follow the instructions to install it, and generate encrypted copies of the wallet you create
Go to [bitaddress.org]( save the bitaddress.org page to a USB, and load it offline by clicking on the page in Ubuntu. Generate a brain wallet using something like lifeboatz' method and print out the private key to store in a safe at home in case you forget the seed.
Hope that helps a little. Let me know if anything is unclear.

What is easy to overlook is that whether bitcoin is regulated, remains in a grey-area, or is free from regulation, people who want to use it for illegal activities will always be able to do so unhindered.
Take the Silk Road, for example, and consider whether drug traders care if bitcoin is living up to its full potential as a cheap, fast, global payment processor, remittance service (and MUCH more) or whether it becomes a currency used only for illegal transactions. Bad guys can launder $10,000 worth of one-dollar bitcoins just as easily as they can launder $10,000 worth of one-thousand-dollar bitcoins.
In other words, bitcoin, just like a firearm, and just like the internet, legal or not, can be used for harm. Protecting us from that should remain under the traditional purview of law enforcement, not in restricting our freedom. 
What we, and the rest of the world, would like to learn from these hearings is that the federal government embraces bitcoin for the good that bitcoin can do, and recognizes the evil as an inevitability of human nature.

1. There's no reason to assume that the bitcoins in those 100 addresses will remain there forever. Use the total bitcoins in circulation.
2. Use ~20 million bitcoins for your estimate of the total amount, because it will reach that amount relatively soon.
3. It is only valid to assume that total market cap of bitcoin = total income if the velocity of BTC is 1. Likely, 1 BTC in circulation will represent much more than 1 BTC of goods.
4. Don't use the median income of the US if you assume that people in other countries will use BTC as well.

I haven't yet thought about the repeated game, so I'll get back to you if I have time. However, it relies upon some mechanism to identify who has been gaming the system.
Also, let's say I operate a small (5%) mining pool and I play the selfish strategy. I get 5.5% of the block rewards and am happy. The other mining pools then have a choice: do they become selfish and risk mutual destruction, or do they all agree to remain honest? This may also be stable; the transactions are confirmed, yet my mining pool extorts the others for a subsidy.

By 2052, the reward will be less than 0.025 BTC. If you think the value of a bitcoin will have increased to somewhere on the order of $250,000 by then, then we have the same network security (realistically, the network is stronger than it needs to be right now, so maybe BTC will only need to be $25,000 at that time). After that, do you think its value will continue to double every 4 years?
Yes, 2052 is a long way off, but by then BTC will have so much inertia that it may be quite difficult to ready the network for the continued halving of the reward.

It's not a problem. The merchant can just specify whether he would like the initial price in the currency of payment or not. It will simply depend upon which currency the merchant keeps his balance in.
If I bought a $100 item 2 months ago for a bitcoin, the merchant will refund me the $100 USD if that's how he chooses to keep his revenue (and thus offered dollars for exchanged items); if he keeps his revenue in bitcoin, and promises to refund in BTC, he will refund me the value of one BTC.
Obviously, there is no profitable business model with fluctuating exchange rates that allows the customer to decide how he would like his refund at the exchange rate of his choosing.
This can all simply be worked out in advance.

You likely won't be able to do this on two different exchanges. When you sell your bitcoins, you will have dollars. Good luck withdrawing and depositing your dollars in time to buy back before it rebounds. I don't think you've thought this through...

Inflation does not effect the real interest rate, only the nominal one. I could just as easily ask people:
"Why would you ever spend dollars if you can just invest them and get [1 + inflation + interest rate] back every year?"

The final allocation of bitcoins doesn't depend heavily on the initial distribution. As bitcoin grows, purchasing power will be transferred to bitcoin holders. If they use the bitcoins well and create businesses through investment, then they will accumulate more wealth. If not, their stock will dwindle. Long-term, there's little reason to think that this is a bad thing that we early adopters might be rich.
Further, that an early adopter will be controlling significant amounts of wealth is better than if a late adopter did. Early adopters are more likely more tech savvy, less impulsive, and are (I'll add humbly) smarter. They can put the coins to better use and deserve the coins they've saved.

You're confusing group group rationality with individual rationality.
Think about this:
If it (again) turned out that there were a flaw in Bitcoin that allowed people to spend each other's coins, your model of human behavior would predict that nobody would steal, because it would make their stolen coins worthless. But one person decision to not steal doesn't affect what others choose. One person can rationally decide to steal from his neighbors because although it increases the chance of his bitcoins becoming worthless, on average, it will make him much richer; the punishment for his action is socialized.
It's just an example of the tragedy of the commons.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:02:03


That's (popular) nonsense. Saving your bitcoins lowers the average velocity of money and lowers price levels, allowing all of the spenders (on investment or consumption) to buy more for less BTC. In other words, price levels adjust. 
Because Satoshi may never spend his fortune, it effectively means that 1,000,000 coins are lost; price levels remain low-- but there are no idle resources caused by Satoshi's untouched fortune.
Put another way, there are only "idle resources" if *real* resources, not money, are sitting around accumulating dust. If I decide to spend my life staring at block 1 waiting for Satoshi to spend his fortune so I can become his butler, there would have been a true waste of resources.

I interpreted tippecanoe's comment about block-size limit to be that if you artificially limit the network to 0.01 tps, as an extreme example, there will be significant competition for inclusion into the blockchain. That would certainly resolve the problem, but it would make transactions very expensive and reduce security because total tx fees will probably be reduced.
I totally see what you're saying: in the future, tps will rise significantly so there will be automatic competition for inclusion. But I think you'd agree that this is an inefficient way of pricing txs.
To me, this is like arguing a carbon tax vs. cap and trade. Either we can have mandatory fees but allow individuals to spam the network, or we can cap the transaction rate and allow a market for txs. Both are imperfect; better would be to privatize completely.

Yes, it does. Price levels equilibrate to a lower level until the coins reenter circulation.
Of course, it won't be noticeable because bitcoin won't equilibrate for a long time.
Edit: It's instructive to understand the logic behind this formula: MV=KP
The product of money supply "M" and the velocity of money (how many times each unit it spent each year) "V" is proportional to (hence the constant "k") price levels "P".
If I hoard my coins, it can either be understood as if the money supply fell, or that the average speed at which money flows through the economy falls. If either one of those variables doubled while the other remained the same, price levels would double. Hence, their product can simply be thought of as MV="the amount of currency units competing for a society's product".

As I've posted about before, the biggest imperfection in bitcoin relates to the incentives behind mining and the difficulty in creating an efficient transaction fee market.
Without creating artificial scarcity by limiting the block size, the marginal cost for including a tx in a block is nil. Without the ~~25 BTC~~ block subsidy (in the 22nd century), the mining reward will drop, as in any competitive market, and the network will weaken.
On the other side, until the reward is phased out, as the subsidy grows in price (due to the per BTC price increasing faster than the subsidy decays) an ever-increasing amount of money will be spent on making the network impervious to attack. This is a social problem, but won't destabilize the network; it will just waste some electricity/hardware.

* How, again, is paper money inherently stable? You can counterfeit and inflate it. Governments can monetize debt with it. It's completely subject to the whims of politicians.
* And how does having a fixed supply make bitcoin inherently unstable? The only thing that can affect bitcoin's real value, once it stabilizes at it's ultimate level of adoption, is the growth of the economy, or the velocity of money.

Yes, paper wallet is the way to go. You might want to put it in a [chest so it feels more "real"]( and perhaps make the address, firstbits, etc.. highly visible so she can check the balance without revealing/endangering the private key.
Go for a vanitygen address as well.

The subsidy is about 10% annualized. That means that if bitcoin weren't appreciating, holding on to BTC for about 5 weeks would result in a 1% 'fee'.
In other words, the subsidy is devaluing everybody's bitcoins; not just the ones transacted.
Now when you factor in bitcoin's appreciation despite the heavy inflation, the transaction fees are actually negative.

@_date: 2013-09-08 14:57:51
Yes, that's right.
But I think you're not being careful: you assume that the blocksize limit will be set appropriately. Not that I think the devs don't have good intentions, but if you are trying to make the cap reflect real costs in HD space or bandwidth, which change in real time constantly, they would always have to be updating the blocksize as well.
More fundamentally, the blocksize is a hard cap, which could only possibly make the fees reflect the dynamic of the market price if the cost for every miner were the same. ie. what happens if there is only room for 10^6 txs, so fees are 0.001 BTC, but the marginal cost for some large proportion of the miners is 0.0005? Miners want to accept it; the transactors want confirmation; it will have to wait arbitrarily.
Edit: This obviously does not likely spell a death sentence for BTC, but it will be many times easier to fix if addressed sooner. Especially once/if politics gets involved and huge amounts of BTC are at stake.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:47:08
But interest rates are equally higher. Why should it encourage one form of spending over another? On the other hand, if you encourage all forms of spending, you just increase price levels.

So you value bitcoins at twice their current market price? If so, I'll sell you my bitcoins at the discounted price of $1600...and use the proceeds to buy more.
In other words, if you prefer to have bitcoins over dollars, spend your dollars to buy more bitcoins, and spend those bitcoins for the black friday discount.

That's silly. Tell me why an economy using 20 million total bitcoins with 10 million being saved forever and uninvested is different at all, besides for price level, from a 20 million bitcoin economy with none being held as savings?
Saved coins, "cash balances", just affect price levels; the only thing that affects the growth of the economy is the relative amount of consumption vs. investment. That is, the amount of people who are working to produce things that people directly consume vs. working to produce things that increase future production. Nominal price levels do not matter, and that is the only variable affected by savings, in the "cash balance" sense of the word.

I can't get too excited about any form of democracy.
Anyway, I think bitcoin has a good system of checks and balances: if the foundation threatens to ruin bitcoin, it can simply be forked and a (or many) new foundation(s) can be formed. Also, the foundation has an enormous financial stake in the bitcoin market.
As long as the foundation does not get to tax us, and exists as a voluntary benefactor of the community, I am not going to get too worked up about it. I say, let new foundations form, let them experiment with methods of organization, and we'll let bitcoin grow stronger through competition.

Because of the block-size being lowered?
If the block-size is lowered arbitrarily, is there any reasonable way to decide how much lower it should be? It just seems like creating artificial scarcity if this ends up lowering tps (granted, to solve a worse problem). It's still not an efficient mining market.
If tps remains the same--smaller, but more frequent blocks--the problem remains.

I already agree. But if bitcoin were to replace the whole fiat money system (I'll give it the benefit of the doubt: only M0), bitcoin would be worth about 300k each. That's about $400 bn dollars each year (current block reward; or $200 bn per year at 12.5 BTC/block).
It's not something to disregard. I don't know how it compares to the current system. Then again, this is assuming that BTC price will be very low because it will be fractionally reserved.
Still, I don't think that bitcoin will get that expensive within the next 8 years, and I do think that the benefit of not having government control over money is worth far more than a few trillion dollars over decades.

* The software might be a trojan and allow Satoshi to mint his own bitcoins
* Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, unlike gold, which has non-monetary applications (to this, you can obviously respond that bitinstant proved that you can use bitcoins as vehicles for transactions, and nothing more)
In all other areas bitcoin is far less assailable than gold as a money. You don't have to worry about the arguments re. deflation, nor any criticism that bitcoin is mostly speculative and volatile at present.

lol.  You don't need to preface that.  I'm not a trader.  I'm a buy-and-hold-er.
So your advice would be to place small buy orders.  You don't need to be too clever to figure that our as a rule of thumb.  I tried to be very clear about the scenario I envisioned:
If you think the price will soon correct upwards, ie that nobody will place any more sell orders, then you would want to be the first to eat up the orders that stand at that time.  If bitcoin suddenly fell to $2, you would want to be the first to place buy orders.  It doesn't matter that it moves the price; it will move anyway when the next trader buys.

Obviously all things equal it's more reasonable to be paid in the more widely accepted currency; but under certain circumstances, it's reasonable to be paid in alternatives. Personally, I'd have been happy if my boss paid me in bitcoins all of the last two years. Also, if I were sending money to family abroad, I'd prefer to go straight to bitcoin, rather than converting my paycheck.

Yes, obviously. You wouldn't normally want to denominate something in BTC if you think BTC will grow faster than return on the investment. You wouldn't want to loan TSLA stock if you think it will grow faster than anything else.
I am talking long-term, once the rate of growth of BTC value is more or less equal to GDP growth--when it reaches peak adoption and stops being monetized. After all, that's what the objection to deflationary currencies is: that long-term, they will cause the economy to grind to a halt.

The nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate plus the rate of inflation.  If the rate of inflation is negative, then the nominal interest rate will simply be lower.
The same argument can be made in an inflationary environment:
"The interest rate is so high that nobody will spend their money; if they save, they will have more money to spend in the future."
All of this ignores the fact that the interest rate emerges from the market and will fall if too high, or rise if too low.

No problem. It's related to the fact that when you gain 10% then lose 10% it is equivalent to losing 1% (not 0%). If it helps, think "what would happen if the difficulty rose by 100%?". Logically, you wouldn't make 0 BTC/day; you'd make 0.5 BTC/day.

They aren't inflationary. They are just more competitors like gold, silver, and fiat. That's the point that is important to make. There is still a strong network effect that is specific to bitcoin because all bit/altchains are incompatible with each other, just like how silver can't be transmuted into gold.

Fractional reserve doesn't lead to a dollar. Fractional reserve + FDIC leads to a dollar.
Anyway, I doubt bitcoin would be fractionally reserved much at all. It's easier to trade than the paper claims to gold issued by fractional reserve banks. There's not much of a reason for fractional reserve for BTC.

Andreas is great, but I agree. Further, the fact that marginal profit mining on ASICs is low makes ASIC miners more willing to stay and compete during 51% attacks.
All of the GPU miners will drop out when difficulty rises too high. For an ASIC, the cost is sunk.

Did you mean it *is* individually irrational? I'm not sure what you meant by that thought.
About the honest strategy (or predominantly honest) being a stable equilibrium:
Given certain parameters (very low tolerance for risk, high tolerance of the market to subsidize selfish miners, few, large mining pools) it might be. I'd be happy to look at that PDF later. But under general assumptions, people aren't homogenous, and there might be enough who rationally behave selfishly.


The selfish equilibrium does; but what about a 1-99 split between selfish-nonselfish? No paperweights, and selfish miner benefits at the expense of the nonselfish. I'd be surprised if you can come up with a reasonable scenario where it doesn't cascade to 25-75 or something similarly dangerous.
In the real world, I don't think this will be a huge problem, because miners mostly act in large pools. Those pools will find it in their interests to play nice. But the pure game theory, I think it's clear what we should predict, assuming we have many individual miners.
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:42:46

I presume you don't mean to say that this would disincentivize the miner from including the new tx, right? I suppose this is a matter of how mining pools coordinate their searches for the right hash, but even in a mining pool, keeping track of what nonces you try would have a very small effect on your probability of finding a hash as long as there is lots of competition between different pools. If you're a lone miner, then it hardly matters at all.
I'm not a miner, so I don't have a good sense for the numbers and the probabilities.
...ah yes, I agree that miners should be indifferent to including or not including the new txs.
I think we agree that miners will accept no fee transactions. Therein lies the problem:
Once inflation ends, miners still won't have much reason to exclude no-fee transactions, because it almost certainly doesn't affect their search for the right hash. Pretty soon, most people will realize that their txs are included even without fees, and the average fee/tx will go down. Fewer and fewer miners will be profitable, and difficulty will consequently decrease to an inefficiently low level.
Does that make sense?
