word of mouth, for one.  also, having a good .com shows more legitimacy for businesses.

Hey guys,
Lars Behrenroth is one of the top deep house djs in the world.  Highly recommend his free podcast Deeper Shades of House which has 440+ episodes and millions of downloads.
  
I reached out to him to see if he had considered accepting Bitcoin as an alternative means of payment for accepting donations as well as his optional subscription service.  
He's open to the idea, especially if it would integrate well with his current subscription service which is a component for Joomla called AEC.
Can anyone provide some suggestions?  Thanks!
