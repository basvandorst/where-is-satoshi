Hi, how long do you think it will take now? Still unconfirmed. And I'm curious as to how you are doing this? Are you a miner?

Bitcoin Trillionaire here. Buy and hold!

You cant make someone accept something if there area better alternatives. People are talking about 8 - 12 hours transaction times. I have a BTC transaction pending confirmation for 6 hours. For the first time ever there are aprox. 100 thousand transactions waiting confirmation. Fees are sky hight. Something is wrong with BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-11 03:40:56

"Some of us wish it would last till January 1st, when Coinbase will release hundreds of thousands of b-ash coins, most of which will be dumped for BTC." 
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:44:59
its not "just backed up", 116k transactions still pending on BTC network. Stop lying to people.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:19:20
Just a few people on exchanges swapping back and forth lol, yeah and the earth is flat.

Investing in cryptocurrencies right now is considered a high risk investment. I mean, really hight, for most people. If market crashes, I'm pretty sure people would lose tradicional money and be afraid to invest further in cryptos. 
Now if the crash happens 20 years from now when everyone would already be introduced and classed on cryptos, tradicional money would convert to crypto money in the blink of an eye.

redditor for 6 days...
Edit: I'm in. But I want 25% of the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:43:38
Lol this guy is not OP, come on.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:42:56
lol, you are not OP, nice try though.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:29:43
Well I've been waiting for 4 hours now for my transaction to confirm. A group of bitcoin miners apparently also stopped accepting Bitcoins atm for some reason. I think something is going on.
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:14:22
lol what a fucking retard, its a nice question. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:01:43
transaction times + fees are not viable... If more people get in, it will become worst. Price will reflect that for the next 3 days. Expect BTC to go down. I'm not saying BTC is bad, me myself I'll be buying again after next drop. 3 days untill things stabilize (115k current uncompleted transactions) and I'll be back on BTC. Just waiting and out of it for now.

Lol in 20 years another better blockchain will already take over Bitcoin. Governments will ban most coins that they can't track / tax and so on. It's a long jorney ahead. No even Jebus knows where we will be in 20 years.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:25:22
This guy is the real Jesus!
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:07:51
If you can do it I will tip!
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:43:27
this is how you spread false information, believing in it. there is no hard fork, only an update, as mentioned on another comment.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:19:38
Same here. I'm worried.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:55:43
Its not just Coinbase. Its Bitcoin. Read the commends. Many people with 10+ hours waiting to confirm transactions...
