I sent 40 dollars worth of bitcoin from coinbase to bitgrail to buy raiblocks. They took out 33 dollars in fees lol.

You guys tell me when it is cheap to buy and I will. Then I will get you guys some pizza when I am rich.

Part of my problem is nothing seems official about them. I can't just click convert cash to bitcoins on Paypal or something. Everything seems shady when I try to buy in.

Anyone know where I can find these coins? Any good fountains to go skimming in?

I don't drink. I just want a place to hang out and scoop the poop.

I subbed to this sub and all I ever post about is how much I regret never getting into it. All I am doing is torturing myself. I DESERVE THIS.

Shoot. If i had a million dollars I'd quit my job, open a grill with someone to run it for me and spend the rest of my life being that guy that is sitting at the bar there every night.

What about a food truck?

The higher their value rises the worse I feel for not getting in on this.

I'll trade someone 2 pizzas for only 100 bitcoins. That is a great deal based on past pizza for bitcoin trades.

I tell everyone that I have zero and kept saying I was going to buy some but could never figure it out.

I like how people cry about the Koch brothers all the time but if anyone even mentions Soros it is "He is just a boogie man for the right!" You all are such a fucking hypocrite.

Now it is my time to shine! I am gonna buy the corner piece of a bitcoin.

I was too late to get into bitcoins so I have to settle for collecting silver quarters. I have 11.
