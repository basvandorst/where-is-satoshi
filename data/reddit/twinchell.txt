It's all based on simply more time in the market.  If the asset appreciates on average, the earlier you buy it the better...simple as that.  That's of course over a very large sample size, just because you do it doesn't mean it will be better.

Yeah this is so confusing.  What does this actually mean then?

Verge has been hacked three times in the last month and the price has gone up.  Quit trying to think the markets are rational.

And what do you expect for a new blockchain? Butterflies and unicorns? The risk something will go wrong is high \(An attack, bug or exploit for example\). And then after it has proven itself it needs to develop a network effect, get developers, get wallets and so on. And in spite of all this its already in the top5. facepalm.
I see, play both sides, you're a genius.

Leave Jesus out of this!  He would have loved Bitcoin btw.

It's not obvious at all.  This is McAfee's entire reasoning for $1M bitcoin or whatever the fuck it is.  If people are still mining for 0.125 BTC in the year 2100, or whatever the fuck the numbers are, that means BTC must be worth over a million dollars.  Makes no sense.  At that point the miners are just securing the network and processing transactions, not actually mining for the sake of block rewards.

There is no way to know the distribution of Bitcoin.  Since you can't correlate Bitcoin addresses with people, you are simply guessing.

OK, I lied.  If they take out BCash and hold the other 9, I'm all in on that!  :)

A fair point.  But seeing as though BTC makes up over 40%, I don't think you can compare it to traditional stock market index funds.  They don't even offer the  coin...that is representative of a stock index fund not having Microsoft, just seems off to me.  Now, if they were to add the top 10 coins and have an index of that, shit man I'm all in on that!

Hmmmm, why not get 2% cash back with a normal CC and buy crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:32:25
Guys, it's 4 coins.....4!  I'm not sure i call that an index fund.
