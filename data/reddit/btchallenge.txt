It's 128x120.

Until this common suffix starting with Ur2y.., the alpha channel base64 string has three bytes less than the red pixel LSB string for me. Anyone else have this? I triple-checked all my conversions and removing bytes from the red pixel string seems too arbitrary.

I did similar things at first, too. The fact that the red value differs from green and blue is not the encoded information, it is just a consequence of some of the LSBs being modified. The LSBs themselves make up the encoded binary string.

The iCCP chunk is an embedded color profile. It's already present in the original image:
I haven't compared them though.
There are no random chunks before or after the IDAT chunks.

As someone with some of the necessary skills (or so I'd like to think), my biggest criticism so far is the trial and error element and the uncertainty about what is random in the image and what is on purpose. My first reaction to the 0.1 solution was "what the fuck". You could try thousands of other, equally "logical" things before you go "why don't I write the date in YYYYMMDD, interpret it as hex and try subtracting it from the table in a row-wise fashion". The time it takes to bruteforce through all the ideas is what inflates the solving time.
I've been working on a specific aspect of the image for 2-3 days now, but it could just be random junk. Other than that, this has been pretty fun.
Teaming up with people is the way to go I guess. Where are the solver communities at?

If you liked the way people teamed up to solve this and shared pieces of the puzzle, perhaps including more of those smaller prizes would amplify this effect.
Looking forward to understanding how the 310 was claimed before the 0.31.
Thank you very much for this cool challenge.

What confuses me about these symbols is that they're all hex, except for two, which happen to be the starting symbols of base 58 wallet format keys, L and K. My brain wants to treat the symbols all in the same way (hex or ascii?), but it can't. And there's no other reason to differentiate them. If they're meant to be hex, putting the L and K there would be just nasty by the author. If they're not meant to be hex, then why do they all happen to be in that range? We end up with either inconsistency or coincidence, both of which should not occur in a riddle. :D

I can access it via proxies only. Maybe the author is aggressively IP banning people who have tried to find clues on the site :D

I did that, that's what I meant when I said "extracting the pattern from white backgrounds".

Could be an artifact from the effect that makes the table and the cells stick out very slightly (the grey shadow/border at the top and right sides, not sure how to call it). u/bitcoin-challenge, if this is not intentional, please let us know, so we don't completely waste our time on random pixels.

OK, I've looked at the PNG file structure. All the header and chunk fields seem to be sound, I verified everything manually except for the datastreams. 
The only thing worth noting is that it contains its own color profile named "ICC Profile". GIMP also tells you it's "sRGB IEC61966-2.1", which doesn't seem to be anything unusual. Other than this color profile, there is no optional data in the file. It's just the minimally required fields and the datastream.

What's the logic you use to draw a black pixel? I tried four different interpretations and their inverse.
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:32:30
I extracted those, doesn't look like anything to me.
If you run zsteg with -a, there are many more.

From: 
I also found the encrypted strings, except for the rar one. Everything else I've tried to interpret as data seems to be garbage. Anyone willing to point me, very vaguely, in a direction? Is the additional hidden image also something to be found with bit-crunching or can I actually focus on the actual structure (curves, table, polygons,..) of the image?
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:32:58
Ask yourself what the possible reasons for this matching could be. Understanding this was the most fun part for me so far ;)
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:22:17
Mind sharing the first one?
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:08:19
Ah, so that's how that is done. I've replicated this in GIMP (r/[ and I can see only the pattern now, nothing left of the background image. The problem is that this polarization does not filter out the pattern exactly (because of the rest of the image) and that it changes the shades of grey, and therefore the data potentially hidden in it, depending on the parameters you use, in a non-uniform way: That is, the shades become darker, but with different offsets.
I've already noticed that there's a recurring horizontal pattern earlier. I've spent a lot of time extracting the pattern from white backgrounds (had to glue it together from several areas). I converted the pixels to bytes, with and without inversion (255-x) and tried to make any sense of it, to not avail. Independently of how we try to interpret this pattern, I think the following holds: It's not encrypted, encrypted data would not have large areas of the same value (which is due to the background white here) and it would not be restricted to about half of the byte space (there's no dark grey and black).
And in plaintext, it does not make any sense and isn't any known file type either (checked with TrID). It starts with a zero-byte, so that was to be expected..
Do note that the pattern in black areas is a different one (and not the inverse of the one I looked at either). It suffers from the same problems.
I tried combining the two patterns in various ways, but it didn't make the "data" any more meaningful. However, the patterns seems to fit into each other like puzzle pieces. White background corresponds to pattern pixels in the black area pattern, and black background there corresponds to pattern pixels in the white are pattern.
If this helped anyone in any way, please remember me :&gt; 3N7E1fPmE4Bznb5HNu8KtRnMX1pPvr7itN

Indeed I was. Thanks!

This now contains the 0.2 BTC solution!
Here's a summary: Take the groups of symbols connected by the curves when mirroring the curves about the axisat x = 1412 and try all possible permutations of these string and all possible permutations of the groups to obtain the decryption key for the alpha channel string. Considering that those curve connections narrow down the bruteforcing search space a lot, it's not unreasonable to expect someone to come up with this.
From this, you obtain a 4x6 grid that has the same first row as the one we already know and you can decrypt it in the same way to obtain 12 seed words again. Adding the seed words from the first wallet now gives you the words to unlock the 0.2 BTC wallet.

I haven't looked at how RGB and HSV values relate to each other, but I have observed that the hue layer is exactly those pixels where red is less than green and blue. We know that the difference between R and GB is a symptom of the LSB encoding that we have already found, so these hue pixels are a subset of the pixels that were modified for the LSB encoding and thus don't carry any additional information (or are extremely unlikely to).
I will check the file header/metadata/etc stuff, good idea.
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:52:15
Can anyone with Photoshop installed confirm that "Stained Glass", "Texture" and Graphic Pen" were used? Which parts of the image result from these specifically? Is Texture the horizontal, tiled pattern?
Edit: By parts I mean layers/concepts, not areas. If these effects are what I think they are, all the stuff I've been looking at contains no information. RIP :D

Once I knew where to look, I quickly figured out that this bitstring is a base-64 encoded, OpenSSL-encrypted string. I haven't made any progress in finding the decryption key (or the used cipher!), I have nothing to go on.
I'm assuming that this is the already claimed 0.1 BTC key though. I'd like to crack it nonetheless.
