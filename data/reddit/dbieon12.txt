Wish I had diverted funds from my 401k more to Bitcoin. Would have grown significantly more over the last year.

Businesses add Bitcoin as an accepted form of payment everyday.

I don't believe their [approach to security]( is flawed.  For them, or any bitcoin wallet service, having security as *the* top priority is important.  Unfortunately online wallets are an important part in attracting average users to adopt or convert.
I do believe they have issues with scalability and reliability, although I have no idea what is causing that Coinbase Error.  I imagine they are working on the error as we speak.

And there was no one who made money on the Tulip bubble? or the dotcom bubble?
Not admitting that it's a bubble but c'mon.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:01:53
Part of the issue is it is totally possible for a media company, a bank, or a government to buy up everything: an artificial bubble.
I'm not a doomsdayer (well I was at $77) but now I'm convinced it will hit $1000 before it hits $100 again.

I disagree.  From an American point of view, at least, people's lives have changed "all that much" with the Internet.  Sparing the details: social media, online shopping, and (as you said) media consumption.

I do not understand why this had to be posted involving "conspiracy".  Amazon could have intentionally damaged the Bitcoin market but the fact that they are launching a "coin" of their own is enough to warrant the post.  Since they will be launching this service anyway, I am interested in the implications on Bitcoin, not any conspiracy theory.
This is not good for Bitcoin - even if not technologically similar - the inclusion of "coin" in the name could limit hype around Bitcoin.  The scope and scale of Amazon, as well, is a pretty significant advantage for Amazon.
Could this prevent merchant adoption to Bitcoin?

1. I guess the label "hacker" is supposed to deter people. Because of the opensource nature, *he* is not important for the validity of the idea. 
2. The way it was written makes the reader believe that the scarcity inherent in Bitcoin is due to hoarding. This may be involved with price swings but does nothing to explain to the reader the true scarcity of Bitcoin.

Is it possible that MtGOX are being intentionally attacked (DDOS, etc.) to incite panic selling?  
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:00:54
Too many factors to know anything for certain. 
My guess: yes. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:56:02
Makes sense because I would 'lock that up' tight.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:45:58
No, sorry just noting that I was "aware" of it prior to that moment.  I assume most people didn't buy in when they first learned about Bitcoin - but wish they perhaps did sooner.  I am in the boat/camp.
@_date: 2013-02-24 23:28:56
Lol.  'Received' is spelled incorrectly in the picture.
Cool feature none-the-less.

It's not linear.

This is a parabola.

Depending on your method of putting them in and where the Bitcoin are currently stored you should be able to easily "cash them out".
You can sell them on the MtGox exchange.
You could transfer them to a linked Coinbase account and sell through them.
Just a few options.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:39:53
$5 in the summer of 2012.  Could have bought in sooner though. :(

Could you elaborate?

Well Bitcoin is setup to handle 0.00000001 BTC values (also called a Satoshi). Apparently it can be expanded if needed to a smaller granularity. 
People have considered alternative denominations such as 0.001 being an "mBTC" among others. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:07:06
Agreed.  One of the next hurdles is going to be transitioning people to look at mBTC as a legitimate denomination.  Currently this is not the case.  Average people see the price of a bitcoin and believe it is too high.  Fewer users will equal slower merchant adoption.
One of the ways to overcome this is to have merchants accept Bitcoin (even small merchants to start).  By doing so they will have USD price listed next to the much smaller Bitcoin price which shows average people the value of a mBTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:09
To be fair, people keep using the service.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:30:17
I had this issue happen. 
I submitted a ticket and they pushed the transaction through at the price of original purchase (current price had risen almost 15% since the original purchase).  Additionally they white-listed my account to prevent this from happening again.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:11:14
Any speculation on what could have pushed this up so quickly?  Another Cyprus?
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:46:01
Coinbase whitelisted my account and pushed the transaction through (at the initial purchase price which was lower than the current price) after I contacted their support team.
Based on my understanding now, Coinbase doesn't sell you a certain number of bitcoin.  When your money arrives, the amount of bitcoin is determined by *that* price.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:20:53
The governments would have to agree on a standard to compete with Bitcoin internationally. I doubt they would afford users anonymity in their cryptofiat because of this, taxes, and illicit uses. 
The price of Bitcoin if it becomes the currency of the future, would be a lot higher than what it is today.
The banks, blinded by profit and guarded by government, would not agree to competitive transaction rates with Bitcoin. 
Edit: The only advantage for users of a new cryptofiat is that they could be grandfathered in and less likely to switch. But the advantages of Bitcoin are based on limited government involvement which the government can not imitate. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:09:32
Just imagine your children ONLY knowing Bitcoin.  "What is a dollar?"
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:29:27
There is only one *modern day* currency: Ƀ.

Based on that graph, I'd say 1975 is reasonable. The 2011 fiasco is merely a blip and clearly a *formality*. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:22:13
At least he admits that he doesn't fully understand it, *"I admit, I do not fully understand what is going on with [Bitcoin]."*
Everyone should have reservations about Bitcoin to some degree.  The tangibility of the medium of exchange part is a valid concern that millions of people will have to overcome.  It's a necessary hurdle for Bitcoin to be accepted just like credit was forty years ago.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:32:46
I happen to like Coinbase because of their [emphasis]( on [security](  I do keep some coins in an 'online' wallet with them.
So far my only criticism is the issue or buying bitcoin.  It isn't even worth the effort to purchase coins from them when there is a delay 19/24 hours every day.
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:00:18
Do they say what the benefit of becoming/running a server is?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:37:33
Comparing Bitcoin to the Tulip collapse is a "fair point to leave it on"? 
Their skepticism is warranted, but their ignorance is laughable. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:46:09
From what I understand, Coinbase relies primarily on Mt. Gox for price information.  Seeing that Mt Gox is not trading, their price (and Coinbase's) is artificially high.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:59:29
I think they are still working on it.  None of the other numbers are updating either: volume, trade time.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:27:22
What if those people are using Reddit to manipulate opinion!?

/Close another useless Coinbase complaint.
If it's new I wouldn't mind, but it's the exact same issue.
The first time I contacted them about this same issue Coinbase white-listed my account AND pushed the "high risk" transaction through at the initial price.
It's a **new** service in a **growing** infrastructure for a **new** payment system with a **new** medium of exchange. Caution is as important as patience.

As far as I have ascertained, the green line represents the volume of bids (potential purchases) at its corresponding price.  The red line represents the volume of asks (potential sells) at its corresponding price.  
If you see a steep line ("a wall"), particularly for the red line, it means there are a lot of people sitting at one price (usually near whole numbers [multiples of 5]).
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:54:26
I interpret that to mean people are "making a shit ton of USD". Well if you align with group 1 in the op, wouldn't at some point (hypo-theoretically) USD lose a lot of its spending power aka value?
