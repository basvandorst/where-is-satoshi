bitcoin anonymity could be opt in. so that you could expect people that want their privacy to opt in an use a more anonymous version of btc (sidechain) while if a government decided to do that you would be able to see that they are trying to hide where public money is going and keep them accountable for that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:55:54
You will be able to see they are using the sidechain and at least be aware of the fact that they are going out of their way to not be transparent. You could eventually make a law that demands the goverment to only use public payments for public money

not all atms ask to verify your identity. not sure about this one in particular. but i know many in edmonton don't

would have to be done from the mycelium private key. you would have to import that into a bitcoin cash wallet.

Cavirtex charges 0.8% for transactions and Quadriga charges 0.5% and has free withdrawals. If you decided to transfer your money to quadriga using bitcoins you would pay 1.3% instead of 4%.

ah ok, makes sense, happens when you put a barrier to exit.
in a lesser way same thing that happened to gox with the price

Honestly I found their service was great, whenever i called during business hours i got someone on the phone immediately. 
When I emailed about a transfer not going through because it went higher than my limit they answered their email after hours and raised my limit.
We were emailing back and forth until 9 pm pt (they are based out of Vancouver)

People should definitely think for themselves. but he does tell people to consider his opinion just as his opinion and not to consider him an authority.

i think you have a misconception about lightning. you don't have to have a channel open with every person you want to transact with. Your transaction can get to that person going through other channels you have.
So if for example you and the person you want to donate a dollar to both have a channel with a company, you can pay the person through that without having to open another channel

i feel like eric schmidt is challenging me to a duel for my privacy with that line.
@_date: 2017-01-12 08:48:59
anybody know how many times exactly? and did they unban it every time? or was it just fake news most of the times?
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:06:15
ahah he taught you right!
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:13:24
ya, i'm not too worried. it's just funny price seems to drop right after i buy. everytime
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:16:19
i think it just does the conversion from american

Clicking on your name in the top left---&gt;Account history---&gt;Trades  
will show you how much you paid in transaction fees in all your trades. 
the spread is not the best, but i have been overall fairly satisfied with their service, been using them since 2015
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:02:53
it happened today, he doesn't know yet.
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:00:06
i just googled "btc to cad" and that result comes up
@_date: 2016-11-14 09:02:04
any outcome you lose 0.25, and you make 0.025*1.425=0.035625	
so you bet 0.05 total and leave with 0.035625
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:41:15
ya, i'm hoping the chinese price stays up and all the rest catches up to it

Please do not send bitcoin to people you have never met in person.   
It is a common scam to ask for bitcoin for something/ come to your country, but you will just end up losing the money.   
Do not send the bitcoin if you have not met this person face to face.

came here to ask for this too.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:15:48
I guess burn might be the word.
what i mean is making those coins unusable. Unless the owner transfers them to a new address, before the protocol no longer recognizes the bitcoin sitting in the old addresses

where in Canada do you live?

a halving of the supply does not mean a doubling in price, there are a lot more variables than that
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:12:54
today would be more like bitcoins conception (or conceptualization)
@_date: 2017-05-02 08:07:59
that's what i thought too, just saw someone saying the decision was on the 15th and wanted to be sure
@_date: 2017-05-02 08:45:58
not saying it applies to this particular case, but that is also the definition of practice 
@_date: 2016-05-26 08:23:13
why is that? just wondering. I've been very satisfied so far. been with them for probably what is a couple years now
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:43:10
what if B receives the bitcoin when it is worth $400 and sells it right away for $400 ? does he have to pay capital gains?
what if B doesn't know how much A bought the bitcoin for? does he have to find out to pay capital gains?

@_date: 2017-05-05 04:48:07
ahah i was about to make this, then i checked "new", just to see if it had been created. I was not disappointed 
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:45:39
just wondering why the comments are disabled on youtube. I sometimes wonder what people have to say about the talk/bitcoin.
just to get the general sentiment.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:53:30
what is the 94.8% number? where did you get if from and what does it represent exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:54:13
The only difference might be the change of the SEC board. The nominee has argued for scaling back financial regulations to encourage more companies to go public 
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:03:02
They also have 1% or 1.5% funding fees from cad
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:41:25
is this good or bad?
