Don't go to etoro. They don't sell bitcoin. Try:
Buy your bitcoin there. Send them to your wallet. Good place to find a wallet is Bitcoin.org
If you buy a lot, make sure to buy a "Ledger Nano S" which is a physical, hardware wallet.
All of these are safe. Good luck

You didn't go to Bitcoin.org to see for yourself didn't you? Because it's listed right there.
Do your own research before asking

There is no spirit of cryptocurrency as a 'code of conduct'. There is only code and how society responds to that code.
As long as the code is sound, all the pieces will fall into place. This is one of those pieces and how the exchange is dealing with it is completely fine.

The owner of the key controls the money. This is the exchange. So the money is of the exchange

Blockchain is in fact a big complex interconnected computer network. So physically it exists?
