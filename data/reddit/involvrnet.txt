proud of you for making history in the best of ways. chin up, shoulders down, shoulders back! :D

Yeah, it's 12 words on the low end. Pretty easy to memorize, just takes a little bit of time. I consider the task easier than memorizing the lyrics to a song.

It's 12 to 24 words, some wallets allow you to choose 12, 18, or 24. 12 is the low end

awesome feedback, thank you. Regarding keeping your bitcoins in your brain, I was referring to the way you could memorize 12-24 words and achieve the feat that way. Is that a mistaken understanding?

Gox was like a bank that held people's money in wallets that they controlled on their systems and had full access to all the passwords, mycelium and breadwallet are like wallets you hold and control in your own pocket. you shouldn't trust someone else to hold your money for any considerable duration of time. highly recommend the [trezor hardware wallet]( for its ease of use, coolness factor, and renowned level of security.

From one ***gentleman*** to another - thank you for writing this for everyone. If you happen to fix the only misspelling in this awesome tirade you went on (which happens to be the very last word you wrote), you'd be that much more of a bitcoin ***gentleman***.

Georgia the country or the state?
@_date: 2015-11-27 21:48:46
ruled by math vs. ruled by people is my go-to viewpoint
