i think you wont get around adding shapeshift trades manually. but cointracking has import APIs for all the major and minor exchanges/wallets.

That's a great incentive!

i wish for bitcoin to rise but it scares me how powerful certain people become when bitcoin goes to 100.000
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:40:25
Somebody program a smart contract where the actual transaction only happens after 1.5 million USD is reached within a certain timeframe. Otherwise it will just return to sender. Would be kind of ironic though if the fundraiser for the BTC clock is implemented in Ethereum. ;)

I don't get it with this opening and closing of a channel. Is an open channel some kind of security risk? What if I never close my channel? Is there some kind of not-too-technical explanation of how to actually use LN anywhere?

"The lawsuit was raised by Mr. Wang, who lost RMB 400,000 trading bitcoin." 
Wow, how bad can you trade.. almost earns my respect. Just HODL Mr Wang!

hence if i want to make money i should cause some serious blood shed..
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:50:24
Thanks, that helped!
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:57:48
Maybe somebody poked bitcoin again?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:24:14
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that crypto ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I buy back quick to retrieve it
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:30:04
so does this mean he's using bitcoin now?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:33:38
USA bans Bitcoin everyone!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:24:08
Maybe they think you can actually only buy something with it where people accept bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:34:11
No, you just have to hodl, that's all.

lightcoin is the silver to bitcoin gold, always good idea to diversify!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:01:23
This is good for bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:22:25
You know how you felt towards all your friends that didn't buy Bitcoin. The ones that envied you and you just felt pity for them.. It's going to be the exact opposite.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:03:41
Best question I constantly get is: "But can you really sell your bitcoins and get money for it?"
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:36:46
I'm actually lying to myself on how much I put into bitcoin already.

Is there any good writeup on how these coins got stolen in the first place?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:41:00
it actually feels good, been missing the drops.

You get into HODLers heaven!
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:36:31
Actually he is still fighting for it and it is pretty sure he and the rest of the creditors get their money that it was worth back then in fiat back. They are currently fighting to get back a fraction of their BTC instead since otherwise the rest of the money would go to.. guess who.. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:35:26
It's only possible if a majority of the miners would run that specific version of the Bitcoin client.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:18:50
The thing is it always feels like "oh shit, this time it's different". The situation needs to be so fearful that even more than just the weak hands start to panic. The price won't drop significantly if it's too obvious for most that it's not really a crisis.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:43:38
And you felt like you made it back then, right?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:20:02
Just relax and hold. You're doing best if you don't read anything related to bitcoin in the next few months.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:21:33
my hunch is it wont be profitable for you, if you wanna do something for the btc community set up a full node instead!
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:23:50
I'm in it for 4 years now and it was never worth it to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:57:52
There's no need to downplay the high transaction fees. The problem does exist but I defnitely opt for a well thought out solution than some quick hack like raising the block size.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:30:36
Seriously, who would pay something like a sub with BTC now? It takes about half an hour to validate the payment and costs like 2$ fee. BTC is good for a store of value and for transactions where the fee is neglectable.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:50:17
Lol, not even bothering to actually spell out "Please". Way to go.

I'm pretty sure it means "Fuck yeah!"
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:47:59
As an individual you can't do much about it. The wallets and exchanges have to support it.

First of all it wont happen tomorrow. The way bitcoin improvements are being agreed on is via BIPs: 
 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:43:42
I remember 2015 when it started rising from 400 to 600 and i felt it's going up again. I was on vacation that it would first reach 1000 and then in the next "bubble" 8000 would be the next stop. It sounded crazy back then and also I myself only really believed it in a more theoretical way (like I now believe it's going to 60.000). But here we are and only one of the people i was talking to managed to buy BTC until now. 
PS: Sorry I'm sometimes mixing up EUR and USD valuation.. don't be too harsh on me. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:54:16
Why does the BCH community seem to be so happy about this? I don't think that a crashing BTC price would neccessarily mean pumping BCH. I guess it would rather affect the cryptomarket as a whole and people would pull their money out completely ...for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:04:31
Hehe, yeah I remember the days when I still thought I would "cash out" at some point.

It's only cool if that thread is made out of gold.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:32:43
Are you sure about that. To me it sounds like they are also talking about capital gains tax:
- "Bei dem Umtausch von konventionellen Währungen in Bitcoin und umgekehrt handelt es sich um eine steuerbare sonstige Leistung, die im Rahmen einer richtlinienkonformen Gesetzesauslegung nach § 4 Nr. 8 Buchst. b UStG umsatzsteuerfrei ist."
- "Die Verwendung von Bitcoin wird der Verwendung von konventionellen Zahlungsmitteln gleichgesetzt, soweit sie keinem anderen Zweck als dem eines reinen Zahlungsmittels dienen. Die Hingabe von Bitcoin zur bloßen Entgeltentrichtung ist somit nicht steuerbar."
"nicht steuerbar" is to be read in regards of capital gains tax i think.

Actually it might even be the other way around. See how Germany's huge reparation costs led to a weak economy and therefore unstable democracy. That made it much easier for "Make Germany Great Again" yelling Nazis.

So let's say the internet on each continent still works but the connection between them is cut off.. I guess that would lead to multiple chains who each claim to be the right ones. When the connection is back to normal the longest chain would "win" and all the transactions that happened on the other continents would be reversed. Right?
