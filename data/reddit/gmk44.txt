Indeed and for sure they won't be telling us plebs until they have enough to control the market and by extention us.

We are constantly being corrected. I don't think we will have a major dip but I know just as much as you do.

Why do you NEED kraken, there are plenty of other exchanges that are way smoother and don't give a 520 error every click. Until their trading platform has not had a complete make over I won't be dipping my toes in the kraken anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:28:45
Haha, or good way if one has humor. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:25
We'll be back up there soon enough.

How could you even take this story serious with all those emojis. Is he/she even old enough to have a job? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:02:48
I'm seriously wondering the same thing. On the one hand I think we're going to have a massive dip, on the other hand I'm scared of losing out (just like everyone else probably). I think waiting till after the 10th is the safest option to see what is gonna happen for now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:57:00
Aha! I knew he would come in handy one day, I know those emails in the past were true. What is his BTC address so I can send him all my coins and he can wire me the money? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:36:06
Fair enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:53:28
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:55:35
Your prediction is as good as mine.
HODL! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:19:27
Yea for sure got my ticket to the moon already, but if they are going to short one needs to be prepared as well. Money to be made with the big fish. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:38:03
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:56:35
The opposite reason for why it is not skyrocketing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:48:23
I'm surprised people still use kraken. I just got into bitcoin trading about a week ago and after spending about 6 hours on kraken I decided to empty my account and move on to a different exchange as kraken seemed broken and not maintained properly. It took me about 3 hrs to move my funds, which could of been done in 10 mins if I didn't get an error at every page refresh. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:50:17


Haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:43:05
Good read and I agree. Very interesting times. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:17:44
Uhm.. No?
Just handle it smart, there is enough money to be made. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:22:38
I didn't read a your post fully but just wanted to mention; don't worry about the ledger, they can and (I read on here somewhere) that they are busy with their own software.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:19
Nicehash has their own wallets

@_date: 2017-12-14 12:24:13
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:28:22
Ah makes sense. Well at least it gives us some more time to invest before the plebs start to understand bitcoin and join our ship. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:50:20
I would say it's their own safety net indeed. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 11:42:24
Underrated comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:48:57
Problems are there to be solved. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:23:12
Well there you go. Thank you for this simple answer.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:49:31
Creditcard is instant but you pay 3.99% fees if I'm correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:59:13
But why would you have that knowledge over everyone else. The thing is nobody knows what is going to happen in the future. Do what you feel is right for yourself. If you can not lose the money, cash out. If you have followed one of the main rules: only invest what you can afford to lose, then I would HODL. But then again, I know just as much as the person that says its going to crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:13:44
One should always excel. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:08:50
Yep, after the 10k mark it got a lot of media attention. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:10:39
This is just the begin, improvement will and are coming. We face problems, we fix problems.

@_date: 2017-12-08 22:13:24
Very good you are interested. Luckily we the Internet in full of information about blockchain and bit- and altcoins. [Watch videos]( [Do research]( [explore]( 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:05:17
I use bittrex for alts and gdax for btc in Europe, but it doesn't really matter what you use, can always transfer btc to other exchanges/wallets/whatever. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:15:39
Maybe they are trying to get more customers onto GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:46
Haha, exactly this. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:35:04
I think said it correctly.
"HODL never SODL"
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:41:13
Same here, set about 5 alarms for when the price drops. We need a dip! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:26:35
Because they are different markets

Overpopulation.

We've been corrected twice in the last 7 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:45:45
Once you click withdraw to BTC address on gdax, you should see your fees on the right. And it should say free. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:49:24
Should be called; Use Coinbase for specific reasons, kids.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:36:23
Eur/usd into coinbase -&gt; eur/usd into gdax -&gt; get your bitcoins via limit order.
If you don't understand what I'm saying search on youtube 'gdax bitcoins without fees' or something of the sort.

The Trevor nano S is good enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:32
Plus the big fish are waking up. Can go either way but I do think this is, indeed, an unusual situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:59
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:51:18
Welp... Learn from this experience! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:32:27
Easy to say in hindsight. If BTC collapsed you'd be on here bragging about the earnings you made with your investment.
It's just the way things go, this is all unpredictable, don't  beat yourself up about it.

Just don't use electricity anymore, we need to head for the moon! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:13:03
Due to the traffic on the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:56:18
Ah I see! Smart move indeed, didn't think of it. Still i find kraken too risky to do that at the moment, until they prove to be a bit more robust. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:03:33
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:46:44
Is this what I've become?

This is normal, welcome to the rough seas.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:31
I think at this point everyone probably wishes they had invested more than they have. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:46:34
As maximum as we give it value. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:20:28
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:50
It's a little scary indeed. I keep expecting a huge fallback and I wish it would come so I can buy back.. But will it? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:31:13
Yea... Or not. That's the whole thing, we don't know. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:01:45
Buckle up and HODL on

Interesting, subscribed.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:57:31
Ah fair enough, yea that's not really easy to do with Delta indeed.
Basically what I do is what I use for hodl I put in Delta and what I use for trading I don't even record (sometimes use an excel) cause as you say, too many trades will be done.
