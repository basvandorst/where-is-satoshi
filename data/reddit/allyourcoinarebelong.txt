 Step 1. Print tether out of thin air.  
Step 2. Send to bitfinex who exchanges for real USD.  
Step 3. Bitfinex sends real USD to Tethers banking partner in Peurto rico.   
Step 4. Tell everyone we have the USD look its right here.  
Step 5.  Profit.

People should stop using the term pump and dump for bitcoin. Illiquid altcoins have pump and dumps but bitcoin is too large and too distributed.
These large moves are predominantly order book related liquidations and stop losses on BitMEX and bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:12:18
I finally  dumped my airdropped BCH today thanks to the endless deceit coming out of Roger Co.  
Not worth holding something that doesn't align with my personal values.  
I wasnt bothered holding it until recently but they just kept pushing!

Sure ya do. Shall I just send the ETH now?
@_date: 2018-05-27 08:17:34
It shows how little faith they have in Bch to stand on its own. 
They have to resort deception like this and the  twitter handle.
Newcomers won’t take kindly to being deceived and will probably leave crypto altogether.

Yes it is. But google lightening network. It is a second layer that settles transactions off chain.

The funding is between longs and shorts.  So peer to peer. 
Bitmex doesn’t take any of the funding.
They clearly state this and it is no secret.

Futures let you use leverage to increase gains/losses.

I remember a story about someone sending a bitcoin transaction through some uhf radios. 
So it is possible. 
I’ll try to find the link.
Edit- 
Prob shouldn’t link to that site but anyway there it is.
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:40:38
After you buy a bitcoin if price drops are you going to get back on reddit and ask if you should sell?
If your convictions were  strong enough you wouldn’t be asking in the first place..
For that reason I say NO you shouldn’t buy..
But then again It also depends on what $6400 means to you.
If you have 2 billion dollars in the bank I’d say sure go for it. What’s it matter if it goes to $3000.
Get it?

Its a shame about those units across the street though.

This is why the US will eventually try to ban bitcoin.
 They want the option to bring in capital controls at no notice.  But once everyone has the option of leaving the country with an encrypted wallet file hidden in a usb then its bad luck uncle sam.

Id like to get payed from my employer by the second.  
While im at work I get streamed my income through a lightning remittance network.  Then my wallet automatically distributes my pay to other wallets and earns interest as I finance Peer to peer loans.

Propy is another token in this space. They have a website with properties available for purchase in crypto and eventually hope to move title deeds onto a blockchain.

You mention money so I assume you mean Fiat.
Binance is crypto only so you’ll need to exchange your fiat first.
So this really depends what country you are from.

This is how I know it’s almost time to buy.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:14:15
Are you sure the wait wasn’t for the exchange to actually send the btc?   
The problem was prob the exchange not bitcoin.

Crypto is legal in Australia yes. 
I’m not familiar with Indonesia’s laws. Can you still own the crypto you already have? Or are you supposed to sell it somehow.

It means someone has put up a large limit order..
It doesn’t mean much as they can pull the order instantly..
The reason it is the same amount on both is because they have just placed 2x orders.

Why would companies have setup a webpage to sell their products in the early 90’s..
They already had expensive shops setup..

Entirely up to you. You would be the one taking risks by breaking local laws.

I agree, he was talking about the alternate monetary system as you put it,  and OP is right, current payment methods are adequate for most people today. (except the 2 billion unbanked people or anyone in Venezuela, or the 10 countries in this list - [
