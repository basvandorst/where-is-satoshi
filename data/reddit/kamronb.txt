This is so sweet man, can you be my uncle? And nothing more important than God, Gold, Silver and Bitcoin in that order.

Stupid prospectors who aren't really appreciative of what bitcoin stands for, they just want a quick money.

I guess they (having a shady history) just went with the most eager or least unwilling person with an established image. Maybe they want to come across as the badasses of the industry. 
And yeah, as far as GF and Iron Bite go - damn, one of them named all seven of his kids off himself, gimme the bite anyday

Foreman had his share of bullshit and his grilles sell like hot cakes. I see this as an interesting move with Tyson already alleging to have been ripped off by Don King and his handlers and whatnot, he has a history of screwy financial arrangements and him taking the plunge into Bitcoins is essentially him kind of underlining his 'doubt' (for want of a better word) in regular money and showing people that he found a better alternative. This better alternative is a lot more 'free' from the bullshit associated with $ so, I guess it should work for him. Plus, isn't he Crypto's biggest endorser yet?

Its amazing, but not Western Union. More pf a click-baiting win but a huge karma-whoring gamble

Brilliant idea... somebody sends me bitcoins, my debit card gets it automatically...
