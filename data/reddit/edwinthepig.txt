I did, and it's on the roadmap, but wanted to make a more recognizable/"traditional" version first people are used to. With an anonymous account, there are privacy advantages, but it's also a lot easier to just forget or misplace that secret string or link that identifies your account whereas people are already used to logins/passwords. I ask for full names, but if someone puts in a fake one it's not like they can't sign up.

For what it's worth, I did sell out of my Bitcoin earlier today in anticipation of a drop over the next week. I believe in Bitcoin long term, but my Bitcoin holdings basically ballooned into like 90% of my overall net worth and I didn't think I'd be able to stomach any significant drop back into the 4-digits and just watch that much money evaporate into thin air.
While I do expect/anticipate a drop, I completely acknowledge that the opposite can happen and it continues skyrocketing from here and there's no drop at all. If that happens, then I fucked up, but I can accept it.

Bitcoin will always be liquid. It's just that the pieces of each Bitcoin being traded and sent around will get smaller and smaller (past the 8 significant digits currently even, if necessary), implying a higher overall Bitcoin value in fiat terms until things normalize. If there was only 1 Bitcoin left in existence today (because all the others were lost, for example), it would still be enough to run global commerce....it would just get dividend into more and more smaller and smaller pieces (10 sig digits, 15 sig digits, 30 sig digits, 50 digits, etc.) until there were enough pieces to go around. As such, I don't think liquidity drying up would be an issue. Bitcoins value in fiat would just keep going up, and the pieces of Bitcoin get smaller and smaller, such that it reaches the point where people are willing to give up small enough pieces to buy the things they want at that time.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:19:17

Considering how most miners exist outside the U.S., how do they plan to enforce this?
I think what makes Bitcoin so unique compared to other assets is that it truly is GLOBAL. The U.S. stunts their own growth in Bitcoin adoption at the detriment to the rest of the world. Bitcoin is bigger than any one country, even the U.S.
It's easy to enforce this stuff so long as it stays within borders. Even if the U.S. is able to whack all the moles within its borders, those mole heads will simply pop up in places they can't whack and shit continues moving forward.

I am an American living in China. I earn an income here and pay local taxes all in Renminbi. However, my retirement/investment portfolio is based in the US. I can't simply just transfer Renminbi from my Chinese bank account to my US brokerage account.
Enter Bitcoin.
I setup an account with a Chinese Bitcoin exchange linked to my Chinese bank account, and one at a US Bitcoin exchange linked to my US bank/brokerage account.
I instantly deposit Renminbi into my Chinese Bitcoin brokerage and buy Bitcoin at market prices, while simultaneously selling off an equal amount of Bitcoin from my US Bitcoin exchange and transferring that US fiat into my brokerage account whereupon I'm able to then invest in stocks, bonds, etc.
Then I transfer the Bitcoin I purchased from the Chinese exchange to my wallet at my US exchange.
Sure there are little exchange fees here and there between both my Chinese and US Bitcoin exchange accounts,...but the net effect is still an incredibly cheap, fast and efficient method for transferring my earned Renminbi to my US accounts as US dollars. The simultaneous action of buying Bitcoin in China while selling Bitcoin in the US also minimizes any effects due to Bitcoin's currently volatile nature.

In a centralized system, account numbers can be controlled such that no two people, past present or future, will ever own the same account number. Assuming private keys are similar to account numbers, how can a system in which the POSSIBILITY of two people randomly generating the same private key, whether past present or future, be considered wholly secure? I understand that the probability is incredibly small of this happening, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around how, if this possibility is &gt;0%, it is still entirely secure? Wouldn't it only have to happen once for the system to fail? And if Bitcoin "is it" going forward XYZ number of years, how can one be so sure it will never occur?

The S&amp;P 500 is just a concept, not something that one can directly invest into. ETFs like SPY are just funds of individual stocks that attempt to replicate the index. I believe this difference is enough because people aren’t “investing” in stocks, just betting on a tracked idea (the index)

Where else can one bet on the stock market over/under week to week? Bitcoin or otherwise? Again, the point is betting directly with others, if you bet right, will earn you a larger return in a shorter timeframe on your “investment” compared to readily available Wall Street instruments.
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:19:21
Maybe you’re right, but I’m still hoping the nuances are different enough. For example, a derivative derives its value from the performance of the underlying. Beyond being above or below a certain value, the value of one’s bet on this site is derived by the amount of action on both sides on a week to week basis, and not necessarily the strict performance of the index. If one bets the Over, for example, whether the index increases +1% or +50% in that week makes no difference, as the value of a bettor’s winnings is pegged to the amount that was bet on the opposite side.
Anyways, are these nuances different enough (at least legally) to what 1broker was doing? I think so. But I’ve been wrong before.

Perhaps - However the goal of simply betting is that you can earn a much greater return on your “investment” by simply betting the over/under on the weekly stock market movement directly with others. Especially if you bet on the minority side, hence garnering better odds, and are right on your bet.

Ah, so you mean the risk doesn't lie in a hacker getting at both seeds, but instead the risk lies with yourself in being able to keep/remember both keys?

True, but the SEC/U.S. isn't the only game in town, and Bitcoin is a global asset. Pretty much any country, not just the U.S., setting up some kind of fund that allows investors to invest in BTC through their legacy market channels would send its price up up up.

How "future proof" are hardware wallets such as the Trezor and Ledger?

It's a good question. To me, the spirit of "being flexible" too often gives way to corruption and irresponsible behavior. For example, is the flexibility the Fed has in controlling the dollar a good thing or bad thing? During the 2008/09 financial crisis, a few old white men were able to get together behind closed doors and drastically increase the money supply thereby stealing purchasing power from the average citizen. Is that flexibility a good thing or bad thing? Perhaps one might argue that during that period of time if the Fed COULDN'T do that it would have resulted in a complete financial collapse, but that conveniently sidesteps the fact that those responsible for the financial crisis (unscrupulous banks) were counting on that flexibility to bail them out for their poor behavior. If they were forced to adhere to an inflexible system, would that have prevented their irresponsible behavior, thereby preventing the need to have bailed them out?
Maybe, maybe not, but nothing like Bitcoin has ever existed before. Maybe it's worth giving the rigid, inflexible system a try. It's different even to when the dollar was on the gold standard as gold can be hidden and re-hypothecated into a de facto fractional reserve system creating more paper gold IOUs than actual gold in existence because the supply of gold is hard to continually audit and easier to hide from view. An institution's supply of Bitcoin can be continually verified very easily to see if they actually have the stores they say they do.
Anyways we can go on and on, but I like these kinds of discussions and wish more people would have them with each other. I think it's important for people to understand exactly what money is, and why certain characteristics of money matter one way or the other. Most people don't, or simply don't care.

Do you think you will be able to do this consistently over longer periods of time?
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:20:25
I'd argue that even the "most stable" of fiat currencies are still destined to decline in value over time, making it less attractive to hold for a central bank than something like Bitcoin. However, even if we did assume that a western currency like the USD is stable, that doesn't mean you can assume it will always remain so. I don't know what a timeline could be, but just because the USD has been relatively stable doesn't mean that it cannot be subject to hyperinflation or some other adverse, or even sudden, currency event in the near/mid/far future, whereas with something like Bitcoin its economic characteristics will always be known and never change.

To be honest, I want to assure users of the site that this won't happen, but I'm not exactly sure what to do that would be satisfactory yet. For example, I'm using an industry-trusted 3rd party wallet operator to store the site's Bitcoins, so security from outside hacks should be a minimal concern, but understand that there will be those who see anything centralized as bad or inferior. I made all betting records for each movie transparent and auditable to try an allay fears that the site is cheating people behind-the-scenes in some fashion, but understand this is not related to Bitcoin/scammy behavior itself. I've thought of perhaps purchasing insurance on the Bitcoins the site holds and making known the policy to make people feel more at ease that if their bitcoins were loss due to some hack, it'd be covered.
Honest question: Is there anything you think I could be doing that WOULD minimize your fears of being scammed again? If I published the site's xpub bitcoin address so anybody could verify the number of bitcoins in reserves at any time, would that help? Or something else?

How accurately you predict determines whether or not you are labeled a "winner" or not. If you are the only winner, then you win all the non-winning bettors' bitcoins.
If there are multiple winners, however, then it matters how much you bet. With multiple winners, each winner wins their pro rata % share of all non-winning bettors' bitcoins.
For example, if there are 3 winners, one wagered 1 BTC, another wagered 2 BTC, and another wagered 5 BTC, then each winner's pro rata share of the non-winners' Bitcoin pool would be 12.5%, 25.0% and 62.5%, respectively.

Agree in principle, but that assumes you're a great trader capable of consistently timing optimal peaks and troughs. My opinion is that most people are NOT able to time markets so consistently and optimally that they're probably better served by just buying/hodling and/or dollar-cost averaging into it over time.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:04:42
I've thought about this as well. My hope is that by the time Bitcoin is mainstream/high enough such that I could retire, there'd be brokerages that let you deposit and purchase shares of stocks/funds that are priced and pay dividends/interest denominated in Bitcoin. Then maybe I'd convert those dividends to fiat (or not) to spend and pay for my retired life,...but at least my HODLings would remain intact and I wouldn't have to take away from my pile.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:00:32
The system basically looks for winners first in the +/- 1% of the actual box office range. If within that range there are no winners, then it looks within +/- 2% range, and so on, until it finds a winner or winners. It will look all the way to +/- 33% of the actual box office range if needed. If in that range there are still no winners, then the round is considered a push, there are no winners and all users receive their bets back.
So, if you're able to predict the box office to within plus or minus 1%, that is the best, but ultimately whether you win is based on your accuracy relative to all other users' bets.

Traditional fiat currencies actually appreciate and depreciate in value as well in forex markets. Those markets are just so big and liquid, however, that the fluctuations are tiny compared to Bitcoin's. Also, you don't "feel" those fluctuations in value in fiat currencies from within your own country. Irrespective of how the dollar strengthens or weakens against the Euro/Yen/CNY etc., that loaf of bread you buy at your local supermarket will probably still cost the same in dollars today that it did last week.
I think that Bitcoin's usefulness as a currency is a function of how big it gets. IF it'll be used as a global currency one day, that pretty much guarantees that it will have to grow big enough in market cap such that all these fluctuations in value against fiat currencies are minuscule, similar to how fiat currencies' fluctuations in value currently are to each other.

I mean from a technology perspective, not from a global apocalypse back-to-basics perspective. Those are two different things in my mind. I only mean that even if all private keys were lost such that there was only 1 BTC left, technically, that 1 BTC could still be split up into enough pieces (after adding decimal places in the protocol which is trivial) that there'd be enough "pieces" of BTC to satisfy global economic demand to trade around those pieces.

Ever been to China? Wechat Pay and Alipay are basically how everybody there not only pay each other, but pay virtually every business. Scan a QR Code and a second later you've paid back your friend for lunch, bought groceries, settled a restaurant bill or whatever. Compared to China, the US is far behind in even its own domestic financial infrastructure. I consider what exists now in China to be the future of payments.
But even China's financial infrastructure/payments system is only that awesome within its borders. Should the US one day (via Square? Venmo? etc.) achieve similar ability to pay via phones, it's likely to only exist with US borders as well. If someone in the US wants to send some USD to a buddy in China via Wechat, he's shit out of luck.
Enter Bitcoin. Imagine the payments system that exists right now within China, but global. With Bitcoin as a behind-the-scenes backbone, a company can easily create essentially a "global Wechat Pay." Doesn't matter what fiat currency you want to work with. Hold your balance in USD, scan your Chinese friend's QR Code and Bitcoin can do its thing behind-the-scenes so that your friend receives CNY equivalent.
So if Wechat Pay within China is the future of how normal people spend money in their daily purchases of goods and services, then Bitcoin will allow for a single, global Wechat Pay where anybody can purchase daily goods and services from each other, irrespective of nationality, borders or fiat currency.

You might be right. Perhaps Bitcoin never does replace banks....but it still has the potential to if used correctly. In which case, I still think comparing Bitcoin's "waste" to the "waste" of the current banking system is appropriate. Nobody ever pointed to all the waste of the legacy banking system and said "Hey, that's too much!" 
Along comes Bitcoin, with the POTENTIAL to replace them (even if it doesn't) and now people are pointing to Bitcoin and complaining about its waste, when in my opinion, they should be looking to Bitcoin as a greener alternative to the legacy banking system.
You're right though,...maybe it never does. My point is, it could, and it'd be a greener alternative, and if it never does and only serves as an add-on to the legacy banking system instead of AT LEAST replacing a significant part of it, THAT's the true waste in my opinion.

Who cares that the US dollar has lost like 95% of its purchasing power since inception, $1 = $1 !
Seriously, I'm a big Bitcoin hodler and supporter (check my comments history), but this 1 BTC = 1 BTC argument makes no sense to me. Measuring it against fiat is currently the only way we can measure Bitcoin's purchasing power, which is what matters most. 1 BTC = 1 BTC, but if more and more people require more and more Bitcoin over time in exchange for fewer and fewer goods, what does the improving technology matter if nobody cares?
I do think that purchasing power/value will correlate with the price though, which is why I still love seeing all these techno-goodies getting added. But if they ever become uncorrelated, then I think you still have to go with whatever medium of exchange people will let you buy bread for.

Wrong. In terms of pure efficiency, a centralized database/server is way, way, way more efficient than any decentralized blockchain solution. All you have to do is look at Visa's throughput vs. Bitcoin's today. The point of blockchain is its decentralized nature with no need to trust any 3rd party. A company making a private blockchain for its own use is akin to how company's setup intranets in the 90s. How did that turn out? Basically, the internet itself is what everybody uses today.
So let me TL;DR this for you:
You haven't a fucking clue what you're talking about.

How much electricity is wasted powering the buildings and servers of banks all over the world? Keeping their branches open? What about the gasoline that's used to shuttle crates of cash around? What about the jet fuel for private jets banker execs like to hop on to play golf in another country because they feel like it? There is so much wasted resources in the current system already,...I doubt the electricity "wasted" on securing bitcoin matches the legacy system's waste.

I’m with you. Petty or not, I smile when I see people who’ve wronged me suffer. Few years ago I had a business partner I would talk about Bitcoin to. I’d call it the future of finance, he’d roll his eyes and call it Shitcoin, scam, etc. I even paid him back $1,000 I owed him with six bitcoins, and he immediately sold it saying the only thing he trusts is USD. Anyways, he ended up cheating me out of $10k after he saw a way to make a few extra bucks for himself. Since then my bitcoin stash has 28x and I smile a lot. Fuck him. I sleep juuust fine.

I think there may be some of what you say happening. However, keep in mind that the rate of Bitcoin supply increase is transparent and known to all. In THEORY (who knows what is actually happening in the real word), since everybody knows that $14.4 million needs to be added each day to maintain price, that requirement should already be priced into any given current Bitcoin price since that is known and "should be" accounted for.

For starters, banks:
1) Accept deposits - Bitcoin also does this.
2) Make loans - Not directly by itself, but nothing is stopping people/institutions from making Bitcoin denominated loans, and it cuts away the mess of a fractional reserve system. And who knows what will happen in the future with a smart contract layer on top.
3) Act as Payment Agents - Bitcoin replaces the banking function of acting as intermediaries both within and between nations.
Actually, I'm honestly curious as to what you think Bitcoin is if you can't see how it has the potential to at least partially replace legacy banking services.

One of the ideas I had with the site was that, if all the betting took place on the weekend, then seeing how the bets were placed (e.g. 80% on over, 20% on under), then it might be able to be a predictive data point for how the overall market may trend over that week. Thought that'd be cool

No problems myself transferring back and forth between my USAA bank accounts and Coinbase. USAA even lets you link to your Coinbase wallets so that your Bitcoin balance, shown both in Bitcoin and USD, shows up on your USAA online banking dashboard.
This friendly relationship between USAA and Coinbase probably has something to do with USAA's investmetn in Coinbase last year ;)
Can't speak to any experience transferring between USAA and any other Bitcoin exchanges, however, but since GDAX is Coinbase, I would assume no problems between GDAX and USAA as well.

@_date: 2018-07-20 02:30:57
My opinion only: Yep, you write off your property taxes, interest, etc. The problem is, so does everybody else who owns property. Every time someone is considering how much real estate they can afford, they are factoring in how much they "get back" from writing off all those things. Ultimately, what this does is inflate the amount they're willing to borrow/pay to buy a home. Meaning that if people WEREN'T able to write those things off, the average prices of real estate right now would be significantly lower. So yes, you write those things off, but so does everybody else, so you probably paid more for whatever property you own than you would have otherwise if people couldn't write those things off.

You'd have to look into the legalities of this, but how about a US-based sportsbook? Online sports betting is a multi-billion dollar market, but largely illegal in the US because online gambling of US dollars is illegal. But if the sportsbook was BTC-based only? It could be exactly like every other sportsbook, in which you can bet on basketball/football/baseball games, etc., with the same Vegas odds, except all bets and payouts are conducted in Bitcoin. How would the US powers-that-be respond to this? I don't know, but I'd love to find out.

The internet excels in the blackmarkets and has no legal connection to the real world.

I agree with you, but because most people are dumb and they can't change their way of thinking just yet, this is why Bitcoin is still a steal at today's prices. When people start waking up to reality, it'll be too late, so enjoy it and stack your sats while you can.

I liked your write up and agree with almost everything. Regarding this, however, I would disagree:
\&gt; The lower it goes, the more powerful this idea becomes. That is to say it is becoming increasingly easy for demand to match the supply on the market in terms of fiat currency. 
When I read this, to me it seems like you think you have to buy whole bitcoins, and that as the price lowers it gets easier for people to buy. I would argue that it doesn't matter, and that the only thing that matters is how much fiat wants to get into Bitcoin irrespective of price. People can buy $10 worth of Bitcoin whether Bitcoin is worth $3,000 or $3 million. You just buy your fractions of a Bitcoin at an implied price per Bitcoin. Buying $10 worth of Bitcoin at an implied price of $3 million still props up the "last trade" Bitcoin price.
