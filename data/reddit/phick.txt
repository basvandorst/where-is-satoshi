Those aren't communist or socialist ideologies despite what the right tells you. Those are basic human rights imo. I'm a libertarian who people call a socialist cause I want universal healthcare smh.

I was listening to a podcast earlier today about this very thing.  The relevant part is between 46-50 minutes.

Haha and buying BTC with your own money isn't gambling too? Nothing wrong with gambling. If you're going to do it better to do it responsibly.

There are plenty of responsible ways of using leverage. Let's say you don't trust the exchanges to not steal all your BTC. You can keep 90% in cold storage and put 10% on exchange and using 10x leverage you can trade with your whole stack while decreasing counter party risk.
Another example, let's say you think the price is going to go down but you don't want to sell everything because it will then be a taxable event. You can hedge using a portion of your stack on leverage and be delta neutral (not have a positive or negative position) without having to sell.

Let's say I have $1k and want to make a 10x leveraged trade. I put up my $1k and borrow $9k from the exchange. I now have $10k worth of BTC. If that becomes $11k and I close the trade then the exchange gets their $9k back and I now have $2k. If the $10k worth of BTC becomes $9k then they auto close my position and automatically get their $9k back and I lose my whole $1k. This is what it means when people say they were liquidated. The exchange closes the trade when you run out of margin.

Well this is where proper risk management comes into play. You should never use leverage without stops set imo. With stops your down side is always predefined. Crypto cred has a great video on risk management here.

It's the 10 year anniversary of the genesis block. Some guy is trying to make it an annual thing.
