That was to protect his anonymity!!
...while using his real name. And telling the first reporter who asked.

Haha true, I was using the word "evidence" very liberally here.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:11:17


Neither would most people who didn't start Bitcoin.

Holy fucking hypocrisy

This is not a minor detail when your strongest evidence is that he supposedly said it was him.

1) Who the hell hasn't heard of Moore's law?
2) "Disk space" is absolutely a concern when you're talking about every node in the network storing the entire transaction history of the currency.

such insider trading. many arbitrage. wow.

A blockchain.info wallet gives you control of your own private keys, which coinbase does not. I think that is what OP is getting at.

Textbook insider trading lunch-arbitrage. Admit to one reporter that you're Satoshi, then admit to another reporter that you're not, exploiting the lunch-loop that was created in the process. Classic Satoshi.

What is different about coinbase?
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:01:41


Yes. Which is why this whole story is bullshit. He apparently hid it from his family for years but "tacitly admitted" that he was the creator of Bitcoin to the first reporter who asked.

Except for one *huge* difference. That "central banking system" still won't be a central *authority*. It will be entirely opt-in and won't have the ability to print money.

Are you seriously suggesting that *this screencap* is what ruined mtgox's reputation?
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:33:22
Wow I really want to make pickled jalapenos now

md5 is insecure because there are many known collisions. Rainbow tables are used to exploit password databases which use hashing algorithms, they don't cause hash algorithms themselves to be insecure.
