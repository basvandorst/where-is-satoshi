We need to find what all these people have in common so we can see where the malware is coming from, I am assuming it is uninstalling itself once stealing the wallet file and leaving no trace so we can presume it is distributing itself from a static source such as a flash exploit on youtube rather than spreading through email.

I have never had that much cash in my life but I went from 1 bank to another and they were only 50 metres apart, they put it in a giant envelop and then in a grocery bag, felt weird walking out of the bank TIMYOYO mode but I just acted casual and told myself it was groceries held it infront of me and looked every1 in the eye, the adrenalin rush was a bit delayed I didnt get it til I left the 2nd bank. They needed my drivers license to make the cash deposit.

I wanted to use coinjar but they took too long so I used bitxoin as you get the price from when you put your order through whereas with coinjar you need to deposit in to their account then you need put in a buy order and that could take days, plus they have a daily limit, bitxoin doesnt have a limit.

When people think of bitcoin they think of silkroad and the deep web and thats how I was introduced to it.
Until major sites like Amazon or Ebay start accepting it people wont of heard about bitcoin.
Non tech people have no heard of bitcoin because they really have no use for it right now.

There needs to be changes to the apps people use for bitcoin, everything needs to be more streamlined and accessible preferebly in one app.
I dont understand what you mean by the wallet address being an issue, I dont know any computer that doesnt have copy and paste.

I worry about this too and the only thing I can think of against it is that some would of cashed out by now if not they would wait for it to go mainstream but then if it is mainstream there is no reason to cash out as you could just spend it anyway and it would not make sense turning it from an inflationary currency into a deflationary currency.

I restored but you cant create anymore receive addresses than the 5 you get at the beginning?
Do you know if restoring from the seed relies on data on their server? For example if they got hacked and had everything wiped then got back up online could you still restore from your seed?

well this is interesting, do a rootkit scan 
But I have a feeling that will come back clean also.
Maybe this trojan just grabs the wallet file then uninstalls itself to lower risk of future detection.
I know old trojans such as subseven had an uninstall feature so I am sure it would be a key feature now days, it would be a good tactic.

when I want to buy something that I can pay for with bitcoin I will, but while thats not the case and the price keeps going up its an investment. 
We are in early adopter phase, there is barely any infrastructure to support it as a currency and its growing so fast, eventually when its close to market saturation it will be more a currency than an investment.

I have imported it in to blockchain with a blank password, when I tried entering a password it said unexpected end of file.
It says 0.0 bitcoins which cant be right because I was mining I should have atleast a fraction.

@_date: 2013-12-05 14:13:38
Incase that comes back clean can you confirm:
* Was your wallet file encrypted?
* Was it sent over the internet or through wifi?
* Was any removable media containing your wallet file plugged in to another computer?
* Could your computer of been physically accessed by someone who stole the wallet file?
* Was the wallet file created on an android phone (RNG exploit??)
Try to find out what you have in common with the other person who had the same thief.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:56:50
I dont think difficulty is the problem, it is current computer security that I see as a problem, there needs to be a peice of cheap hardware with an ad-hoc OS thats stores, buys and sends bitcoins.

Yea so rather than a new user having to search what exchange to use and then navigate the site the app just has you select your country and other necessary information and give you a step by step guide, it would have to be open source.

My friend told me about bitcoin back in 2011, he sold a URL for 350 bitcoins forgot about it and threw away his wallet along with his old computer. 
I did some mining but never got any bitcoins, I was not in to investment then and I had no spare money.
Now I am going to invest about 55k which once I do I hope to not be obsessed about bitcoin.
I have told a lot of my friends about it and suggested they should invest.

I think the easiest way is to just block double extensions.

They will have to make some improvements, the code isnt 100% yet:
- you can also create a 2.2GB fake JPG / PDF (just rename a movie file or create a file full of zeros) as the first file in your user directory (not alphabetically first, but the first FAT allocation file) it crashes Cryptolocker when it hits the 2GB accessible memory limit (somebody forgot the extended memory space flag as a compilation option when compiling the code :P) ...
