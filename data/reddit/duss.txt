If you wrote down or memorized the seed, you can just reinstall electrum, and get your wallet back with the seed.
You talk about a root.disk, were you using ubuntu with wubi?
Try to mount it in another linux (see: 
Or else you can try to mount it under windows with the correct driver for ext2 (

Gosh, 43 BTC at 3 months ago price is approx more than 20k$.... You invested a lot in BTC and didn't learn how to secure your funds...strange.
I  wouldn't invest a penny without knowing basic stuff (which is available all over the web)
Sorry for your loss (if this is not bullshit)

Just look at the intersango euro order book....It is not the rush toward bitcoins....

Yup, don't worry i had SEPA wires that took up to 7 days to make it through. But Intersango never failed me.

Because some other people are waiting to make more profit on your back.
This julian702 guy says it clearly:


Something that was done for sharing is now aimed toward some shitty profit thing.

You're right, i had this impression when looking at the orderbook that there were fewer offer than 1-2 months ago.

If  this is your first deposit, it takes a bit longer. My first deposit took like 4 days, and now it's more like 1-2 days.

Don't want to be effective, just exposing my point of view. I know some are convinced, i'm not.

I also use Intersango, and i totally agree with you about their effectiveness.

You don't have a bank account? How do you pay your Intenet connection? And the laptop you're posting on? Did you pay cash? How did you get bitcoin without a bank account? By buying overpriced coins with your mobile phone that you paid cash? And are you sure your payments are anonymous? 
I don't need bitcoins to "tip". If i give some software developper 5$ (by paypal for ex), he will receive 5$ minus the fees, let's say for the exemple 4.75$. For bitcoin, i have to get bitcoin (=fees for bank transfert + fees for transaction) then i transfert to receiver who will have to convert them to $$ (more fees) because at the moment you can't buy lots of things with your coins only. For me it would cost more than 5$ to be able to give him 5$. Then you have to sell your coins for good price which is not guaranteed. Or you may gamble on the exchange (which seems to be the largest use of bitcoin, make money over close to nothing, like real exchanges) But im in no way intersted in doing something that led us to the banking-that-became-economical crisis. And in this game, be sure some are already good and waiting for the mass to inject coins so they can make good profit over the innocence of beginners, or of people not interested in gambling. 
On the other hand i admit i like very much the idea of bitcoin and to be able to make payments this way. But for lot of services you can already pay whith real money (paypal, CC, check or transfert) it is not worth the trouble.
Also, nothing personnal.
