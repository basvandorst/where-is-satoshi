Remember Sony didn't want porn on blu-ray? And before that Sony's betamax lost to VHS and porn played a role in that too. So you might be on to something here.

if i'm not mistaken Mr. Schiff is not a bitcoiner

Pump and dump is the exact reason that the volume is picking up now. Even at $800/bitcoin you can expect a pretty good return in the next few weeks. Chinese aren't stupid, they're practical, and probably good at math.

I don't need Yahoo finance telling me that its in the numbers!

Whenever I copy/paste a bitcoin address I always check the first 3 and last 3 digits, helps make sure that something did not get transmuted or corrupted during the copy/paste process. Its a technique I developed working as a design engineer and dealing with lots of part numbers.

The fact that the IRS has not released any official guidance regarding Bitcoin is very disturbing at this point.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:07:27
What exchange rate would one use to calculate gains? This is a disaster for the IRS, they clearly don't understand what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:15:50
I keep getting satoshis from a different address every couple of days, and then those transactions get removed.

nice Acura
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:40:36
Good for you, I'd hang on to it as long as I can before spending or selling it.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:28:39
I say let the stupid people miss out. Volume has been really low this weekend and I have quadrupled my position in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-15 01:15:53
The fundamentals of Bitcoin are just so strong at this point, I'm staying on the bandwagon.
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:38:39
Mathematically it will replace the dollar, that is if they start printing again. But it looks like they are threatening to completely stop in a few months. I still can't predict what's going to happen but either way I have some wealth stored in both.

I'm imagining a future where the number of bitcoin transactions is hundreds of times higher than it is now and there is a need for increasingly faster hardware.
Moore's law says the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles every 2 years. I just hope technology can keep up with bitcoin. Also, government regulations on electricity, chemical waste, and water (apparently it takes a lot of water to manufacture a cpu) could play a major role in the future of bitcoin mining. The vast majority of ASIC manufacturers are located in USA, Germany, and Japan.
I think that many people will be disappointed in the long run unless they are able to continue a sustainable mining operation. This will also include investment in the development of new mining technologies. Nobody wants to see their profits evaporate into tiny fractions, regardless of the fiat exchange rate.

There is a project called Deaddrop

Yes, nature time and time again proves that exponential growth is not sustainable. Humans have a very hard time grasping this concept.

its a series of bubbles
@_date: 2013-07-11 23:11:51
There was a banking crisis in Cyprus in April which caused a spike in Bitcoin interest.

Sounds good to me, this is how a unmanipulated deflationary free market currency is supposed to work.
I still can't get over how perfect bitcoin is ;-)
@_date: 2013-06-11 02:37:51
This could be huge
@_date: 2013-06-26 13:19:03
Stop living in the past, save some bitcoin and buy dedicated miners. Now is the time for early adopters to benefit.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:38:17
Mt. Gox bitcoin market share will decline if they really are the problem. I think thats already starting to happen. Bitcoin is very young still.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:43:57
If they don't accept bitcoin that's fine. They will just fall victim to Ripple. Which if I understand correctly is like a decentralized type of Paypal.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:32:23
They intentionally skipped over the part of the weusecoins video where they say your accounts can never be frozen. I know its true, but why would they skip it?
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:43:22
oh lol I thought thats what the lower set of bars were on the chart I was looking at. Either way the price has been stable and coins are available at other places for fair prices.
@_date: 2013-08-10 11:59:56
As if Mt. Gox was causing more harm than good to Bitcoin? I beg to differ. Let the free market function. They controlled over 80% of the market at one point and really helped get this Bitcoin revolution started. If you intervene in the free market then you will destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:33:10
I'm using USB block erupters by asic miner. I have pre-orders from BFL as well and I'm also invested heavily in mining contracts.
@_date: 2013-08-30 00:09:09
omg yess over 24 hours and counting for one of them...
@_date: 2013-07-20 13:39:45
and you can't even use bitcoin to help fund it, very frustrating. I won't have any part of it.
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:37:37
how dare he compare bitcoin to beanie babies
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:38:16
whats so special about these coins?
@_date: 2013-06-25 23:41:36
Because their customers have more confidence in bitcoin than they do?
@_date: 2013-06-27 21:03:37
With all the central banking action going on right now I've recently picked up my rate of bitcoin saving/purchasing.
I have very high hopes for bitcoin and have some mining investments too!
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:51:51
hence the reason we need bitcoins to being with, it should not be taking that long to send money in this day and age
@_date: 2013-07-16 22:12:53
don't you have to claim it as income and pay taxes on it??
@_date: 2013-06-20 22:00:33
I think Mt. Gox deserves more credit for all the hard work and dedication they put into Bitcoin. A controlled decline was the best we could hope for and that's what is happening.
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:31:53
Pretty impressive resume for a 29 year old.
Edit: I googled it and apparently there is a conspiracy about his real background.
@_date: 2013-07-13 14:22:23
Coinbase is pretty trustworthy, it really does work.
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:29:10
There is no actual price of Bitcoin. You buy it if you want at the offered price, end of story.
@_date: 2013-06-16 19:51:58
Lost over 5 bitcoins on bad bitcoin investments on btcjam. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 01:01:44
Is this available to US residents?
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:13:39
more fiat money, more problems
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:01:18
satoshi dice, p2p lending, and margin trading on Gox.
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:43:54
Even if the difficulty rises profitability could still come back if/when the exchange rate makes some significant moves.
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:00:15
Nice to see we have some smart people here.
@_date: 2013-08-13 18:30:44
got a nice little boost in usd exchange rate too :-)
@_date: 2013-08-10 23:53:14
It is a free market, I just don't understand why Mt Gox market share keeps coming up as a topic as if its a really big problem. People moved on and that was expected.
@_date: 2013-07-09 16:41:02
Similar story bro, I've lost on SD and satoshi circle a few coins here and there but I could have done so many better things with that money.
@_date: 2013-09-06 02:06:54
@_date: 2013-07-08 13:52:14
Become an early adopter and wait until the exchange rate goes up, mine them, invest them, offer goods and services in exchange for them.
Also buying as many things as you can in bitcoin and avoiding fiat like the black plague (within reason).
But mostly just waiting for the usd exchange rate to go up before you sell them or spend them, no matter how you acquired them.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:51:54
The thing with coinbase is you have to be patient and wait for the buying window to open up. I usually check the site a few times per hour and somehow I get lucky. Bought several bitcoins this weekend at about $100/each and not regretting it.
Now when the price goes really high and everybody is trying to buy/sell, then availability becomes a problem.
Buy low, sell high.

2 revolutions in under 3 years, they move pretty fast over there. Might as well upgrade your monetary system while you're revamping everything else.
America should have had 10 revolutions by now, people need to stop victimizing themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:52:25
Unless the number of transactions goes up due to widespread adoption, then we would welcome the additional processing power. This bitcoin thing could get HUGE.
