I don't get this guy. Why does he continue to talk about Bitcoin even though he thinks it's bs?

Thanks. Why are paper wallets a bad idea now?

All this talk about numbers is nonsense. Will it be infinite dollars or not?

Depending on the printer, it saves recently printed documents onto it. Attack threats could be If a hacker got into your wifi-connected printer, or someone goes to the printer and prints the recently printed doc.

I meant how to generate a transaction while offline and then later send that signed transaction on my online computer.

I have an old laptop, never connected to the internet, and my private keys are stored on both a USB with a .7z archive (encrypted), and my laptop which is password protected. I downloaded Electrum and put it on the offline computer, and I sign the transactions using it, bring the signed transaction to my online computer and broadcast it on Blockcypher. Wouldn't that be enough?

Damn I don’t know how people leave all their crypto on exchanges. I have a friend who left it all his on quadriga and I told him  for months to at the very least use a software wallet.

People think it will touch 3k and the majority seems to think so because of the amount of buy orders there. It's a huge amount. If 3k is touched it will bounce big. The more bids the more competition, people are expecting a price rise after the bottom. Those who got ahead of the competition are placing their bids at 3.2-3.5k now. At some point there will be the same people putting in at 3.5k. That's a bullish sign.

This should have been expected. Good thing it's happening early on rather than later when bitcoin potentially becomes one of the biggest mediums of exchange.

Just a spike in volume of BTC sold lowers the price for that day because of supply and demand, but theres still so much more demand that can be created in the long run. We're still only hitting less than 0.2% of the world population..

Sorry about that
