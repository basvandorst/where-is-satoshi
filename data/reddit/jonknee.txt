It would absolutely be worth freaking out about because where the hell is all the money? A bank takes deposits, makes loans and receives interest. If Tether made "loans" (issuing without a backing) it receives no interest and there no physical assets backing up the liability. If they can't keep the market up all the crypto assets will be underwater and they're insolvent--anyone left holding Tether is FUD.
tl;dr it's worth freaking out about

I guess you could go back as far as the Gox days as there's some good research there, but just starting from the start of 2017 things went from stable to a rocket ship. 
It just seems weird that you don't see going from $1,000 to $20,000 as suspicious, but you see $20,000 to $10,000 as obvious "price manipulation by Wall Street".

Have you considered the possibility that the gigantic run up in BTC was the real manipulation? A bunch of wash trading bots and unbacked tethers coming in to bid the market up to scoop up dumb money that came in to chase the incredible gains.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:30:45
Unless perhaps the operators of the exchange are in on the spoofing... Like say an exchange that also operates Tether?

Well... $1000 of it is actual $100 bills so that is the "lower end" OP was talking about. The BTC value is variable as is any perceived artistic value.

Why would that make much more sense? It's muuuch more simple to settle in cash. If they had to settle in BTC the market would be much smaller and few parties would be able to sell the futures as they would need the BTC in reserve.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:16
You can't put BTC in a bank account, but you can sell your BTC on GDAX and then transfer the USD (or whatever your currency of choice is) to your bank. For USD [there is no fee]( if you use ACH and $25 if you use a wire transfer.

From the SPR? There's definitely a reason, to pay for shit that the GOP doesn't want to pay for. It's really dumb to sell it off when the price of oil is so low, but hey. Oil is cheap because there is currently more oil than uses for oil, it's not going away in the next 30 years.

I hope not, but I feel that the government would love to dump cash (not for BTC, but just cash in general).

It is now likely to be returned, with a fine deducted, the Italian financial police say.


That actually sounds really reasonable, it was money that was made in Europe and any way to try and make this a BTC story is absurd.

In a timely turn of events, this story came out today:
[Coinbase ordered to report 14,355 users to the IRS](


@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:25
... But you're still liable for it. I know it might sound wild, but some people want to pay the taxes they legitimately owe. Bitcoin makes that difficult and improving the situation would actually make it a more valuable currency.

Yea, money laundering rules in general are a shakedown of everyone to try and catch the bad actors. At least Snoop will get it [mostly] back.

I have a hunch they spent about 3 minutes working on this story and used words that accurately describe Mt Gox (fail, collapse, loss).

Read up on how futures work, but the OP is correct that the gains (and potential losses!) are multiplied. Here's a [good place to start]( Essentially in a futures contract you put down a deposit, so instead of putting down $10k you might only put down $1k but have the risk/reward of the 10x bigger stake. If the value of that moves up 10% to $11k you have actually doubled your outlay for a 100% gain. 
CME is probably going to require a larger than normal margin because BTC is so volatile, but even 2x levered (50% deposit) is a significant boost. Note that if it goes the wrong way on you there's a good chance you'll get to find out what a margin call sounds like.
Futures are a big boys game, it's really easy to get smoked and brokers don't let just anyone play because you can easily lose more than you put in. Buying options is a lot safer (you can only lose what you put in) and still has some leverage effects. CBOE has BTC options in the works.

I'll give you that it's currently tough in Europe, in the US we have not experienced negative interest rates and the government provides excellent inflation protected bond options for individuals.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:41:03
You can own them in tax advantaged accounts like an IRA or 401k... It's a fine hedge against inflation. Another one is owning equities.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:04:44
That's not at all how it works... The reserve requirement for large banks is 10%. If you deposit $10,000 the bank keeps $1,000 around and tries to loan out the remaining $9,000. They don't get to loan out 10x your deposit, they get to loan out .9X. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:46:29
I know exactly how fractional reserve lending works and it is indeed how I described. If you deposit $10,000 the bank can only lend out $9,000. 
Where you're confused is that people get loans to buy stuff and people who sell stuff often deposit that money into a bank which can then again be loaned out (less a reserve). The money supply expands, but a liability is created that balances it out. Nothing is created out of thin air. The same process works in reverse whenever you pay against a loan.
Put another way, if you loaned me 10 jackets and I in turn loaned 9 of those jackets to someone else, would you say there are any more jackets in existence? You would still say you have 10 jackets and someone else says they have 9 jackets and the bank has 1 jacket, but there really are only 10 jackets.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:30:22
It incentivizes investment which is why billions of people today live way better lives than they used to. No one benefits when people keep their money under the mattress (or Bitcoin in a wallet). My savings is loaned out to help other people buy stuff, the people who sold the stuff then have their savings loaned out and the cycle continues--we all get more stuff!
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:15:18
Please enlighten me!

It dropped below 8k again...
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:13:01


But you do agree that there really are only 10 jackets though right? If you add up the credited jackets *and* debited jackets the total will be 10. It's the same with the money supply, you're adding up the credits to get to 10x, but not counting the debits which then get it back to 1x. $10k deposited, $9k loaned does add up to $19k and so on, but there's also the matter of whoever got the loan owing $9k. Add up all the debts and boom you're back to the original amount, even after many layers of deposits and loans.
Obviously there is a way for this system to break down (too many people not paying back their loans!), but that's like saying life insurance is a flawed idea because not everyone can die at the same time and get paid. The idea is fine, the [many] trillion dollar question is just the default risk. Banks need to make sure they are charging enough interest to be able to cover any defaulted loans. That's where the risk is, not that it's because they are making money out of thin air.

So save through a CD or short term bonds that will beat inflation. It's not exactly rocket science.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:22:57


Where did you get that idea? Who wants a bunch of currency? People want assets, not currency. Do you think Jeff Bezos wants to own a large piece of Amazon or a bunch of currency he can look at? Currency is useful to exchange different forms of wealth, otherwise it's not much good.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:59:39
I imagine people with significant assets consider themselves savers as well, they just save in things other than hard currency. Which makes sense as currency isn't meant to be an investment class but a medium of exchange. 
The government even makes it really easy to make small investments (starting at just $25) in very safe bonds at better rates than the big fish can get.

The current value of all BTC ($3.78B) is less than all but one of the positions the OP cited. That's the theoretical max too, a lot of BTC has been lost/stolen and isn't available to trade. BTC is much too small to be interesting as a serious position to someone of Buffet's size.
