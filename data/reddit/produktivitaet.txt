New Hampshire is an epicentre of bitcoin activity, and home to the [Free State Project]( It's beautiful [this time of year](
It needs a little bit of work to pass inspection, and has about 267,000 kilometres on it, but no collision history. Needs: disc brake pads, rear rotors, brake fluid, and rear shocks.
1.8 litre Turbo (petrol). Manual transmission. Great interior. New Goodyear tyres as of last year. Manchester, NH. PM me if interested!

As far as I can tell, it's the only gas station in the States which accepts bitcoin. You can find prints like [these]( lining the walls.

Indeed. Check out the [Free State](
To our knowledge, the oldest continual bitcoin meetup is in Manchester, New Hampshire. Today was our 105th weekly meetup.

False. It lists the wallets in order of creation. [I took that screenshot]( and I created the Bitcoin Cash wallet before the Bitcoin wallet.
Furthermore, the toggle switch defaults to BTC during wallet creation. Bitcoin Cash is opt-in.
Feel free to download it for yourself to verify.

I've been meaning to visit them next time I go hiking in the White Mountains. Didn't know if they accepted btc for gas or just the convenience store.
