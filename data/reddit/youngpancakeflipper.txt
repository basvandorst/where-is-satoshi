Wait and watch the price of whatever coin your holding gets to a price that you're comfortable cashing out at

This is such a bad idea 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:52:25
Wtf hahaha

Tips and tricks on how to hold? Just put it in a wallet and don't touch it

Don't sign up for GDAX if you already have a Coinbase account, just log into GDAX with your Coinbase email and password

It makes perfect sense buddy. Coinbase pays the fee. Clogging the network? So what? I'm not supposed to spend my cryptoCURRENCY now? Maybe BTC should catch up and increase network speeds like LTC &amp; XRP. Not shilling but there's a problem here and I promise it's not your average Joe moving around 100-200 dollars "clogging" the network.

How are you gonna give a "tip" about holding when you panic sold right after you bought in?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:08:51
You're missing the point of crypto there buddy

Dude you have a load of learning ahead of you

Buy $150 worth? Offer goods or services on Craigslist in exchange for crypto? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:41
For no-fee transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:09:25
You're an idiot lmao
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:01:25
Its not normal, this isn't everyday people buying to adopt. This is huge players trying to make incredible profits. The way I'm seeing this right now, it seems too easy for btc to be shorted rn
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:13:53
Or use GDAX lol

You said it's physically impossible to run a stop sign without stopping.. that's what I don't get and I don't see how that has anything to do with that analogy 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:17:37
Yeah I reckon that went right over my head
