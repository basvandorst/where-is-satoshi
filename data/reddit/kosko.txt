Well played sir!

Cool, thanks for the info man, good explanation. I dig what you're doing and thanks for giving back to the community.

As a total newb, do you get anything in return?

The recent surges have convinced me to go from long time lurker to small investor (with funds I can afford to lose).

He's got $50 of 2012 Bitcoin money of mine!

Bought $200 @ 18.4. It's not much, but I'm trying to buy in the dip

Sure, but that's why I invest low and slow like traditional capital vehicles. If it crashes and I lose it, then it doesn't matter. People taking out a second mortgage to buy currencies is pretty goofy, but money markets are certainly a traded commodity.

So do users actually have a USD account within GDax as well? Like can you make day trading buys/sells within GDax until you pull it out of the market entirely for a fee?

Nice work here son. Remember when you used to be able to tip bitcoin on reddit? I think they were worth around a buck. I sold a coin for hash about 4 years ago, that'd be worth 17k today.

That's actually pretty amazing. Of course no one can guess what the markets will do, but it sounds like someone could flip any number of times between USD/BTC during the day, without any built in fee, as long as they're using limit orders. No wonder this technology has the power to disrupt existing financial markets, a single change in my existing traditional portfolio costs like $10 and then there's like 1% maintenance fee per quarter. An investment vehicle without fees that let me manage the holdings directly.... why do anything else?

Hit the gym, lawyer up
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:23:54
Damn that was quick. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:23:51
That is slick as fuck. Hard to do if you're lag is 30 minutes though. I think it's a pretty good indicator of why to move away from MtGox though.

Watching the little girl destroy the pedo in the first drop on the "First of the Year" single is so gratifying. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:25:41
And the corollary, do not buy high and sell low.

Looks like last price was $125. Still impressive if you held on through a crash and kudos if you made some cash.
