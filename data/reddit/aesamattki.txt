Right, but I thought the issue people had with private (secret) networks was that it wasn't publicly accessible so no transparency in transactions.

As someone who's only used online wallets until now, could someone ELI5 me how this works? Isn't it not very safe to email yourself the backup? What's the best / simplest way to store the backup code for this?
Once Android M comes out, which lets us back up our whole phone, should we not allow it to back up out Bitcoin wallets since they may have some sensitive data we don't want on Google's servers?
Sorry, possibly stupid questions.

Thank you. I actually was using Gemini but I do not like that they don't have any plans to make a mobile app or any mobile friendly website, or that they force you to use Authy and don't let you choose another OTP app, so I'm closing my account with them.
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:23:01
I think it totally depends on their set up. Maybe it is either enabled for everything or disabled for everything, which means adding a BTC option wouldn't stop people from using PayPal. Just a possibility.
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:26:00
Le me ask you this: I know people buy bread every day, but I think if there were a national "bread day" then the demand would increase a lot that day but the price would stay the same. At least I feel like it would. Would bitcoin go crazy if most people used it regularly and then around Christmas everyone bought a ton more with it?
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:55:56
Yes, and one of the reasons it IS for everyone is because it is open source. If it were closed source then it would be centralized and controlled by one company, and not be able to offer any of the benefits it currently does. It's the same with any software. People here complain all the time about governments or corps controlling their lives. If you care about that at all, I'd think twice about jumping on board with another closed source OS.
Regardless of open source vs closed source, I'd suggest trying Android out anyway. I don't really see any benefit of WP other than the UI (which can easily be replicated on Android).

@_date: 2014-12-16 21:14:04
No, you don't HAVE to be a "crusader." But I am saying it seems shortsighted to like BTC for all its benefits and then not see what is wrong with using an entire OS that is controlled by one company.
And there are many kinds of Android. If you're unhappy with yours maybe it is just the specific kind you've chosen. Just a thought.
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:28:30
Wouldn't you be able to make this argument for most crimes? For example, what is the point of treating rapists like criminals? If we lock them up then that further separates them from normal society and doesn't educate them on how to behave. If we legalized rape and just made them go to classes to educate them why rape is bad, as well as show them the harmful effects of it, then that would actually fix the problem.
Not trying to compare drugs to rape. Just trying to play devil's advocate.
@_date: 2014-12-11 11:55:29
How would they expect anyone to if they use it regularly? I buy BTC all the time and then purchase stuff with it. I'm supposed to keep track of the difference of value and how much I added and when, and everything else involved with that? That's insane. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:59:04
So I'm just a tad skeptical. Don't get me wrong, the site looks amazing, but I'm just not sure what the actual reason is for this. People don't just do this stuff and quit their day jobs out of the kindness of their hearts, living off of the funds of some multimillionaire who wants to help Bitcoin and its users.
There must be some game plan here.

I think it appeals to both technological and politically or economically minded people, mostly younger, right away. Sadly, that is a small fraction of everyone. I think the rest of them will switch once they see many others switch and merchants accepting it. Because of this I think merchant adoption will drive it, and all merchants DO have several good and clear reasons they should want it.

I don't necessarily mean having it stolen by hacking. If I buy something from a smaller business website using a credit card, if they don't send it or steal my info, then I just call my cc company and they'll take care of it. I'm totally protected. If it is through BTC then I am protected from them abusing my info, sure, but I've lost all the money and have no way to get it back.

I hate this kind of pretentiousness. I've seen it time and time again in all fields of study, whether it is science or tech or music or literature. One thing I've come to understand is that even when someone is very successful at what they do, the pretentious ones can often be very wrong about a great deal.
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:36:20
it all depends on exactly how you want to rate it though, and what is more important to you.
sure, Google makes Android instead of having a lot of devs from the community contribute code. do I care? no. i don't see why i should.
in terms of whether the apps themselves are open source vs closed source, google IS making many of its apps closed source and putting them on the market, while keeping others like "Email" or "Browser" open source and part of the OS. i also don't really care so much, since google is a company and it needs to protect SOME of its assets. it can't open source everything.
what i DO care about is whether and OS itself has open source code.
if google goes 1984 on us and we decide it is a horrible company, can we strip out every single google-centric bit of code in there? yes.
if i want to use it to start my own "version" of Android or to install it to run on any kind of hardware, from motorcycle helmets to robots to airplane seats, can i? yes. they've all been done before.
is it free? yes.
can i see every line of code to make sure that my phone isn't doing anything i don't want it to? yes, unless you are talking about the various small closed source aspects like drivers. but i don't think drivers can act very maliciously, and if you care about open sourcing them then there are 100% android custom roms which include drivers.
android has become nearly ubiquitous at 85% global marketshare and its focus on lower end and cheaper phones now. it's setting a standard. if you don't like something about the OS, then you can always change something yourself. the dev community does it all the time. if you care about it being 100% open, then that IS an option.
those are the aspects of open source i care about and which many people also consider to be the real aspects that matter, as opposed to exactly how the OS is created.
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:08:57
I'm confused. Etsy integrated Bitcoin into the payment options? Or the seller just mentioned it as a way to pay?
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:56:33
I doubt it. Why would you want to? You have to link a bank account with PayPal anyway. And paying with credit just means fees for who you're paying.
Circle is pretty trustworthy with that info if you ask me, and if you're concerned about anonymity then I'd be far more worried about PayPal.
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:19:01

Which would cause many who wouldn't otherwise invest at all to see there is a pattern of rise and fall, so they'd choose to invest in BTC. Then the investments on a Thursday would cause more people to invest on a Wednesday due to the regularity of investments on Thursday. Then it would move to Tuesday, then Monday, and continue and eventually level up and up. The plan cannot fail.

I'm not an economist so this may be a stupid answer, but it seems to me that both fiat and BTC and gold are more complex than either being volatile or not volatile.
BTC sure seems volatile when you compare it to the fiat equivalent.
Fiat doesn't seem volatile because people don't want to exchange it for other forms of currency as much as they do with BTC. If you look at fiat in terms of buying power, I think it also depends on WHAT you're buying and the volatility of the item itself. I think there is a big difference between items like bread and milk and items like gasoline or gold. There is a lot more to each equation than simply looking at how volatile the currency is. I feel like talking about currency in terms of volatility alone is kind of one dimensional because it disregards the other factors involved in such a highly complex equation.
I think, for me, it helps to look at issues in extremes. For example, what would the world be like if we all used one currency, regardless of whether it is fiat or not? If everyone used BTC and it remained just as volatile, would it matter? If everyone paid twice as much for everything, then I feel it is just semantics. I don't care if I pay twice as much for everything if I get paid twice as much as I do now. Unless I'm missing something, then volatility of the currency itself, when demand for the currency stays the same, is more about the demand for certain products you can buy with the currency relative to other certain products you can buy with the currency.
I feel like there is a lot of relativity involved with this stuff, although I could be wrong. Again, this is just the perspective of a BTC noob.

Would be amazing and probably win everyone over in a matter of a year or two. You should ask them about it via their support email. I asked them if they will offer a debit card eventually and they said they have some really great things planned but didn't say anything specific.
Your idea sounds amazing. Definitely tell them.
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:22:19
Honestly, as someone who hasn't programmed more than website stuff, you lost me at "multisig escrow." I agree it seems like it should be an add on. However, it would be a lot better for me if the process was that I find a merchant that says "accepts bitcoin" and "protected by BitProtect" or something, where BitProtect is an open source insurance add on. Nothing like that exists?

I would have to understand exactly how BTC works more to suggest anything, but just off the top of my head, why not have a complaint system where if an individual decides to not ship out products and just steals BTC from buyers that that individual is not allowed to own any BTC anymore, their BTC assets are broken up and dispersed among the people who didn't receive their items... Something like that. Is that possible?
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:30:34
No way to know. It's like asking when to buy stocks. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 16:28:01
In which case I would ask about what happens when a computer's storage is full. If it can only add transactions, would there be a time when the computer has no more space and it can't do anything else other than sit there, worthless to the owner?
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:32:53
Why? I would think people here would support open sourced decentralized projects that are pretty much standards, which is the exact opposite of Windows Phone. It's great MS is supporting BTC now but why wouldn't you choose Android?
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:04:33
I'm new to BTC but it was explained to me before that if something like this were to happen that BTC software could be updated to fix the bugs and that places which accept BTC would have to update to the latest version which fixed the bug, or else stop dealing with BTC. Is that not true?

Um, no. I have several people I know who use iOS and they cause so many insane issues that that is definitely not the case. If they had Android they would not have had the problems at all, but because it is iOS it is literally impossible to solve the issue for them. The tables have turned sharply.

I know I'll probably be downvoted into oblivion for saying this, but I think there are some crimes often labeled as victimless which, in realty, do have victims are cause major issues, but are just not direct. I am personally for the legalization of marijuana and prostitution and a few other victimless crimes, as long as they are seriously regulated, but there are others I do take issue with.
Other illegal drugs for example, like heroin. If someone wants to do them then that's fine if they don't affect anyone else, but I have a hard time believing they don't. A heroin addiction can easily lead to other crimes for a number of reasons. And what about drug addicts who have children who have serious physical problems? I already feel like society is going downhill due to the number of stupid people who have kids.

You sound somewhat skeptical that it will ever stabilize. Do you not think BTC will ever become a valid option for people who want to hold a lot of money in it like fiat?

ANY sort of conditional payment? So I could say "do this web design project for me and I'll pay you"? How would it know it was finished and I was satisfied?
@_date: 2014-12-13 19:02:28
So pretty much it is the same as if you keep your money in a normal bank account and buy BTC through Circle or Coinbase and then use the BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:21:17
Awesome idea! Plus, 1 USD is probably a hell of a lot more in Africa Dollars.
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:58:49
I don't get it. I thought BTC was perfect for micropayments. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:23:54
That does seem better, but what happens if it locks the money, the buyer receives the item, but still does nothing on his end? He'd lose his money but you'd never get it?
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:18:43
So why do they have to wait for ten minutes? If it arrives right away then that basically confirms the deal is done right?
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:09:20

Every single email provider has access to the email on their servers. It is a fundamental principle of email.
You can also disable ads in Gmail in settings. Not sure why you would want to though since ads are the reason Google can provide us with the best of the best of free services. And they do not share or sell your data in any way.

You do realize that there are a ton of subscribers here who aren't into Bitcoin on that level, right? Personally, I am not even sure what a firewall is or how it works, so I doubt running a full node will be an awesome experience for me.

@_date: 2014-12-16 17:10:33

New to BTC.
- I'm stuck between thinking it is anonymous and extremely public. Is it both? If I had to guess, the transaction records make it very difficult for anyone to trace it back to you, but they are all displayed publicly for everyone to see. Is that correct?
- I currently use Circle, which required me to enter some personal info to verify my identity. Am I correct in thinking that if I use a wallet which doesn't require this and is actually anonymous that if I lose my phone that the BTC will be gone? What happens to the BTC if that happens and I didn't back them up in some way? Do they just sit there never to he used again?
- What is the most average user friendly wallet there is? Something for beginners who just want to use BTC and aren't technically gifted, like for my parents.
- hypothetical question: what would happen if two computers on opposite sides of Earth submitted the exact same code to deposit BTC at the exact same time?

Unless I'm mistaken, a data breach of a credit card company also means 100% failure. A data breach of cash is also a 100% failure. The difference with credit cards is that a data breach of your card isn't actually as direct as a breach of the company. The basic information on their servers wasn't tampered with. Someone just stole your card number. Bitcoin is NOT in competition with credit cards, and I can easily foresee a future where there are BTC credit cards as well where if someone steals your card info that your BTC are insured, just like your credit.

They must have recently changed it but it is still fearmongering. Up until recently it claimed that if you searched for herpes that potential employers could see that and you might not he hired because of that, which is of course utter horseshit.
Now it just ambiguously says "info can be legally requested" which makes it sound like anyone or businesses can request it, which they cannot. Anyone including the government can legally REQUEST info, but whether google gives it to them is another story.
What DDG failed to show is the charts which Google makes publicly available which show the number of government data requests per country, government orders, and the number they have complied with.
Google doesn't comply with government info requests unless they have to or unless there is a good reason to, such as looking into emails of a rapist or murderer to help find them.
As for DDG not being able to track what you search or where you are? Also horseshit. Numerous sources show that PRISM and other tracking software the government uses do not work that way. It intercepts data between search engines and the user. Also, do you honestly think that DDG doesn't have you IP address or search info? How the hell do you think it works? It needs to know what computer you're on to deliver the search results. And if they didn't store that data, you can bet your ISPs do. To the best of my knowledge there is a law saying ISPs have to store data on sites their users visit for 90 days to comply with government data requests.
Google is a good guy here, but everyone freaks out at them because of their ubiquity. They don't do the research to see how transparent Google is, their focus on open source tech, and the ability they give you to even turn of tracking right from your Google account.
The real issue here is the government, not Google. But of course, DDG doesn't say shit about the government and wants to capitalize as much as possible on it.

@_date: 2014-11-05 17:31:05
1. Sorry, I meant Circle, not Coin.
2. So, let me just try to paraphrase this so I understand. The "mining" process is really just the computer validating or backing up other transactions from around the world locally, on your personal computer, and making those available to other computers who in turn validate the authenticity of those transactions? Like if I told several people I bought a $1 candy bar and they told a bunch of other people as well, so that if someone comes in and says I didn't that there would be enough people who knew that I did to show that he is lying?
Thanks for the BC! How do I claim this?

I keep hearing about private keys but don't understand them so much. What exactly is the difference between a private key and a bitcoin address? I assume a private key should never be shared with anyone?
If I associate myself with a private key using Circle, I lose anonymity. I assume I can always regain anonymity by simply using a different wallet?

I still feel like refunding only in gift cards is illegal in some way, or else we'd see it all over. I've never heard of that before now. I would say it is very much worth looking into.
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:19:54
I'm not sure if you ARE understanding. It isn't theoretical. Credit card payments DO take a long time to process. Not that they MIGHT. It just seems instant since they usually aren't met with issues so you never notice. BTC goes through much faster. Not theoretically. Literally.
I have used BTC a ton and never had to wait for anything. Try checking out with Overstock.com or get some tea from Beautiful Taiwan Tea and you'll see what I mean. It is faster than credit cards.

@_date: 2014-12-12 23:28:53
1. Which features do you need and want?
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:39:26
Yeah, but that is also possibly dangerous as well. But you never know. BTC seems to a lot of people to have a bright future, but remember that it was at $1,100 about a year ago. People lost a lot of money from the drop. But like any good broker will tell you, invest for the long term in something that you think will be successful and has long term goals, which I believe BTC definitely has. So even if it does drop, just hold on the the BTC and it might get back up there again years down the line.
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:35:21
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:21:50
Remember, BTC is a currency and doesn't complete with banks. We'll get that too.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:57:32
I heard he likes tech stuff.
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:31:43

@_date: 2014-11-06 05:32:55
How so? If I have $5 in my bank account then I have $5. If anything I might have $5.01 eventually. Bitcoin might go up but might also go down, and isn't invested.

He already said several times that 1. It is NOT a pre mined coin and 2. It is not even an altcoin.

There isn't any ONE point to BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-25 13:38:16
Thanks! Merry Christmas! =)
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:59:00
Of course you can't go from accepting 0 BTC to holding lots of BTC. It is a relatively new currency! As I see it the steps are:
1. Nobody accepts BTC
2. Some merchants accept BTC but automatically convert most or all to fiat since they can't use it for much else like paying employees or reinvesting.
3. BTC continues to catch on and more and more merchants accept it, all or most still converting to mostly fiat.
4. Rates of conversion to fiat shrink as BTC acceptance grows.
5. Eventually most BTC trade holds BTC and doesn't convert.
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:08:58
Don't say that! They're just as smart as the rest of the lower hemisphere.

I thought it was a site where you just go for information about what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:11:55
How? My understanding is that your BC isn't used at all until you spend it.
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:37:03
Interesting. I have so many other questions. Are there any resources you'd suggest I go to learn in depth about how this stuff works, written for beginners? A lot of resources I have gone to about BTC seem very geared toward programmers.
If there aren't any, I was thinking I could make a website that ELI5s everything you could possibly want to know about BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:40:35
In that case, is it necessarily bad that the price is low? It might be used a lot more than normal but just being converted to fiat.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:20:07
So in retail situations you'd say that even in the distant future we will see almost all of them use centralized services like BitPay and Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:12:43
Sorry, I'm new to thinking about currency like this. So I assume the majority of volatility of BTC is due to is being valued mainly by fiat currency, which a lot of people want to convert it to? If everyone in the world only used BTC then there wouldn't be as much fluctuation in value?
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:07:12
I'd like to know this too. Did the seller seriously label it as "weed"???
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:48:57
Someone should sit outside and talk to them about BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:50:41
Does BTC reflect the scarcity of the physical world?

&amp;gt;However, in keeping with the times, our devs have tweaked the appearance in accordance with Google's latest Material Design principles – as employed in Android 5.0 – resulting in a more consistent users experience and 'flatter' look.
No, they haven't. This is "holo" design, not "material." Holo is several years old.
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:44:32
Honestly, I think the best way to sell the idea of Bitcoin to anyone is NOT to just talk about it, but to demonstrate it. Have a projector and a couple devices on screen, and use a VPN to make it look like one person is in another country, and share the screen of both of them at once. Then send some money to them in a variety of ways so everyone can see how simple and easy it is.
Also show them how tipping works.
SHOW more than tell.

Could we perhaps just have a length of graphene with a width of a few atoms which stretches from earth to mars, and has binary signals relayed between the planets by tugging on it? Wouldn't that allow for communication faster than light can travel?

I wasn't sure if Farmer Chang's was from China or Taiwan. Any chance you guys could put up the location for your teas? I saw a few say where they're from but others don't. I would totally become a loyal customer, and I'm a huge tea drinker.
I just tried purchasing some with my Circle app and it had the first error I've run into though. I clicked pay with BTC, and it opened my Circle app and filled in the address and price beautifully. I clicked Send and it never brought me to another page, so I clicked it again and it messaged me a verification number but still didn't bring me to another page. I looked at my Circle transactions and it shows I sent twice as much to that address now, but it didn't deduct it from my BTC yet. I contacted Circle about it so we'll see what they say.
I'll order more once they tell me what happened. Weird.

What is B2B
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:28:41
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:19:49
1. Calculate the expense of each user based on the work the servers have to do, salaries, etc. and have an ad with a figure for each user showing us how much we've cost Reddit in a year. Then show the ad around New Year's and we can pay Reddit back. That would give us a better idea of how much to give and what is effective or not. People might be surprised at how little it is per person and you'd get a higher quantity of tips. Or maybe it is more than we think and we'll be guilted into paying some more.
2. Reddit app donations. Reddit Sync is so amazing I want to give the dev more money, especially I'm BTC. Provide a tipping APK for devs to easily integrate it into their app. Maybe let them integrate some code into a sidebar of their app's subreddits too.
3. Bitcoin Day - A whacky day dedicated to promoting the amazing new cryptocurrency where upvotes and downvotes all double as money. Users all start off with 0 BTC and Reddit has some extremely small figure that is attached to the number of upvotes. You can't go below 0, of course, but maybe the absolute most popular posts of the day get a hundred bucks or something. Reddit decides. Reddit keeps all the BTC in its account until they are collected, and if they aren't collected in 24 hours they are Reddit's again. Sure, Reddit may lose money with this, but if you do it after you integrate the shit out of Reddit with BTC then you will suddenly have a gigantic influx of users who 1. Now know about and are excited about using BTC, and 2. Will be easily able to give BTC back to Reddit, which has BTC integrations all over. Boom.
@_date: 2014-11-29 12:38:25
So the more people spending using BTC then the less volatile it becomes? How does that work with regards to spending affecting the value?

That seems kind of crappy. Shouldn't the code be impartial to transaction size?
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:50:14
It really depends in who you ask. If you ask China, that's what they would say. The reality of the matter is that Taiwan is a self governing country, and that China doesn't control it at all anymore. China hates this, and lashes out against them in petty ways a lot of the time, but it doesn't make it any less true.
@_date: 2014-12-13 19:40:03
Maybe I'm misunderstanding something but Circle says I am 100% insured against hacks and theft unless it is a result of my own carelessness. The only reason I'm hesitant to put all my money into BTC is the volatility.

I don't understand. Why are you mad? They're treating it like a currency...
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:01:17
I'm new, so don't kill me, but I think the problem is "based on" isn't very specific. From what I understand, BTC uses a cryptographic protocol to function, and its value is not based on any physical commodity (based on thin air).
@_date: 2015-01-21 06:48:13
Why would someone want to use BTC instead? Ethereum is based on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:47:17

Why wouldn't the volume stay high? Like I said, people who hold are in it as an investment, but I think the majority of people who use BTC aren't in it for that. People would still send money and convert it instantly. People would still send money overseas. And it doesn't cost anything to simply allow people to pay with BTC. So why would the number of transactions be lower?
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:09:34
He never said they weren't centralized. He only said they use digital money.
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:28:11
I agree with most of what you said, buy I'd argue that there isn't ONE point to BTC. There are numerous benefits to it while using Circle. I personally value the convenience over anonymity and 100% control.

I feel like it isn't a critique of Bitcoin but more a marker as to how far we've come and how widely accepted it is. If we can get to the point where someone can live entirely off of it then it's a pretty major marker.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:30:12
Yeah, and from what I understand there were only about 4 admins and then DPR. If one admin tells DPR to view a certain page at a certain time, and they catch some guy viewing the same page at the same time, while his laptop and chat history are open to the same conversation with the undercover agent, that is enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:44:16
I disagree. Censorship is very different from the laws about not being allowed to harass people or yell bomb. Censorship is wrong. I strongly believe that people shouldn't be allowed to yell bomb in a theater or airplane. That is what laws are for. To protect people. Censorship protects the government, not the people.

The article mentioned Target accepts Bitcoin... As far as I understand they do not. Some websites say it does because you can buy a gift card through Gyft, which isn't the same thing at all. Am I missing something?

So, Ethereum?
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:20:10
BTC doesn't have to process anywhere near that amount per day for this to happen.

I feel like you just dodged the question again...

I can trust a company that appears somewhat reasonable, but if the first thing I hear is that they don't have any plans to earn any revenue, and they says "we have many ways to monetize" and yet repeatedly dodge the question as to how, then that personally raises some red flags with me. They're not obligated to tell me, but I'm not obligated to do business with them or trust them.
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:05:07
Couldn't they have done that before using existing exchanges?
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:26:35
But what disappointed? There were rumors of an exchange, so the price went up. That was true, and it looks amazing... So it goes down?
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:52:21

You suck.
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:37:05
Yeah, there is a cool DIY community around it since it is open source and they show how to make the official powder. However, the official stuff still has some nice benefits to that. For example, like I said in another comment, people complained about the fish oil because there is new evidence showing it causes prostate cancer, not to mention the fact that vegetarians and vegans can't have it. Fish oil gives Soylent added calories and omega-3 fatty acids. Fish get this oil from eating a certain type of algae (from what I read), and the algae itself produces the oil in a purer form. So in Soylent v1.3 cut out the middleman and grows the algae themselves now and takes it directly from there. Same calories, higher quality omega-3's cheaper, more environmentally friendly, doesn't cause prostate cancer, and appeals to vegetarians and vegans. I love that kind of stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:46:15
That isn't how it would work. Google can take Bitcoin payments and still take a cut.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:12:45
Wow, didn't know that!
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:12:57
If it did cause a problem, couldn't we do some kind of fork or software update to reset the lost coins or something?
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:15:36
I've spoken to the devs of Ethereum and that doesn't seem true at all. Where are you getting this from?
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:27:00
Sounds awesome! And it being open source means that I could personally create my own website to do the same thing and we wouldn't need streamium.io for anything?
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:31:43
Why not open a Kickstarter campaign? Also, what kind of company would it be? What kinds of products would it sell? I'd say create a business plan first and then launch a Kickstarter.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:01:49
Thanks for letting us know! Could you show us the formula you're using to determine where it will be going? A lot of us would appreciate that.

Can you back this up with proof? I have read they just eat the cost themselves.

Speaking at a conference is not a right. It is a privilege. By supporting someone who scams others, you are in turn supporting these scams. You'll find that if you don't seriously consider the consequences of that that you'll lose community support very quickly, which looks like it is already happening.

It doesn't even seem anything like an altcoin to me. ETHER may be, but it isn't meant to be used as a simple currency from what I understand. I thought Ethereum is all about decentralized apps and protocols, decentralized autonomous organizations, etc.

Weird. I wonder why.

I have heard awesome things about your app, don't get me wrong. But to be honest, it looks VERY outdated in design. Make it a material design, and hire a fantastic designer. Design and simplicity are so important.

Here is some further reading material for you in case you are too retarded to search for it yourself.


You have to meet minimum wage in cash, unless you qualify for minimum wage exemption, which isn't very common.
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:19:09
I'm not a dev so I'm not really sure how it would work. Can you give me a simple explanation? Is it like WordPress where everyone installs it themselves and it has some kind if front end setup? Or is it code that distributes the video files and streams them, but you have to put that code into your site somehow to allow people to use it? Or something else?
ELI5 please.
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:00:08
Go away
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:44:15
Can't you do that already by ordering cash through the government's website? I thought we are able to do that.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:14:34
I would assume this also means businesses can choose to pay employees using it.

While you're here, I have a question about Storj. I'm not a dev and don't have much experience with more advanced software stuff. I'm not a basic user though. When would you expect Storj to be at a level most users would be able to use? As in something along the lines of simply creating an account and using it like Google Drive? And will there be an Android app that allows access to your files?

I've heard numerous people say that using Popcorn time is very unsafe because the way it works allows for you to easily be traced. Is that correct? If so, wouldn't it be even worse to allow people to trace funds back to us, since Bitcoin is not anonymous?

Why is there a fee for converting Bitcoin to USD or vice versa? I haven't ever seen any.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:15:17
I really doubt it is like that because then every single exchange would have to contact each other. These exchanges post a definitive price which doesn't vary.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:21:14
Yeah, free WordPress install + $70 theme. You don't even need to hire a dev.

Okay, I can see you don't understand how democracies or countries work at all, so let me explain. Nobody "owns" a country. Most of the time, people elect officials to run the country. "Running" a country requires there to be certain "laws." "Laws" are just rules, but if you break the rules there are consequences.
This guys revoked his citizenship AND broke the rules. Let me give you an analogy. A country is like a house which mom and dad are in charge of. A citizen is like a family member. If their son breaks a lamp, then they will be mad and might ground him. They have the authority to do so because they're in charge. If someone from off the street demands to come in, they do NOT have to let him in. It doesn't fucking matter how much the retarded person complains about it. It is their house and they can choose who to let in and out. Furthermore, if this retarded asshole breaks their window, they will DEFINITELY not let him in. They also have the right to call the police and have him arrested.
This is what is going on here. The guy is not a citizen. You don't have to let anyone into the country. The guy broke the law, and is confused why the US isn't letting him in.
I don't know how to make it any clearer for you, but if you still don't understand then I suggest going to meditate for a few years and trying to get the gigantic entitled libertarian sick that is lodged deeply within your ass out. Hopefully that will help you come back to the real world at some point and become a functioning member of society.

@_date: 2015-01-26 20:04:59
I understand that, but I am still confused. Why would so many people see the price going up so unbelievably fast and then start selling huge amounts? I'd think that price spikes would mean more people buy and hold.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:41:09
This is something people seem to misunderstand. Bitcoin should not be reversible. It is an unregulated currency. Reversals would be abused so much, or else need human regulation. Also, Apple Pay is not a currency like Bitcoin. The USD is a currency. If you give me cash for an item or service, and then want to reverse the transaction, you can't. Same thing with Bitcoin. If a service like Apple Pay wants to build transaction reversals on top of Bitcoin, it can be done, just like making a Bitcoin credit card.
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:33:32
So in 20 years the value of 1 BTC will be over $1,000,000...?

I feel like the difference between this and the correct terminology would be lost on readers anyway, and using the correct terminology might scare them away, so yes, even if it is not completely accurate, it should lead to beginners looking into it more and learning the finer points eventually.
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:03:53
Ohhh I see. So he is saying it could process more than that because BitPay or Coinbase can process way more and then just disperse them at the end of the day like a credit card company does to minimize blockchain transactions.

Yep! I ever it was the step after I put in my address.
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:33:08
[Are you referring to this]( I don't think it is the same, but maybe I'm wrong. Also, there is far more to Soylent than what vitamins and minerals go into it. There are different forms of specific vitamins, which they also take into account. They even recently replaced the fish oil with oil they grew directly from algae, giving more omega-3 fatty acids in a more environmentally conscious manner, as well as removing the concerns about fish oil causing prostate cancer.
And yeah, Soylent is open source and there is a huge DIY community, which is pretty cool =)
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:10:54
I'd also like to know about what the other commenter asked. I would LOVE to see this as a WordPress plugin. Is that possible?
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:17:27

@_date: 2015-01-25 01:38:00
Ohhhh I see. Very smart!
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:52:04
Everyone here seems to be posting about how we don't need the government's permission, but I think there is more to it than that. IANAL but I would assume that there are laws which would protect these transactions. For example, if my employer wants to pay me with aged cheese, and I agree to that, even in a written contract, that is illegal. They still have to pay me the minimum wage, whether by cash or check or direct deposit. I would think this means that BTC is now accepted legally. Just one example off the top of my head.
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:59:42
1. Does Coinbase becoming a fully regulated exchange mean I can store my Bitcoin with them without worrying? If they get hacked or steal my funds or something, does this mean I'm protected legally or something?
2. Is Circle or Coinbase safer to store BTC?
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:59:05
Not the official version. I think others might be though. Look into 100% Food or Joylent.
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:26:39
Dude, you're wrong. Your definition is not correct. This is not a matter if opinion.

@_date: 2015-01-26 03:06:38
Can someone ELI5 this to me, as a non-dev? Would it be like WordPress in than you run it completely online?
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:47:15
That's not how that works at all.
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:42:22
That's better than Circle?
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:58:18
I went to checkout and clicked proceed and it was right there under credit cards and paypal.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:52:29
I agree that is part of it, but as far as I know I can say anything I want unless it causes some actual problem like yelling bomb or something.

I feel like Circle is great for any ordinary person who wants to use BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:52:10
Is there somewhere that offers an explanation as to what all these bullwhales and bearwhales mean? I'm relatively new and must have missed something.
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:49:32
I don't promote one over the other but in my opinion, Maidsafe seems like a much bigger project that has more potential, but is still a long way from being finished. Storj is in beta and is based on the blockchain which has already had a lot of use and has been proven to work. It also has a pretty nice aesthetic design to their site which makes me feel like it might be more user friendly sooner.
Just a first impression.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:58:42
Have you tried Joylent or 100% Food? Not sure if they ship there but they actually also accept BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:18:10
Not really. First of all, nothing has been studied anywhere near to the extent soylent has. Second of all, this isn't a normal "meal replacement," like Ensure is. Ensure is not in any way meant to completely replace 100% of your food forever. Soylent is. People have been living healthily from Soylent alone for very extended periods of time. Third, the cost is less than $3 per meal, which is an incredibly healthy and perfectly balanced meal, so I'm not sure why you think it is pricey.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:33:50
Why not?
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:12:01
A full and complete business plan? The guy just said their whole business doesn't earn any revenue. How the hell are we supposed to hear that and NOT ask how they plan on making any money? I'm not entitled to know anything but a little shred of transparency on this might help them gain customers, if not to simply answer a pretty blatant hole in their business model.
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:51:25
I've seen it but the design in the screenshots look so incredibly outdated I can't even bring myself to download it.
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:33:03
I agree with the other commenter. The Circle app is amazing. Bread Wallet for iOS is also amazing. Have you used Simple Bank before? They're also way up there.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:10:08

I'm skeptical of that statistic. Very skeptical. I looked at your source and it didn't provide a link to the study. Does this stat include children?

Could you explain what the difference is? I know on circle and coinbase I can exchange fiat for BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:27:44


No? I never said anything like that.
I AM saying it is probably illegal to pay someone who is not exempt from minimum wage (for example, executive or administrative employees) ENTIRELY with Bitcoin. Employer must pay minimum wage in cash, the only exception is if they deduct lodging, utilities, or meals. If you want to pay someone minimum wage in cash and also give them extra in BTC then that is fine.
There are reason for these laws, and they are to protect employees and create a fair employment environment in our country.
I know a lot of people are libertarians here and I agree that the government should stay out of SOME kinds of affairs, but I don't see how anyone can be against wage and hour laws which are exist entirely to protect employees.
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:25:54
Which is fine with me. I'm asking if I trade in low volume if Circle or Coinbase are better in terms of fees.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:34:09
Two questions:
1. I know there's been some problems people cite with BitPay where they receive a large transfer and BitPay cancels it due to having a multi-tiered system of maximum daily transfers. Once you verify more info then the max goes up, but there are limits. Do you have anything like that?
2. Do you have any special features for nonprofits?

@_date: 2015-01-04 00:55:25
Do you know how law works? This isn't saying that we needed approval for BTC transactions. It is protecting BTC with the law, which is a GOOD thing. If BTC isn't a legal transaction then businesses, for example, cannot legally pay an employee with them because they wouldn't be abiding by minimum wage. I could agree to be paid with acorns and that would still be illegal, unless the state recognized acorns as a valid currency.

It's probably that they accept returns for defects. I think it said they take back returns for pretty much any reason, even if you just don't like it.
If they ship defective merchandise then I'm sure they'd take it back. If not, then they deserve to get a chargeback.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:31:35

I can attest to it. I sold my phone in perfect condition to someone who claimed it arrived broken. PayPal took the money for his refund out of my account without my approval. They said if I had proof I shipped it without the broken screen that i should send it to them. I sent them the photos of it when I sold it. Perfect screen. They said they weren't going to refund my account anyway because they'd be liable for a charge back and in these cases they 100% of the time side with the buyer. I also wasted many many hours of my life arguing with them over the phone, getting nowhere. I would have had to drive to the city of their nearest office to sue them in small claims court, which I couldn't do. That's as good as stealing hundreds of dollars from me.

Probably not legal here either. But if a company does something illegal that is several hundred dollars then it has to go to small claims court, and here the rule of small claims court is you can only sue a company is the small claims court they have an office in. And you can't do it electronically. Not feasible for 99.9999% of people so PayPal gets away with it all the time.

Wrong. It depends on a lot of things. Let's say you can pay for a house flat out, or get a mortgage where you pay 5% interest. You could invest you money in something that almost guarantees you gain 10% interest, and then pay the mortgage off and you'd end up with more in the long run than if you just paid for the entire house altogether.

@_date: 2015-03-02 21:24:05
I disagree.
1. This will allow people to hold more in Bitcoin since it can be spent very easily rather than converting fiat to BTC all the time. This means, from what I understand, higher value and less volatility.
2. I assume Android Pay would impose some kind of fee which Google would collect. If that's the case, then it will make it very convenient for people to use BTC to pay for things, but it would still give merchants a reason to try to adopt it more directly so those fees weren't imposed.
3. Who's to say merchants couldn't choose to accept things in Bitcoin? Right now everyone is talking about Android Pay only used as a payment method, but what about the receiving end? Maybe merchants would be able to have some option to accept it as Bitcoin.
4. From what I understand, more transactions will also decrease BTC volatility.
5. The decrease in BTC volatility is what we need for merchants (or anyone) to consider holding a lot of their money in BTC rather than fiat. Merchants will not accept it if they think it will lose them money by holding. The previously mentioned points I made should solve this, and hopefully the decreased volatility will show merchants and people it is okay to keep your money in BTC.

So really lagging means the price is probably more stable? Or is neither one good or bad?

Are the shirts themselves made in the US? If so I'll definitely by a few. Let me know.

Honest question: can you link me to a wallet the average person can use in any country which can easily convert it to fiat?
@_date: 2015-10-06 11:21:54
I somehow doubt it.

Here's the info on Android Pay we have so far: 
Sundar Pichai confirmed it today, saying it is an API for third party apps to be accepted in brick and mortar stores along with in app purchases and that Google Wallet will be using the API.

Amazon is great for the most part, but goddamn are they closed minded when it comes to tech. They refuse to allow for Chromecast functionality with their Amazon Instant Video service, don't even have an app for it for Android, the Fire Phone was worthless, and they refuse to even consider Bitcoin.

This is not the Google Wallet API. Android Pay is an API which will allow any third party wallet to make use of in app payments and brick and mortar store payments using NFC. For example, Paypal can use the Android Pay API in their app and then I can enter a game and use PayPal to pay for an in-app purchase. A Chinese competitor to PayPal can use the Android Pay API and I can use my phone to pay for things in stores in China using NFC.
I think you're not understand the difference between Android Pay and Google Wallet. They're two very different things.

I just wish they had a mobile app.

You can kind of Marie that argument for any person too, if you're pessimistic enough.

What I'm asking is why did FF experience a LOSS just from adding an option to pay with Bitcoin? That doesn't sound right to me.
@_date: 2015-03-15 07:48:51
How does it guarantee that they actually send the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-15 05:17:12
Yes, but Bitcoin allows us to easily and securely store large funds without that happening. It was just the trust they put in Mt. Gox that was the problem.

Have you looked into Ethereum?
@_date: 2015-03-29 06:15:32
Did you help make this? I'm also interested.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:34:48
Ethereum would be for smart contracts, which you'd need for the business deal.

Imagine holding your money in Bitcoin and using an app that automatically converts it to local currency based on GPS location. You wouldn't ever have to worry about converting it again.

I already do this when they use Coinbase. I tap the QR code once and it lets me choose what wallet I want to use.

Are you considering using Ethereum?

Still is unclear to me why that happened.
