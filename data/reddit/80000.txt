From the forum:
Here's what's going on.  Evil-Knievel has pre-computed a couple points on the secp256k1 curve.  Specifically points where the exponent is of the form 2**N. (see 1,2)  He then wrote a program, the "cracker", that can search the area around those points.  If a Bitcoin key-pair lies close to one of those points, his program will find it.
This isn't dangerous.  It's improbable (~impossible) that any uniformly random Bitcoin key-pairs are weak to his pre-computed points.  The secp256k1 keyspace is, for all practical purposes, infinitely large.  It doesn't matter if Evil-Knievel had a gabillion-gajillion pre-computed points and all the computing power in the universe.  His approach still wouldn't crack a normal Bitcoin key-pair.
To me, having just read Evil-Knievel's thread, it sounds like he's insinuating that there is danger here.  He's insinuating that a uniformly random Bitcoin key-pair has a reasonable chance of being tractably close to one of his pre-computed points.  There is no reasonable chance of this, and his claims are ridiculous.  The thread should be closed as a scam, because he's asking for money on misleading premises.
If he has nothing to hide, why was his HTML generator obfuscated?  I'll help and de-obfuscate the generator for everyone.  Here's the algorithm:
Pick a random N, [128, 255].
Pick a random M, [1, 20000000].
Spit out 2**N - M as a private key.
See the problem?  He just needs to take a generated public key, add G to it ~20,000,000 until it matches one of the 128 pre-computed keys (which are of the form 2**N), and BAM the private key is "cracked".  This doesn't make Bitcoin weak.  It never will.  It's a rainbow table attack.  But mankind will never have enough computational and storage power to make rainbow tables work against secp256k1.
As for the bitprobing.com "project".  That's a load of bollocks.  If you don't believe what the experts have to say about ECDSA, that's fine.  But go learn group theory and number theory first, before asking the public to help run unsubstantiated "experiments."
I know these forums are intentionally soft-modded, and appreciate that to an extent.  But it's times like these I wish the forums were more aggressively moderated so that Evil-Knievel could just be banned for misleading and scamming people.

This is a breeze compared to those times. If we can survive a protocol bug that invented 184 billion bitcoins (2010), survive Bitcoin crashing to one cent (2011), survive a hard fork due to an incompatible update that 50% of the network used (2013), then do you think one exchange going offline is going to be the end of Bitcoin? People panic so easily and I almost feel like a jerk when I buy their bitcoins from them.

People don't understand this is a requirement by law. There's no way around this currently. The reason fiat ATM's do not require this is because you already told the bank your ID, photo and favorite color when you signed up for your debit card.
What would be cool is if Robocoin allowed people to sign up once on the website and receive some kind of verification card or something, that would then work at every ATM. This would also be a great way for them to monopolize as more people buy Robocoin ATMs

Just here to say this CANNOT be related to transaction malleability. Transaction malleability is changing a transaction's hash (or 'id'). The transaction is still broadcast so your withdrawal would be fine.
Also, the 'double spends' we have been seeing is someone rebroadcasting transactions with a different transaction hash, thus only one will confirm, there's nothing wrong with this. Once again this person is rebroadcasting transactions so they appear twice. You would definitely see your withdrawal on the blockchain, and one of the two will confirm.

Even 100,000 BTC stolen from someone wouldn't cause a 51% decision to rollback.
The 100,000 BTC would hit news and depending how it was taken, it could cause a drop in price due to people believing BTC is insecure as well as fear of all that BTC being sold.
BUT if a hard fork was created it would cause a much more drastic price drop. Also people would lose much more faith in bitcoin as now any transaction can be reversed at the communities discretion.
TL;DR A decision to hard fork won't happen unless a core bug has been found that affects the majority of Bitcoin users. (Like what happened on August 15th, 2010)

It's not the only reason in the video. It mentions many times the fact that no one entity can control Bitcoin as being one of its biggest features. Among other things like the extremely low fee's. I could only fit so much in 5 minutes. My point was the fact the price is $800 and not $1 is a measure of the success. People would rather hold onto a Bitcoin than sell it for less than $800 right now.

There's many ways you can do it depending on what you need. The easiest being simply sticking your Bitcoin address on your page. Or you can install bitcoind (I believe its called bitcoin core now) and have it generate a new payment address for each user.
If you need to monitor for incoming payments etc and are not willing to trust something like the blockchain.info api, you will need to be running your own full node with something like bitcoind
