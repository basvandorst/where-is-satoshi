I got it "late" when the price was around 5,000. I have no idea what I'm doing except to hodl. But for those who can provide a little insight, maybe you can tell me if my investment process is ok?
1. Made initial deposit
2. Signed up for one of those automatic "debit purchase to saving" accounts. (Without naming the company, I set up a rule where if I use my debit card for purchases, the purchase price automatically rounds up $2. That $2 goes into the savings account.)
3. Take the accrued savings from the week and invest it in BTC.  
4. Repeat
5. Hodl
6. Profit???

I agree, but the growth was also contributed by the many with little to no understanding. As a long-term investment, that's there. But asking for people to remember when bitcoin was at 15k while it's down at 6k is not going to get more people to put more money in. When people SAW it going to reach 15k, people were throwing everything they had into it.

exactly. I keep seeing these buy the dip. A dip is going from 17k to 15/16k and back up — hence the term "dip". Not a 70% drop in value with no recovery.

I get what you're saying, but I also see why people don't want to pull the trigger. When BTC was 5k, 10k, 15k, it was rising with very small drops (relatively speaking). Now, we're looking at something that once hit 19k down to 5k with **hopes** of getting back to where it was. The buying mindset is very different now.
