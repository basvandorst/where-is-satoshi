because he didn't invent it and he's just lying

It’s interesting that countries turn to bitcoin, because their economies and political climates are so fucked up. Part of me feels bad because the instability of bitcoin that causes us to profit hurts them

I wish I had the money to give you gold for this
@_date: 2019-05-01 19:38:13
Even if this was true, your realize how exorbitantly unstable this currency is right? You understand the concept of a sustainable business model right?

@_date: 2018-12-18 17:08:44
Lol ok will do

It wasn’t phishing, they either lied about how they were hacked or are faking it for money. We’ve already seen that bitcoin is an excellent platform to scam people, take bitconnect for example

Nah dawg, someone who *actually has* taken a class in economics is calling. I mean look at the dot com bubble. Look at the google trends on bitcoin vs value. Bitcoins only value is the hype it generates. The more hype it generates the more it’s valued. This is how truly free markets work

Give me one reason I shouldn’t short bitcoin right now.

Y’all realize you wouldn’t have to get rid of bitcoin, you could just make it worth so little it’s pointless. That’s how you break bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:45:03
I mean yeah, but not according to the missing 16k/btc

You do realize that it’s never going back up right? It was the hype that caused it to go up, and now that hype is over. I hate to say it, but you lost hundreds of thousands of dollars dude. You should start taking USD and saving it.

Lmao dawg it’s a vise, google it
