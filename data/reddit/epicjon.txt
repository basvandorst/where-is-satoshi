Did you get the Powerball numbers too?
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:32:32
second in relation to what?
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:28:06
If you are looking at this in $30 increments you are going to get hurt really bad.

he's our own Nostra-dumbass.

Not really, unless you've only been around for a few months or haven't done any research.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:37:09
I think he's referring to when he bought in.
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:18:57
that's a really shitty analogy, unless you have only ever had one hard-on in your life.

Does someone just auto-repost this story every couple hours?
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:10:54
Because they don't have all the lost coins, they only were able to reclaim a percentage of them.

I ended up just blocking him. Life has been much better ever since.

You haven't left any predictions up, you deleted them all along with every comment you have ever made. Just like you will most likely delete this one within the next few hours.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:41:08
I feel like if you actually had this question you would have looked either in the comments here or at any of the 50 posts created about this topic in the last few hours. This makes me assume that you must be trolling. I could be wrong though, you could just be unaware of how to actually use Reddit.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:34:14
Yeah, at this point I think they might actually have some kind of disorder. Like if you met them in public you'd go "Oooooh, that explains it."

That's because he deletes them all. They are either completely wrong or personal attacks and insults.

If there is one thing you can take away from any of these discussions it should be pretty clear no one knows anything for sure. Personally, I believe we will continue to see these fluctuations for a few more months with a slight decline over time before things level out. Then I think we will see an upward trend again, but I'm talking about 6 months to 2 years before we see another big run up. Grain of salt.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:48:29
That sounds like far too centralized an event for me...

Apparently we're not the first community goldbergger has devoted his time to trolling:

Exactly, a price of 11.5k would be part of the abnormality and currently not sustainable. It's not depressing that the price is currently in the 8k range.
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:44:37
I don't have a basis for one, which is why I don't think we'll see one for a while. Do I think it will happen again eventually? Yes, because I feel it has become a trend over the last 9 years. I'm not quite sure what you're looking for here. Do you just want me to say something specific about whales, fomo, TA or something so we can argue?
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:00:12
too bad you missed the 4 different edited versions he has since made. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:08:34
Major edit to your post, huh? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:28:28
You have to see the irony of that question with your username.

So could you do us all a favor and just go focus on making money then and stop posting here? You're trying to make fun of BitcoinAlways for spending all of his time here and your post history shows that is EXACTLY what YOU do. How sad of a life do you have right now that this is what you spend all of your time doing? I was hoping to check these daily threads every so often and find some actual information like you can on other crypto threads but instead it's just you repeatedly acting like a 10 year old.
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:59:59
He has literally deleted all but 1 comment he made in the last 2 months. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:30:44
How much tax are you going to pay on that?

It's hard to "admit it" because It's wrong and just sounds like you have some personal issues you need to work out. IF this becomes a major issue it can be addressed and changes can and will be made.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:36:16
Yeah, that is actually standard business attire there. And knee high socks.
