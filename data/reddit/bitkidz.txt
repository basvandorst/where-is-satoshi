My sisters and I always use this 1-liner (&lt;140 character tweet): 
 is digital $ that can be used by anyone of any age anywhere in the world at anytime! As easy as sending email or text msg.
To simplify &amp; dumbify itsalwayslulzy's comment, why not something like this:
Bitcoin like email in 4 ways: 
1. it sends money electronically rather than physical mail
2. it cuts the middle man out like banks, credit cards &amp; PayPal -- no more mailman &amp; stamps 
3. Bitcoin is the beginning of an global revolution for money, like email revolutionized mail.  
4. Just like email didn't take over postal mail completely, we're just saying Bitcoin (like email) offers a faster, easier, more secure, MORE FUN, and personalized way of using money today!  
While Bitcoin does show signs of having the ability to dominate fiat--you should leave this out, because it sounds pompous and subjective. 
We can't wait to see the interview, because we're curious &lt;strong&gt;how did you come up with the idea in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;.
Here's some questions we'd love to hear you answer?
1. How long did it take you to make the vanity BTC address?&gt;That was BEYOND brilliant!
2. What kind of response did you expect to get? PR for Bitcoin? To "really" get Bitcoin donations from mom? Does your mom even know what Bitcoin is?
3. So, we read you're married...how old are you? Do you have kids?
We're curious because we wrote earlier..."Brilliant Bitcoin marketer. As kids ourselves, we always believed it was Kids innocence, creativity, and market-demand that will drive mainstream interest into Bitcoin", but if you're not &lt;18yo or &lt;22yo (average college kid) than we're off in our statement.
4. Did people at the game question your "odd sign"?
5. Did you really mean it when you said you'd donate everything over 2.something BTC to SeansOutpost.com? If so, when? Was your wife happy, sad, angry with this decision...it's a difference of $2K vs. surprising $22K+ present?
Okay, my sisters and I are just very curious...again, we think you're brilliant on so many levels!
If you don't have time to answer these questions here before your interview, please PM your answers, so we can post this interview on BitKidz.com as we'd LOVE to have this inspirational post live!

Hmmm...my sister and I can't say we agree with you on why not to spend Bitcoin, as Bitcoin investors, consumers &amp; merchants, but maybe you didn't search the listings too hard, because we noticed a few 50% off, for example ours:
1. Our books are 33% off from amazon's price if purchased with Bitcoin and today we're offering 50% off of that. coupon code: btcblackFriday for 
Our books share a bunch of awesome reasons why Bitcoin should be spent, use, saved, invested, earned, and shared...not "hoarded". 
2. We're actually offering 50% for BlackFriday in general because we're publicity outside the Bitcoin community too, but as a "test", we made this product 50% off for fiat and 75% if bought with Bitcoin. 
 - if you're a small biz owner, author, consultant, it's mommy's Ultimate Online PR Kit - How to create SEO Press Releases and get media attention to your stuff.
3. Donating to a charity doesn't need a discount either. But, if it helps 15% of all our proceeds are going to: 5% SeansOutpost.com 5% TheBitcoinAcademy.com and 5% (during the month of Nov) to the Philippines typhoon victims.
We're going shopping shortly, if we find other 50%+ deals we'll edit this post.
Hope I persuaded you to think differently about today!

Thanks. we're excited about all the possibilities and opportunities we're facing already!
@_date: 2013-09-15 19:04:23
Nice. so do you want to partner on an app?
and, what do you think of contributing to a "bitcoin for kids" book?
@_date: 2013-10-17 02:54:01
This is awesome news! We just made our first order last night on gyft for our "Bitcoin for Kids book 2" which are all tutorials for us to have fun using Bitcoin. We bought Burger King but wanted McD's and Wendy's.
Walmart and Target are definitely on top of our list. But here are some more high on our list:
Westfield. Com because that's everything in the mall who accepts AMEX!
Dollar Tree because what kid doesn't want to spread each dollar we have? 
All discount stores like TJMaxx, Marshall's, Burlington coat factory
Toys R Us
Mommy obviously wants gas and groceries like Kroger's Von's stop and shop
Then amazon too. We know gyft had them already.
Anyways thanks. We just downloaded the app and we'll go shopping tonight.
@_date: 2013-10-18 14:07:13
This is awesome! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:23:41
Thanks. We're still haven't recovered from this major lost. See, we're all co-authors to our books and many blogs. It's easy to work with shared docs, but when you're the originator of that doc we lost all access. Also, she's always in her email, so she'd jot down links, notes, etc. (like private bookmarking) and that was all lost too.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:07:07
We're a Big Hot Sauce Family! Congrats! We just listed you on  ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:57:51
Wow, I just researched a bit more--he went to college for biochemical engineering. So cool.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:47:15
Boom! We agree with much that was said already, but as a recap for possibly a more perfect video:
- Great job taking out the mining explanation.
- Take out $100 value
- + more &amp; more websites, stores worldwide
- It's refreshing to have this dude's accent!
- + divisibility or micropayments = you're $ is worth something - it's not too late (for those thinking $200 = 1BTC means it's too expensive to start)
- change keyword title "what is bitcoin"
- 12 seconds of intro &amp; extro credits (+ funk-e pasted on the video) is a lot of advertising time - cut out the flash &amp; just slide in the credits for 2-3 seconds -remember attention span is short (especially kids) -- no one would watch 1.5 mins in the superbowl or any tv commercial
- crowdfunded superbowl bitcoin infomercial sounds as innovated as bitcoin itself -- brilliant idea! but, cutting this awesome video 1/3 in length will be very hard.

After 5.5 months we finally released what started off as 1 kid's book into 4-book series. 
1. You can download the Primer Free here:  (sold on Amazon $2.99)
2. All 3 books &amp; The Trilogy is sold 33% off Amazon's prices if bought with Bitcoin (via BitPay or Coinbase) on our website 
** We are alpha testers for the BitPay/aMember plugin--it was SO much fun troubleshooting with our shopping cart developers. And, we actually paid the developers to make a Coinbase plugin, because we love having options, and love CB.**
3. 10% of ALL proceeds from our books and blog will be donated to SeansOutpost.com (5%) and TheBitcoinAcademy.com (5%) 
4. For the rest of November 2013, 5% will also be donated to the victims of Philippines typhoon via World Food Programme. My sisters and I are 0.25 Filipino.
5. Our press release already being picked up by 5 news websites in the first 2-hours: 
We got our PR rep so excited, she asked for how to open a BTC wallet and asked that we pay her in BTC! SOOO cool, huh!?
6. Please dear bitcoin-redditors, we kindly ask that you help us with with our BitKidz Movement: To make Bitcoin mainstream one kid at a time! There's so many ways to help, participate in the contest, donate to the Grand Prize BTC wallet, share all our links, get all your kids and families involved on our site!
7. Last but very not least (I wish I could tag each of them) we want a BIG shot out to all the redditors and Bitcoiners who allowed us to interview them and be featured in our books:
Book Primer: Kids Making Money Online
The Bitcoin wife's 3 Bitcoinettes
Common theme by all 12 kids of this book: Bitcoin has changed our lives!
Book 3: Wise Words from the World's Best Bitcoiners (yes, we're biased. ;-)
David Johnston - BitAngels.co
Vitalik Buterin - Bitcoin Mag
Mike Hearn - Infamous BTC developer
Vinny Lingham - Gyft.com - Thanks for the 2nd Prize!!
Paige Freeman - BitPay
Trace Mayer - HowToVanish.com - The Bitcoin Editor to the whole series
Stephanie Murphy, PhD - LetsTalkBitcoin.com
Ken - Coingig.com
Max Wright - SuccessCouncil.com
Our incredible Uncle I.J. for introducing us to the wonderful world of Bitcoin on May 30, 2013--our lives are forever changed!
Last but not least--our highly meticulous Editor: Habeeba Husain!
8. Book 2 outlines all our Tutorials how to have a TON of fun with Bitcoin as kids and parents (as a family)
We added companies above, but add eGifter, BitFash, PizzaForCoins, BitcoinShop.US...of course Gyft!
9. Coinbase + BitPay CS were AWESOME during our development testing period with aMember our online shopping cart
If we missed anyone, we are SO sorry! 
10. More to come! If you're against getting kids into Bitcoin, rather than downvoting this post, we kindly ask that you download the Book Primer and read how Bitcoin has changed the lives of 12 kids ages 9-16 yo from ALL around the world to see that it can be used safely, securely and to do wonderful things, like acts of charity and further our life lessons and academic careers.
11. We firmly believe that in order to make Bitcoin mainstream, kids and moms need to be using this AS currency and this book series is one Big-step towards educating this population to take many more steps forward!
To more Kid Bitcoiners,
JuJu (13), GiGi (12), JoJo (10) and mom Ponn

Thanks. Since we never really took to allowance in our house, it was always a rewards system...with some reprimands of course.
So, we get rewarded for our chores, homeschool work, etc. But, just like every dime counts for all our little efforts, every bit would count here!
We're so curious what happened to this Hackathon! When will something be announced? Winner + group projects...hopefully a team took our project on. If you did, please email us at contact&lt;at&gt;bitkidz.com!
@_date: 2013-10-15 19:29:53
Great article! Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2013-10-03 09:43:45
Yahoo, hotmail and gmail didn't make a kid-version and we don't know any kids without email.
My sisters and I agree with Plazmotech.
We made a tutorial for blockchain, and JoJo (10 yo) is the only one who uses the blockchain android app on my mom's phone, even though we each have our own blockchain wallets.
Also, we got our first wallet with coinbase, so when we opened blockchain that was fast, easy and kid-comprehendable.
Also, saving for a trip is a big responsibility and goal, adults show treat it as one to keep the girls motivated for the right reason.
Last, being girls--we really hate the idea of making something pink just for girls. No wonder girls are so underrepresented in STEM/Science, Tech, Engineering and Math.

Presently in its 2nd Edition, we just added 5 more kids:
The Bees Brothers &amp; their 7 yo sister
9 year old Andrew the Bitcoin Wonderbracelet Kid
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:43:53
Thanks we'll look into both (gyft &amp; egifter) more closely.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:15:37
Congrats! 
This story is like the 12 kids in our "Kids Making Money Online" book, aged 9-17yo making $1000s! A 12 yo has over 50 BTC to his name, after cashing out 50 for $5000. The book is free here: 
Kids can also enter to win 0.25 BTC + $50 Gyft.com card until tomorrow night here 
BitKidz.com is on a mission to make Bitcoin mainstream 1 Kid at a time -- NOT solely by investing, but we're driving the market by buying, spending, and selecting to invest in bitcoin startups, businesses and their own Bitcoin biz...AND saving some--not hoarding like the bulls in this market. 
Us kids are much more realistic than some downvoters claim us to be. We're not driven by emotions, we're driven by 'educated value' and 'innocent fun'...besides Bitcoin, 99% (my own high percentage to make a point) kids USE and spend $, and SAVE until we can get what we want.
Only now with vehicles like Bitcoin, are kids starting to think and be able to invest long-term like my sisters and I are thinking college, cars, and maintaining our debt-free life. 
Paxtan &amp; Roushk, We'd love to add you to our book! We're already making an update from 12 kids to 15 and planning on another big launch in 1-2 weeks. PM us for the interview questions.

There's some really cool things in Science! We listed her on  for family-friendly Bitcoin shopping.
We're huge into STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering &amp; Math) check out

Hi Pokemann.
1. You can get a free copy of our Bitcoin for Kids Book Primer "Kids Making Money Online - 12 Inspirational Stories That will Motivate You To Action!" at  All of us are aged 9 - 17 yo from the U.S., U.K., Netherlands &amp; Australia and the  thing we all had in common was "Bitcoin Changed Our Lives" not just monetarily--but in academics, business savvy, computer and app development, tons of STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering &amp; Math) and life lessons like money mgmt, international financial markets, budgeting vs. spending, investing vs. saving, etc. [$2.99 on Amazon] - Read this book with them!
2. PM me your email and I can give you review copies of the Book Trilogy. Book 1: Basics of Bitcoin, Book 2: Step by Step Tutorials--FUN! Book 3: Interviews with some of the world's most well-known Bitcoiners, like Vinny Lingham CEO of Gyft.com, Bitcoin Developer Mike Hearn, Trace Mayer, JD served as our Bitcoin Editor
3. Oh, I forgot...you can subscribe to get a Bonus Gift of FREE 2-cents of Bitcoin for each book you own. You can open a Blockchain wallet by our tutorial here:  The voice is my 12 yo sister GiGi
4. Sit with your parents and walk through  - Stanford Univ. Bitcoin Group developed this AWESOME must-us website. You open a Btc wallet get 3-cents, can give 1-cent to a Bitcoin charity, then transfer to your new Coinbase wallet. We did a run-through and it only takes less than 3-minutes to go through all the steps--their ocelot mascot is adorable and very family-friendly.
5. I wouldn't recommend meeting someone via LocalBitcoins.com, we recommend and have a tutorial in Book 2 doing a local bank deposit with a highly-ranked localbitcoins.com seller. But, I don't think you're parents are at this stage yet...try all the FUN, educational things above first.
6. While still young, have your parents check out  this is mom's site "Family-Friendly Bitcoin Shopping"...when we started with Bitcoin 6-months ago, there were not a lot to buy with Bitcoin, and tons of sites not family-friendly, but now the market is SO much cleaner. We moderate all listings on this site.
7. My sisters and I are going to start making Google Hangouts Live for open Q&amp;A, video tutorials of each one in our book, so people (especially parents) can see that kids/girls are safely, securely having fun earning, using &amp; learning from Bitcoin. 
My mom, sisters and I are willing to do a private Google-Hangout, skype chat with you and your parents to answer any questions you may have--they may be more receptive because we're kids with a mom. I'm 13 and my sisters are 12 &amp; 10. 
Last, can you ask what does your priest have against Bitcoin, this is the first time we ever heard of something like this. We actually share how CHARITABLE the Bitcoin community is--like all the tips you got just for writing this...we believe Bitcoin is the root of all charity, whereas fiat money is the root of all evil. 
Last, why wait for Christmas? Share some of the tips you got with your parents and gift them a present now. ;-)
@_date: 2013-09-28 18:44:55
CONGRATS! That's awesome news! 
We've been using your board to get our cousin ready for her first "forhire" post. We're making her online portfolio/website right now so it's so cool to know that you're getting so many eyes on this sub-reddit!
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:12:26
OMG! These are the COOLEST things EVER! I need to get all of them! Unfortunately, we're traveling overseas right now, and I don't think our POBox will hold them well. ;-)
We'll wait til we get home to make a huge order!
We pinned you on Pinterest and listed on  to help spread the news! 
BTW, your coupon code rocks! Wish we could've been as classic as you...ours is a boring "btcblackfriday" ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-03 10:04:13
WOW! All great ideas below!
Here are my sisters and my thoughts:
1. charity - definitely.
2. Love, love the idea of sharing/educating - since we're months behind schedule, we just talked to mom and set our goal of launching our "Bitcoin for Kids" book series that day! We have a free report to give away, which will be our gift. 
3. Satoshi Forest camp out--cool idea! Something on Let's Talk Bitcoin--perfect timing!
4. Major newspaper spread is cool, or even better: everyone planning an event, should send a press release online, and local news, at least 1 week before Nov. 1st, so the media can contact each of us and cover our stories. News reports are always better than ad-space. Unless, a company uses ad space as advertorial along side promoting their company.
This is what we're planning to do. 
Selfless plug for mommy: Don't know how to write a seo press release mommy is a master. Check her out here:  While it sells for $47USD, we use aMember-BitPay plugin to sell for BTC ($7USD).
5. Giving us some bitcoin, always a great idea. LOL! ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:49:02
Gorgeous pieces of art! My sisters and I LOVE your mom's studio - playground! We just listed her on our family-friendly bitcoin shopping site 
Yes, for Coinbase, just scroll to "Advanced options" and you can request email and shipping information. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:20:02
This is a HUGE Bitcoin Success Story worth celebrating! 
No one can ever doubt how much a little bit of food, a little bit of support, and a little bit of belief can offer any one person--let alone 3. 
This is such an inspiring story that the Bitcoin community should be very proud of!
My sisters and I are so proud that we made our first Bitcoin donation to Sean's Outpost, and we'll continue to support more regularly, since as of today (5th Anniversary) we decided to give 5% of any of our profits from our site and books to this worthy organization.
Congrats Mr. Jason &amp; family! You've proven to be a huge role model not only to these men, but to our whole community!
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:40:31
Awesome job! As for your classmate, my sisters and I immediately remembered when our youngest sisterd lost her email account...it was devastating for all of us!
Email is not physical or tangible but have a TON of value! We do our homeschooling projects, our blogposts, books, research, attachments, contacts, etc...like our cloud storage. 
And, of course, PayPal. Are you "physically" touching your $ when you get paid or buy something online? No!
Curious what your reply was--or, did you just walk off happily in triumph with all the new Bitcoin believers asking how to get started!? :-)

we'll take this as a big compliment, but my sisters and I did write all the blogposts. ;-)
we starting making audio tutorials which are getting transcibed for our books now

ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL!!!!
Got a loud "Hah!" in reading this. :-D
We explain this in our opening chapter of Book 1: Bitcoin for Kids book series. 
My sisters and I now 13, 12 and 10 yo, and look into the future 2032 and we talk about what Bitcoin DID to us: debt-freedom (mortgages &amp; student loans), and so many social problems become things of the past.
@_date: 2013-09-15 13:14:54
My sisters and I are 13, 12 and 10 years old. Here's our Bitcoin Kids website:  and our mom's is 
We've been writing our "Bitcoin for Kids" book series. We have 3 in the works, check out the titles and book covers here: 
TheBitcoinAcademy just contacted us to use our books in their pilot public school program, so we're rushing to finish them now even though we're overseas with limited electricity and Internet.
My sisters and I are all kindle best selling authors to nearly a dozen books now, so this book series is very important to us. We interviewed nearly a dozen well known Bitcoiners in the world, like BitPay, BitAngels, Coindesk, LetsTalkBitcoin, Bitcoin Mag,  Coingig, . Book 1: intro. Book 2: all our tutorials Book 3: Interviews.
We've recorded audio tutorials on Soundcloud here and getting them transcribed for our books now. 
My sisters and I have been professional bloggers since 2009 though I've been blogging privately with my mom since I was 5 yo. We created our first video curriculum and sold almost 100 memberships since the winter, but haven't promoted it much now that we're accepting Bitcoin via BitPay: 
My sisters and I own and manage over dozen websites and blogs and I designed all of them. so, Plazmotech, we'd LOVE to partner with you.
We have 2 great ideas for Bitcoin games/apps, and some angels investors love 1 more than the other, but we wanted to make a small program first without any investors and they encouraged us to find kids to partner with and do it ourselves too. We'd love to partner with Boelens too. 
I started making a design portfolio site with some of my examples here:  but like the carpenter who has a leaky roof, I'm busy working on sites and clients rather than my own ;-)
We obviously know WordPress, html and basic PHP, we started learning Visual Basic. we were thinking of just using gamesalad to get something up and running, but we need to us a merchant account to do the btc&gt;usd conversion, we have merchant accounts with coinbase and bitpay.
I know I'm missing some things but my sisters and I are SOOO excited about this thread.
Here's an idea for everyone: How about Book 4 "Bitcoin for Kids: How Kids Are Using Bitcoin Today".
You can share your stories, experiences, we'll send some basic interview questions to get you started.
Anyone interested, just drop us a line and email us anytime contact&lt;at&gt;bitkidz.com
BTW, I'm JuJu (2000). My sisters are GiGi (2001) and JoJo (2003).
Here's more about us here

This book was made possible by this awesome Bitcoin subreddit community! We wanted to release the full Trilogy today Nov. 1st - 5th Anniversary goal, but we ran into some technical problems, like no Internet for 4-day. 
However, we were able to successfully publish on Amazon  for $2.99 and make it FREE on our website.
We're extremely proud of this book, and if you decide to download the free copy, we kindly ask that you review our book on Amazon, in just a few hours it's already on 3 Bestseller Lists. So, every review helps! 
Stay posted, the full Trilogy should be completed next week, it's with our Editor now.
@_date: 2013-10-03 09:45:56
Funny and not-so-funny story. 
Did you ever find it? Can we share this story in our Bitcoin for Kids book series? PMing you now.
@_date: 2013-10-16 22:01:42
Oh my gosh! This is friggin' brilliant! And I got mom's permission to say that.
This is totally kid friendly! Every kid can't wait to get their first CRedit card... But since we started learning about Bitcoin we knew there would be A better option for us... And this is! My sisters and I can't wait to get or hands on our own coinkites!
@_date: 2013-10-16 22:15:59
Btw. We totally know it's a debit card which is the only things out family uses (cash) that's why this is so much better. I was waiting for my 13th birthday to finally get my student PayPal account but it was a master card debit card with fees so we decided against it. We already started working with Bitcoin by then so we knew some one brilliant like you guys would make something much better available. We'll PM or email now. When will they be released? And what cities will have merchants with the terminals?
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:33:44
Love witcoins! The downvoters are old farts, you cashed out what you put it--what an amazing story! My sisters and I are inspired by this post...we're so against hoarding. "Savings" is one-thing, but for witcoins to thrive it must be used for its intended purposes: Money! 
I have 2.5 years to drive--it'd be AWESOME to cash out for my own car...and still pay for college myself!
BTW: LOVE your craigslist posting--will take the equivalent in b/witcoins.

You should be proud! We're so proud of him and we just met you over a reddit post!
This is why kids can/should/will be the best advocates for Bitcoin adoption, because we can talk in simple words...we can make it fun! 
We totally LOVE his wonder bracelets and can't wait for the next batch--we already know which ones we want!
Looks like Andrew is putting YOU to work now! :-D
BTW, we just listed his site on mom's family-friendly Bitcoin shopping site

We have tutorials how to send BTC via SMS through both Blockchain and Coinbase in Book 2 for "Bitcoin for Kids" amongst many other cool things to do with Bitcoin. 
We wrote about coinapult, but didn't do a tutorial yet. Here are the books 
We're slowly putting each tutorial on our blog with either audios or video files too. Yesterday we put the "open blockchain wallet' for our PR rep who wrote our press release and asked to be paid via BTC after learning about it from us! here's this one tutorial

Don't forget Mr. Vinny donated the 2nd prize of $50 Gyft card to our 0.25 Bitcoin giveaway contest: 
EDIT: We just got Gyft's email announcement with the # of points we earned. When we read more, we're excited to see 1% points for credit card purchases, 2% when bought with PayPal and 3% for purchases with Bitcoin! YAY-us!

We really want our BitPiggy Bitcoin wallet and allowance tracker app - built on coinbase api. It should be very easy like eGifter.com and be the Bitcoin version of virtualpiggy.com
There's 4 things to do with btc: save spend share (charity) and selection (invest in biz, Entrepreneurs or their own startup)
Parents and kids have their own wallets but a whole family is connected. Parents can give a set weekly amount or they can give a bit/point system for all the chores accomplished the weekly bits are calculated and given to the appropriate kid.
Also there a special occasion option like during holidays, report cards, etc.
Kids can spend with other Coinbase api clients like eGifter and there will be a page for the BitKidz.com store. All our Bitcoin for Kids books that we sell with Coinbase. Ideally we'd love to have our blog and forum easy to login to and link to a markets page like market.blockchain.info so kids can watch their savings vary in value across multiple btc exchanges.
The developers could have a nice credits page too ;-)
This is our first public post about our project we've been researching and mapping out since Feb 2013 so hopefully developers will build upon our idea and not steal it. After all we're kids and my sisters, mom and I wanted this for more ease and convenience. We think many families can easily get into Bitcoin with little bits at a time instead of thinking only buying  1btc.
Last, it'd be ideal to have a web based app like virtualpiggy.com 
We really hope a team will take up our project because we think you'd definitely win!
Obviously android first but all os eventually.

We tried not to take anything personally because you left such a short impersonal reply. 
Thanks so much. No need to be jealous honestly we're nowbere where we want to be when it comes to programming so we're quite envious of your skills,abilities and accomplishments!
However mom always remind us in business that great partnerships and collaborations are made when everyone compliments one another by bringing new skill sets and ideas to the table. Our goal is to bring btc to the masses and we totally believe getting kids involved with btc is what will make it mainstream. While mom's control 80%+ of all household spending the majority of it is controlled by the kids' desires, needs and influence.
I just wrote a long pm with our 2 ideas. Unfortunately we don't know what kind of apps can be developed with all the languages you know...but w e know we're on to something in the right direction!
Since we're traveling all of our blogs are on hiatus and all client work is on hold. Our btc books and kindle sales are our only priority now. Looking forward to your email.

We successfully used the tutorial on  to use Virwox.com Virtual World exchange. Even with the fees of exchanging PayPal USD to SLL (Second Life Lindens - virtual gold) then SLL to BTC, the particular day we bought it was lower than the average rate of BTC-USD exchange, so we were happy. It was easy.

Anyone else wanna join?

My sisters and I totally think kids should be educated and marketed to for bitcoin. the market will only mature once moms and kids start owning and spending the $.
Moms control over 80% of all household spending, BUT the kids influence how moms spend that $. The minute our uncle told us about bitcoin, we were determined to get as many kids interested as possible, hence our bitkidz.com and  book series coming out. BTCbootcamp and the Bitcoin Academy will be using our books for their curriculum.
We have 2 fab ideas for mobile apps using btc for in-purchase apps and how to use btc, but we're not advanced programmers yet. BTC angel investors love one of our ideas, but they even encouraged us to do it ourselves -- by kids for kids thing.
Last, our lives have changed with growth in knowledge, skills, relationships, opportunities, and $ since we learned about bitcoin, and we do believe its the currency of our generation. Kids have SOOOO much to gain for getting in the market NOW.
PS. We even launched  to protect family-friendly btc spending. to help the market mature we need to promote, show-off the every day usage and purchases of bitcoin. Right?

Hi! I'm JuJu, the oldest of my sisters. I'm 13, GiGi is 12 and JoJo is 10. We own and blog on BitKidz.com, and writing the book series with our mom. 
We have interview questions ready for 5-10 kids who are actively using Bitcoin for our Special Report that will give for free as a introduction to our book series. 
You can PM me if you're interested in being published, or email me at contact&lt;at&gt;bitkidz.com. It's first-come first-published. So, the faster you email us a completed survey, you'll be the first ones in the book.

On the home page:
"Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, is a non-profit and we rely on donations and grants. If everyone reading this gave $3, we would only have to fundraise 1 day a year. Donate today."
So, we tweeted and emailed them to get their attention, saying we'd donate if they accept Bitcoin.

Not sure how to do it via Gyft, but we'll try to figure it out now, since we're definitely going to buy some with the 4% points for  
We use  to give giftcards. In the app and website you can "Gift a friend". They have $15 off $500 purchases of cards for Bitcoin Black Friday. The cool thing with this is you get to 'gift' someone and choose to make it a public gift via social media, like FB, and others can add to the giftcard for I believe 7-days.
Happy BBF Shopping!
