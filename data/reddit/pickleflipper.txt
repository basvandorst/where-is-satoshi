No...no it's not.  They are attempting to subvert open source money.

I"m not saying the history is idyllic.  I'm saying that if money can't be easily replaced when stolen, people will more readily kill if you take it from them or attempt to devalue it.  I'm also saying this is a very good thing.
Evil isn't just murder.

You're not fucking fooling anyone with this shit.  I truly hope you die.

This is the true goal of coin validation.  Make no mistake about it.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:52:48
IT"S NOT A FUCKING JOKE.  IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO BECOME A NEW CENTRAL BANK AND DESTROY OPEN SOURCE MONEY!!
I REALLY WANT ALL OF THEM TO DIE!! 
GET IT!!
DON'T FUCKING PLAY AROUND WITH THIS SHIT!!!
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:04:14
It doesn't matter.  I truly hope the coinvalidation folks are killed for their actions.  I am hoping that day will come soon and am ready to celebrate it.

It's not an idle threat.  Money that can't be easily replaced is as valuable to people as their health in many cases because in many cases it literally means their health.
You do the math.

No YOU DO NOT.  It's far less evil for a few people trying to destroy a currency of freedom to be killed than for that currency to be subverted, become the standard and billions of people continue to be enslaved by the .01 percent...not the 1 percent.
If you KNOW how evil our current system is and the millions upon millions of soldiers and innocent families slaughtered because of it and you still consent to standing by and letting the answer slip through our grasp then when have different moral priorities altogether.

They can screw over the US citizens by closing the exchanges unfortunately.

Hmm...start off as a "voluntary" registration service.  Get accepted by everyone and become a standard.  Next step, create policies behind closed doors to only validate coins of your choosing once it's a de facto standard.
Great plan.  Most people are stupid enough to go along with it too.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:34:56
I'm sorry.  I hope they die.  I hope someone kills them.   I'm not going to do it but I can hope it happens.
You don't seem to understand the gravity of the situation.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:37:46
That's ok, I'll be the first to slice your throat if you steal my money.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:00:26
Good point!
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:46:36
I hope you are murdered.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:06:09
IT'S NOT A FUCKING JOKE!
