But the same could be said for horses in 1880. Their lives had gotten progressively better overall for hundreds of years under humanity's care. Technology in stirrups and horseshoes and saddles and plows, as well as improved diets and veterinary care had made their lives better. 
Then, wham, out of no where comes the internal combustion engine. And it took virtually all of the jobs horses had previously occupied. Fast forward to today, and there are very few jobs for horses, and very few horses in general (as compared to 100 years ago).
Except now we're the horses, and automation has the potential to completely replace vast swathes of the human job market.

Right. 
But if I am looking for information about bitcoin, and it gives me it's next best guess as to what I'm asking for because it doesn't recognize the input 'bitcoin', it's next best guess might be the correct output by the software's standards - it thinks that's what I want! The software is working correctly! 
But the information is wrong. So it's wrong.

I went to Afghanistan twice, and never thought about this before! 
Screw waiting in line for the pay clerk who only comes to your base once every 3-9 months. 
I wish I'd had bitcoin in 2007 lol

That notice just disappeared off of my account. It's gone, now. Anyone else?

I think, for bitcointip to work, both individuals have to have an account. Then, once you deposit bitcoins into your account on the bitcointip site, you are able to comment with the code, which the bot picks up, and transfers coins from the account you have linked on your account, to the one linked on the other redditor's account. 
I'm not 100% positive. I haven't done it, so I could be wrong.

"Well, I was just sort of asking people on Twitter and Googling it." 
"Well how else would you?"
"Well, I've gone onto Reddit!" *Grin*
Well played, sir. Well played.

Right, but the point is that eventually the hoarders become smaller and smaller, because they spent some of their coins. This spending leads to volatility, like you said, but as a result of the transaction their coins are in the hands of multiple people, instead of just one. When lots of people hold smaller amounts, and you don't have hoarders saturating the market anymore, then the price will stabilize. 


You're making two poor assumptions, here. First, you're assuming that the volatility will last forever - I, and many others, have already explained how the volatility decreases over time, stabilizing the currency. Second, you're assuming that 'government backing' means something. What does that mean? What are they 'backing' the currency with? Nothing. It's not backed by any good or commodity - it's fiat. The fact that there will only be a finite number of bitcoin means that it is a better store of value than fiat currency. See Zimbabwe, and let me know how trustworthy 'government backed' currency is.
 &gt;It's only value is that people keep thinking that. What happens when they stop? Beanie Babies used to be considered a storage of value.
Here again, you're describing the same problem that all fiat currencies have - they only have value because people believe them to have value. The dollar is no different. What happens when people stop considering bitcoin valuable? Then it is not valuable. But the fact that bitcoin - at the very least - can facilitate instant money transfer to anyone in the world, while circumventing banks and bank transaction fees - is enough of a use for many others, and myself, to imagine them as valuable.

Right. 
I understand completely what you're saying. Because WolframAlpha isn't programmed to understand the input 'bitcoin', and so it's using the absolutely most likely information it DOES understand and producing that information. And, in doing so, the program is working absolutely, 100% correctly. It's doing it's job! Yes! I got it. 
But I think you're missing my point entirely. 
Did WolframAlpha output information even remotely related to 'bitcoin'? No. It did not. It produced the absolute closest thing it could to the input of the characters 'bitcoin' - but that is NOT the desired result. It is NOT the information that was being looked for. 
And so, I think, your system for comprehending things which are abstract, or philosophically different than that which you are traditionally used to comprehending, is lacking. This whole time I've been so specific - so literal - that the input 'bitcoin' did not produce any information related to 'bitcoin', but it did spit out something else.
It spit out 12.5 cents. 1 US bit. And, for all intents and purposes, that information is useless. It's not correct. WolframAlpha might have COMPUTED the information absolutely correctly - but the INFORMATION it produces, in this case, is not right. Its just plain wrong. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:07:19
I should start off by saying - I like this discussion! :-)
But, in the world I live in, the interpretation of 'bitcoin' is not 'one US bit'. 'One US bit' is not the correct information. Therefore, the information provided is wrong. This isn't a moral dichotomy - we aren't arguing shades of gray. 
2+2=4 --- If Wolfram Alpha says that 2+2=5, it is wrong. It very well could be the result of a misinterpretation of the inputs. It may not recognize the characters correctly - maybe it hasn't been programmed correctly, yet. 
But 2+2=4 means something, whether the computer recognizes that or not.
And that doesn't excuse the fact that 2+2=5 is wrong.

If I call a 'dolphin' a 'fish', because it's the next best thing, that makes me wrong. Ignorant, sure. You could argue I was mistaken, or misinformed. But still wrong.
