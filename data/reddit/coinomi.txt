We are very sorry to hear that.
The exchange service is powered by shapeshift.io so for exchange issues you have to contact with shapeshift's support team through the link:
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:51:08
Thank you so much :) You will be glad to know that we just added support for 200 tokens: 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:07:07
It used to be OSS so you'll still see references here and there. You should never make market decisions based on search engines' meta tags. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:01:57
As we mentioned above, we have been around since 2014 and no user wallet was ever hacked or otherwise compromised. That should be enough trust to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:43:47
That is correct.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:10:54
Well we are not your servants either. Either trust, appreciate and enjoy this great wallet you are provided for FREE or build your own. It's a free world after all.

Do you trust Ledger hardware wallet (just a random example)? What other crypto wallets apart from bitcoin core have deployed deterministic builds, and how many of them are mobile-first and are being distributed mainly by Play Store or App Store? As for the offline part we'll put together a how to guide one of these days. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:10:38
The same applies to Coinomi, you can chose to keep it on an off-line device. Coinomi also doesn't come from some anonymous group, we are a registered company in the UK and both founders are great open-source contributors. Coinomi is a security-first wallet and numbers don't lie: ZERO wallets hacked or compromised since 2014's v1. The open source is only useful if you inspect all code line by line and build it yourself, otherwise it doesn't contribute towards a more secure environment for your coins. Coinomi never holds your keys so it can't be or considered to be a custodian for your funds.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:59:02
Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:38:01
No, it's not.
"The source code will be available for all the non secure (STM32) part and some of the secure (ST31) part. Ultimately it'll be available for most of the ST31 with a minimal binary blob implementing the chip functionalities only available under NDA."
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:16:13
Paranoid users are not really our target audience. On top of that, if a user would know how to compile the project why would they use the APK they downloaded and not the one they just created? As we said, Play Store / App Store are not ready for this kind of distribution methods. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:47:54
You can use another wallet if you're not happy with Coinomi. Or you can compile the version we have on our public repo and run it yourself. Thankfully enough the world understands the *hard* work we've put into building this wallet and doesn't really care if it's OSS or not. Numbers don't lie and number say that ZERO Coinomi wallets (from the hundreds of thousands of funded copies) have ever been hacked.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:15:56


So based on what you say we assume you have never put your money on any exchange nor willing to do so, correct?
We don't need your sympathy, we need you to stop throwing unfounded accusations and trying to dictate this conversation by imposing the victim while in reality your writing relates to that of a sophomoric and a fanatic. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:20:34
Yeah, maybe the "use with caution" part was unnecessary as we didn't make any claim that our wallet is OSS. People will continue to get scammed but we will have done everything to our power to protect them and the way we see it this is the ethical thing to do, we deny to facilitate any more scams with our product.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:09:38
What other truly multi-asset wallets other than Uberpay which is a poor, unlicensed code of an older version of Coinomi and Jaxx that has only parts of the code open? Coinomi supports 79 blockchains and 200 tokens, so it's the fraudsters' first choice. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:55:25
No we're not. And FYI the source code for the ShapeShift integration is public in our repository.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:43:51
That is correct.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:05:08
Your balance shouldn't be zero. Did you follow the instructions? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:03:20
We don't need an excuse to close our source, this is what you fail to understand, it's a business decision we took after lots of thinking. Our website says "source available" which is totally different from "open source". Every change we made was public so there's nothing shady about it. You can still chose to compile the older, open-source version and run it yourself if you believe that you cannot trust the closed-source version, same as you probably did with Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex, Cryptopia, Yobit and who knows what other services that unlike Coinomi hold your keys but we don't see anyone complaining there.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:42:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:17:04
No but we're working on it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:02:34
Thanks for using Coinomi :) 
Detailed instructions on how to collect your free BCH: 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:46:35
Coinomi NEVER holds your keys, contrary to all Exchanges, Banks and so many other services you DEFINITELY have used but couldn't complain. Sad, sad, sad.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:06:23
Same as Coinomi, that is. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:56:11
Oh, whatever. 
We didn't make any such claim = recently, after the changes were put in motion. Before that, of course we did.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:07:00
Changelly will be added soon
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:04:21
Even with the source you can't know if the binary that you downloaded from Play Store is the compiled version of the source code you reviewed, so it all comes down to whether you trust Coinomi with the hundreds of thousands of funded copies and ZERO wallets hacked or compromised, ever.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:02:18
No, let's not leave it at that. Give us an example of deterministic builds delivered over Play Store. You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. We never lied, it's you who doesn't have a single clue about delivering deterministic-built enterprise apps.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:43:21
BTW thank you for summing up the reasons that led us to that decision. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:23:06
Nothing guarantees that the binary was built from the compilation of the open code. So it's really a matter of whether you trust the development team behind it, no?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:19:49
We never took the time to thank you for this free publicity :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:17:42
Thank you for recommending Coinomi, we are also big fans of Samourai. We are going to make a public ANN to set things straight.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:00:25
Neither are hardware wallets BTW. There is a delay indeed in pushing the latest code and this is to protect the users from fraudsters who clone our wallet to steal users' funds. FWIW, no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked since 2014 when v1 was released.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:51:34

You trust both with your coins, and that's the whole point of this thread, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:21:43
Thank you so much for taking the time write down a full review! We will put under consideration all the improvements you proposed, thank you :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:11:53
Thanks for your comments. Sorry to see that you won't be using Coinomi. Good luck with the alternative clients.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:34:42
is not == used to be, which part of that you don't get?
And it's OK if you don't want to recommend our wallet any longer, our hundreds of thousands of happy users will. We made it that far, nothing can stop us now.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:19:22
We will add that option soon :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:16:04
What is worse than people who understand the risks involved in using closed-source software is people who are preaching over the security benefits gained by open-source software, misleading the less technical users who by definition find it hard to understand that even with an open-source repository nothing guarantees that the binary they installed is the compiled output of that very same code that resides on the repository. As for the charges part, we would suggest you read over our EULA.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:40:48
We must be awful planners, as we performed these changes on  Nov 2, 2016 and still didn't run this exit scam. Shame on us! :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:12:08
You always have the choice to compile the github version yourself and run it. As for the "bare-minimum security" comment you made it's far from the truth, Coinomi is a security-first wallet and our track record only proves that.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:09:26
That's what we call a great attitude. We need more users like you :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:14:02
The two chains will get separated only after the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:05:07
See how many shills downvote our replies here (and everywhere else on Reddit, even when we make a simple ANN). This is proof that we're doing something right.

We also hate to have our source close but we just couldn't allow to have our app cloned all the time by fraudsters with users being stolen off their life savings. If you can suggest a better solution we would love to hear it.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:04:56
We already do that for existing users but the real problem has always been non-Coinomi users who get scammed by fraudulent clones.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:24:12

We respect your opinion, but speaking of unprofessionalism, the way these two "researchers" never opened a ticket with our Support (which is the only formal way of reaching to us) and then "put pressure" on our team could have disastrous results and cause loss of funds.

It is repulsive because the facts are severely twisted and the timeline of events is seriously misrepresented and anyone can see that's it's just a desperate cry for attention. As to our "denial", there's nothing to admit really, our wallet uses SSL. Thank you for your input anyway.

Coinomi HD wallet is open-source with all keys being held on the client and supports 45 coins and 3 testnets with many more coins such as Monero, Ripple, ZCash and others to be added soon. It's currently available for Android with the desktop editions for Windows, Linux and MacOs being put to the test as we speak and iOS coming soon.

Of course, you can set custom tx fees for all coins via Settings. This might also be useful:

Coinbase is an online wallet. Coinomi isn't. So even if someone would hack us they wouldn't be able to steal a single satoshi from our users (or from us, for what it's worth)

Great question. Coinomi is a security-first wallet, it has been around since 2014 and no wallet was ever hacked or otherwise compromised and no one from its hundreds of thousands of happy users has ever lost funds with it because there was something wrong with the wallet.
