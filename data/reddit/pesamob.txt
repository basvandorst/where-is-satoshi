Paypal is adopting new procedures later in November 
See 
A change in policy
PayPal recently decided to update the PayPal User Agreement when it comes to digital goods. These changes will become active on November 18, 2014. The specific part of this policy update that pertains to bitcoin can be seen below:
“Clause 7.3 (“Ineligible Items”) of the PayPal User Agreement will be amended as follows:
7.3 Ineligible Items. PayPal Buyer Protection only applies to PayPal payments for certain tangible, physical goods. Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:
    Intangible items, including Digital Goods (subject to exceptions as listed in Section 7.6
    Services
    Real estate
    Businesses (when you buy a business)
    Vehicles, including motorcycles, caravans, aircrafts and boats
    Custom made items with SNAD issues
    Travel tickets, including airline flight tickets
    Items that violate PayPal’s Acceptable Use Policy
    Purchases made on eBay that violate eBay’s Prohibited or Restricted Items Policy
    Items which you collect in person, or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including at a retail point of sale
    Industrial machinery used in manufacturing
    Items equivalent to cash, including prepaid or gift cards
    Personal Payments”
Due to the fact that the above changes to their user agreement did not specifically mention bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, or digital currencies of any kind, I reached out to PayPal for further clarification on this issue. A PayPal spokesperson responded, “The PayPal buyer protections only apply to physical goods and do not cover digital items, which would include crypto currencies like Bitcoin.” In other words, these updated terms do remove PayPal Buyer Protection from sales of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

$0.0108695 = 1 kshs.

In the Video, it is pointed out that MOST people would want to get more and therefore they would go out and look for more BUT on the whole this sounds very much like socialism. You are right to say that UNLESS the basic prices were controlled, they would shoot up anyway and render the income worthless!
Capitalism has to be dealt with for this system to work since you can NOT have it and still control prices.
Although, now that robots are producing almost everything in very large quantities at very low prices, if they continued to do just that and the supply was kept to equal demand...... prices would not rise?
What do you say?

Is the Secret Ballot really the Solution to most of our problems that result from Corruption? 
How can CryptoCurrency be used to stem the corruption brought about by Vote buying in Congress/parliament ALL over the World?
A solution to this menace is urgently required.

In most developed countries, robots are taking over most jobs and rendering many unemployed.
These robots produce so much more at a much higher quality than the workers did.
The thing is, people are jobless because their jobs have been taken up by robots.
Is IT then NOT time to offer these people a guaranteed minimum income? After all, there is greater wealth - distribution is the problem.
What do you say?

Personally I DO NOT agree!
When I sell Bitcoin to someone, my address will show that the Bitcoin has moved from my Wallet to the buyers Wallet!
This is VERY easy to confirm or even automate.
As long as the charge back is removed, BITCOIN should be the safest item to sell through paypal!
When both Wallets show an actual transaction - HOW is it then one can claim fraud?

Many times - one listens to people speak and wonders .... WHY ....WHY can they NOT see the major advantages of  To one it appears so obvious why ALL should adopt Bitcoin BUT to 99.99%, Bitcoin is still a mystery.
What are you - a Bitcoin User - doing to spread the Bitcoin Gospel knowing fully well that IF YOU do not help spread the Bitcoin Gospel, no one else will.
Bitcoin is NOT a company - there is really NO true Bitcoin entity that is going to promote its use.
That Onus is on us - You and I!
What are you doing about it? A user base of just about 6million out of a possible over 5Billion is a drop in a bucket!
