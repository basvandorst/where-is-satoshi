That an edit war a month ago resulted in a sock puppet being blocked?

Not if you wrap your transactions with the appropriate automation, e.g. a plugin to your accounting software.

They wouldn't, and so the merchant reduces the risk of having to deal with such people.

Most people people buy PCs with their operating systems pre-installed.

I was browsing Tor one day and found a site with a bitcoin address asking for donations towards Islamist organisations, so there's that going at least.

I didn't cover this, but yes, carding gift cards then laundering them is a popular method.
That said Amazon's anti fraud tech is notoriously robust.

Clearly the important issue :)

Pretty much
@_date: 2015-11-15 18:02:40
I don't know, it appears pretty similar to blockchain.info in that it won't track more than a single transaction back usefully.
@_date: 2015-10-02 18:08:12
A well informed and pragmatic approach, I'll admit I'm surprised.
@_date: 2015-11-15 21:43:36
Again, only does a single transaction view.

@_date: 2016-07-02 16:29:33
I track these pages and many others on Wikipedia. If they are 'controlled' by various interests I would like examples so I can go out them and sort things out.
Otherwise such complaints are useless.

I'm just getting into things, but I'm going to disagree with it being easy obtain.
To use the analogy of Linux, there are lots of different ways to do things, with pros and cons, and little end to end support in the whole process. This means there is a high barrier for entry as one explores the options, understands some risks and chooses an avenue to go down. Once there is that base knowledge, yes obtaining bitcoins is fairly easy, but you can't ignore this.
Again, your point about difficulty of use assumes a knowledge of the different levels of anonymity available, knowledge of where and how to safely use bitcoins, and yes once you know that it's not difficult to use - but these are still barriers to most people.
It is not lazy for people too look at the market and to say 'it looks too complicated for me right now' - that's a failure of the market, not the people IMO.

Stores like M&amp;S have this for under £15, I use this all the time. In London, it seems about one in three pubs allow you to pay for your (&lt;£15) drinks contactless which is nice. It is however a risk if you open a tab with a contactless card as it can so easily be charged.

Your username is incorrect!
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:36:24
Well they are credits against the blockchain :/
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:38:49
Over in the UK we have 'touch to pay', you press your card against the reader and instantly pay for your purchase. BUT this is only valid for purchases less than £15 to reflect the inherent reduced security.
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:43:59
I was using credit = ownership
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:59:37


That should be fore transactions lower than a certain amount though.
@_date: 2013-06-22 10:11:41
Or the mods could verify them and add a flair :/

Can you tell them to add this info to their page about site blocking? They're pretty transparent otherwise:
