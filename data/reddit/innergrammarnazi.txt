Who knew the ',' character was worth $5? Thanks for adding incentive! 
I feel like if someone created it would be an overnight success.

For English language translations, the thousands separator should either be changed to a ',' or removed.

* The decimal separator is a language/locale issue. There are virtually no English locales which use the ',' decimal separator (exception is South Africa).
* The number of countries is irrelevant.  
 Population, which is also irrelevant, would make more sense if you're looking to count.

 * Since you're using English and especially to an international audience, the '.' decimal separator should be used.
 * Right aligned, or decimal aligned number columns would assist with numeric comparison.
 * Rank is mistyped as "Rang".
