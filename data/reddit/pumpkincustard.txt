IMO we're still continuing down the downward trend that we hit $7.3k with. I knew this $9.1k blip was too good to be true.

i haven't been in the game long (a few weeks; got in when bitcoin was at 9.3k in late feb and then rose to 11.5k and then cliffdived to where we are now). i have a feeling it's going to get lower. i thought it couldn't get lower than $10k. then i thought it couldn't get lower than $9k. then i thought it couldn't get lower than $8k.

i don't think cryptocurrency is a good long-term investment. first of all, what makes bitcoin so much more valuable than other cryptocurrencies, like dogecoin? can anyone just create their own cryptocurrency? i swear to god this sounds just like the dotcom bubble

why does coinbase take so long to receive transfers from banks? it only took me 4 days with robinhood. coinbase is quoting me 7 business days. does it always take as long as they say it will or do transfers on coinbase really take this long?

i can still remember that first point when bitcoin reached $1000. i thought people were idiots for buying bitcoin at that price. it seemed like no one knew what the fuck it even was except the people that were investing their savings into it. sounds like a bubble to me. people are really gullible when it comes to money and they get hyped up by articles by "experts" that they read online. this isn't just for bitcoin; this is for stocks in general. i've been susceptible to this too. maybe it's because i'm still a beginner at this, but it's hard to not let stuff you read/hear from people who seem like they know a lot more than you do have an impression on you. i suspect a lot of the people investing in bitcoin right now are like me. but i was wrong when bitcoin reached 1000, because it eventually shot up to 20,000, so at some point i was the stupid one, not the guy who bought bitcoin at $1000 (though it did crash to $300 after reaching $1000). and i still don't understand why or how it shot up to $20,000. does anyone, really? common sense tells me it's a bubble. greed tells me to invest. i just transferred a big chunk of my bank account into coinbase hoping to ride the volatility wave. i'll probably get fucked?

it could be the other way around -- when the price of bitcoin falls, less people are interested. when it's going up, more people are interested.
