So if an output has "&lt;unspendable time&gt; OP_CSV etc etc" in transaction A:
1) once A is included in a block, the &lt;unspendable time&gt; starts counting down?
2) when a tx (B) is trying to spend the CSV output, it compares the sequence number in B's input to the stack top value in the CSV output from A?

Sidechains exist. [Elements]( is the only publicly available one that I know of. (Liquid is private)


Through the 2 way peg, the sidechain token is directly correlated to the value of bitcoin, so you can earn bitcoins via fees on the sidechain.

Bitcoin, itself, has no registration/sign-up process so there's not technically an age requirement. Some exchanges and services (private companies) will have registration processes and age requirements.
LocalBitcoins and Bitquick are the fastest ways to get bitcoins for cash. Electrum is a user-friendly wallet. It puts the bitcoins completely in your control. Since you're a bitcoin beginner, consider using it with [SuredBits]( SuredBits makes it impossible for you to lose your bitcoins if you lose your private key. PM for any questions, and I'll gladly help you out.

Ideally, you want something completely offline that has never touched the internet, nature-resistant (fire, water, etc.), and fail-proof (incorruptible storage device). However, when starting out with a small amount of bitcoins, the online wallet providers such as Coinbase and Circle are the most user friendly, but you relinquish full control of your bitcoins doing so. They can also be slow in buying your first bitcoin (verifying bank account, credit card, then hold for 5 business days).
Lightweight wallets such as Electrum are another easy option. When you download [Electrum]( and create a wallet, you'll be prompted to write down a seed. This is your backup if something terrible happens (ex. computer destroyed or hard drive crashes, etc.). To maximize your protection, I strongly recommend creating an nLockTime transaction should you ever lose access to your bitcoins. You can do this with [SuredBits]( If you're unfamiliar with nLockTime, it's similar to a post-dated check in that it is a signed transaction to be conducted at a future point of time. PM if you have any questions about SuredBits or starting out. Just remember with bitcoin, much like everything else in life, it is always better to be safe than sorry.
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:23:45
I would also recommend Electrum as a beginner's wallet. In addition to the seed that you write down and an encrypted password for the Electrum wallet, consider maximizing your protection with a [SuredBits]( policy. If you were to ever lose your seed/password, the bitcoins in your wallet would still be accessible with SuredBits.

The bitcoins still exist but they're essentially lost forever on the blockchain. It's like an unbreakable glass case containing your bitcoin; you can see them but there's no way of accessing them.
The wallet data is lost forever if it wasn't backed up or if you didn't use a service to protect yourself (SuredBits).

If you can do a SEPA transfer, you could use [BitQuick]( Much faster than Coinbase and it's cash.
A wallet is a set of addresses. You store your bitcoins in addresses. Your private key is the password to your wallet. If you lose that or someone has it, then your bitcoins are gone. It's not like a bank where you can "look up your account" and there's no "forgot my password" email recovery link for bitcoin. There are services that allow you access to your bitcoin even if you've lost/forgotten your private key ([SuredBits](
Popular wallets are online wallet providers (Coinbase, Circle, etc.) or desktop wallets (Electrum, Armory, etc.). I prefer desktop because it lets you have control of your bitcoin whereas if you use an online provider, you give up full control of your bitcoin. It's essentially a bank for your bitcoin, which defeats the purpose of bitcoin IMHO. There's also wallet apps for your phone.
Your bitcoins are as safe as your security measures. If you're lazy about it, then you might consider not using a desktop wallet.

Stop treating it like a high risk investment where you think you'll become an overnight millionaire. Do you praise the dollar that much? You can use it to buy your makeup and dog's biscuits and pretty much anything else you can think of on overstock.com (largest online retailer accepting bitcoin). 
Research all you can until you're comfortable explaining it to someone else who doesn't know what bitcoin is. Don't trust everything you read on message boards. This is the beginning. There are no history courses on bitcoin [yet]. 
Already said, but I'll reiterate. You don't put your bitcoins in a bank because YOU are your own bank. YOU control them. YOU spend them. You don't get your monthly bitcoin statement. It's financial freedom in that sense.

I'd suggest either a desktop or paper wallet combined with an [nLockTime transaction]( As you mentioned, lost private keys do occur and this simple method allows you to "retrieve" your bitcoins should you ever lose your private key or encrypted password. In addition, you can choose which address they would be sent.

Having prior banking experience, I can attest to the unjust practices of modern banking. Aside from all the fees and profits that aren't properly reinvested, they're extremely prejudice. Someone with a 6 figure bank will get all fees waived, but someone living paycheck to paycheck has to pay these fees without negotiation. This applies to holds as well. There were some businesses that were able to have no holds on every check deposited into their accounts (regardless of amount), while the little guy has to wait 2 business days for his $500 clear. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:51:43
There's currently a service that is solving this problem. [SuredBits]( allows you to create your own nLockTime transactions from any address you control to any address you specify. We've included an optional field for a beneficiary's email address should the worst ever happen. 
Also, the address the bitcoins are sent to could be SuredBits if the user chooses to do so. In this scenario if the nLockTime was executed, we would email the beneficiary to relay the bitcoins after 90 days without contact from the user who created the transaction. 
If the user designates their own receiving address, they have to be certain that the private key for that address is safe and accessible by loved ones.
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:46:29
Anyone can secure their bitcoin independently; they don't have to rely on someone else (ex. Coinbase, Circle, etc.) to store their bitcoin. With [nLockTime transactions]( SuredBits is making this possible. If you lost your private key, the nLockTime transaction will "retrieve" those bitcoins and send them to a different address, which users have the option of choosing themselves or SuredBits.
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:50:38
Hopefully I understand you correctly. Are you asking if blockchain.info will recognize nLockTime transactions and broadcast them? I believe so. You can freely create [nLockTime transactions with SuredBits]( There is a [broadcast page on blockchain.info]( if you're curious to find out yourself. Our tests were conducted on blockr.io.

~insert shameless plug~ Also considering creating periodic [nLockTime transactions with SuredBits]( from your primary wallet to a separate wallet you own if your secondary PC crashes or any doomsday-scenario occurs. You can always invalidate the transaction if you still have access to your bitcoins - it's just another layer of protection.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:22:06
Electrum is a good one. You'll be asked to write down your seed (**on paper**), and you can also encrypt your wallet with a password as well.

First off. Research, research, research. Educate yourself on bitcoin before you dive in.
Never been to Canada but I believe there's American banks in Canada, at least the big ones (BOA, WF, Chase, etc). If that's the case, you might be able to use BitQuick. They act as an escrow service and allow you to do cash deposits into a seller's bank account for bitcoin.
Mobile wallets: Mycelium for Android (although there's been negative news lately) and Breadwallet for iOS (personally recommend). Desktop: Electrum (easy for beginners), MultiBit, Armory, Bitcoin Core. Generally, I stay away from web wallets, but to each their own.
To secure your wallet(s), you'll be asked to write down a "seed", which is a 12-24 word mnemonic phrase. Keep that offline, on paper, and safe. Anyone that has access to this seed has access to your bitcoins, so it is imperative you keep that safe and secure. You may also be optioned to encrypt your wallet with a password or PIN. 
In addition, you can also create nLockTime transactions periodically. [This is what we do at SuredBits]( These are transactions that are created and signed but won't broadcast to the network, or become valid in other words, until some future point in time. If for whatever reason you completely lose access to your bitcoins, a signed nLockTime transaction is very advantageous to have. Besides the flexibility of invaliding an nLockTime transaction whenever you want, the beauty of these transactions is that they will execute even if you don't have access to your wallet at the time of validation. This effectively allows the user to "retrieve" bitcoins that were previously inaccessible. 
Feel free to PM me with any questions.

CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Can't steal what isn't spendable [to an extent]. If they steal the private key to a CLTV, then it's just a race to who can redeem the bitcoins faster.

First off, welcome and congrats on getting your coinbase setup. Watch some youtube videos, keep yourself updated on current events in the space and you'll get a decent understanding of everything rather quickly. 
Coinbase is a great wallet for beginners. It acts like a bank in that they control your bitcoin for you.
After you've learned more about bitcoin down the road, you may feel comfortable controlling bitcoin yourself. Just remember that you're fully responsible for keeping it safe, and accessible only by you. If you were to ever lose your private key and seed, you'd lose access to your bitcoin forever. [SuredBits]( is solving this problem with nLockTime transactions. These are transactions that are executed at a specified time in the future. You have the full flexibility of choosing the receiving address and the transaction can be invalidated by spending from it. With this, we can prevent any bitcoin loss due to personal negligence. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:47:41

@_date: 2015-07-16 22:30:46
Your "pocket cash" would be your mobile wallets. Breadwallet for iOS (what I use). Research for Android. Mycelium had some recent issues. 
You have a lot of options for storing a lot of bitcoin. Hardware is definitely a good recommendation. Trezor, Ledger, and Case are popular names. 
Software-wise, there's Electrum which is lightweight (SPV) meaning you don't need to download the entire blockchain as you do with Bitcoin Core and Armory. 
You can also use [nLockTime transactions with SuredBits]( to protect your bitcoin should you ever completely lose access to your wallet (lost seed, password, etc). The nLockTime will send your bitcoins out of your wallet even if you don't have access to them when the transaction becomes valid. The great part is that you can invalidate the transaction at any time by spending or receiving bitcoin. Ideally, you create an nLockTime transaction after each normal spend/receive transaction and you'll never lose access to your bitcoin. Feel free to PM me with any questions.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:37:40

CLTV hasn't been released yet. [SuredBits]( is a simple user-friendly platform for creating your own **nLockTime** transactions.

Everyone's different and I think we depends on how much bitcoin you have. I personally have an encrypted hardware wallet, and paper backup. 
Also a separate paper wallet that is the receiving address of an [nLockTime transaction]( in the possession of a beneficiary across the country w/ instructions should I get hit by a bus tomorrow. Just before the nLockTime transaction's timestamp is met, I send a separate transaction to myself to invalidate the nLockTime, then repeat the process of creating another. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:03:44
If you're just holding and not planning on spending, consider safekeeping a paper wallet with a [nLockTime transaction]( to a separate zero-balance wallet. The nLocktime is an additional layer of security. Be sure to protect that paper wallet with lamination, fire-proof, etc. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:04:59
Electrum is a good one. Simple enough to setup and use. Lets you be in control of your bitcoin. This also means you alone are responsible for the safekeeping and access to your bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-07-08 18:48:58
Electrum is a decent lightweight wallet if you encrypt it with a good password and write the seed down on paper. If you want extra protection, consider creating an [nLockTime transaction]( to a separate wallet should you ever lose access to your bitcoin on the Electrum wallet (i.e. forget password, lost seed, computer crash, etc.).
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:01:22

@_date: 2015-07-29 00:58:45

For the most part, multi-sig is generally more secure as there has to be multiple points of failure to lose your bitcoins. Depending on how often you spend bitcoin is another factor to think about (if it's a spending wallet or a savings). 
Side-note/shameless plug: Personally, I believe a paper wallet (for savings) with an nLockTimeTx is the safest and most secure. You can do with [SuredBits]( Eventually, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY will supplement additional security.

Online exchanges (Coinbase, Circle) are the most convenient and probably the safest, especially given you went thru the verification process already. Once you purchase your bitcoins, you should consider moving them off the exchange. Hardware wallets such as Ledger have been suggested already. There are desktop wallets like Bitcoin Core and Armory that require you to download the blockchain. There's also lightweight wallets (SPV) like Electrum that you can use within minutes. Just make sure to write the seed down on paper and encrypt your wallet with a strong password. I recommend protecting your bitcoins with an [nLockTime transaction]( should you ever lose access to your bitcoins (ex. forgot password, lost, seed, computer crash, etc). Feel free to PM with any questions.
Welcome to Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:24:01
Your seed is the one you want to protect no matter what. You can use this seed to retrieve your bitcoins should you ever lose access to your Electrum wallet. To switch wallets, you can sweep private keys from Electrum (Wallet -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Sweep), and import them to a different wallet. 
About you being overwhelmed with it, that's understandable. Electrum is a good beginner's wallet for controlling your own funds, but if you screw up something, you could lose your bitcoins. Now what if you lose access to your wallet and lost your seed? Consider looking into [SuredBits]( We create nLockTime transactions which act as "post-dated checks". They're essentially transactions that will occur in the future. You maintain control of your bitcoin, and they're flexible in the sense that you can invalidate them by simply spending from the address. If you create one of these transactions after each time you spend from your wallet, you can never lose your bitcoins from private key/seed/password loss. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 00:10:09
Yes, not 100% though...Unless the forked chain removed OP_CLTV functionality, I don't see why the output wouldn't be spendable once the timestamp is reached.
