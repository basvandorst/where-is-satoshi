Hmmm, or I could just use a trust-free, pseudonymous and decentralized payment network that works everywhere and gives me full control over my money, instead of effectively taking my money away from me with the promise to probably let me spend it again sometime (as long as I comply with all their terms of service and their user agreement).
Tough choice.

I agree that this is an important aspect for adoption up to a certain point. But I honestly think Bitcoin has passed this point already. Most people who are now getting into Bitcoin do so because of the media exposure. They either hope for a further rise in price or they want to actually use it to buy stuff. And not because it is fun or not fun to hang out in @_date: 2014-02-05 19:06:00
The way I see it is that a merchant has a lot more to lose from scamming the customer than the other way around. So as long as I am doing business with a merchant who has a reputation to lose, I am not worried at all. And if I do a transaction with a shady party such as maybe a porn site, then I have done a risk/reward assesment for myself (whether it be knowingly or unknowingly) and I decided to take that risk.
So this means that I face two scenarios:
1. I want to do a transaction with a trustworthy party. Here I prefer using btcoins out of pure convenience. I know this is only true because I own bitcoins already, but so be it. And I am very sure that converting dollars into bitcoins will only become easier, up to the point where it has a negligible effect on consumer decision. At this point, a lot of people will prefer using bitcoins in this scenario.
2. I want to do a transaction with an untrustworth party. Here I still prefer using bitcoins, because the worst thing that can happen is that I lose the amount of bitcoins I send, while staying completely anonymous. Whereas when I am using a credit card, I might have to deal with the consequences of credit card fraud or even identity theft. Again, I know that this is why we have consumer protection mechanisms, so that the consumer will often get refunded in the case of credit card fraud. But it still causes a lot of inconvenience for me, and on my own personal utility curve that might actually be worse than losing a certain amount of bitcoins. 
Also, what else am I ignoring?

Yes that's exactly what is happening. Except that in this case it is a lot more likely that the blockchain randomly contains a byte sequence that matches a virus signature which some antivirus tools use to detect that virus.
False positives like that happen all the time, and with tens of gigabytes of data in the blockchain, it was bound to happen sooner or later. The easiest solution is to just exclude the bitcoin-qt data folder from being actively scanned by your antivirus.

By active code I literally meant code that is actively executed. The blockchain might contain any kind of executable code, but that code never becomes active, unless someone goes out of their way to execute it, so it really does not matter.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:49:10
I think you are confusing wallets and addresses:
A wallet is just a tool to help you manage all your bitcoin addresses in one place, so you don't have to worry about individual addresses. In the bitcoin protocol however, a wallet does not exist, only addresses exist. So if you want to anonymize your bitcoin transactions, you would want to use a new address every time you receive a transaction. This new address can still be part of your wallet, as only you know about the relations of addresses in your wallet (unless of course you are using an online provider such as blockchain.info, then they also know about it).

Wow. You took the time to write all that so I guess you were really appalled by this little stunt. But please try to keep some perspective here: It was 5 (five!) iphones. Who the hell cares? Rich kids buy new phones every day and throw the old ones away. And nobody cares. It's consumerism. It's wasteful and it's stupid. 
I found it extremely funny to see all the reactions that thread provoked. Do you think trading in 5 iphones for nexus phone and giving them away to some kids in front of an apple store would have had a similar effect? No. It's boring. And the kids who get the free iphones are already super privileged because they can hang out in front of a store that sells overprized electronics in the first place. Now they can waste their $600 on something else that they don't need. Well done. World hunger is cured.

So it is more useful as a storage of wealth because of its scarcity than it is useful in any other sense.
I just looked it up, and according to Wikipedia, 90% of all the newly mined gold is either used for investment or jewelry (which is essentially the same thing). That seems like a real waste for something that useful. And by your logic, only 10% of gold's value would be derived from its utility, because only 10% of its price is coming from industrial demand. Which would also mean that 90% of Gold's value is actually not backed by anything, right?

Yes, Bitcoin promotors can sometimes behave like a cult, but they at least have a reason to: "Bitcoiners" have been trying to convince people of the legitimacy of a cryptocurrency for over 5 years now. They have faced opposition from all directions and never stopped trying to improve the protocol, the network, the services, the understanding of the public, etc.
Altcoin communities have done nothing of the sorts. All they do is leech off the work of others, pitching their stupid look-at-us-we-are-so-funny or whatever selling point they use and make every effort to spam the same fucking crap everywhere.
So please, stop comparing one to the other. Thank you.

But that's not where the value of $19 billion comes from: Whether Whatsapp is good or evil, whether it saves people some money or whether it kills cute little puppies is completely irrelevant to the investors, as long as people us it and give up marketable information about themselves while doing so.
And Whatsapp is not the only app providing that kind of messaging service, there's literally hundreds of them in the app stores. All of them trying to reach a critical mass of users to become worth something in this market. In fact, I could probably write my own messaging app in less than a month if I wanted to, even though I am not a programmer.
Whatsapp does not add anything of substantial value to the world. The real value is being added by the underlying technology and infrastructe, like the internet, the cell networks, the handhelds and their operating systems. Whatsapp itself is just a very simple add-on to all of that. And that's not worth $19 billion usd.

Too bad this is getting downvoted/ignored. I think it's an interesting topic. It even reminds me a bit of the idea that there is [only a single electron in the whole universe]( which is moving so fast that it appears to be in every place at once :)
So that means if the velocity of money in a Bitcoin world is high enough, we would only need a single satoshi, right? Maybe. But obviously that is not practical in any way, because there are of course limiting factors to the velocity of money. The two main limiting factors that come to mind are:
1. The infrastructure on which the monetary exchange takes place.
2. The willingness and the ability of the market participants to exchange goods or services for money.
How does Bitcoin affect these factors? My guess is as good as yours. But if I had to make a guess right now, I would assume that neither of these factors will change much: Most of our money is already digital in some way or another, and people probably won't suddenly start making significantly more exchanges in a shorter period of time.
Reduced fees and reduced delays and reduced dependency on third parties might encourage people and especially companies to spend money quicker, but probably not enough to completely change the equation.

- Give the game away for free to get a lot of people interested
- Make the first few levels easy enough so everyone likes playing the game and wants to play more
- Make the later levels so hard that they can almost only be won by buying extra bonus stuff from inside the game
- Add a social feature so people can compare their progress with each other and see how much better all their paying friends are doing

@_date: 2014-03-10 21:03:18
Hmm. I'm out of ideas then.
What I personally would do is restore the original backup you had (of course back up your current wallet.dat as well just in case), then do a rescan in bitcoin-qt.
Once the rescan is complete I would try sending to a new address again.

For the most part it has made money for people already owning Bitcoins, who decided to take a wild shot and bought some "promising" (as in have a somewhat good chance to get pumped in the near future) altcoins. And of course the miners who more or less found [a way to indirectly mine Bitcoins]( with their outdated (in Bitcoin terms) mining hardware.

The blockchain does not contain active code, so it's pretty much impossible that it contains a virus in the usual sense. It's thinkable that the blockchain could be manipulated in a way that would exploit the client reading data from the blockchain, causing the client to execute some arbitrary code. But this is something completely different from the "virus" that your antivirus has detected. 
tl;dr: It's safe to ignore the warning and you should exclude the bitcoin-qt data folder from being scanned by your antivirus if you want to avoid this problem in the future.

Importing your wallet.dat to blockchain.info should work regardless of the amount of bitcoins that are stored in it. In fact I think it should even work with an empty wallet.
Maybe try to import it again or open a support ticket on blockchain.info if it still doesn't work.

I usually add those spam domains to my adblock plus custom filter. They still show up on reddit as empty submissions (no title, no link), but at least it makes it easy to identify and report them and it also makes it impossible to accidentally click on them.

    How to Upgrade
    --------------
    
    If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
    shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all
    earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy
    over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).
    
    If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run
    0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from
    30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.
    
    On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin
    client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version.
    
    Windows 64-bit installer
    -------------------------
    
    New in 0.9.0 is the Windows 64-bit version of the client. There have been
    frequent reports of users running out of virtual memory on 32-bit systems
    during the initial sync. Because of this it is recommended to install the
    64-bit version if your system supports it.

blockchain.info uses the bitstamp exchange rate for price conversion. You probably used the mtgox exchange rate. That's where the difference is comming from. As long as the amount of bitcoin stored on that address is the amount you expect it to be, there's nothing to worry about.

I understand what you are saying. I just don't agree that patterns that occured in the past will necessarily happen the same way again in the future, because I think that the factors that created that pattern will likely have changed in the meantime. It's the same reason why I don't think technical analysis in trading has much merit, even though thousands of people take it as the basis for their trading decisions every single day. At best, the patterns people look for in TA are self-enforcing, because everyone is looking for them and trading accordingly. Again, this is my personal opinion, and a lot of people disagree with it :)
Your approach, as interesting as it is, is just taking TA to the next level.

Fine. Obviously you don't want to discuss the merits or demerits of Dogecoin and its oh-so-fun community any longer, and instead you prefer to make this about using the right words when paraphrasing anything you wrote. 
Here we go then:
1. You say Dogecoin offers no utility over Bitcoin (I will assume that was implied by **not much really**). So why would anyone ever want to use Dogecoin instead of Bitcoin (notice how we go in circles back to the initial question again)? There is no reason, which you admit by saying there is **not much yet really** in incentive to do so (was that paraphrased accurately enough for you?). Therefore I concludeed that dogecoins are indeed good for exactly that, namely **not much yet really**. Yep, totally putting words in your mouth.
2. I am not sure what's up with all that italics business. I never claimed you have said any of these things. The first one was a question whether you agree with my interpretation. Unfortunately you once again didn't answer it. The second one was about snakesoil salesman trying to pitch dogecoin as an essential buy to gullible people. I never said you used those words. You can find them in this thread however, written by other fun-loving members of your community.
3. I took the liberty to scroll through your last few comments in your history. You wrote yourself that you invested in a mining rig for dogecoins. Don't make me dig it up please.
So now that this is out of the way, I have anohther question for you: Does it make it easier for you to deny what you are doing by attacking me on a personal level? Please respond.

My point was that adding redundancy when doing the private key -&gt; address conversion would greatly reduce the risk of a mistake due to a faulty implementation or user error when using that specific implementation.

Do you know how much money that is? Normal people can not even comprehend how much that really is! Imagine you have a decent job and you earn $100k a year. Now even with a good salary like that, you would have to work almost for 200,000 years straight. Two. Hundred. Thousand. Years. That's about twice as long as modern humans have existed on this planet!

Not really. It seems to be relatively easy to fix on all fronts, and it does not affect the integrity of the blockchain in any way. It only affects poorly programmed wallet implementations.

Problem is that you did not include a miners fee.
Anyway, your bitcoins are not lost: The transaction will either confirm eventually or get rejected by the network. If it gets rejected, the bitcoins will be available in your wallet again.
You can still make a backup now (and you should!), and that will include access to your bitcoins if the transaction doesn't get confirmed.
If you want to speed up the confirmation process, you can give this service a try:

Unfortunately it's not that simple. And blaming OP for his loss doesn't help anyone. 
For example, I consider myself pretty tech savvy and knowledgable about bitcoin and security. And even though I am fairly sure that my day-to-day browsing/gaming/fapping PC is not compromised with malware in any way, I would still not put a significant amount of bitcoins on it, neither on a local wallet nor via login to a webwallet. Because even though I know what I'm doing and I am confident in my abilities to keep my system secure, I still think the risk of loss is too high!
It is absolutely unreasonable to expect the average user to be able to handle the security aspect of bitcoin without losing all usability. The tools and services that we have today are just not good enough! OP is trying to make a point, saying blockchain.info should go with a more secure default setting for new users. And I agree with that.

With 2FA enabled the malware needs to get both the password and the wallet file. Without 2FA it only needs to get the password.
And it's not as easy to get the wallet file as you make it out to be: The malware has to either have access to a backup or have the ability to extract the wallet file from memory when the user is logged in. That requires a way more sophisticated attack than just a keylogger grabbing the password.
It's still not a perfect solution, but it increases security for new users nonetheless.

Ok. Look, "economics" is an empirical field of study. It is largely based around models that try to describe, not explain, the world the way it is. Economists are experts in applying these different models (there is no one model to describe everything) to different situations in the real world. This allows them and us to make predictions and come to conclusions about what course of action might be most desirable for the value of a business or the welfare of a state. Sometimes the predictions are correct, often they are not.
Again, please believe me when I say that having a degree in economics does not give you any special insight in economic situations that are not well enough understood to find examples about it in a textbook.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:51:37
Yes, but any 12 year old can get people to install a keylogger and steal their bitcoins if he finds a victim. Hijacking the browser or extracting from memory or even just finding a backup of the wallet file puts a significant hurdle in the way for the hacker. There is no good reason for blockchain.info to not have 2FA as the default option with a big red warning message when the user tries to disable it.

Ok let's do a simple example:

Week 3, price is $100.
Your strategy:
Buy 1 btc each week. You end up with an investment of $1101 for 1+1+1=3 bitcoins.
Dollar Cost Averaging:
Buy bitcoins for $100 each week. We end up with an investment of $300 for 100+0.1+1=101.1 bitcoins.

You are absolutely right, that is an assumption. But I feel very comfortable making that assumption based on my own experience. I personally prefer bitcoin over any other payment option, and I'm not just saying that because I own some.
The real problem is that most people are extremely inert when it comes to changing their habits. So in order for them to use bitcoins instead of paypal or credit cards, they have to not just hear and read about its advantages, they also have to see other people use it on a regular basis. And that can obviously only happen if enough merchants accept it.

Of course there is insider trading going on. If you thought otherwise, you were simply naive. I have no idea whether Mtgox was as heavily involved in insider trading as you claim or not. I doubt it, because they had the perfect business model and the perfect opportunity to make tons of money legally. Why jeopardize this with insider conspiracies? But of course the possibility remains.
Either way, insider trading mostly hurts other traders who are not on the inside. Because those are the people losing all the money to the insiders. People who buy and use bitcoins but don't trade it are only slightly affected by this (it might cause some higher volatility at times, but everyone knows about this fact already).
And lol at "I plan on keeping my current alt portfolio"! You are aware that the manipulation and insider trading in the altcoin market is magnitudes higher than it is for Bitcoin, right? Right?? You lost all credibility here.

The difference here is that Bitcoin is not a business venture. Bitcoin is a protocol that fuels a variety of different business ventures, some of which are highly successful while others fail miserably. The never-seen-before aspect here is that this protocol comes with a token of value that can be exchanged and used by all of these different business ventures and their customers, as well as by everyone else.
The value of a bitcoin is therefore nothing more and nothing less than the utility value which the market attributes to the network of businesses and services that are built around this protocol. Unfortunately this price-finding process is pretty much just a lot of guessing by all the market participants based on incomplete information. Obviously there will be a lot of uncertainty in the early phases, which results in the crazy volatility we are seeing today.
tl;dr: Comparing Bitcoin to a conventional business venture makes no sense.

Of course "we" weren't buying bitcoins because there were merchants accepting it. Because up until now almost no merchants did accept it. That's why "we" speculated. "We" speculated on the possibility that merchants might start accepting bitcoins in the future. This would benefit "us" both with a possibly increasing price as well as added utility to the bitcoins "we" own. Now "we" can use them. It worked out pretty well for "us", wouldn't you agree?

Yes of course. But merchants should not accept zero fee transactions obviously.
Maybe I read it wrong, because I thought what pinhead26 was talking about was sending a second transaction with a *higher fee* then the first transaction.
Obviously if you send a zero fee transaction that's just stupid, because every well configured payment system will just reject it.

My take on this is that Bitcoin is money. People are free to do with their money as they please. People do stupid stuff with dollars all the time, for fun, for publicity, or just to piss off others. It might be seen as unethical and it might cause an outrage. But it will never make people think "wow, I never knew money could be used to do that. Maybe this dollar thing isn't such a good idea after all". Why should this be any different with Bitcoin?
I know this is wishful thinking, and the reality is a different one: Bitcoin gets wrongly associated with drug dealing, money laundering and whatnot. Because the public is ignorant and they are not able to differentiate between the two things. But by trying to police other people regarding what they should do and what they should not do with bitcoins would just mean reinforcing this ignorance. I feel it's better to get rid of that mind set, the sooner the better, and take some collateral damage in the process. At least it gets people talking about Bitcoin, and that is always a chance to educate them.

Do you maybe have more than one wallet in your multibit client? Multibit only shows the balance of the currently active wallet.
A wallet contains a list of bitcoin addresses and Multibit shows the total balance of bitcoins of all the addresses in the currently active wallet. If you created a new wallet instead of just a new address for the second transaction then you now have the bitcoins in separate wallets.

There doesn't need to be any additional money for the price to go up. The price is just the point of intersection between the demand and the supply curves.

People don't ultimately just want dollars. People naturally want the one currency that offers the highest utility for them. Right now, for pretty much everyone in the US, that currency is the us dollar. 
Bitcoin obviously still is a niche currency. And even though it offers a multitude of advantages over the us dollar, for most people, dollars are still a lot more useful. Only once the usefulness of Bitcoin approaches that of the us dollar for the average person will people not want dollars over Bitcoin anymore.
And this argument is exactly why altcoins will not be able to compete with Bitcoin: Why would anyone prefer to hold SillyCoin instead of Bitcoin, when Bitcoin is so much more useful in pretty much every situation? Bitcoin can compete in this situation with the dollar because it is fundamentally different. Altcoins can not compete with Bitcoin because they are fundamentally the same.

From the perspective of the market it does not matter why there is demand for something. 
The Bitcoin price has everything to do with supply and demand, because it is the only mechanism that makes up the price discovery process. 
Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency with the strongest infrastructure, both in mining investment as well as in merchant and user adoption. Copying the code for another altcoin does not copy that infrstructure.

Importing a private key doesn't remove the bitcoins from that address, it just makes the address available in the client you imported it to.

Here's another idea for 
- Create a blockchain.info wallet
- Set up a watch only address (store the private key for this one in a different wallet where only you have access)
- Set up a spending address in the blockchain.info wallet where you will send the bitcoins that can be spent by your kids
Now they see how many bitcoins they have in total, and they will also see how much of it they can spend at the moment. If you want to increase their "allowance", just move bitcoins from the watch only address to their spending address.

I agree, it's the best decision they could have made: To everyone with an ounce of common sense it was clear that Dogecoin could not compete with Bitcoin in any way outside of the this very niche meme community. Trying to mimic Bitcoin even more by imposing a hard cap would just have sealed Dogecoin's fate as a redundant copycat coin that was ultimately doomed to be abandoned. This decsions by the devs at least keeps some of the spirit alive that made it "special" in the first place.
All the people who think Dogecoin had a chance of ever becoming similarily valuable as Bitcoin were delusional. Good to see at least the devs behind it are not complete morons.

Of course, the growth of Bitcoin *could* resemble other patterns of exponential growth, if the assumption of exponential growth holds true. But we can only answer that after the fact. That's why trying to predict the growth rate by trying to find ex post patterns is a futile attempt in my opinion. Right now it looks like that. But there is no inherent underlying mechanism that says that it has too look like that in the future as well. Unless you create a model that convincingly explains such a mechanism, this is nothing but drawing lines in the sand. And then the tide sets in.

I agree, it would be a nice option to have in bitcoin-qt.

Offer in return for what exactly? This smells like dogshit.
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:41:54
1. Issuing such a Fedcoin would be equivalent to increasing the money supply. So the higher they set the supply cap, the higher the effect on inflation. But the supply cap for the coin has to be sufficiently high to be useful as a currency. I would estimate that this would probably have to be in the trillions of dollars. That's a pretty big amount. And should this be released instantly or gradually over time? Over what time period? How will it affect inflation over that time period?
2. The Fed would need to ensure control over the network. This means controlling over 50% of the hashing power in the network, AT ALL TIMES! It would become a high profile target for terrorists and other nation states. This again means that the hashing power controlled by the Fed has to be so high, that not even an adversary like China or Russia could overtake it if they wanted to. This is just not realistically possible.
3. There is absolutely no need for the government to issue a currency based on the Bitcoin protocol. The Bitcoin protocol so revolutionary because it does not need a central authority, and because it eliminates the element of trust from the equation. But when the Fed has to control over 50% of the network anyway, then both the decentralization as well as the trust-free aspect are lost. So why bother with such an approach in the first place?

@_date: 2014-04-13 21:14:47
I am not sure that's what I said.
It even was their own fault for not checking whether they are connected to enough healthy nodes before sending the transaction. Of course this is not something a user should have to do at all. And it doesn't have to be, because it can be handled by the client itself. Current clients are just not handling it very well yet it seems.
And it was very different from the bank issue, because, as I said twice now, it was completely transparent for the user how the transaction got stuck. Whereas with a bank, you have no idea what's going on. I guess some people just prefer the former, while some might prefer the latter.

As jenya_ has pointed out, bitcoin-qt pregenerates [a keypool of 100 addresses]( Every new receive address you create in the client, as well as every change address that gets automatically created for a transaction will be taken from this keypool. So your backup of the wallet.dat will be up to date for the next ~100 transactions without the need to make a new backup.
If you think 100 addresses is too much or not enough, you can change the size of the keypool [using the command line argument](
     -keypool=&lt;n&gt;           Set key pool size to &lt;n&gt; (default: 100)
If you want to get a list of all the addresses in the keypool, you can use [Pywallet]( More info [here]( and [here]( But make sure you know what you're doing before using it on your real wallet and always make a backup!

Dogecoin didn't send the Jamaincan bobsled team to the Olympics: One guy basically donated $25k worth of dogecoin, while the other 50000 people of the "community" basically donated as good as nothing. Then those dogecoins got converted to BITCOINS before they got sold and donated to the bobsled team. That's the reality. Dogecoin has done nothing in this case, neither as a currency, nor as a community.
And doge is "on the rise" against BTC because it is a) hugely overvalued due to pump and hype, and b) Bitcoin is undervalued at the moment because of FUD and MtGox. In reality, this is the best time to convert doge inte btc before the situation normalizes again.

Yeah but you are comparing two completely different investments: In the first case the investment is $600, while in the second case the investment is $800. Not a very fair comparison.
Now let's say someone wants to invest $1000. If that someone buys at $800, he gets 1.25 bitcoins. If however he would have bought at $600, he would have gotten 1.67 bitcoins. That's 0.42 bitcoins more for the same investment. At a hypothetical long term price of $10,000, he could either have bitcoins worth $12,500 or bitcoins worth $16,700. That's a pretty big difference. And the difference only gets bigger as the price increases.

I don't see any possible purpose for "millions" of altcoins. Andreas seems to think that everyone will create their own altcoin for pretty much everything, from schoolyard trading to popularity contests and buying any kind of merchandise. I think this is utter nonsense. Why create a new altcoin when they could just as well use an established one? It makes no sense at all. In my opinion, altcoins will fade away as they lose their novelty factor and people come to realise that these altcoins have no real utility compared to Bitcoin.

But without upvoting, nobody is going to see it, which would be a shame.
Even though some things might not be 100% factually accurate, it's close enough for a new user to get the idea. I especially liked the demo transaction at the end :)
The only thing I would change is the explanation of the private key: A new user will most likely never see a private key, so they really don't need to know what it looks like. It's just a bit confusing to see two different strings of letters, when really only the address is relevant for them.

It's due to a "shallow" order book: There are not enough already open buy orders to absorb a sudden sell order of a relatively large amount of coins. Then when it happens, people and their trading bots race each other to get their hands on the few cheap coins and the price spikes back up.

This is such a stupid argument. Anyone holding bitcoins can buy any altcoin in less than an hour if they want to. So if these people are so afraid that too much monies will be sucked up by an altcoin, they could just convert some of their bitcoins to whatever is the hip coin at the moment, then sell it again once they think the hype is over. 
But instead a lot of people here are smart enough to realize that a redundant copycoin offers nothing of real value to anyone, other than its creators and the pump and dumpers. This in itself probably wouldn't even be reason enough for all the "hate" you are talking about. Unfortunately some altcoin communities behave like an obnoxious cult, spamming their shit all over and anywhere else they get a chance, which is not only annoying but also reflects badly on Bitcoin itself.

Whatsapp was really smart in their decision to make the first year free of charge, that way they managed to build up a large user base, which effectively locked everyone in after a while (just because all their friends were using it already).

Because $70bn is not enough to make the Fedcoin any useful on a larger scale. That's like what, $200 per capita? 
How would they limit the amount of miners? And the "timely manner" of transactions is not dependant on the hashrate, it is a result of the proof of work function where the hashrate is just a variable together with the difficulty. The limiting factor with a large number of transactions would be network nodes and bandwith.
And where the hell does speculation suddenly come from here? The Bitcoin protocol is useless for the Fed because they would need to control more than 50% of it, which is not only not feasible, it also defeats the purpose of the protocol. There are easier alternatives for a digital currency if it is issued by a central authority.
Please think before you reply.

Ok let's break this down then:
1. Status Quo: Spending change input from unconfirmed transactions can fail to confirm, due to the malleability issue. The only problem this brings is that unconfirmed transactions can not be seen as secure as previously thought (by the majority of people using bitcoin). The real world implications of this are *slim to nonexistent*. This has only been a problem the past few days because of certain nodes spamming changed transactions (this could even be addressed in different ways, rather than fixing the wallet clients).
2. Proposed "Quick Fix": Wallets should not spend change inputs from unconfirmed transactions. This would prevent the problems described above, but would introduce another problem: Customers might have to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation before they can spend the change input again, if this is the only funds in their wallet. Highly inconvenient!
3. Long term fix: Immutable transaction IDs. Everything is resolved. Might take a while.

The real face of bitcoin is neither dependant on speculation nor on your perception of beauty. The utility of bitcoin is clearly laid out in its protocol and everyone can take as close a look at it as they please.
Speculation is needed right now because a large part of bitcoin's current utility is tied to being able to convert it back and forth into fiat. Once the infrastructure has matured and adoption has reached a certain level, then converstion into fiat becomes secondary and ultimatley irrelevant. There will probbably still be price speculation even then, but it won't be necessary anymore because bitcoin's utility does not depend on it anymore.

A bit of [googling]( brings up this regular expression to match a bitcoin address:
    /^[13][a-zA-Z0-9]{26,33}$/
where {26,33} defines the min and max length of the address minus 1.  So I guess your regex pattern should look like this:

The problem with Tyler Cowen's argument is that he completely underestimates the barriers to entry for any new crypto currency that wants to compete with Bitcoin: In his view, the only barriers to entry are duplicating the code base and marketing. This is just not correct. The main barriers to entry are the network effects of the Bitcoin economy that a new coin would need to overcome, as well as the sheer amount of hashing power behind the Bitcoin network that a new coin would have to catch up with (in order to achieve a similar level of trustworthiness as Bitcoin). If a new coin can not do that, it will fail.

I never used Electrum, but a watch-only version of a deterministic wallet would have to generate a certain number of addresses from your seed to watch. It probably did not generate enough addresses to include the ones where your bitcoins are currently stored. I don't know how to get Electrum to watch more addresses, but that's probably what you should make it do :)

Vertical distances on a log chart represent percentage changes instead of absolute value changes. So if you're treating bitcoin as an investment, then you don't care about absolute changes in value, all you care about is the relative change in percent. That's why looking at the above chart makes no sense from an investment perspective unless you look at it on a log scale. Unless of course you're a troll trying to spread FUD like TheRedditDoctor.

If you really want to compare it other business ventures, then you also have to attribute for the fact that this Bitcoin venture is currently valued at over 6 billion USD, starting from zero 5 years ago. Not many businesses out there achieve that.
That's not cherry picking with percentage increase, that's 6 billion USD of absolute growth. And that's just the "shareholder value" if you will, it does not even include the value growth of all the actual businesses and services that have been built around the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
And it's not fundamentally broken logic to say Bitcoin can't be compared to anything seen before, because it actually is fundamentally different from anything seen before. Sometimes things are just different.

I am absoultely not opposed to speculating with dogecoin. Despite the moral aspect of taking advantage of a lot of naive people, there is nothing wrong with that. This doesn't change the fact that Dogecoin is inherently redundant to Bitcoin without offering any added utility, which makes it virtually worthless in an objective sense. Unfortunately the clowns don't understand this and will therefore ultimately get burned by the speculators.
I also understand that discussing the merits of Dogecoin was not the intention of your posting, but you can't deny that this is the question that will have to be answered before the speculation can go beyond the point of casual bitcoiners trying to "diversify" their portfolios.
And I am not trying to pick a fight either. I am just pointing out why some people here somewhat resigned when it comes to having a serious discussion with proponents of dogecoin: They are not able or not willing to have any kind of fruitful discussion. And the unwillingness is obviously largely motivated by their speculation too. This is admittedly not that different from all the shills that can be found in of course. Unfortunately the combination of blatant stupidity paired with an unprecedented display of ignorance is extremely off-putting, at least to me.

A lot of "bitcoiners" including myself probably have a huge blind spot when it comes to how Bitcoin is perceived by other people. The reason for that is that once you start thinking about its implications it all seems so obvious, and "conventional" alternatives such as Venmo just feel... outdated. 
The problem is that it is quite hard to put this feeling into words that make a convincing argument. Not many people can do that. Plus it takes a lot of time and thinking to write it up, especially if the question is as unspecific as yours. Once you actually make an argument for Venmo, it would become a lot easier to try and refute it.

Create a paper wallet with a new address, print it out, send all your bitcoins to it, delete your now empty wallet on your PC (make a backup first just in case).
Once you get your PC back: Create a new wallet on your PC (don't use the backup, but still keep it around just in case), import or preferably sweep your paper wallet. Done.
On second thought: You probably shouldn't do it like this if you don't really know exactly what you're doing, because in that case the possible points of failure that come with this are probably a bigger risk than the tech guys stealing your coins. I say go with encryption :)

There are a few faults in your logic:
1. Even if an exchange artificially inflates the price of an asset with *fake* liquidity, that only affects the price on the exchange, which is just a number. In order to turn a profit from this, there needs to be *real* liquidity at that price, which means real buy orders in the order book at that price. Otherwise the insiders are only trading imaginary funds. So people have to be willing to pay the artificially inflated price with real money, which means the market still sees the inflated price as a reasonably fair value. Of course this percepttion will be skewed by the fake buy orders, but only to a certain point. If you argue that this is not true, then what you are saying is that the majority of investors are idiots and don't know what they are doing.
2. During the last runup, Mtgox was not really the leading exchange. The runup was mostly fueled by Chinese exchanges. So for your theory to make sense, the Chinese exchanges would need to be in on this / have done the same.
3. As soon as Mtgox liquidity problems became apparent, its bitcoin price became more and more detached from all the other exchanges. This again shows that *real* liquidity does not blindly follow *fake* liquidity on a single exchange.
4. Altcoins: How do you know Cryptsy, Bter and BTC-e are not doing exactly what you are describing here? Hmmmm?

Right now, everyone is just looking for excuses to sell in order to buy back cheaper. This whole China mess is nothing but a catalyst for a bunch of market shorting, because you know, everyone else will be shorting too, right? So in essence, all the traders are trying to ride the final wave down then get back in right before the next tide sets in. Once that happens, it will explode like crazy, and a good part of the sellers will panic buy back in, adding even more fuel to the explosion. The experienced traders will likely have made a lot of money, while all the noobs missed their exit and entry points and are left eating the losses.

It's not really a 4:1 odds bet: You have to see this in relation to your next best alternative, which would be buying on a different exchange. So your odds are more in the range of 2.2:1, because that's the price ratio between mtgox and bitstamp right now.

I agree, Zerocoin and Ethereum do offer interesting new approaches. But the bottom line is that these features can all be implemented in a similar form to the Bitcoin protocol (even though I am not exactly sure about Ethereum I have to admit).
And it is obviously much easier to add a new feature to an already established currency than getting everyone to start using a new one (as we can observe now with the dollar and bitcoin, except that the dollar has a hard time adding those features to its infrastructure, which makes a transition inevitable).

In short:
* A private key lets you spend the funds on the address that is associated with that private key. So if someone knows one of your private keys, they can spend the bitcoins on that specific address. Usually, you will never see or directly use a private key, because your wallet software takes care of it.
* A public key is the crypto twin to your private key. It is used when you generate a transaction so others can verify that the transaction has been made by someone who knows the private key. You will definitely never see or directly use a public key.
* A bitcoin address is a different representation of the public key (that's why they are often confused as the same thing). The bitcoin address is the only thing you normally use.
* Your wallet password is not a private key. Your wallet contains all the private keys of all your bitcoin addresses. Because anyone who gets their hands on these private keys can spend your bitcoins, it is advisable to encrypt that list of private keys. That's where your wallet password gets used: To encrypt and decrypt the list of private keys in your wallet so they won't get stolen.

It's not about being elitist, it's just that every good advertising campaign should be targeted at the right demographic. Personally, I think there are countless better opportunities for advertising Bitcoin than Nascar. Because honestly, I just don't see the average Nascar fan to be the guy who can get his head around the whole concept. Maybe in a year or two when things are more suitable for mainstream adoption, but not right now.

True. But the government is doing that because they are trying to keep an economy of 300 million people alive and going. And they can do so because they own the money supply.
Whereas FB is part of that economy itself and can't just print money. Those 19 billion dollars came from somewhere. In the end, most of that money has at some point been earned by someone like you and me. And then we spent it and it finally landed in the hands of FB.
What I find appalling is that this kind of money gets thrown around in such a mind-boggling sum of 19,000,000,000 dollars like it's nothing. And even worse, neither of those two companies produce anything of substantial value. They're effectively just marketing user info to ad companies.

MtGox's price was inflated because fiat withdrawals were limited/not working on there for a long time, so people resorted to buying bitcoins instead which they could freely withdraw (up until the final collapse). There are no signs of fiat withdrawal issues on Bitstamp.
Maybe people just trust Bitstamp more than BTC-e etc with their fiat deposits, which means more new money is flowing into Bitstamp compared to other exchanges, which of course means more buying pressure.

Why is the "community" (by which we really mean such an important aspect for anyone looking into a new form of payment system or a new form of currency? Does it matter to you what the paypal community is like? Are people more inclined to sign up with VISA because its community is so much more fun than those boring Mastercarders? 
I am not trying to be a smug asshole here, just an honest question. I don't think hanging out with bankers and wall street traders is a lot of fun for someone not at home in those circles either. And yet we all use their coins in some way or another. 
Obviously it is important that newbies can easily find answers to their questions and all the ressouces are readily available. But this is absolutely the case with Bitcoin. Are you saying people don't want to use this new form of money because the people in refuse to end all of their postings with a smiley face?
The bottom line of what I am trying to say is: Bitcoin is valuable because of the underlying technology and it's advantages over conventional money, as well as the network effects that have been achieved by the pioneers pushing it forward over the past 5 years. It's not valuable because it has a funny community and we can all make jokes all day long. That's what jokecoins are for after all. :)

Of course they store your encrypted wallet file. How else are they supposed to sign transactions for you?
The point is: They don't hold any of your funds, they only hold your encrypted wallet. So if they got hacked, and the hackers somehow got around the wallet encryption, then they would steal the bitcoins from the users wallets, which would be immediately obvious to everyone. There is no way blockchain.info could cover this up. OP is full of shit.

What makes you think it couldn't? And what would even be a realistic reason to do so?


The amount of bitcoins **does not matter** in any way other than the subjective perception of the individual user. Economically it does not make a difference in the slightest if there are 21 million bitcoins, or 21 trillion or just 21. As long as they are sufficiently divisible it is completely irrelevant.


So far they seem to have worked out quite well I would say.

Does it matter? I would say it does matter that they accept Bitcoin, but it does not matter why they accept it:
A currency is only valuable if it has better utility than its next best alternative. Bitcoin derives its utility partly from its unique features that result from the decentralized and trust-free aspects of the technology underlying it. But the bigger part of its utility will have to come from merchant adoption!
So in essence, the added publicity of accepting Bitcoin incentivizes merchants to adopt the currency despite the fact that its perceived utility by the average customer is still relatively low. But once a critical mass of merchants have taken advantage of such publicity stunts, the utility of Bitcoin as a payment option will have increased enough for other merchants to accept it purely because people see it as a useful payment method and want to use it.

I might be wrong, but I think from the perspective of the network it doesn't make a difference whether you are pool mining or solo mining:
In either case you are contributing both the important function of a full node as well as an addition to the overall hashrate which an attacker would have to overcome. If anything, solo mining might be even better for the network because you are reducing at least one pool's % of the total hashrate, making it harder for that pool to maliciously double spend.

The address is generated from the public key. The public key is generated from the private key. So all you need is the private key, everything else can be calculated from it.
And yes you are right, you can import as many private keys to your wallet as you like. [Here]( is a list of all the possible private keys for your convenience.
But don't worry, trying to generate someone elses bitcoin address is a complete waste of time because [there are just too many](

I am quite sure this is done in such a way to protect the "casual" buyers and sellers who don't really understand how order books work: They just see the spot price and want to buy or sell at that price. Then they click on instant order and expect it to execute at that price. Imagine someone does that in an incredibly shallow order book situation and ends up getting a largely different price. People would be confused and angry. 
Anyone who understands how the order book works can easily submit a limit order way above or below the current spot price and get the effect you describe.

More cost effective to mine? What does that even mean? Mining is governed by market mechanisms which ensure that the marginal cost of adding an additional unit of mining power will always be equivalent to the mining reward gained from that additional unit. How can litecoin be more effictive or efficient or whatever in that regard? Stop making things up!

The real world implications are slim in my opinion because zero confirmation transactions would only fail in one very specific situation: The change input of a previously unconfirmed transaction is being respent, and that transaction ID gets modified and broadcast in a way that the network accepts the modified transaction instead of the initially transmitted (by the customer) transaction. It's just extremely unlikely. The probabiliy might be less than getting counterfeit change or whatever (no I don't have any data to back this up).
Either way, I doubt we are qualified to assess the feasability of immutable transactions IDs, so that point is moot anyway.

Speculators are only necessary to provide liquidity for fiat conversion.

I am sorry but I did not look at all of those.
Either way, from the ones I looked at it seems that it was always the case that the transaction did not get broadcast properly, and a blockchain re-scan in the client followed by a re-broadcast of the transaction fixed it.
Afaik the bitcoin-qt client even automatically rebroadcasts transactions after set intervals if they didn't confirm in the meantime, which would fix this without user interaction.
In any case, it's completely transparent what has happened and it was (relatively) easy to fix. I am sure future versions of wallet clients will handle bad network propagation a lot more gracefully for the user.

From 








The second condition is easy to meet as you have 0.07 btc.
The first conditions depends on how many inputs you have that make up that 0.07 btc.
For the third condition, priority is calcualted as follows:
    priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
So you can increase the priority by a) adding more bitcoins to the output transaction or b) waiting for some time.
Hard to tell how exactly you would go ahead to spend your 0.07 bitcoins without any more details. You could also wait for the next version of bitcoin-qt which should introduce some smarter fee calculations (even though I am not sure whether that would solve your problem or not).

As soon as the fad dies out, people will just exchange it for whatever is the new cool thing at the time, or they try to get bitcoins for it so they can actually use it. Trading useless coins back and forth for sexcoins and bbqcoins in the hope that one of them might become worth real money for whatever reason only goes so far.

@_date: 2013-12-18 13:56:52
In case people don't understand what you were trying to say:
A falling bitcoin price means some miners pay more for electricity than they make by selling the mined bitcoins. Therefore they stop mining while the price is below their profitability threshold. This in turn means the hashing power in the whole network is now too low compared to the mining difficulty, and thus mining a block will take longer (= longer confirmation times). But it also means it will take a lot longer than usually until difficulty gets readjusted to reflect the reduced hashing power, because 2016 blocks have to be mined before that happens.

The messages you see attached to transactions on blockchain.info are NOT part of the bitcoin protocol. This functionaliy is merely a feature of the blockchain.info wallet (under 'custom send'). The messages are not stored in the blockchain, they are stored on a server that belongs to blockchain.info.
If you want to add a message to an address instead of a transaction, you can use the tag feature of blockchain.info:   (again, this is not part of the bitcoin protocol).
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:33:02
It's really not as simple as that. It's more of a dynamic self-regulating process. 
1. A lot of miners have very low cost of mining.
2. Miners have an investment to protect (ASICS cost a lot of money), so they have a strong incentive to keep the nework alive, even if it means mining at a slight deficit for a while.
3. Mining difficulty will get readjusted to make it easier for the remaining miners to solve a block, and therefore make it profitable again.
4. Not everyone is strictly mining for a profit, some people have a different motivation to make Bitcoin a success.

That's such a stupid argument. If I thought litecoin was a good thing then I would just buy some. If I thought litecoin would take away from my bitcoin investment, then I would just buy some. Nothing stops bitcoin holders from buying stupid altcoins. They just don't want to, because they think altcoins are useless (at least for the moment). All the altcoin supporters cite the same fake arguments you do over and over again. Ohhhh competition is good! Ohhh innovation blahblah! No it's not just good because those are words that get thrown around everywhere. What the bitcoin movement needs right now is adoption, and altcoins don't help. That is all. Innovation and competition can come once crypto currencies are accepted as such. Keep telling yourself you're in litecoin for "all the right reasons". The only reason you're really in it is resentment.

Sure it was supposed to be a joke and I am sure a lot of the "Bitcoiners" even thought it was funny. For a while! Then all the 12 year olds started spamming the same shit over and over in here, polluting every thread on with their tired memes and tipping everyone the equivalent of 0.02 cents. And that's when it stopped being funny and became nothing but annoying.

Yes, I also thought I should probably clarify that :)
Anyway, at the moment people are blindly buying anything that somehow has coin in its name, so I'm not even surprised to see dogecoin become "a thing". I actually like it, because it might help some people realize how stupid the altcoin market has become.

In my opinion, tipping just for the sake of exposure is counter-productive at this point. People know about Bitcoin by now. It's not necessary to spam other subreddits with tips. Just look at the dogecoin spammers, they are nothing but annoying to everyone.
I say tip a comment because you think the comment deserves it, and also tip a good amount and not just 20 cents.

Ok I was expecting you to ask why you should be worried. Anyway here's why: The current litecoin price is largely based on the speculation around rumours that some big exchanges (namely btcchina and mtgox) will be integrating litecoin trading in the near future. In the light of recent events this scenario became a lot less likely, especially for btcchina. So if in the beginning of next year mtgox doesn't come through with their promises, litecoin will probably fall back to levels where it was 2 months ago (which was sub $10).
Because let's be honest here, litecoin has zero utility right now and there is no reason for anyone to use litecoin instead of bitcoin for anything other than pure speculation.

I think you're confusing inputs with outputs here. A transaction takes a number of inputs and creates a number of outputs. Generally it's only two outputs: Your 'payment' and the change. But it could of course be many more outputs. Either way, every output generated by the transaction has to be 0.01 BTC or larger.

I think Coinbase as well as the two big exchanges MtGox and Bitstamp are fairly safe. Of course there's always a small risk, but nothing to lose sleep over.
With all the other sites and exchanges however (especially ones that try to stay anonymous like btc-e) I would be very careful and only leave it on there if you absolutely have to.

Please don't take investment advice from reddit.
There is a good chance the price will go up, and there is an equally good chance the price will go down. If you want to invest into a highly volatile market, then Bitcoin is perfect for you. If you don't think you can stomach huge swings, then better buy some government bonds.

I would have to agree with beaker38 on this. I think setting up a website and detailing what the funds go towards is the easy part. The hard part would be to get people to trust you.

People care about the dollar. People don't care about altcoins.

It can't. It will only go mainstream when there's easy to use and secure wallets that the average joe can handle. But there is no reason to think this won't happen. It is in fact quite a nice business opportunity right now.

Mining bitcoins has one big advantage over buying bitcoins: Mined bitcoins can in (almost) no way be tied to your identity. So if someone is interested in acquiring bitcoins that are as anonymous as possible, mining is their best bet.

Only small amounts. Ridiculous fees. Have to buy SLL first and convert into BTC I think.

It's really not the same. Tipping bitcoins in other subreddits had the effect of raising awareness when most people had no idea what Bitcoin even is. But people in are largely aware of altcoins, so tipping accomplishes nothing, it's just really fukcing annoying.
That said, I think most people have heard of Bitcoin by now so spamming 20 cents tips everywhere is probably counter-productive. Tipping should be reserved to reward good, funny or insightful comments, and the amount should be appropriate.
Anyway, if someone tips $0.0002 dogecoins or whatever, that's just plain retarded and should be considered spam.

Funny thing is that it probably is a good time to buy for people who were looking to get in. But it's always a lot harder to buy when gloom and doom is the predominant feeling and a lot easier when we're going to the moon. Humans are really bad at making rational decisions.

Uh, don't get me wrong. I don't know anything about YOU. I was just addressing the common litecoin supporter. Maybe you're the exception. Still doesn't change the fact that the driving force behind litecoin is resentment and personal greed at the cost of the poeple who try their hardest to make bitcoin happen. I see you as leeches, nothing else.

Have you read the NYT article OP posted? I just did and I must say, I expected a whole lot more from someone of the caliber of Paul Krugman.
For one, it appears that he does not understand (or at least does not acknowledge) the fundamental role of the proof-of-work function in the Bitcoin network as a decentralized and trust-less system. I would even go as far as to accuse him of either not having read the Bitcoin whitepaper, or deliberately misrepresenting its implications. I am not sure which would be worse.
His whole argument can essentially be summarized as "the intrinsic value of gold is less than the harmful externalities associated with its mining process. And therefore mining bitcoins is even worse because they have no intrinsic value at all. Thus Bitcoin is bad."
Please! Tell me that I am wrong here! Because if that is his whole line of reasoning, then he just lost a whole lot of my respect (for whatever it's worth).

Personally I think it's a good time to buy, because as you said, it is oversold mostly on rumours. A lot of people have learnt about Bitcoin only this month and more will hear about it over the holidays. It's reasonable to assume that interest will spike again in the beginning of next year. Now the question is will it go any lower between now and then or not? Well nobody knows.
