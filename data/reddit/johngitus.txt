better return on investment. It's the second most popular cryptocurrency and the difficulty to mine it is still relatively low. If you cannot get your hands on bitcoin ASICs litecoin is your best bet.

There's nothing to stop a user from sending a game to a person who has sent them bitcoins.

If the media is any indication of how the government might be viewing btc, I don't really think they are going to do anything like start calling people terrorists. I think the government will be primarily concerned with getting their share of taxes from the exchanges.

I got in at 6, though I spent most of my btc on drugs, I'm still feeling like a Rick Ross type person.

I've heard this a lot today. You cannot realistically expect an exchanger, even Gox, to be prepared for this amount of transactions. On top of this, there is evidence that gox is being target by a .02 transaction spam. 
The solution here is simple; use a different exchanger. If more people did this there would be better universal rates and people wouldn;t have to wait on Gox.

I started at $6. Spent most of my wallet on drugs. I regret nothing.

Thanks it's about time someone posted this! I was on the verge of ramming my head through my monitor and that would be painful because it can take up to 30 minutes for capacitors to discharge..

Why not try mining in litecoins?

Imagine how simply it would be to transfer funds to an exchange is all the verification was not required. A lot of the reason one has to go through so many channels and processes to move cash to the exchange is because the exchanges have to deal with the banks.

It appears so. Bitcoin just didn't have an infrastructure to support this much attention and it was to difficult for new users to adopt quickly. In an ideal world the bitcoin millionaires will spend their money to support Bitcoin by building the infrastructure up and supporting innovative ideas. The best thing we can do is prepare for the next spike.
