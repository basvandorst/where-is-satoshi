Here's the MtGox chart for reference:

I literally laughed out loud when you suggested using log scale, because you most likely didn't realize that log scale not only accentuates spikes, it accentuates flatness.
So the log scale chart turned out of course to be even more flat than the linear chart

Why would that make me, or anyone else for that matter, buy Bitcoin?

Perhaps I should phrased it differently so that it was more clear what I meant: Because Willy is gone, there is no actual support above $10, beyond the human traders. But we now know that the human traders didn't and still don't account for much (just look at current volumes compared to the Willy-era for instance). So there will be some support, but not much. The people who bought in at high levels will crush any support - this is why I conclude in my post, 'Once the support is tested significantly, the price should go down like a hot knife through butter'.
To affirm once more, I didn't mean to say Willy was support; I'm saying there is no actual support, since the supposed support is proven to be fraudulent

I doubt it. MtGox held a unique position. When they started they were pretty much the only exchange. Even after the 2011 hack, they remained the largest exchange until late 2013 (or early 2014?).
I don't think there's going to be another exchange quite like MtGox.
You have to keep in mind also that these were interally-run bots that bought/sold without fees and without anyone able to prevent it. It's not like a bot simply running an algorithm from the outside of an exchange.

OK, here's the chart in log scale:
