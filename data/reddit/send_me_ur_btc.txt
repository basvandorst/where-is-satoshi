Damn, that's a pretty nice boat. Looks quite liveable too. How much do those tend to cost to buy and maintain?

If you throw up an eBook on a website somewhere and make it purchaseable with crypto, I'd happily buy a copy.

Can you link a source please? I didnt hear anything about this.

Do you have to pay taxes (other than regular sales tax/VAT) if you buy something using btc?

It is already difficult to buy crypto in some areas,  I'm a little worried that they would go as far as to outright ban fiat on/off ramps. You'd have no option but to use cash which I feel is much less anonymous and more risky.
Then again, banning things (see: alcohol, drugs, internet access) has a funny way of making them even more valuable and sought after.

Then how come some bitcoins can become 'tainted'?

I know this has already been mentioned, but get your coins off Coinbase asap.
Not yo keys not yo coins.
Seriously, don't procrastinate.

More like Catoshi.

I just wish Bitcoin was actually fungible and private. I think those are the two main issues I have with it.

I just finished reading this and really enjoyed it. 
Some fantastic explanations and analogies in there.

Where do I start if I'd like to eventually get into blockchain development? 
Python? Any good resources?

No Antonopoulous? :(

I'm a bit confused, what is this graph showing? Can you break it down for me? Thanks.

Very well said. 
Are there any other great thinkers (and doers) like Andreas that you'd recommend? I can't get enough of his talks and books. I wish there were more people talking about the tech rather than the price.

I agree with you on most points but: 


I don't think it *should* have plenty to show. It still works the same way it did 10 years ago, and the protocol holds up. In a young industry like this rife with scams, shitcoins and centralization, that means a lot. 
If it were so easy to make changes to BTC, we'd be dealing with bigger problems than forks like BCH and BSV.
