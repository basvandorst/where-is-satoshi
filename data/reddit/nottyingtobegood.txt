Download an android app called "bitcoin accepted here" When I was in Tokyo I sat down and had dinner then got lit at a bar with bitcoin. Bitcoin is more widely accepted for transactions than gold.

What's funny is that Amazon just orders from Alibaba and stocks a warehouse for quicker shipping.

As an American, I strongly disagree and so does our fourth amendment.

I'm not sure. I do know that it will have to have its own personality. If it looks too similar to another website people tend to view it as "offbrand" or a clone instead of a unique thing.

Yes I did. I'm personally just excited to see a site paying out in BTC in general. I'm personally a hell of a lot more motivated to do something for bitcoin than I am in dollars. Bit of user feedback so far. Usually when you log in to a website, it redirects to the main page to start viewing content. I was confused where to go after logging in. Figured it out though. Other than that I think it just needs to be made a little more pretty. It's hard on the eyes right now.

Here is a link where I explain how this would work lol

Thank you for your input.
I'm coming from Maid Safe actually but substratum does look solid and more what I'm looking for. Here's the topic where I present my idea to the members of Maid
As you can see the members saw it as a fail as it required another layer for network routing. It seems substratum is a decentralized server that has routing in mind. Thank you very much for the suggestion. I'm not too sure about substratums reward method though. They seem to rely on inflation to reward nodes. The method I was trying to propose was using an already existing coin to encourage free market economics. I'm not sure if substratums reward methods would encourage people to go out and pay $300 in equipment required to be an ISP in a local network like I think using bitcoin for the reward system would. Its all speculative of course and as always, may the best system win.

See this video is supposed to be a link in a longer line of text where I explain that by using bitcoin we can incentivise people to be each others ISPs using these devices which would create a mesh.

Okay, I don't know why it didn't let me type text with my link. Maybe I'll try again.

I noticed it is annoying.

The monetization method would encourage people to do something more like this
