Yep, I'd be fine with that.  it's the line out of the top and bottom that confuses it

Though it may not be a problem due to moving almost exclusively to digital writing, drawing this symbol by hand repeatedly would be a nightmare, there is no flow to it.

Well, with that comment you added some facts (albeit with no sources)
I was just pointing out that your first comment is like saying, "All christians rape little boys." Yeah, some do, but most dont. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:37:56
This statement is devoid of fact and patently racist.
@_date: 2018-10-06 21:39:25
Well said.

Looks like it worked wonders for the owner, after all they were able to move out.
Maybe they broke the bank on the miner and went homeless

Indeed. Came here to say this.

Price goes up. Someone did research on it and many bitcoin have been lost from this exact circumstance already.  Sadly I do not have the link, maybe someone else does.

But on a real level, this may be a thing eventually. Keep your totals secret.

The top one, bitcoin (BTC)

You all really put on the tin foil hats for this thread. 
There was a flaw with 2fa on iOS from what I've gathered. They messed up big, but that's why they had the foresight to set up the safufund .  I dont see any inclination of foul play, seeing that they are attacked by hackers on a regular basis.

Make sure you invest in a good project. Set it down and wait a period of time. If you were right about the project being good you may make some money.
Xrp, for example, just randomly jumped 10% in the last hour.
Your satoshi value is actually the fiat translation of current speculative value, so if your alt is worth 10c each and bitcoin doubles in value your alt is still worth the same usd, so it has lost satoshi value. While maintaining fiat value.
I prefer alts, I think there are more exciting things happening with them than bitcoin right now. Just a personal opinion, though.

There are many reasons, transparency and immunity to inflation come to mind.
