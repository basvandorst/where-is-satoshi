Agreed. But centralized exchanges are just as likely, if not more, to freeze or lock your account if you don't comply with them, which is the example you gave.

Haha you shouldn't be putting money into something you don't understand. From what I understand, you buy a certain amount of hashrate, and you will get paid out daily.

Define high price? For something that started as fractions of a penny, I'd say anything over a couple bucks is a "high price". It has stabilized many times over the years, and will continue to do so. Each time at a higher level than the previous spike. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:13:54
It adds up. Definitely not to 21 but it adds up

My pops committed suicide one year ago after two tours to Afghanistan in 2011 and 2014. I built Bitcoin Charity to highlight a different non-profit each month. For July, Bitcoin Charity has partnered up with Continue Mission, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization serving Veterans with service connected physical, mental, and emotional injuries.
"We aim to inspire, empower, and involve Veterans and their families and referred Service Members in recreational and educational programs that promote health and wellness and positive life changing experiences. We are dedicated to raising mental health awareness and taking an active role in suicide prevention."
If bitcoin sign guy can get over $15k, let's do something good with bitcoin!

Understandable, and thanks for your reply. Thinking long term, I want to highlight a different charity each month and become a bitcoin donation platform. Only way I can think to prove the money is going to the charity is to post pictures, and hopefully after a few successful campaigns with proof of donation it will build credibility. Have to start somewhere though!
