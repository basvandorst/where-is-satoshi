I will openly admit I partially do it because I am bored and the rapid rise and eventual fall of BC will be the first boom and bust I will be able to watch first hand to know how to spot and deal with it in the future. Also because like trying to understand religious folk my brain wants to try and see the rational behind the people who try to invest and promote this despite clear signs of danger and past examples.

People don't keep tens of thousands of dollars in their physical wallet. Also I do believe that would count as a fallacious argument, not sure which though. Economies function on free-flow of currency. People keeping their BC wallets offline is the equivalent of people storing money under the mattress vs using a bank during banking crisis.
As an armchair economist I would say the reason bitcoin is so valuable right now is because buying in is easy, cashing out for anything other than gift-cards is hard.

For fear of this going on too long. I will say I believe that farmers who have more value on seed than gold are a separate market from those who have industrial uses for gold. It is like a country looking upon another countries' currency with less value due to lack of reason to trade with that country or whatever political game. Intrinsic value of an item is limited to the market that sees value in it. 
You could then though say that those in the BC market see a high value in it. As a transaction facilitator I can see that value but people who see it as an investment vehicle simply because of it's current fad status and market trends boggle my mind. If you remove the investment portion of BC's current gains likely it would go back to prices back before the media attention, similar to the original image I posted and the longer it takes for the return to mean, the greater the consequences on the people still invested.

Not my pic. Stolen from a site detailing the lifetime of a fad investment.

To me intrinsic value should be the standard by which a commodity is judged. It is the base line by which you can make a safe assumption of 'Ok this is used in 'this' industry so if the price crashes the industries which use such a commodity will act as bottom feeders since it greatly improves their bottom line.' So intrinsic value provides a backing by it's very nature.
Fiat currency does have a backing, at least to me that backing is the collective weight a country has in the open market and other political forums.

And yet BC still seems to follow this img almost perfectly.

It is my understanding that due to the way Bitcoin works improving the processing capabilities of BC would require something equivalent to a country changing their currency and making the old currency obsolete.

A payment system that
1. Cannot handle the load of processing a normal market's transactions
2. People who make their currency easy to access have lost near billions from exchange hacks.
3. Has no fallback if the market crashes or the equivalent of a bank goes under.
4. You are being ridiculous if you believe the current trend of increase in BC does not come primarily from people using it as an investment vehicle.

It really must suck for your position to be so faulty you have to resort to Ad hominem attacks to justify your views.
I hope you will sort out your debating skills/position sooner rather than later.
good luck

Can you please point me in the direction of this information? I am curious to read up on it.

I relish the thought of some poor sod encrypting hundreds of dollars worth of bitcoin then forgetting the password.

There are many who believe regulation is a mark of legitimacy.

Exactly how much Bitcoin has been stolen in the past few years from exchanges and person-to-person attacks. Now Overstock has a no questions asked way to liquidate that currency into physical objects. Of course it will have a high rate of sale.

But how long do you think till BC levels out or where the mean will be? BC is essentially a method of exchange and investment that solely has value due to the fact that people think it does. I personally can't think of any other currency or investment in the modern world that has survived long-term with absolutely nothing backing it besides the collective will of the masses. BC may possibly be a first of that kind but the chance of that, given the volatility of the market is slim.
