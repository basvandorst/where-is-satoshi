AFAIK you will need to generate a new wallet because the private key will be generated on the Keepkey using the relevant BIPs and won't be shared with Electrum.
The forthcoming Electrum 2.7 (I'd expect a release or at least release candidate within the next week) is changing the keystore so you can use a HW wallet as part of multi-sig. AFAIK you will be able to do this with two HW devices of your choice (two or a mix of Trezor, Keepkey, Ledger) or keep one key on the PC while the other comes from the HW device.
Edit: fixed version number

I'm with you here. I believe it's always possible for a major event to be conspiracy of some sort rather than coincidence.
There are a lot of conspiracies in the world as such. Obviously the nature of conspiracies is to cover them up. On a meta level as well. If you look at who marketed the term "conspiracy theory" in the 60s and know that conspiring is basically their job description it becomes clear that there is a long going trend implanted in society to taboo such topics and discredit and ridicule those who try to point out such dealings.

The idea is to follow the "longest chain" - i.e. that the majority of miners build upon to increase the block height. Those that don't get built upon and aren't referenced in the longest chain which adheres to the rules of the client are considered "orphaned".
See aantonop's Mastering Bitcoin: [Mining and Consensus]( especially towards the end there's a section about forks
AFAIK if you have a permanent fork your full node would only validate blocks which adhere to its rules, throwing away the others, which leads to a longest chain for the particular ruleset. If no miner is mining that ruleset then it's essentially orphaned as you don't get new tx.

The common vector is javascript code on a malicious website scanning and connecting to the RPC interface for electrum running on localhost. More modern browsers do not allow https (website) to http (RPC) access to localhost, so the attacking website commonly has to be http only as well.
It can only steal funds if your wallet is passwordless, which is not usually the case. It's serious in that RPC can also be used to change settings in the electrum config.

Actually up to 70 cents on the dollar because of income taxes, energy taxes (on gasoline and power) and on top of that value added taxes. 
This is then combined with social security insurances which are inefficient (overpayment on unemployment benefits which you could save yourself for, state pensions which largely pay out the same regardless of how much you have to pay in, expensive health insurance which is only useful for serious injuries as the level of treatment for all other medical conditions is sub-standard and best paid for privately).

However there is still little to no currency competition. The landscape in which central banks operate on a global scale is largely the same: issue debt based token to support governments being able to fund war and welfare through issuance of bonds. Basel regulations still favor government bonds as secure assets for banks to buy with little to no core capital required.
The FED is one of the largest buyers of USDT bills to keep the yield curve down and the ECB is intervening in bond markets by buying up corporate and governement bonds. It does not sound so separated to me.

noscript will have saved you the day on shady websites. There are no reports of this being used in the wild. As long as your wallet also has a password to spend (sign) there was no theft possible. 
If you have a password there is no unlocked timing state (like for Ethereum) where the RPC could have had access to the funds.
RPC can change settings so that is serious in that you can probably devise some elaborate attack - but this would be known if it happened in the wild. I do expect crackers (the hacking type) to write exploit code as I write this.

It does not matter much if TLAs are nodes as it's onion routed. Some attack scenarios on Tor apply here too and could need some more obfuscation on protocol level.
Granted, choose your channel partner wisely - it might be subverted by TLAs or have to comply with them. The same applies for exchanges as well but channels and nodes can be created permissionless which means it's easy to supply alternatives.
This really makes the case for smaller providers of channels in jurisdictions with less interference. Just like you might want to use protonmail over gmail...

Paying for monitoring is a lot less than paying tx fees. Probably like one tx on BTC these days for the whole year or something.
I'm learning more about this as we discuss this thread. It looks like the service might need paying only on results - i.e. if it claimed funds for you. From the whitepaper:


If this means there can be competition of watchdog services then you can choose one when you establish the channel. Having a choice for each channel means decentralization is possible by design. Obviously you cannot force decentralization but it's important to design it that way.

Thanks for your insightful post. I think we might have to look at it from a wholistic point of view: Automation / AI, the change on work it has, the change crypto and AI will have on organisations and how we do business. 
So while fiat currencies are in dire need of a debt jubilee of some sort (aka currency reform) it'll be interesting to see how other techological shifts will influence monetary policy and whether currency competition with scarce cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can have a checks and balances effect on government spending / fiat printing.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:53:45
As a world currency to settle commodities the US FED / government is in a special position to expand the money supply as it can export inflation. Governments like Venezuela, Argentina or Zimbabwe don't fare so well when they do similar things.
Which books would you recommend on modern monetary history echoing your insight? 
It's not easy to understand and from what I understand it has worked fairly well post WW II and post Bretton Woods after closing the gold window. I don't believe this will work forever - not even for USD or EUR or CNY or JPY. Especially raising interest rates significantly from the low rates central banks have nagivated into to thwart the 2007/8 crisis and stimulate the economy afterwards seems infeasable without creating excessive debt burden (GDP / govt debt + liabilties ratios). I only really see the solution in some currency reform in major currencies at some point to reset the fiat system to work another half century. 
Now with the new paradigm of crypto currencies, why exactly would savers prefer to be expropriated by their governments rather than using currency competition to divest to something perceived scarce? It does not have to be crypto currencies it could be precious metals too. Promises to pay and trust in certain puchase power is central to debt based fiat systems. As David Graeber shows in "Debt: The first 5,000 Years"  monetary systems have been oscillating perpetually between periods paper and credit / debt based money and periods of commodity / metal money. So to me it seems like a possibility this will happen again.
Regaining this trust in fiat currencies will be hard for governments with a modicum of democracy left. In fascism you might not need such trust, you just force people to use your currency, so this might also be a way to go - obviously not one I would like to see. Cryptocurrencies might win currency competition and curtail the possibilities of governments to refinance itself. See [this posting of mine from three years ago](

no, separate instances. one is crypt of wallet info the other is crypt of seed / signing procedure. it crypts wallet content against a pub key in wallet so opening it is like one execution of decrypt. 
As of 2.8.0 there is optional (but default) full wallet file encryption. It works as follows (taken from the release notes):
Release 2.8.0 (March 9, 2017)
  * Wallet file encryption using ECIES: A keypair is derived from the
    wallet password. Once the wallet is decrypted, only the public key is retained in memory, in order to save the encrypted file.

 * They don't use segwit. 
 * They have made no announcement about supporting LN. 
 * They force you to use BIP70 invoicing
 * They charge unreasonable network fees for Bitcoin (while you also pay the tx fees anyway) even when mempool is clearing at 1 sat/byte
 * They don't support replace-by-fee properly

Greater fools theory applies to fiat. The illusion of growth through printing money works fairly well until there is a strong dis-balance between the amount of finite goods and an ever increasing amount of fiat currency.
Not to say there is no growth at all - but measuring inflation as price increase (rather than increase in money available) and then postulating real growth on that measure is ingenious.

It's the lesser evil. You can create electric energy with renewables - this cannot be done with most consumer goods. Instead of debt based money which needs economic growth mining can be self-regulating. However if you can use limitless fiat money to consume fossil fuel energy then this shows the limits of growth in a fiat system. Energy has to be more expensive, then there would be less crypto mining with less energy use. At the end of the day it matters less whether it's used to build a yacht or power bitcoin miners. If fiat allows it, it will be done.

Yes, you're right. Still if one of these hub/routing node channels is saturated and will not be re-balanced as there are no fows in the outbound direction, it makes sense for the merchant to close the channel and redeem the money.
Sure, once LN is all encompassing and can be used by merchants to pay for purchase of their raw materials or salaries of their personnel they don't even need to close most channels as there is no need to "cash out".

Quite some fixes from RC1, so do update to the final 0.5-beta release if you're running RC1
Nevermind the typos, I believe there is an error in the release notes (I haven't found an easy way to do a pull-request for release notes on github):
In the section "Reliability improvements to bitcoind backend" two distinct sockets are mentioned, with an example given as 
    lnd --bitcoin.active --bitcoin.testnet --bitcoin.node=bitcoind --bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332 --bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
I believe the two distinct sockets are called bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock and bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx and rather than calling them on different internal ports they are usually queried on the same port but using their distinct names. Unless I'm barking up the wrong tree completey the example should read:
    lnd --bitcoin.active --bitcoin.testnet --bitcoin.node=bitcoind --bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332 --bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332

All is not lost. The price might be down now. It's still up massively if you look at a 5 year time frame.
If you believe in your national currency, you will lose at best 1/4 of your purchasing power within 5 years or at worst everything, depending on where in the world you are and how much money your local banks create.
Bitcoin in 5 years will have less monetary inflation than almost all national currencies and partly because of that a huge number of users - directly or indirectly. 
Fiat funds wars, welfare and wasteful consumerism. Bitcoin funds financial freedom both in being apolitical and censorship, confiscation resistant, a tendency to save and indepencence of an unnecessary growth paradigm. It's something to believe in even if the price stays down for a while or even a little longer.

It means consuming the future - debts are meant to be repaid, however there is no realistic way to do so in a fiat money system as money evaporates when you repay debt and the system is based on debt growing indefinitely to have growth and be able to pay interest.
It usually leads to an imbalance between goods available and money issued. It's not sustainable forever. It facilitates monetary inflation, is a hidden tax on savers and favours those closest to issuing debt. It requires a debt jubilee from time to time to reset the monetary system. It can bring about civil unrest and/or (civil) war as a result of this reset.

Chinese minining pools could just leave the soft-limit at 8 MB regardless of the hard limit if that is what they are comfortable with in terms of risk / reward? 
Am I correct to assume it's more likely the miner who produces larger blocks (i.e. closer to 20 MB) who will have their blocks orphaned?
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:13:13
It's pretty interesting: Gavin is cautious about transactions fees but is leading to increase the blocksize limit. He assumes if more fees are available in the mempool, miners will increase their soft limit.
It works the other way around too: If there are too few fees in the mempool, miners can choose a low(er) soft-limit. 
If there are some benevolent miners which mine at x MB blocksize and include lots of free transactions and thus reduce the over all tendency for users to include certain a fee, then I guess so be it.
So I really don't get the argument about destroying the ecosystem with larger blocks. If the protocol lets them miners will ultimately decide the fees to blocksize ratio. No need for the core devs to steer it.

Public pools with 0kb blocks would get penalized by their users withdrawing hashing power. Self-miners have an interest to sell the Bitcoin they mine at a price, and 0kb blocks are hurting the eco-system, possibly lowering this price in the long run.

The advantage is speed, versatility of watching any address and scalability with multiple HD wallets. Electrum servers have the UTXO set available and clients can query it to quickly see the balance of an account or indeed any address. It's also fast in serving the history of transactions.

Except Bitcoin is not just a payment system but a currency too.
How much does a good payment system matter when the underlying currency is becoming worthless?
The contingency planning for the EUR as a currency is problematic: Debt is increasing exponentially, the ECB balance sheet is increased to keep bond interest rates down, banks and sovereigns afloat + the stock market up. This is to stabilize the value of EUR - within the mandate of the ECB: If it weren't the case the system would collapse leaving behind a nearly worthless currency. This will go on until the debt / tangible assets ratio is so bizarre that trust is lost by investors in the currency (i.e. everyone from lower-middle-class worker to commercial hedge fund). What's the contingency then? Currency reform? Bail-in? Hyperinflation bail-down (=chaos)?
Bitcoin may have other issues but it's always interesting to see the ECB talk about shortcomings of Bitcoin when their own product is weak by design.

When you intercept text messages all you can do is censor transactions by not forwarding them. There is no way to modify them as transactions messages are signed by your private key.

Actually it's the other way around. They are saying the Internet has value but TCP/IP does not. This is what they are used to and it's correct in the sense that you cannot directly invest in TCP/IP only a layer higher with companies making use of it to sell goods and services.

Strictly speaking you're right. To be able to pay you will have shown your ID at some point to get a bank account or credit card. That's the same with all online fiat trading plaforms. Obviously it's not completely anonymous - only in person cash can do that properly.
What I mean here is that the platform itself does not require to receive a copy of your ID, which is think is overstepping. I can see the need to avoid fraud (cracked bank accounts) but this can be achieved with other measures like postident. It should be enough to have a trustworthy person witness your identity a bit like with keysigning parties and not keep a copy for your ID papers.

Buying bitcoin should be as easy as opening a bank account. In Germany you can open a bank account by filling in forms and showing your ID card at the post office (PostIdent). 
Kraken currently requires you to submit a scan of ID and passport and a selfie of you holding it to use it within Germany which is way too intrusive for my liking. 
I hope this extended partnership with Fidor will make it possible to trade and covert Bitcoin by using a standard Fidor bank account opened with PostIdent.

There is too much risk of abuse for the benefit of fraud prevention it serves. If they lose my data or if it's intercepted anyone can open an account using copies of the pictures elsewhere. It's like handing out private keys.

That's correct but USD is the current world reserve currency and those other currencies have a floating exchange rate against the USD.

Sidechains will actually be good for decentralized decision making. It enables competition between chains while keeping the benefits of a strong core network with set rules and lots of hashing power.
Once there is one proper implementation for side chains there is little need to change the Bitcoin core protocol for new features. Most of these proposed possible future changes can be disputed by arguing to do this in a sidechain.
I see side chains as the "plugin-feature" for Bitcoin which will help to keep Bitcoin the major crypto currency. Obviously we need to be vigilant with changes to Bitcoin core, but making side chains work is useful and should be supported.

Concering privacy:
To avoid IP &lt;-&gt; address collusion you could use TOR to connect to servers. That said: The default behaviour in the code is not to log bitcoin addresses. The server would have to be malicious to monitor for this.
Other than that trustless is a bit different than privacy concerns.
Trustlessness is more about being able to verify whether the servers are sending you trustworthy data: a correct balance, correct tx data and not withholding transactions . SPV does a good deal of this for tx integrity. 
To verify that a client has received a complete and integer dataset there is ["proof of completeness"]( For the client to actually make use of it, the applicable root hash needs to be published in a decentralized way. There is work in progress to make use of this in the client.

Concerning gold:

Ex order 6102 was the beginning of the end of the current financial system really. In 1933 when the order was executed the US was coming from a gold standard based system. It's now coming from the debt based system it has evolved into and any trust left into the current system will collapse with another such order. It would come at a time of chaos were it'd be hard to enforce because there would be other, more severe problems to be dealt with.
Currently there's more of a psychological prohibition going on in gold with the price action. There's a reason for that. It keeps the current system running...

Bitcoin certainly does not make manipulation impossible but programmable money with an open ledger is more transparent and predicatable.
Success for Bitcoin also means success for currency competition. If I get to detect which system behaves honestly and get to choose which currency I use I can at least make an attempt to avoid the rigged ones. If I'm buying commodities, stocks, bonds today there is little to no choice how these are priced and settled - which leaves a lot of room for manipulation and little room for players in the market to avoid it.

There are CryptoNote based currencies like Monero (XMR) which solve this. They're currently not getting as much attention as they deserve.
But bear in mind: The Internet didn't go mainstream because you could send messages anonymous and/or encrypted. It went mainstream because it's the one-shop-stop for read/write communication in the 21st century. The need for anonimity and encryption are just about to get on people's radar.

I'd be happy if Bitcoin grew like Skype's [share of the international call market]( reaching 40% market share of international calls within 11 years of operation.
Skype was released in 2003 and had a market share of international calls just under 3% in 2005.
Unfortunately Bitcoin is not like Skype. The currency/money market is more heavily regulated (the telecoms markets were de-regulated long before Skype appeared) and it's not "free" to use. You have to put actual money in to make it useful or earn Bitcoins. 
Although if that means growth rate is halved and it takes 22 years for Bitcoin to achieve 40% of international money transfers that'd still be great :)

Moreove to buy into XCP (counterpary currency) you'll most likley buy into Bitcoin first and then convert to XCP and vice-versa. It's the same with most alt-coins.
Bitcoin has a good chance to remain the coin with the largest market cap and most fiat exchanges hence providing reserve-currency status for alt-coins

You're right: Taking advantage of arbitrage is easier with Bitcoin as it can be done completely electronically.
However even with gold I wouldn't expect the price to be 50% off depending on region.
There are Hong Kong and Sydney trading sessions in the futures pricing of gold and they operate on the last price seen on COMEX. Ideally those trading sessions would price-in local differences or those markets would stand for delivery of the futures contract to satisfy the higher physical demand but it doesn't appear to work.
I think it's an other good example that the price finding mechanism for a supposed global gold price in USD is broken. 
Bitcoin is often belittled because of the relatively low number of exchanges and trading volume but price finding across the world possibly works better than the gold market, with a market cap magnitudes larger than bitcoin. There are probably political reasons why the gold market pricing doesn't work efficiently but it's certainly interesting to keep an eye on.

A: Yes because word order matters it's hell of a lot of search space. I think it's more complex than a  random 20 chars alphanumeric + one special char password.
B: Basically you're adding extra work for the generation of seeds, which means a brute force attacker needs to do the same work. It'll take longer for each attempt.
According to ThomasV "Electrum does 100000 iterations of sha256, which is equivalent to adding a few extra bits of entropy to the seed. " and "Electrum's key stretching is not intended to protect the seed against someone having an encrypted seed and bruteforcing AES. It is there only to make the seed a bit stronger, in case a user uses a custom seed instead of the 128 bits of entropy provided by the software." 
C: This is true, however there's a trade-off between usability and security which is high enough for the set list. Moreover humans tend to be bad at picking things at random which can be disasterous to security. It's best to let a random number generator or roll of dice pick the seed.

Because there was a commit to the codebase disabling basic functionality when the project was officially abandoned. TCnext is a promising attempt of a fork.

Yes you're certainly right - a lot of banks just raised their core capital in the tune of the Bitcoin market cap because of Basel III requirements. Too bad most are holding them in government bonds which are considered a Tier I asset, when in fact those are just debt with increasing risk of default as debt ratios are going up. Obviously a genius part of the bank &lt;-&gt; govt "agreement" to allowing the banks to issue debt and governments to sell bonds to banks.


The way I understood it is - they just have to comply with a core capital requirement laid out by Basel III of like 7-10% (used to be less). That would allow them to leverage debt to deposit at least 10 times. Lots of banks have leverage ratios of 10+, some like Deutsche Bank 40+. Central bank base money: For example in Europe it's only at 1% reserve requirement, the US has it at 10%.
Then there's a lot happening off the balance sheet - namely derivatives. Some of which aren't priced correctly because IFRS allows for "fair value" accounting. This way the don't have to write off all losses. If they had to it would severely impact their liquidity. 
Edit: I certainly oversimplied a couple of things in here (i.e. govt debt is not a tier I asset itself but can be used in the Risk-Weighted Assets and so forth but the general idea is right) - just one source for those interested

IIRC Satoshi's  choice of using curve cryptography was with performance in mind. 
Hyperelliptic curve cryptography might have appealed to Satoshi because of the further optimizations possible. I believe Hal Finney wrote code to make use of these optimizations in bitcoin, yet it's interesting Satoshi apparently didn't point it out to Hearn. Edit: This might help finding Satoshi BTW ;) he wouldn't point out if he was into hyperelliptic curves because it could give him away...
There's a book by Neil Koblitz with the title [Random Curves: Journeys of a Mathematician]( where he briefly writes about his work at Certicom the company developing secp256k1 using the properties of a hyperelliptic curve as discoverd by Koblitz
I think it's a smart choice by Satoshi to pick something that doesn't get used much and hence is less likely to be manipulated. For example see
 :


    Not part of NSA Suite-B cryptography selection
    Not part of ECC Brainpool selection
    Not part of ANSI X9.62 selection
    Not part of OpenPGP ECC extension selection
    Not part of Kerberos extension for ECC curve selection
Not being part of an NSA cryptography selection is a merit these days :)

The analogy here:

Gold is a different beast but MtGox and Comex may share some similarities here if it turns out to be true that delivery of gold in Asian markets has such a high premium over an alleged "world price" for gold.
More analogy - you couldn't get Bitcoin out of MtGox as of early February. While not impossible COMEX mostly settles for cash and doesn't like to deliver outside a system of a few registered dealers.

Congratulations on winning and congratulations to writing it. It's pretty good. The statements are pretty bold and that's intended to make it powerful. 
I like that you introduce the concept of control using signing keys to move coins rather than "owning" coins in the physical sense.
It leaves out the aspects of "open source" of the code, "transparency" of the blockchain and actual "signing" to move coins to a new address but that might be too much for an introduction anyway. It can be improved in places and around th edges but even if you don't it's a good shot.

I'm based in Germany and have recently used Kraken to buy Bitcoin. However they started to ask for scans of ID cards and passports and selfies holding them to use their services with German bank accounts.
I've now tried out Litebit.eu three times and can report it works surprisingly well. There is a 1-3% markup to the bitcoin.de price but I'm happy to pay that for not having to send in scans and photos.
You start out with a limit of up to 50 EUR for your first SEPA and if that goes through you can buy up to 500 EUR / day in the first week. After 7 days there are no limits afaik but I guess 500 EUR / day will do for most users.
Litebit.eu is not a trading platform but instant buy / sell. For SEPA transfers they'll use their exchange rate at the time they get the funds coming in, so it might differ from when you make the purchase or sell. 
SEPA usually takes 2 days rather than 1. They use pay.nl as a trustworthy payment provider. You can also use credit cards (another 5% markup and after a week of signing up) and various direct online banking solutions like SOFORT.
I'd say for anyone who is looking to buy a smallish amount without hassle in Europe and can't / doesn't want to use Kraken, go for it...
If you know of other hassle-free services in Europe which are more competetive, let us know in this thread.

AFAIK you could pay the fees by using the unconfirmed tx as input of a second transaction with a fee usually accepted by miners. Some pools (or possibly only eligius) will then mine both transactions at the same time to snag the fee. 
The feature is called "child pays for parent" but it's not yet mainline (any may never be) - see relevant [Stackexchange Thread](
Obviously the first transaction with little or no fees needs to have propagated the network at all, but most clients these days will make sure this is the case.

You're right about trust issues and the ways to convert govt fiat to Bitcoin are to be improved - the blame is to be divided between the two systems though.
There are other - deeper trust issues at hand though: Do you trust your government and central banks to manage the value of currency. Because it's only a promise to pay debt and promises are progressively broken. Do you trust your bank to stay solvent or deposit insurance to actually work if multiple larger banks fail at once. Do you trust your government not to introduce a currency reform at some point to deal with high debt levels?
These are the sort of high-level things that crypto currencies like bitcoin can fix in a trustless, predictable, auditable environment.
I see the dilemma: It's a bit like Linux on the desktop. You could write a similar story about your experience with it. How the right mouse button behaved weird in one application you installed and why anyone living in the first world would not use a desktop operating system written by a commcercial company spending millions of dollars on usability.
Only when Microsoft remotely de-activates your operating system because they feel your license is invalid or you've used it unlawfully or intelligence agencies and other crackers break into it because you can't actually know what's under the hood - only then can you appreciate using a free operating system. Free as in free speech. A system I can trust because a community can audit it.

If you put your money on an exchange and there are no published verifiable proof of reserves  ([example Kraken]( it's possible these exchanges do not actually hold all of the Bitcoin deposited with them but lend some of them out or invest some of them otherwise.

Once all bitcoins are mined (and the bitcoin protocol has scaled) one block may well have 30k transactions. 
If the average fee to get into blocks is at 0.0001 (100 bits) that's 3 BTC for miners. To put things in perspective in late 2024 reward halving is expected to reach 3.125 BTC / block. 
If the fee drops to 10 bits then that's still like 0.3 BTC per block (perspective: block reward going to 0.39062500 in 2036) at 30k/tx. It all depends on the purchasing power of 0.3 BTC at the time.
Just to extrapolate:
If fees remain at purchasing power of what you can get for 0,1 USD (10 ct) and fees are go average at 10 bits then the price target for Bitcoin would be 10k/USD. (10 bits = 10 ct). Somehow I hope we'll reach a purchasing power of 10k/BTC earlier than 2036 but ah well....

Testnet can't be used to put economic pressure on miners.
If Segwit activates on Litecoin and value of Litecoin rises considerably after that then it's a vote for segwit by cryptocurrency users/investors. Bitcoin miners wouldn't like to see marketshare go to Litecoin (like with ETC) and might be tempted to enable SegWit.
BTW: There should be a BU fork with Segwit enabled so miners could choose to be big blockers and Segwit supporters at the same time. I don't see why it should be mutually exclusive from a miner's choice point of view.

Apart from the dust limit it's mostly a matter of the size of the tx. If you have lots of inputs for your tx it'll be larger than 1kb, costing more in fees. This can happen if you earn small amounts through CoinWorker types of services.

Yea the EUR is so stable and great that even the Swiss have decided to keep the peg indefinitely :)
EUR has lost half the purchasing power since introduction for day-to-day purchases. You just need to fill a supermarket cart and you'll pay double of what you'd pay 2002. It makes sense too looking at the increase of money supply which has increased manyfold.
Of course you can rig inflation statistics by working with hedonics.
The few exceptions like cheaper TVs and PCs are not a sign of increased purchasing power of EUR (or any other debt based fiat currency) but of innovation in the field.
Of course you cannot compare all of this to Bitcoin. It's still inflating in numbers heavily (~30% per year) and has a small market cap which makes it very volatile.

Great to see so much interest in this (upvotes!).
Please note: This is about securely invoicing people by email, saying "please pay me x bits to pay for y" and you have to actively accept and pay the invoice. 
I think it's ingenious because it builds on Bitcoin's paradigm of push payment rather than pull known from direct debit and credit cards.

Hardforks always create an altcoin, but only if it's actively mined and traded it's perceived as one.

He gives three reasons why
* 1) Independet of national economies
* 2) Untaxable money supply  (code as law, type of constitution)
* 3) Transitions nature of violence (wars are increasingly fought in cyber domain)
Interesting thoughts but the argument is not by itself convincing:
Bitcoin is transnational money but so is the Euro. The difference here is currency competition: Individuals use Bitcoin voluntarily and attach value (create demand) to a fixed, pre-determined supply.
At the end of the day functioning nation states have a limited frame in determining the value of money. Nation states have globally been debasing the current government fiat money at least since 1971 with the demise of the gold standard. They need to deal with this challenge presently in one way or the other.
Nation states have existed with and without sound money for the longest time. In fact as Graeber writes in [Debt: The First 5000 Years]( monetary systems have been perpetually oscillating between periods paper and credit / debt based money and periods of commodity / metal money.
With debts exploding at all levels (government, corporate and personal) nation states will need to re-value their currencies (reset) and re-gain trust. This is most easily achieved with using commodity based money.
The Internet allows individuals to join efforts outside the immediate nation state. Bitcoin offers a complementary way to transfer value globally over the Internet and is a viable competitor in offering commodity style money. Nowadays at least [50% of all US funding is from creating new debt]( rather than from tax income. Nation states unsuccessful to keep running or re-establishing a debt based currency will need to shrink the scope of involvment (war, welfare) as they rely solely on tax rather than creating debt.
Procurement of debt based money is a threat to democracy in nation states. Using force and violence to force debt based money onto people may work for a while but would ultimately threaten the legitimacy of the nation state as we know it. I'd expect several iterations to go from nation states with national identity, language and geographic ties to chaos to a completely decentralized and commercialized order.
TL;DR: Bitcoin does not by itself end the nation state. It's a question of how nation states deal with the the debt based monetary systems they currently have and what this means in terms of their future capabilities and trust. To gain trust they need to adapt and that may well mean using cryptocurrencies (national or international).

It would point to biflation:
"During biflation, there is a rise in the prices of commodity/earnings-based assets (inflation) and a simultaneous fall in the price of debt-based assets (deflation)." [Wikipedia: Biflation](
While debt-based assets are deflating, we're not seeing inflation in commodity prices like gold or oil for various reasons (demand + market manipulation). We're already seeing inflation in food prices, rent and so forth to the tune of 10% per year using 1980s metrics - see [Shadowstats]( .
In the long run we'll a) either run out of commodities at the managed price or b) interest rates will have to go up, stopping QE at the same time.
a) could lead to rationing, official price control and stopping free trade of commodities b) would lead to individuals, companies and nation states defaulting on their debt.
Both a) and b) lead to further loss of confidence in the fiat money system and general legitimacy of the state in the view of the citizens. Unless challenged by the citizens it'll lead to more centralization i.e. authoritarian regimes.
Question is: Is there enough time for Bitcoin to emerge as a winner of these developments? I believe the current system would need to keep working for ~5-10 years for Bitcoin and other P2P trends of decentralization to be able to absorb the vacuum left when a) or b) ultimately hits.

There's no need for a central bank to set interest rates. The market will determine them at the rate of people willing to take the risk of lending out the money. The risk being that they lose all or part of the capital stock they've lent out. Creditor default and inflation are two things to take into account.
I'd imagine interest rates for Bitcoin (in the absense of other credit markets) could be fairly high because it's less risk to just keep the coins stashed and wait for disinflation to do the job. I believe it makes other credit markets much for interesting for creditors.

I'm with you on the collapse of economy because of compound interest - it's one the reasons why fiat money systems commonly fail in hyperinflation because too many money units are held against a limited number of ressources.
What about the argument that there will always be people willing to lend at interest and there will always be people willing to take on a loan and pay interest (whether or not they can or should afford it). This will happen even in the absense of central banks or fiat money as we know it. 
What should society do? Ban it? Make sure there is no need to lend because ressources are distributed equally (in some form of communism)?
I wonder whether it's morally right to lend for pure consumption - which is increasingly happening because of a tendency to glorify shopping and consumption in our society. Because fiat monetary systems are based on the need of growth. 
I believe it's morally right to save first and then to spend. It's also right from an environmental point of view - rather than to waste ressources. There are valid uses cases for lending and borrowing money - like buying housing for a young family and indeed those good causes could be subsidized so that interest is at zero.
@_date: 2016-03-14 09:15:44
Thanks, I appreciate your insightful comments.
David Graeber points out in "Debt: The First 5,000 Years" that societies have been oscillating between periods of credit-money and periods of barter / metal money.
I believe if promises are broken in the credit based economy people will want to return to scarce metal type money where no liabilities exist in the issuance of the money. It might be more primitive but satisfies the safety needs innate to human nature.
I can see the need of credit expansion to finance activity but why shouldn't it possible to layer credit based contracts on top of a gold / bitcoin standard? It'd create a number of fractional reserve type of debtors (not necessarily banks) but at the end of the day there's still some trust anchor to go back to.
These days the way banks operate is that they have things like sovereign debt as underlying assets for their operation (debt based on debt) which is unsound. It's also increasingly tough to value debt if it's a perpetual / compound thing as you point out.
It'd be useful to have more transparency in dealing with credit issuance.

Verizon is possibly a network with a higher ratio of inbound traffic (think Netflix) than outbound.  I believe other providers have to pay upstream fees to connect to Verizon's network. 
If you want settlement free traffic exchange (peering) the exchanged inbound / outbound ratios with other larger Tier 1 carriers (Level 3, AT&amp;T, Telia, NTT) should match otherwise one party may have to pay.
This could be a legitimate way to boost ratios to achieve better peering arrangements with other providers while also being able to charge eyeball providers for more upstream.

Yes, naturally there needs to be a reset of balances at some point because interest tends to centralize balances to those who can lend out. 
However, I believe there needs to be some kind of mechanism to price the time preference to purchase goods. You can either do it now through debt and paying interest or you need to save first. If there is no interest rate, there's either no lending market and there is no other way than to save first and purchase when you have saved enough or it won't work either because naturally everyone would prefer a low time preference if it's for free.
Interest rates should reflect risk and defaults need to happen to leave the unwise lender without his original "wager" otherwise it certainly does end in hyperinflation.

2.8.x has CPFP (child pays for parent) built in.
Go to preferences and activate dynamic fees if that's not already set. You can then click on a "low fee" tx in the history and select "Child pays for parent". You then have a fee slider with "within 2 blocks" pre-selected from a dynamic fee. Click OK and the fee is bumped.
This will only work if you have change from the transaction to your own wallet (usually the case). Otherwise you can ask the recipient to do a CPFP on the transaction. The CPFP transactions in Electrum are by itself RBF, so you can further bump the fee after doing CPFP if needed (which means you could select a lower target like 25 blocks and bump further from there if you want to save on fees).
Make sure you select a server that runs Bitcoin core (the servers usually print what they are running in the console tab) because BU won't accept RBF and will prompt an error (you can still switch then). Most Electrum servers are running core though (I'd guess ~80%+), so it'll work out most of the times.
Edit: add info that CPFP in Electrum are by itself RBF and info about BU rejecting these. Add blurp about enabling dynamic fees in preferences first of all.

IIRC your mining software needs to be ready to make segwit blocks, otherwise the Bitcoin core software won't signal readiness.

Unfortunately because of replay attacks it's not that straight forward. The whole network sees your tx and can replay it on the other chain. That's why you have to split your coins by making sure all further attempts to replay will fail because you've successfully introduced constraints that will make it fail on the other chain.

Why not make it a command line option / GUI setting, defaulting to off. This way the community gets safely built binaries and can make its own choice. It's supposed to be "user activated" anyway. What's novel is that is needs to change the user agent string to signal (rather than some BIP9 bit).

It's not voting, it's signalling readiness. There's a good chance Litecoin will see this through. Might be a good investment for a short while and apply economic pressure to Bitcoin to get its act together.
Edit: Re cartel - is there or is there not a monopoly by Bitmain wrt to producing mining hardware? If there is how would it not lead to a supplier directly or indirectly being able to dicate the terms of how the hardware is used (if you wanted to keep the supplier relationship). I hope there will be more competitors in the space.

It's more complicated: Bitcoin is about achieving consensus and blocks depending on each other (creating the longest chain). 
Once you win the block you get to decide which transactions to include. If you were an altruistic miner you could act irrationally and include just low-fee or no fee transactions reaching you. In fact sure - there could be a mining pool of people supporting this endeavour.
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:42:00
Actually, given the choice between perpetual inflation and moderate fees for moving money, I'd prefer the latter because overall the benefits of not having to deal with bad money far outweighs the cost of fees.
There will be chains with both lower fees and perpetual inflation and it's certainly good to have this kind of competition.

The precious metal ETCs are a great way to get people to invest in paper assets, without requiring actual physical delivery to buyers. This opens the possibility of fractional reserve.

To my knowledge you have to make it available but there is no requirement to do so over the Internet and there is no hard timeframe to do so. 
BU could ship it out by CD-ROM by request - even for a handling fee and after a couple of weeks of handling time.
BU have not stated that they won't share code at all - much to the contrary they stated they will release code given some time to patch.

I took a while to get my head around this but I think market rates are meant to be in equilibrium: Market price of 1 BCC and 1 BCU should add up to 1 BTC not more and not less than 1 BTC. 
Everything else can be arbitraged if I understand correctly because you can either split BTC and then sell BCC and BCU or you can buy BCC and BCU and reverse split for 1 BTC.
Edit: Also if I understand correctly - as time moves on, all else being equal and no hardfork occurs, price should be in favor of BCC (closer to 1 BTC) because without a HF BCC are redeemed for 1 BTC regardless of market value on Jan 1st 2018, while BCU become worthless. 
Edit2: If you intend to hold until Jan 1st 2018, there's also competition from lending rates to take into account. There is opportunity cost splitting and selling BCU now while holding BCC for 9 months because it might be more attractive to just lend out the coins on the exchange. Bitfinex pays ~12% for 9 months at this time, lending rates on Polo are currently at a multiple of that, but it's obviously subject to change.

OK yes, electrum servers take their info from bitcoind estimatefee, which is pretty good but does take time to adjust when there are fee spikes. Consider using RBF (replace by fee). 
By marking a transaction replacable you can bump the fee from the GUI after sending it. This way you can even try with a lower fee and if confirmation time is becoming essential then upgrade it.

From what I understand: It doesn't matter. It's not about dictating anything to anyone. 
You'll have soft-forks which some miners may choose to support. You have a base of users running upgraded versions with the specific feature. Users use the features and a certain amount of miners mine blocks with it, so it can be used.
Think about CPFP: Not all miners do this, yet some do and it works as soon as such a block is mined.

The goal is to enforce the fundamental rules Bitcoin stands for and which are in the code since the early versions. If miners disrespect these rules and attack a possible minority chain (in terms of proof of work not users) which serves to hold up these rules then a PoW change is a valid and useful strategy. 
Changing Bitcoin for the worse wouldn't just set us back. It would destroy (the values of) Bitcoin.

  * The daemon requires wallets to be explicitly loaded before
    commands can use them. Wallets can be loaded using: 'electrum
    daemon load_wallet [-w path]'. This command will require a
    password if the wallet is encrypted.
  * Invoices and contacts are stored in the wallet file and are no
    longer shared between wallets. Previously created invoices and
    contacts files may be imported from the menu.
  * Fees improvements:

Obviously this is all rumor and what I've read is that you'd better withdraw than face rejection. If you happen to have wallstreet / SEC experience I'm tempted to believe you. 
FWIW I don't think rejection would mean no ETF for years to come, in fact I think chances are good for COIN or another one to go to market within 12-24 months. At least a rejection would give full guidance on the reasons for the rejection. It'd be very interesting to see what direction they are coming from - purely "wallstreet" technicalities or more towards Bitcoin tech. I for one think they need to be more specific with reasons to go with the chain that has less work on it in the event of a hard-fork.

Good point, there were no particular reasons mentioned. I took it as customary wallstreet gesture to save face / not damage the company or product. It might apply to those cases where you apply for a standard product and made a grave error which makes you look incompetent if you get an official rejection.
This is novel and by no means anything to be shameful of if rejected. At least it might mean there is no "wallstreet" technical error. So I guess it cannot be compared to previous filings and behaviour so we can throw the rumor out all togehter.

I did some research into the filing for a silver ETF by Barclay's back in 2005.
Silver is sometimes called the [achilles heel of the financial system]( as it's a precious metal that gets used up in industrial production which means stocks are routinely partly depleted and only partly go to investors. It's estimated that only about a yearly production is available for sale at any one time.
There was some worry by the SEC at the time that the supply in the silver market was too thin and could move the price substantially by allowing a large ETF. Yet it was filed in June 2005 and approved April 2006 although there was rumor of withdrawal inbetween. In the end a much lower initial deposit of silver at the custodian was ammended and done, which may or may not have had an effect on the approval.
Interestingly I haven't heard concerns by SEC or commenters about moving the Bitcoin market. I guess because it doesn't matter so much in that it's not a raw material used for production.
What follows is a link dump from my research:

Within the lifecycle of bitcoin there may be ways to recycle lost coins without increasing the 21 m cap.
For one Bitcoin may move to other signatures because ECDSA may be brute forced or weaknesses discovered which make "mining" for lost coins (which have not migrated to new signatures) a worthy cause.
A second possibility is to require coins to move once every ~10 years and to make coins which have not been used in such a time available as steady mining reward to delay halvening (thus boosting miner incentive). Obviously this is a hard fork and quite controversial but it'd be a clever way to keep the ecosystem from drying out b/c of lost coins without having to raise the cap.

This is all well said. What if interest is not in fact paid but the loans are distressed? There seems to be a moral virtue of paying off debts and interest on it which appears to be higher than the moral virtue of taking in compound interest. Shouldn't it be morally acceptable for loans to fail if the lender has made enough money off of it?
I'm not sure why it should follow that Bitcoin is a more primitive form of money. It's trustless in that there is no central authority to determine the growth of the monetary base - rather it's pre-determined and predictable for its users. Limiting the money supply is a feature of good money (in Gresham's terms) that benefits savers - especially those who don't want to take the risk of lending out money. With Bitcoin there simply can't be bail-outs in the form we've seen in the world economy in 2008, because the money supply is inelastic. Mt.Gox might have been bailed out in a fiat money regime because you can just print up the money there - it failed, sadly but rightly so in the Bitcoin economy.
Bitcoin certainly won't solve wealth inequalities but that's not the purpose of money as such.
With disinflation, credit allocation is not forced with Bitcoin. With Bitcoin there will be less loans than in the credit based fiat systems because the risk / return ratio is a lot lower. It might be prudent to just keep money saved up until it's needed. Of course there is the whole argument of stagnation if money is not moved. I believe it's important money is not moved for wasteful purposes - because of some need for it to be allocated. Money will be moved if what is offered matches what is demanded. It might mean less overall activity in good money. Currency competition is important here. There will and should be credit based alternatives to facilitate trade, which will and should fail as they become worthless because of broken promises or hyperinflation at some point.

It's the properties that makes gold and Bitcoin valuable.
Gold is a scarce element with all properties needed to make it good money. It lacks trust-free payment over distance, which is what Bitcoin is good at. However value for Bitcoin will always be a measure of its properites as well: Coin limit (scarcity), divisibility, fungibility, security / verifiability but also a high level of consensus (no random HFs)

This is how current economies work, granted.  You still might not want to save in the same currency if it's inflated heavily to serve the growth paradigm.
Economies in the past have worked on commodity based money, in fact [Graeber argues]( societies have oscillated back and forth between credit based and commodity based money. Investment is still happening, less of it of course.
I don't think we have to live like cavemen just because growth and with it resource consumption is not the top priority in an economy. [The Limits to Growth]( are well known for the better part of 50 years, so I would encourage people to be more open for a change in that direction.
Moreover just because something like Bitcoin exists does not mean you cannot have fiat debt based currencies alongside. If people are willing or forced to accept it, an economy can still function the same way as today. Bitcoin is merely a choice and currency competition - a very powerful one.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:55:35
I agree. It'll have to split and issue shares in the forked coin. It should still have strong(er) guidance which one it'll call Bitcoin and which one it'll give some Altcoin name.

All else being equal it might then still come down to the chain that (after some time) has the most work on it.

While lending is problematic when there is no chance to pay it back or indeed when debt in the fiat regime is the way to create (!) money, it's not necessarily a problem by itself. 
The problem is: Near zero interest rate, almost no risk of default and built-in necessity to having to issue debt to pay off older loan + interest.
Bitcoin will not and cannot solve inequality. It can solve transparancy of funds, more equal access to it and offer an incentive to save rather than to spend. It's dis-inflationary, scarce money and supports de-growth rather that the current wasteful, consumerist economic system. It will be expensive to borrow money. This is the environmental case for Bitcoin - nevermind the PoW.
A Bitcoin economy is lacking funds for war and welfare. Some people will not like this and choose to issue and accept fiat instead. However when you have choice, it'll be harder to make people accept such fiat in the future.

I'm actually really positively surprised by the CH Smith book. There are a lot of books about futarchy / automation / societal change / do and don't of basic income / socialism which are fundamentally flawed in that they think inside the box (i.e. leave out govt based money creation) and still view things from the old paradigm.
I thought I'd give "A radically Beneficial World" a chance, didn't expect much and thought I won't make it past 1/3rd of the book but it really strikes a note. At ~220 pages it's a fairly light read - the author even argues why that is necessary in a rather humorous way. OK, now I start soundings like a sales shill for the book, when I'm just genuinely enthusiastic about a good read. I guess I shouldn't praise it too much before finishing it - the spicier bits about presenting a solution are yet to come (and I don't expect to agree to all points).

I can only guess: There is a certain direction in which most news outlets / media reports. They are supposed to be objective and independent yet usually take on some form of political view point (towards right and left, or for example towards certain foreign policy goals of a certain nation) usually catered for by the publisher. As an example: The news you see on CNN have a certain agenda, as do the ones you see on Breitbart (calling each other fake news).
OP probably means this sort of political agenda can be applied to posters (writing in a certain direction from their opinion) / readers upvoting / mod policies (to remove things). I tend to agree. That's social life though. Communities are held together by beliefs. It'll be extremely hard to find a completely balanced media outlet. The solution here is to read more than one source, know where they are coming from and form your own opinion based on that.

From the conclusion:




The same is true for gold - most people don't own it. In the 20th century it was phased out as the money of choice backing debt. There are roughly 170 million kilo of gold overground, possibly half of it available for purchase. It was a fairly good investment to cover for asset price inflation, but it did not have the same gains in 50 years as Bitcoin did in 10 years. The reason here - except a brief period in the 80s - there was little necessity to hedge with gold, the fiat system just worked well and brought about ressource consumption and growth after two devastating world wars.
Being roughly even after the 2020 halving, gold will have a lower S/F ratio than Bitcoin in the halving ~2024, when only 3,125 BTC are produced per block, indicating higher scarcity for Bitcoin over Gold.
For Bitcoin to ultimately succeed, purely debt based fiat currencies of G8 states and with it the current banking system need to start failing. People need to discover official price inflation is understated and government liabilites in welfare / pension payments cannot be satisfied at the current purchasing power.
Chances for this to happen are high, the timing of the release of Bitcoin was ideal - even if the technology had already been available 20 years earlier. 
As the paper shows S/F only describes price discovery when there is huge demand for newly minted coins. Again this is the case when fiat is in crisis mode - as it has not been for the second half of the 20th century.

From my experience the fee estimate by bitcoin core (also used in dynamic fees in Electrum) works pretty well. I've not had to wait for more than 2-3 blocks let alone days or weeks. The usual fee is around 3-5 USD cents for a tx size of ~300 bytes, which is certainly not cheap or free but not exactly expensive either.

If you can control it directly or indirectly (like a centralized service) there is little need for censorship or detrimental laws. You can make use of state supervision as a tool of protecting your citizens from the dangers of certain technologies.
Bitcoin is fairly resistant against this, so we're likely to see (desperate) direct action. At the end of the day it's a free speech and freedom of contract debate - if you can communicate freely you can use Bitcoin. A state needs to be or become pretty authoritarian to ban that.
To come back to China: Recognizing virtual goods like Bitcoin as property is certainly an improvement. This does not mean that the use cannot be restricted by law. It might not be easy to enforce but there are capital controls for foreign currencies in place. I have no reason to believe those will suddenly vanish just because Bitcoin is indirectly recognized as property.

BTW the most profitable 20 year time-span for gold in the 20th century relative to the USD would have been to buy gold in 1960 and sell 1980  ~x16 gain.
Why? Not necessarily because gold is so great, because fiat started losing value by monetary inflation. 
Little gains to be made between 1792 and 1932 - because price fixing/covertibility and general price stability in USD.
There was no price managment for Bitcoin in the first years as no one cared. There is lots of evidence for price management of the gold price in the past 20 years - so possibly prices could be much higher in a real market, where every ounce of gold was allocated.
We don't know about future price management of Bitcoin. Gold is harder to transfer, store, verify, increasingly less scarce - those should be among the arguments for Bitcoin over gold not past price performance.

Great piece.


What you say is in line with my own thinking which I [posted three weeks ago]( as part of the paper ["On the Apparent Convergence of Bitcoin’s USD Market Value Toward the Stock-To-Flow Valuation Model and the Necessary Divergence Into the Narrow Halving Window."]( on this subreddit:
Gold was a fairly good investment in the second half of the 20th century to cover for asset price inflation, but it did not have the same gains in 50 years as Bitcoin did in 10 years. The reason here - except a brief period in the 80s - there was little necessity to hedge with gold, the fiat system just worked well and brought about ressource consumption and growth after two devastating world wars. 
Being roughly even after the 2020 halving, gold will have a lower S/F ratio than Bitcoin in the halving ~2024, when only 3,125 BTC are produced per block, indicating higher scarcity for Bitcoin over Gold.
For Bitcoin to ultimately succeed, purely debt based fiat currencies of G8 states and with it the current banking system need to start failing. People need to discover official price inflation is understated and government liabilites in welfare / pension payments cannot be satisfied at the current purchasing power.
Chances for this to happen are high, the timing of the release of Bitcoin was ideal - even if the technology had already been available 20 years earlier.

If you connect directly to it and it accepts a bumped RBF tx, then it's not a BU node :) Not sure if anyone has tried this yet, bit costly for that for every single node. Most interesting for miners actually.

2 MB blocks require a hard fork afaik.
Bitcoin is about achieving and securing consensus. There has [not been a planned hard-fork]( yet and it's non-trivial to get it right. It's preferable to scale using soft-forks and to avoid hard-forking several times for capacity increases. 
I believe there will be a planned capacity hard-fork eventually but one with smart properities rather than a static size.
Is there clear evidence of meaningful Bitcoin growth stalling because of fees? Some fees are healthy to avoid DoS, keep network health up and in the long term as miner incentive to secure the blockchain.

The further east you go, buying gold at CB level openly and covertly has been going on 5-10 years at least.
For purchases of more western CBs - this is quite possibly related to Basel III, which now treats gold a riskless asset (where previously govt bonds were favoured haha). While Basel III is for commercial banks it can have some psychologic effect on central bank policies as well, I guess.

You only really need to safeguard 12 (or 24) words in the right order - offline. You can always come back with those. That sounds easier than it is but as long as you don't expose them the attackers (malware, thiefs, insiders) you can screw around all you want on your PC once you bought BTC and withdrew it to your wallet. That's why most people want a hardware wallet.
LN has a different risk profile as a routing node but you don't need to do that as a beginner.

There is competition between countries and tax laws. Once some mass is achieved, there is an incentive for nations to support Bitcoin with favourable tax legislation for it, as to profit from Bitcoin to some extent. This will lead to pressure and internal protests in countries which are overcharging on taxes.

No, obviously this does not solve the scaling problem, it's just a work around if you're willing to pay a high(er) fee to be included in the next blocks.
I doubt the 50k tx in the mempool would be willing to bump fee. There are always tx trying to clean up utxo for a fairly low fee and those won't battle for higher fees but wait for times where there is less traffic (like weekends).

They don't have to. They have outgoing capacity to a lot of nodes on the LN network including all well known merchants. 
There are 20-40 servers of LNBIG. A number of endusers who randomly open some channels to a number of nodes end up opening incoming capacity to LNBIG and paying through LNBIG - so LNBIG is routing payments for them. Moreover "autopilot" of LND opens incoming capacity to nodes such as LNBIG.
The motivation to provide liquidity for endusers on mobile is such that they can act as "point of sale" and receive funds. Once they've received funds they can spend this balance right away. Any inbound capacity once it starts getting used and value is transferred will be outbound capacity on the same channel.

The article itself does not mention Bitcoin but it gives an interesting perspective on diametral solutions for dealing with global resources. I wonder how Bitcoin fits in either world view and whether Bitcoin may be inevitable for one or the other to dominate.
Key paragraphs:






My take on it: Obviously we rather want a production society - open, free, innovative, leaning on self-managed. Still there are finite natural ressources. The 20th century capitalism of top-down centralized mass overproduction, dependent on unlimited debt and consumerism is not sustainable forever. Capitalism with decentralized and more individual production without coerced consumption may be the answer, without society having to be "rationing" as laid out in the article.
Bitcoin - a crypto currenty with limited supply - may be inevitable if you want both a "production" or productive society so to speak and one that does not depend on necessary mass production and GDP growth.

There are two things: Scaling and optimizing.
SegWit is an optimization which happens to also increase the number of tx you can carry without a blocksize increase. This is one and just one of its benefits.
I think it's pretty clear that you cannot grow forever just by optimizing. It's prudent to optimize first and then scale some other way...

You can spend the change to an other address in your wallet with a higher fee. The change is what is left over from your original transaction.
Miners will then pick up both transactions, your "stuck" one and the new one in the same block

As of 2.9 it'll prompt the user that Electrum has detected a chain split and asks you which side of the fork you want to be on. It lists servers on each side for you to pick from.
If you pick the "wrong" side you see the "wrong" balance (i.e. BCH balance when you were expecting BTC) but BCH-following ElectrumX servers won't accept BTC tx because of the replay protection at bitcoin-abc level. 
Electrumx won't advertise BCH-following servers to Electrum - only to Electron Cash and vice versa.

Highly speculative but nevertheless: I suspect a possible database issue in the past week - Poloniex changed minimum amount of lending to 0.01 (up from 0.001 i believe). One reason to do that I came up with was to alleviate the database from new entries by factor 10.
The allegations made here are serious. Poloniex should make a statement - because as it stands Poloniex have stated that in fact it has not yet happened that lenders had to take a haircut. This would be a first and it needs to be made clear if it was the case.
Edit: Changed database integrity issue -&gt; database issue. It's unlikely to be a database integrity issue I just want to point out there have been changes in the past week to the lending amount and there may be reasons related to this issue.

Either Buffett does not know about the four basic functions of money or he denies them deliberately to make his argument:
* unit of account
* medium of exchange
* store of value
* standard of deferred payment
He is specifically missing out the "store of value" part - but he [does so for gold too]( .
It might not be so suprising as the money he knows best - the USD (but all other fiat currencie too) - does not fulfil the "store of value" function properly. It has not been a good store of value in the past 100 years and the USD lost over 90% of its value through inflation. This is one reason why he invests in companies that use money to create what he percieves as value. He may not believe money should have a mid- to long term "store of value" function in itself at all.

Disinflation is happening in BTC and is pre-determined when the protocol was first released and the network launched. 
In fiat currencies like USD - not so much or quite the opposite.

Many thanks for your reply! I'm amazed any miners would include from email. If it has indeed worked, I commend your brave effort.
I saw you mentioned an Electrum plugin as something you're eying. That would definiely give the whole thing traction.
Edit: Wouldn't miner just run "sendrawtx" from bitcoin-cli to include it in their local mempool? This way it would also propagate to other mempools unless they specifically have a propagation block for their mem pool (which I doubt many have in place).

At least Electrum has "Dynamic Fees: using estimatefee value returned by server" since 2.4.1 (Aug 2015). 
It's the default setting for new wallets since 2.7.0 (Oct 2016) but you may have to set it once if you upgraded the wallet from an older version.
For 2.6.4 shipped with this particular version of TAILS you have to manually set "dynamic fees" in the options.

From what I understand skimming this:
The main idea here for LN is to construct a so called "multi-hop lock" for funds routed around the network. Rather than have separate HTLCs and updating each channel in and outbound along the way, there is one overlay for the entire path from sender to destination. 
Security (in terms of integrity), privacy and performance guarantees are upheld and increased. Integrity of funds appear to be an issue for routing with HTLCs today as funds could get lost on the way, the paper cites.

Currently you can get by by paying 0.06 USD (within 2-3 blocks) or even 0.03 USD (takes an hour) for a 0,5 kb tx.
The fee estimates calculated by bitcoin core (and used in clients like Electrum) tend to be too high because they don't take into account mempool size afaik.
One thing I do more often these days: For transactions not urgent, use a low fee and use RBF (replace by fee) in Electrum. This way you can easily bump the fee if you want the transaction to process faster.
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:20:17

Make sure you split your coins properly first, though. AFAIK 2X does not yet have replay protection and is not using the appropriate HF flag either. 
Electrum has a generic way now to detect chain splits or forks like this and will allow you to make use of sending tx on both chains with different fee levels and RBF to split your coins properly and save you from tx replay threats.

Electrum 2.9 adds chain split detection client side. You will see that you've accidently landed on a BCH node and it won't accept your tx anyway because of replay protection.
Edit: If I may add: electrumx is also pretty good in that it will p2p discover other BCH running nodes and report those back to the (electron cash) client, while keeping up another p2p network for what it calls the Bitcoin segwit chain reported back to Electrum. It's the old and unmaintained electrum-server servers which show up on both Electrum and Electron Cash (but that's caught by the chain split detection client side). There are no BCH nodes running the old electrum-server to my knowledge, so it's merely as nuisance to Electron Cash users.

I'm just saying - it doesn't matter you label commodity based money as a 15th century economic model. 
Keynesian economics is not going to solve problems either. What it does is issuing a blank check to consume the world's ressources without actually making things much better for the poorest billions on the planet.

There will still be huge inequality - that's not Bitcoin's mandate.
What it does: It levels the playing field. Offshore banking and tax evasion is only available to the top corporations and individuals and possibly the politicians safe-guarding it.  This is not going to be fixed by legislation.
Change will only happen if it's available to everyone. I'm not advocating to do it from a moral point of view - I'm just saying the mere implications that it can be done has lasting effects.
Luckily Bitcoin is scarce which is good for de-growth. Infinite money with finite ressources doesn't work out - neither for the earth we live on nor the value of the currency you trade in.

I applaude you for fact checking everything you see and hear. However - it keeps you from seeing the bigger picture. There's lots of that in the presentation, don't get hung up on the estimation of people banked or unbanked.
You're also right - the 6 bn people figure is [inaccurate]( and more of a figure of speech these days. It depends largely on what you accept as fully banked. Being able to hold and receive foreign currency would be one example.

Commodity based currencies are bad if you need to finance war and welfare. They are great if you want to make use of the "store of value" function money should have and if you believe there should not be excessive debt levels by consuming far into the future. There should be sensible interest rates reflecting risks and risks should actually be risks in the sense that default needs to happen if a business endeavor is unsustainable.
2008 is the result of the fiat money system's need for GDP growth. Debt needs to be increased for it to finance the interest accrued. You can try to print yourself out of trouble and de-base the currency for everyone else but it will only work for so long.
I don't have a degree in economics, yes - but my reading list over the past 10 years is extensive and serious enough not to just put it off as "fringe nut" authors. 
I realize there are different schools of thought in economics and naturally each side believes they are right. Depending on the system you would like to support, this is the case.
At the end of the day I think it's important to give people choice and have currency competition. If the system only works by force, I don't think it's desirable.

@_date: 2018-06-11 08:39:23
Why would that be the case?
Bitcoin is working for years, has an established and growing userbase and is inflating less than in the early years.
Going from 0.09 USD to 1 USD or even 1 USD to 2 USD was tough as many coins were available, issuance was higher, the network was smaller and had less proven uptime and much less usage and less utility. There were no signs of ETFs - even the legal status was entirely unclear. 
So I'd contest that it becomes "more difficult to break through into new ATHs" as time goes on and the network keeps performing + user interest is increasing.
Edit: Typo only

So it's a total of [20999999.9769]( minus the unspendable genesis block (50 BTC) minus [several other instances where less than the allowed block rewards was claimed](

You don't necessarily need the "how" unless you want to verify rather than trust. 
One of the reasons Bitcoin is not yet mainstream is because people trust the current fiat money system and do not ask how it works.  Not because they are too afraid to ask, rather because of remoteness and a sense of complacency of how things are. If not apathy it's a form of suppressed critical thinking as to avoid cognitive dissonance.
To ask questions and not to trust but verify is something Bitcoin advocates,  so it's encouraged to understand its functionality. Bitcoin does not have to hide how it works, it has a high degree of determinism; much more so than the fiat money systems.

It appears it's connected to a new law finalized on the 31st of July by federal government to be passed in German parliament after their summer-break called "Umsetzungsgesetz für die 5. Geldwäscherichtlinie".
It's effective Jan 1st 2020 and requires new custodians of private keys (such as exchanges, payment providers) in Germany to get a license with BaFIN.
Previously there was no such regulation and possible threat of cease and desist by BaFIN in Germany if you operated as custodian.
Existing custodians have until February 1st 2020 to inform BaFIn about their operation and have to have submitted a qualified application form for a license until June 30th 2020.
Thus it seems a little pre-mature for Bitpay to stop operations in Germany...

Very good points.
They would care about about having international fiat. However there is no chance for them to work for it. The playing field is not level - ofc it starts with education but from there on it's also a matter of where you are born. It's very hard to work for US dollars in many parts of the world. Bitcoin might change that at least in regards to any work done over the Internet.
Will there be an effect on the value of the local currencies in second / third world countries beause of Bitcoin? These local coins don't seem to have a good exchange rate to USD (or BTC for that matter) so the wage of a worker there does not compare to 1st world. 
Granted the first world economies enjoy cheap imports because of this... Can this change? Should it change? 
The opportunities Bitcoin creates for world-wide change are enormous. I think it's fair to question almost everything - or at least a lot more than the angles we're looking at now.

Banks which have loans go bad at large scale either socialize the losses to tax payers ("bail-out") or use customer's funds to re-capitalize ("bail-in").
Once those two are exhaused they take down the whole fiat money system most likely through huge inflation by the central bank ("bail-down").
The Austrian economics idea of risk is bad businesses including banks which have taken on unsustainable risks can and will go bust. Not all at the same time by propping up each other but once the issue arises. This cleans out the economy of wasteful and unsustainable business endeavors and keeps the system going. Today this is defunct, especially at large enterprise / bank level.

I can only guess his motivation was somewhere between
"If you can't beat them, join them" and being a Hobbesian [Leviathan]( "If I don't do it, somebody else will". 
Arguably, personally for him and for the timeline of his career it was a wise choice. Building an alternative which (eventually) makes the current system obsolete just was no option back then, the cycle of unbacked fiat was at the beginning and working well for a generation or two. Moreover co-opting people into running the fiat system is the norm.

It's from the executive branch of government (law enforcement) and should not be addressed to Facebook but to the legislative branch to ask for laws. 
Laws against free speech are usually against the constitution (or equivalent) and in violation of human rights and ideally get squashed by the judicial branch.
Ideally you then have a choice to vote for parties which do not pass laws which are unconstitutional.
However a large part of the voters are apathetic and/or uninformed or misinformed by their media outlet of choice and place blind trust in their government. This lead Churchill to say "Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time..."

For reference: JPMcoin runs on JP Morgan's own Ethereum clone called [Quorum]( which is marketed as "A permissioned implementation of Ethereum supporting data privacy". 
Permissioned is what makes the difference to Bitcoin here. It's centrally controlled in who can send and receive, so freeze of funds and reversal is possible.

The slides are pretty good. I'm amazed I agree with most of the  analysis of all three presenters. 
Two major points I don't agree with:
The social cost is overblown: The  current financial system is much more expensive to maintain and cost does not increase per user. 
The missing ability to respond to variation in demand for money is a fact yes, but not a problem. They don't take into account money competition. There will always be altcoins with value to them extending the money supply. It's the users' choice to attribute value to them. It can't be controlled centrally - that's their main point. Going with the Austrian school of economics: It's better that way...

It's an important but different statistic. Personal full nodes have gone down as users have switched to SPV like Electrum or even custodial like exchanges. 
Smaller blocks won't change that. Users want an instant-on experience over downloading blocks for their personal usage. It'll never be instant unless it's operated 24/7.
IMHO smaller blocks concern open nodes - and there is no lack of them.

I'll chime in: Looking at the relevant stats on [bitnodes]( we've added 5k open nodes over the last two years. The ATH of 12k nodes was around UASF for segwit so it was special. 
I was concerned when the number was dropping to 4-5k levels before 2017. I remember we've had the 10k figure around 2011 when the path to success started. When it comes to full nodes I don't currently see a problem. The trend is pretty stable. 
I think an UASF for smaller blocks is unwarranted for now, untimely and hence dangerous. If we drop back below 5k levels it can be re-considered.

Negative interest rates are adding to inflation. You get paid money to increase the supply - it's what one would call a perverted incentive.
The velocity of spending money should increase - which means money which has been created but was idling around as savings is now more likely to be spent. The number of goods which are up for grabs is unchanged, which drives price inflation. At the same time negative interest rates help re-finance debt, mostly of government bonds.

Bitcoin is partly about currency competition. The idea here is to have an alternative to  government controlled currency, which is free speech and mathematically pre-determined in terms of issuance.
Stablecoins on something like Lightning Network could enable mass adoption to those still believing in government controlled fiat currencies they grew up with. The underlying is still rubbish fiat but easily swapped out by Bitcoin if confidence in fiat currencies crumbles.
Obviously it'd better not be permissioned "JPM Coin" but something less so like DAI, which is a USD derivative collateralized against the USD exchange value of ETH. Surely side-chains or LN itself could do the same for Bitcoin without needing a central party to do clearing.

Bitcoin will not solve compliance matters like capital controls by itself. 
It just offers an alternative and gives both parties a relatively easy and hard to shut down way to dissent should local laws not offer freedom of contract.
Ideally once critical mass is reached it'll be easier and smarter to integrate Bitcoin into national laws than to try to ban it. However IMHO it's naive to think "with Bitcoin this would never happen". The powers that be will not just give in. They won't make it easy.

This is bad. I don't understand how the exchange itself hedges risk, maybe they don't have to - they just seem to do betting, like a sportsbook. It has little to do with what the original intention of mercantile trading was I'm afraid.

You can use normal LN. It's already well connected within the network so that routing your payments should work. 
In fact opening a channel with Bitfinex itself requires a minimum channel capacity size of ~0.018 BTC so they are only interested in larger capacity channels at this time

By all means run a full node - everyone who can afford to should.
There is little Electrum can do against "fork issues". It's a global thing. You have a free choice of which Electrum server and hence chain to use - should there ever be a fork. 
All it takes are public Electrum servers running XT and this will happen sooner or later but it won't make much difference unless miners come close to creating 75% of blocks with XT.

The risk here is that clashic nodes form their own network and transactions can be replayed on each side of the fork. This means if you send BCH you also send Clashic coins and vice versa unless you take special precautions to split your chains so the transaction is not valid on the other.

To trade there has to be at least some collateral by the exchange, because you're meant to be able to "stand for delivery" meaning you want to actually receive the underlying good at the end of the contract period. Usually the contracts are just used for risk hedging and speculation aka price manangement purposes and not really to buy the underlying.  Hence most contracts are closed out or rolled into the next month. Very few contracts (1%-10%?) are actually standing for delivery at the end of the period.
In an event where more contracts stand for delivery than there is actually available you can be asked to settle for cash. From what I have heard sometimes a premium is offered in the order of 20-30% above market to settle for cash like when you get offered a 4-star hotel stay when the long distance flight is overbooked and they need your seat.
The future markets are not supposed to make the price but allow for hedging the spot price but it so happens that the sheer amount of speculation does have a substantial effect on the spot price. Why this is OK I don't know and certainly the CFTC might argue this is forbidden and not actually happening. However it's hard to explain why for example entities would sell short precious metal contracts in the gold and silver markets with magnitudes as large as the yearly production of the good traded within minutes. No rational seller would do this because you usually want the best price which is not achieved by dumping into the order book.

It's certainly an interesting discussion. How much state or which functions of the state are need in networked societies where individual autonomy has been maximized and where individuals govern their own interactions (like envisioned by Benkler in [The Wealth of Networks]( )?

I agree. The current system works on a growth paradigm and requires consumption to service interest / debt. This has to change.
The statement I wanted to make wrt to negative interest rates: Price inflation in the past decade has been slower than could have been expected from the exploding money supply because the velocity of spending has also decreased. Whichever measures increase velocity should also lead to price inflation. Bitcoin is even more attractive then.

Yea that is high and uncommon but as relay nodes can freely choose their fees maybe some node on the route choose a higher fee for the value routed. For example LNBIG has 0.05% which comes out at like 8 ct, not sure what "wallet of satoshi" charges if you open a channel with them.
Some wallets have a function to limit the maximum routing fees.

@_date: 2015-07-24 14:11:49
Correct me if I'm wrong - but there is no actual indication other than the headlines that BNP is buying Bitcoin. 
From what I can gather they are looking into ways to manage value transfers of existing funds in a more efficient / modern way using blockchain technology. It's not even clear whether it would be using some public blockchain for value transfer like Counterparty, Ripple, let alone their own sidechain to Bitcoin or whether they'll be using something centralized with blockchain technology for the banking sector.
@_date: 2019-12-13 11:28:08
Using re-orgs to double spend is not subtle. It also carries opportunity cost - you forfeit blockreward on the blocks your abandon. 
Doing this for economic reasons is unlikely unless you want to doublespend a transaction worth billions in USD - and success is unlikely - the other party receiving a billion may well want to wait a couple of confirmations more...
Doing it for political reasons is possible but it will have severe backlash by the community. It works once if at all.

It depends how many sat per byte you were paying for your transaction. 
tx fees never depend on the value of the transaction but only on the size in bytes. If you have many inputs or if you're overpaying on fees to get into the next block mined it can be 20 cents.
It depends on whether your wallet allows you to set the tx fee for opening a channel. With lnd for example you need to add the sat_per_byte parameter like:
lncli openchannel --sat_per_byte &lt;value&gt; &lt;id of node&gt; &lt;amount in sat&gt;
Setting sat_per_byte to 1-2 will usually come out at 1-2 cent at current BTC / USD exchange rate.

You believe somebody could control the level of geographic concentration and make it right. Somebody has to be in charge... That is not the case. That's what I mean by centralized thinking. 
Bitcoin is not centralized just because mining happens to be concentrated in a geographic region.
Besides miners you have exchanges, merchants and payment processors, full node operators and users spending / hodling coins. Look at BIP148 - if Bitcoin were only operated and controlled by miners it would not have happened.

A note for Electrum users: While the Electrum client makes use of SPV, Electrum servers run bitcoind. 
As long as the bitcoind version on the server is recent enough this issue does not affect you. Reorgs up to 100 blocks are also handled by the server database.
Most servers should have up to date bitcoind versions.
We've asked server ops to include the bitcoind version on their server banner message. So if you want to make sure, check the server message in the "Console" tab for a version number.

About point 1)  - yes there are other digital currencies before Bitcoin - any fiat currency is these days. So it should say "Bitcoin is the first digital settlement layer over the public internet, without walled gardens and trustless" above.

This means you have to decrypt something from an unknown, unsigned, untrusted sender. 
For Bitcoin usage you don't usually decrypt with your private key. A vector for Bitcoin could be something like a specially crafted but valid BIP70 payment request which you would have to sign. Which is theoretical because signing is not decrypting known plaintext. There is no mention of ECDSA, so this particular device won't work out of the box.

This is an excellent example of how activation on a major mining pool draws in the other, smaller ones towards activation. In case of the 95% activation with Bitcoin it's still very hard to do without something like BIP148 or peaceful agreement.
I hope 0.14.1 is released soon, with segwit signalling by default, regardless of whether your mining software has support for it.

The number of confirmations deemed sufficient for high value transfers will increase. You cannot double spend other people's money just your own. Transactions close to the Chinese government would get extra scrutiny.
Moreover hashpower would move away from China as investors can make choices. Granted, I do not know how much hashpower in China is operated by mining-pools and foreign investors but not all of the 54% is [TINA](
The likely outcome would be to spread FUD trying to destroy Bitcoin. It might be a nuisance if it happens but that's about it.

While I agree LN is still in its infancy (much like Bitcoin ~2011) your examples of why you believe it's a mess can use some commentary:
 * Publicy visible capacity decrease has to do with private channels and one particular reckless entity adding and withdrawing liquidity at one time. We just don't know about the actual capacity anymore with most enduser channels being private.
 * People may have lost coins but it's nowhere as bad as [How I lost ~4 BTC on Lightning Network]( would make you believe at first. He claimed it back in the end. Failsafes like SCB have been implemented for LND. Eltoo will help in the future to avoid having to use punish tx.
 * No meaningful real-world use: LN at first stage is about merchants and in this regard it applies to BTC too. We need more merchants offering BTC / LN as a payment. As fees are lower and the transaction trustless faster, chances are good for all merchants offering BTC payments now to also offer LN in the future - majorly dependent on some payment providers of course. LN may help with merchant adoption through submarine swaps, possibly with fiat stable coins in the future...

There's a difference between signalling BU's EC and actually running it. 
Especially smaller pools like Bitclub, Bitcoin.com and Slush are running Core and singal BU. How do I know: They process bumped RBF transactions. BU nodes don't do this. Slush openly admitted it (because it's just being run to give miners on the pool a choice) and hashrate there is split over signalling Core segwit and BU

If it has to do with securing patents, then they can as well use the overt boosting once it has cleared. Also I believe patent infringement would already have happened by placing the tech on the chip, it can't be averted by officially not making use of it.

The beauty of BIP8 is the "worst" outcome is (user) activation on a pre-determined flag-day, best would be early activation by miners. You don't have to update your client if you don't want to accept / send segwit tx. You can keep it running but others can enjoy the benefits of segwit. Miners would be prudent to upgrade to have rule enforcement of segwit so they can verify the last block and don't mine on an invalid one. They are not forced to enforce segwit rules or mine segwit blocks with BIP8.
@_date: 2017-04-24 11:16:35
I'm not sure even Jiahn Wu has full knowledge: Currently you can signal Segwit (rule enforcement), use covert asicboost and just not produce segwit blocks.

"professional, standards-based journalism" can be an euphemism for politically correct fanaticism. There should not be a monopoly on fact checking and it's imporant not to outsource this soley to companies like Snopes, Politifact, ABC News or FactCheck.org.
Please be different. Please be better. 
The purpose of the 4th estate is to raise awareness and inform regardless of the interests of its financiers, the political affinities their employer / publisher or the government where the servers are hosted or where the main publisher lives to have a story changed. Please don't run a three letter agency liasion unless it's public (most TLA won't be interested then). Find ways of how you or the employed journalists can't get blackmailed to have stories changed or not run.
It's important to have diversity here, not just in the community but more importantly for the journalists hired. It's important to make the process of hiring journalists transparent.
From a technical point of view - I'm not specially endorsing it - but as a platform for decentralized news, it might make sense to take a look at [Steem]( and use some of the ideas - if only long term.

It's more psychology than anything else. Not sure what you mean by "shuffling things". The actual tx rate passing through BIP148 nodes does not matter and can't be measured properly to my knowledge. Miners need to fear their blocks will be orphaned by important economic actors (exchanges, payment providers, wallet providers like electrum servers or mycelium) and switch on rule enforcement / signaling of segwit to avoid this risk. It's unlikely at this point but if segwit signaling happens to by up to &gt; 60% by July and major exchanges support BIP148 the other 40% are either prepared to fork or will fall in place.
@_date: 2017-04-28 07:55:10
Not sure if still up to date but Bitmain and competitors are currently on 28nm die according to [List of Bitcoin mining ASICs]( with 16nm in the pipeline by Bitmain.
Intel is starting to work on 10nm / 7nm for their CPUs, current CPUs are 14nm die size.
Once we're down to 10 nm or [7 nm]( with ASICs doing SHA256 some commoditization and more competition should set in as 5 nm will be harder to achieve. Maybe one of the large manufacturers like Intel, AMD, Samsung etc make SHA256 ASICs at some point?
Not sure when we're down to 10nm or smaller for SHA256 ASIC and whether that's good enough for more competition to evolve. Probably not before 2019?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:01:59
BIP148. If miners just signal segwit to avoid being orphaned but don't produce segwit blocks after BIP148 enforcement kicks in, they are behaving suspiciously and are leaving fees on the table. Any miner producing segwit blocks automatically prooves they don't use covertboost.
Of course this is only effective if major exchanges support BIP148.

If Chinese miners want to hold another round table for BTC to signal segwit, make vows never to use covertboost on mainnet and most importantly save face that's fine by me. 
At the end of the day - we as a community and users of Bitcoin know we get to decide the rules by running software enforcing the rules of the protocol - not the miners.
Edit: Chinese miners signalling segwit as result of a round table, because they think they are in control: Priceless! For everything else there's BIP8...

Take Electrum as an example: There are currently ~50 public servers, each running a bitcoin full node. Each server is serving hundreds of concurrent client nodes with SPV (sending them headers and specific transaction data) and receiving the nodes' tx to broadcast them on the network. 
Another example would be bitcoinj based implementations where thin clients connect to full nodes with bloom filtering.
Full nodes (mining or not) are the backbone of the Bitcoin network. They help scaling the userbase  Electrum server ops are not miners, yet they are providing an important service to Bitcoin users around the work.

The nice thing about this compromise (as far as I understand): You can offer it without real risk of activation. Every BU supporter in favor of this, is a supporter won for Segwit. If they signalled for it, that'd be great. 2MB afterwards is unlikely to reach consensus, but the lowest common denominator here is Segwit.

AFAIK BU nodes accept transactions with RBF flag but do not accept RBF fee bumped transactions (transaction replacements with a higher fee). 
So to do this you should create an RBF transaction with a low fee and then bump the fee.
It can then still be mined by non seg-wit supporting pools which pretent to be BU like Bitcoin.com or Bitclub. I did some tests and they appear to be running core because of this behaviour.
Please note up until and including 0.14.0 the mining equipment itself needs to be segwit ready for bitcoind to signal segwit. This will change with 0.14.1 where rule enforcement of segwit is default even if your mining equipment is not ready. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:18:25
Looks like it's vaporware for now. Their website is  and the promise is an EC patch against the latest stable core version. I think it'd be important to have this, to give BU supporters a chance to activate segwit and still advocate emergent consensus.

Why? BIP8 Segwit and wait it out. If Bitmain does not produce segwit blocks they will be penalized by losing out on fees. Miners producing segwit blocks cannot use covertboost.
Sure there can be another BIP8 to block covertboost but I don't think it's as important as Segwit.

If you're currently having issues getting your Electrum wallet to "synchronize" or even to connect to a server this is because of an ongoing DDoS to all public servers. A botnet of several thousand zombies is running custom code to connect as an Electrum client and use up resources.
There is a [patch as pull request to electrumx]( to introduce per IP resource limits. The default 30k RESOURCE_LIMIT seems a little low for larger wallets but works fine to keep up servers.
Fairly responsive servers with TLS connections are:
* electrum.hodlister.co:50002
* electrum2.hodlister.co:50002
* ecdsa.net:110
* arborghast.bauerj.eu:50002
* electrum.peleion.com:5004
* donnager.bauerj.eu:50002
Also see 
Servers at the top should be more responsive than the ones further down the list.
Please be patient trying to find a server that works for you (disable auto-connect doing so). Do not download alternative Electrum versions from random sites stating they will fix this issue - those are by scammers trying to steal your coins!
Update: The botnet has a range of 150-300k unique IPs hammering all servers on the application level. The attacker is resourceful and is running custom code on the zombies, which is fairly uncommon. It leads me to believe the botnet is not rented but under direct control of the attacking entity.
I think the motivation of the attack on legitimate servers is so people running older versions of electrum keep using their old version. This way they stay on a scammer server and are asked to upgrade from a malware site upon sending a transaction. Please make sure to only use the official site stickied at the top by BashCo.
Update II 20190411: The attackers are still going. They are also trying volumetric attacks on the servers using IPsec ESP traffic and SYN flooding. Providers like Hetzner have DDoS protection to deal with this but it may impair service (their Arbor box seems to interfere with TLS from time to time for example). 
For server operators there is a public blocklist which can be used to block traffic at  . Make use of it using cron at regular intervals of several minutes.

BIP8 is going to be the thing that is going to get segwit activated. Most nodes (70+%) on the Bitcoin network can enforce the segwit rules. Even those signalling something else would be prudent to at least verify segwit blocks by flag-day even if they want to boost &amp; emerge in unlimited ways.

The IP based blocks in code are on a resource usage basis. There's a counter for each IP over a time-span (i.e. 24h) and accounting on the type and number of requests you do. 4-10 requests minute should be fine.

Yes, BIP148 enforces all blocks after August 1st have to have segwit signalling or being orphaned. BIP8 states additional rules will be enabled on flag day at the latest. If you don't know or care about the additional rules you cannot properly verify blocks making use of the new rules but they don't look invalid to you by the older ruleset you know.
The risk here is blocks mined with invalid segwit tx can go undetected and will be orphaned by the user base which knows all about segwit rules. Miners and users with older software run the risk having to trust the rest of the network and will see re-organisations if miners build on invalid blocks. Now it's uncommon to see invalid blocks on the network b/c no miner is interested to have their found block orphaned, so this will happen randomly from time to time (maybe once or twice a year like with BIP66). It has a low impact when the majority of miners and installed user base know about segwit rules. There are good reasons to believe even most miners signalling for BU actually run core software that understands segwit rules.
UASF is mostly misunderstood b/c of the special case of BIP148: In the case of Segwit and BIP8 at least it's voluntary to make use of new features brought by UASF but it's in the best interest of all to be able to verify whether those who use the new functionality actually play by the rules.

@_date: 2017-04-06 18:22:51
Thanks for answering. I'm still trying to get my head around this:
What if miners using the chips in question signaled for segwit rule enforcement but never intend to produce segwit blocks themselves b/c of their use of ASICBOOST. 
Obviously it must not lead to a situation where no miner actually produces segwit blocks because they'd rather implement the covert ASICBOOST in their product.
Might it be best to make the [patent royalty free]( and by this convince miners to make use of the overt form allowing proper segwit blocks? The profit for the patent owners would likely materialize in form of a higher Bitcoin price resulting from a flourishing eco-system.
Edit: gmaxwell clarified the first part for me on IRC. "[just producing non-segwit blocks while signaling rule enforcement works] but then you could detect it on that basis, AND you'd lose out on lots of fees."

Many thanks for your summary - 500 bits What I don't yet get is how BIP-uaversionbits-strong can be less disruptive than BIP148 as described by . It's supposed to have some "coordinated syncronized activation between full nodes" which I understand as some threshold of supporting full nodes. I don't get how that is supposed to work or how measurement would be done. With BIP9 PoW it's based on the number of blocks. Economic majority would include something like relayed / sent tx but there is no way to measure that afaik. Other than that you could measure number of nodes, but that can be sybil attacked?

Not ELI5 but still useful I hope:
ASICboost is a possible reason why Segwit won't activate by miner consensus on Bitcoin mainnet. 
The use of a certain form of ASICboost which I dub "covertboost" cannot be detected in mined blocks but messes with the block header in a way incompatible with protocol improvements like segwit. There is another, open form of using ASICboost, which does little harm to the header but it's not used, likely because it's detectable and might raise patent and competing miner &amp; customer of mining equipment manufacturer concerns.
Officially no one is using covertboost on mainnet and there is no statement about plans to make use of covertboost. So officially it should not be a problem to softfork to disallow the harmful use of ASICboost, while still allowing the openly detectable version. It might be blocked using BIP8 at some time in the future, but there is no clear consensus on how to move forward at this time.
Personally I think activating Segwit (i.e. through BIP8) would be more important because miners producing segwit blocks cannot and will not use covertboost. Miners enforcing segwit but abstaining from producing segwit blocks after activation will be suspicious as being dishonest and will get penalized by no being able to get fees from segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:06:14

Let's face it - Wikileaks has challenged the powers that be. So does Bitcoin. There's a reason Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym and that he disappeared. The arrest of Julian Assange shows it's not good to stand out. It's better to be part of a movement that is decentralized.

It's only when people feel betrayed some go look for a better solution. Just look after the Snowden leaks how few people actually took consequences in their daily lives.

I'd argue Bitcoin (used at large scale) disincentives (or outright prevents) an economy based on forced consumption for the economy to grow. It's [de-growth]( government financed war and welfare is hard to do here. 
In how far this is "healthy" and what this means for general living standards lies in the eye of the beholder. It's certainly not healthy by standard economic teaching - in terms of what it means for preservation of ressources / nature might be a different picture.

Yes, some ICOs actually sold tokens and then only let you move it to another address if you did KYC with them!
Now if you shared keys you'd allow someone else to operate under your identity like selling your bank account with money in it.

As we can see, price is relative and people do pay in other areas of life to be member of an exclusive club. Except with Bitcoin it's permissionless to become member. 
Currency without a limit has diminishing value. That may appeal to many (partly because they are uninformed or are following social conventions) but is not for everyone.
True point though: Are there enough enlightened people for Bitcoin to succeed? Possibly not. However, if enlightenment happens through long-time experience with fiat currencies, there is hope ;).
Edit: Transaction costs - you do follow news about LN and have been watching the mempool lately? It's currently not an issue and won't be long-term either.
Edit II: WRT fiat money you may want to look at the [Cantillon Effect]( "Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about.". With Bitcoin this effect is limited. You can only profit once as an early adopter, price inflation is curbed by the disinflationary nature of Bitcoin. With fiat both money / price inflation and unfair advantage of who receives money first is a continuing effect.

Yes, there will be commercial banks just as there will be e-shops (not everything will move to openbazaar style of onlineshopping). 
However central banks are not offering the types of services you mention. They issue money / cash, allow banks to create debt and "manage" the monetary policy by setting short term interest rates. They also influence/manipulate markets if they deem it necessary to the value of their currency or to control long term interest rates. Do we really need this in the future?

Your understanding of "help the economy" is different than mine.

MD5 is currently safe if you use passwords with length of 15 chars (for charset len:63 mixalpha-numeric and one special char) with good entropy. Even a large botnet or government type of attack will take over 1000 years to brute force it.
Rainbow tables are usually capped to 10-12 chars because size then explodes into Petabytes and are computationally expensive to create too, also many MD5 passwords are salted.
collision-resistance does not matter in this case because known attacks rely on some form of known plaintext as input which is not the case with hashed passwords
Edit: added "with good entropy". No use using 15 char password which can be cracked with a dictionary attack

Things have changed during the last 100 years and they will in the future. Just don't count on things having worked for many years in the past to work the next 100 years. Let alone official price inflation rates vs monetary inflation. The savings account will not offet the latter and the former is biased to show a low figure.
Buying Bitcoin is a choice and has its own risk/reward calculation. I  personally think holding government fiat in whichever form for the next decades is high risk / low reward and would always choose something else.

Care to provide back-up for your claims? 
It was very permissionless for me to set up a node, censorship gets routed around if you have multiple channels open. 
It's trustless in the sense that everyone can walk away from the channel and get their coins by engaging in a smart contract beforehand.
While it might be more centralized than the Bitcoin network itself, no one forces you to connect to the nodes with large capacity and many channels, in the first place. You're free to connect to the edge of the network and have your payments routed - anonymously to the more central nodes!

wrt to altcoins you have a valid question.
For Bitcoin it's mostly:
* Increasing scarcity over fiat
* Money independent of third parties (gold like property)
* More upside than downside risk over most other assets
* Easy to store and transfer regardless of (high) value
As a result it's an ideal diversification for investors.

You cannot at this point. Opening and closing channels will consume far more in fees than routing will yield (~1 sat per forwarded tx). 
This only changes if you routed thousands of tx per day and even then it's competing with channel fees. Likely you'll route a handful per day at this point unless you're the entry point for a lot of users. There is not that much use of LN at this point.
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:38:11
Yes, however Bitpay charges a so called extra "network fee" of  ~10 cents per tx to end-users to promote bcash where it's "free".
They do not support segwit or LN and they are increasingly hostile to the BTC community (in favour of promoting Bitcoin Cash). So if you want to accept Bcash by all means use Bitpay, for everything else use BTCpay or a service based on it...

It's really a matter of upstream bandwidth at home. In EU, especially Germany it's usually somewhere between 1 Mbit/s and 10 Mbit/s. To comfortably run a node without capping upstream and worrying about other services on the same network 100 Mbit is needed. 
Hetzner does 1 Gigabit on all dedicated servers for as low as ~25 EUR / month with 10-20 TB of traffic included as a standard which makes it very competitive - even over just the power and hardware cost at home, nevermind the bandwidth. 
In terms of independence: I too think it's too centralized to have this many nodes at Hetzner, however were they all at home they'd be running mostly on 3 ISPs in Germany: Deutsche Telekom (~40%), Vodafone (~30%) and Telefonica (~10%). Hetzner operates too many servers to interfere with single Bitcoin nodes running on their network.

Nevermind the price predictions but 2140: "Latest block mined?" should say "Last block reward paid out".
It implies Bitcoin will cease to exist then. However at 1 sat per block block rewards should not have mattered for a long time.
Fees higher than block reward will likely happen well before year 2050, so best to put the marker around 2050 and state "block reward irrelevant over fees".

On a serious note: This is the idea of a free society. Enabling trade with freedom of contract and liberties, protecting inhabitants from aggression, theft, breach of contract and fraud and enforcing property laws.
However the idea of a [minimal state]( is not part of our experience, much the opposite.
The social contract is being broken too often these days, by nanny like states believing they have to take care of business for their subjects to remain relevant. By offering an illusion of democracy created by representation. Indebting poor people to have them vote for social benefit systems. Keeping the middle class down by taxing them close to 70% with direct and indirect taxes so they cannot easily escape the tread-mill system. Increasing the complexity of doing trade by creating ever new laws as if they were ordered by the hour. Social contracts broken by mandating families to have both parents work full time to make ends meet with a moderate lifestyle while leaving the upbringing of the children to third parties.
People feel this partly consciously, mostly subconsciously in one way or an other and it's mouting to a change in the next decades. It's unsettling to live in a period of slow change. When you know history is in the making and it will be looked back upon in history as a decisive period of 20-30 years but events itself are unfolding in such a slow pace while you're witnessing them.

300x energy usage only works if you can get electricity as cheap as you can get it today. 
I expect energy price to go up as demand increases for two reasons:
1) simply because the underutilized resources have been used up
2) with a Bitcoin valuation in the millions of USD, energy is increasingly priced in Bitcoin as well as the USD is hyperinflating away at this price point. From another point of view: Energy is only as cheap as it is today because you can inflate the fiat money supply and then use this to subsidize the price of it.

According to this analysis no one should be running public bitcoin nodes, yet there are 10k with ports open to connect to.
Bitcoin may become important enough that there is incentive to run miners to secure the network even at a loss. However as the system is self-regulating in terms of difficulty it should be possible to operate to cover cost.

It's mostly about safety of funds at this point. There is no easy way to back up channel states, you cannot just restore your private keys from seed and control your funds. 
Watchtower is something that is just being implemented in server daemons like lnd, it needs to be made available to mobile wallets which are not always online.
So from a  point of view it wouldn't take a year to roll out LN in mainstream wallets, however doing it properly for wallets which are not expected to be online all the time is the challenge. 
It'll happen for the first maintream wallets in 2019 but there is also a lot of bugfixing, feature implementation and even BOLT spec updates for LN and the major implementations lnd / c-lightning. 
Keeping track and supporting those is also a challenge for wallet authors. The sweet spot to start implementing without having to do upgrades all the time might be past eltoo and that's possibly at least a year out b/c of a soft-fork required for it.

It's a fee market, it's natural to have some transactions pending at any time on a blockchain that is actually used a lot. If you need it processed you can raise the fee with RBF. Some transactions linger to consolidate lots of inputs for example - this only really makes sense using a low fee.

How so? Bitcoin is self-regulating. As power prices increase, hashrate will go down eventually if it's unprofitable to mine.
Let's face it: Energy tends to be too cheap these days. Especially when generated from fossil fuels. The economic system we have is bad: It is based on debt and the necessity of consumerism to service debts. Growth has limits, in terms of natural ressources. If fiat money is unlimited you can consume all the natural ressources of the world and default on debt.

Electrum windows binaries are signed by "Electrum Technologies GmbH" and on top of that signed by the gpg key of ThomasV. 
By all means verify GPG. If you cannot please at least make sure you use a code-signed version by the official company behind it.
I know there's also Linux and Mac. Linux makes it easy to verify gpg as it's usually shipped in the default install or very easy to obtain with a packet manager. MacOS will ideally come to the appstore there sometime - until then do learn gpg ;)

It's the native address scheme for segwit. It is a requirement for seamlessly opening channels for Lightning network usage. Electrum is one of the few wallets that already supports bech32. 
Using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) commonly referred to as addresses starting with "3..." is more or less a hack to receive and send segwit transactions. As P2SH is widely supported already it's the easier variant to implement segwit for wallets and services to start with. However sending to bech32 addresses doesn't require full implementation of bech32 addresses. It just needs to recognize them as valid addresses to send to.

One defining feature of fiat is that the money supply can be changed arbitrarily by such decree (of the central bank). 
With commodity money you might make a bad choice because you might choose something that is not in fact rare on earth. However it may be rare in a certain location or require significant work to be introduced in the area where it's used as money.
With Bitcoin what moves it closer to a commodity is the fixed limit and distribution model set out at the beginning. A change of that set of rules is not Bitcoin anymore (at least for a vast majority of users). Based on this set of rules it also requires work to be dispensed - mainly specialized hardware equipment and electricity. This comes at a cost, similarily to how retrieving a commodity like gold from the ground requires work. With goverment fiat these constraints are not laid out - there is monetary policy which tends to be flexible to fund things like employment programs such as wars and welfare.

Debt based fiat currencies are designed this way.  It's just a Unit of Account of Debt. 
As interest is paid for the time preference of saving and spending money, debts and with it money supply increases. So called "real" growth of the economy (GDP) is mandatory to outgrow debt increase. Usually both price inflation and GDP are mis-represented to tailor real growth for governments to present to its people.
Yet debt tends to grow much faster year by year than growth in products and exploitation of natural ressources happens. 
Only regular debt jubilees, irrelevance of growth figures and prudent spending can save a fiat system in the long run. Otherwise it's a mathematical certainty that fiat systems must inflate into irrelevance or collapse.
Bitcoin has an entirely different paradigm. Bitcoin, as we know it, inflates itself into existence and is a commodity money not based on debt...

Some weird form of plausible deniability ("look I just swept what I had a publicly available private key for") accepting the risk of a race to spend the coins?
To me it sounds like it would be interesting to shed more light on how 1GzYFnuZKf8KwfWcvvonwxcbLuSobfV11G was generated. do you actually have a 12 word Electrum seed that reproduces 1GzYFnuZKf8KwfWcvvonwxcbLuSobfV11G (among other addresses) and is there anything special about it?

That may be so. He has hashpower with bitcoin.com and he can mine 2x. With optional replay protection there is a chance for exchanges to list it. If that happens there is some value, which will mean more hash power to carry it at least to the next difficulty adjustment.
I don't see it as a threat to be Bitcoin at all but I see the possibility of another altcoin just like BCH. It's more dangerous as it can be replayed if you're not careful to split your coins and that is what makes it reckless in my opinion.

As I pointed out that is a fundamental difference. When did your central bank last ask you how many units of account you'd like circulating in your economy and was there ever a chance to agree to a certain monetary policy?
"The community" cannot easily change the fundamentals and still call it Bitcoin. For hodlers there is no incentive to dilute the supply, so why would they run a version that changes such fundamental rules. Even if they did and find miners to mine it - whoever does forks Bitcoin.
LN does not increase the supply, you lock existing Bitcoin into channels that's it.
side-chains don't increase the supply of Bitcoin because they are pegged to it. You might have blow stamps inside a side-chain with a different factor, but that's an altcoin then as a side chain.

This is crucial! Can't upvote enough :). When I looked into this topic a while back I learnt that large banks have so called [correspondent banking agreements]( in which they agree to offset the funds transferred between the banks - called "netting" and only pay the differences. 
If one of the banks has too large an offset and doesn't want to use its core capital it needs some security to borrow from the interbank lending market and if that doesn't work possibly from the central bank at a higher rate.
To create money this way without requiring extra securites, money needs to be created at roughly the same rate at all banks which have correspondent banking agreements. This is likely the case over time in an expanding economy. It also means top players in the banking sectors can collude in creating money this way.

I like your comment but it's strictly about Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies can behave inflationary without a fixed limit. It's still a lot more transparent because the actual amount issued is open to see for everyone and changes in inflation of the money base are easily detected. 
There is a chance representative democracy could eventually establish a cryptocurrency mimicking today's government fiat. Socalists can still print to keep the voters happy. The question is: Will alternatives like Bitcoin be legal in such a system? I'd very much hope people get a choice which (crypto)currency to use.
One other point I just thought about: Ad infinitum inflating crypto currencies are not inherently debt based, which is another plus.

There's a lot of contemporary witnesses, myself included. 
After a closed door meeting called the "New York agreement" there was the threat of a hardfork in October 2017 to something called Segwit2x which would increase the block size and later enable segwit. 
Luckily it was the consensus of users including important economic actors in the space like exchanges who did not go along and they started to signal for BIP148 UASF. Miners - motivated by block rewards and reluctant to be on the wrong side of a chain fell in place and neither a hardfork nor chainspilt happenend. Segwit was signalled unanimously starting August 1st (or more precise the blockheight in BIP148).
Increasing the coin limit is a hardfork. Miners are not going to do it unless there is an economic majority behind it.
Then still if they did anyway - it's not Bitcoin, it's some fork of Bitcoin. The coin limit at just under 21m is one of the defining principles of Bitcoin. Only if people - the economic majority - lost interest in using the original chain, that fork would matter...

Insightful.  However in this case there was a tx associated with the sale, so possibly it was a sale of actual Bitcoin.
Where would naked shorting work in the Bitcoin sphere? Bitmex? CME? On Bitfinex / Poloniex you actually have to borrow the Bitcoin and it has meant a significant increase in lending rates in the past.  Borrowing 100k Bitcoin on Bitfinex for example is a multiple of what is lent there at this time, rates would be through the roof + the amount possibly not even available at a moment's notice.

There may be bias - but this applies to both sides. Shadowstats makes a good argument why it's desirable to indicate lower inflation than is actually present. All economic data needs inflation adjustment: real growth, real interest, real wages et cetera. 
I find it odd that methodologies for measuring inflation have changed over time with newer methodologies continually indicating less inflation than older methodologies. This is at least an indication that something is amiss and part of a political agenda. Especially the business of [hedonic regression]( leaves wiggle room and can be used to underreport. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 08:15:27
According to [CPI-U]( inflation is low. According to [shadowstats]( with CPI-U there's significant underreporting and it no longer measures the cost of maintaining a constant standard of living or the full inflation for out-of-pocket expenditures.
The reporting methodologies in place as of 1980 better reflect inflation and is more closely linked with money creation: See the second chart here: [Shadowstats inflation charts]( Certainly there is no hyper-inflation yet but somewhere between 5-10% annually appears to be more realistic.

The idea with debt is for the lender to be able to default on it. 
Together with payment for time preference of money this is part of the risk premium of interest paid on the loan.
ofc defaulting is the "power collapse" you're talking about, therefore it's usually avoided. 
If you create enough (central bank) money over time it comes close to a default. The price of commodities will rise, as the purchasing power is watered down. Hodling commodities to then repay debt could be done with any commodity i.e. gold, silver, oil not just Bitcoin.
There was a half serious thought experiment with the 2011 debt ceiling: To use [Trillion-dollar coins]( issued by the United States Mint (which is essentially central bank money in most other parts of the world) to pay off debt. It's just another way to monetize debt by creating money - which will diminish the purchasing power of the USD further over time.

If he left for other reasons - like "leaving his baby for to the community for the better" - I believe he may not actuall have mined nor bought coin subsequently. Maybe we'll find out someday.

Bail-ins are too remote a possibility for many people to see it as a real risk. 
In the EU bail-ins by law are only supposed to happen for amounts exceeding 100k EUR. Most people seem unconcerned as it's more than they have saved in their bank account. They rule out the possibility of these amounts being reduced in the future or not being followed through.
Generally - especially for the EUR zone - bail-ins on a large scale could lead to a currency reform. In this case the 100k will likely be upheld however any savings are reduced to say 1/10 of newly issued money...
Again most people do not concern themselves with this. It seems to alien for them to happen... what we fear is commonly quickly repressed.

The figures in the table shown are from 2014 and are outdated for Bitcoin. 
The article cited as [source]( specifically states Bitcoin to be using ~70 Terawatthours mid 2018 which equates 252 million Gigajoules (GJ) if we can trust [this converter]( That would put Bitcoin mining at half the energy used for gold mining but obviously still around 1/10 of the traditional banking system.

Good discussion! I think it's pretty clear what we call "money" in the fiat world is always an IOU - either from / towards the central bank or to / from a commercial bank. That may not be common sense for most people but it's clear to us.
I'm also wondering about [proprietary trading]( Surely here it comes in handy for banks that they can create "money" on their balance sheet to trade with. Profits from this kind of trading enters the economy through divident payments to share holders and employees (bonuses). There are Basel I/II/III core capital requirements to be fulfilled but there is a very convenient special treatment for "sovereign debt" which is recognized as High-quality highly-liquid assets  - see [Area II in Basel III for Dummies]( If a bank can make "easy money" by creating money and buying up sovereign debt, then it looks to me like commercial banks are used for window-dressing to argue central banks would not directly monetize government debt. 
We're currently certainly in situation where the broad money created by commerical banks is starting to shrink because of an unwillingless to borrow and lend and because of debt payment default. The central banks call this deflationary and are providing the liquidity and buying up bonds for example - see Polleit: [Central Banks Can Increase the Money Supply, Even If Banks Do Not Lend](

The idea of correspondig banking agreements is not refuted within the article - it's still in all pictures, so I'm not certain there is no netting. It's referring to systems like BACS/FP, Euro1, ACH. The central bank can be used as well - however for example with [Target2 balances]( it remains unclear who will be liable in case of bankruptcy of a nation state (we may find out soon with Greece). 


Well, it has become a liability of the taxpayer (bail-out) and the depositors (bail-in) in the past. 
Granted I'm missing the link between what is presented in what I've linked and the statement by the [Bank of England]( "Of the two types of broad money, bank deposits make up the vast majority — 97% of the amount currently in circulation. And in the modern economy, those bank deposits are mostly created by commercial banks themselves." That's why I proposed the theory that banks create money more or less in lock-step. 
It may just be that the securities are grossly overstated in price which makes it look like "money creation out of nothing" - and looking at it it's a feedback loop: If you create lots of debt to buy houses for example you increase the demand and price for houses. In turn houses will be valued at a higher price, requiring yet more debt to buy the next one. This will go on until either the banks or the consumers are reluctant to take the risk of giving out or taking on the debt - this is ideally steered partly with the interest rate. As I understand it: The decision to give out the debt (create money) lies with the bank first and foremost - there is little restraint keeping banks from doing this and hence the saying "out of nothing" may be lurid and not a prudent way of doing business for banks but it's not wrong either.

Laws of physics can change too. There is no guarantee gravity will work tomorrow the way it does today, however it tends to work out pretty well over the past years ;).
A limited supply of government fiat is just as unlikely as consensus to call something Bitcoin which has more than 21 million coins in total. 
There's never a 100% guarantee in life other than death and maybe taxes but I'd rather stick to the fundamentals which are much more likely to remain that way: gravity, limited supply for Bitcoin, unlimited supply for govt fiat.

Banks borrow from the public. When you deposit money in a bank essentially you are giving them a loan and they have an obligation to pay it back. However if the go bust they cannot pay you back and other facilities dealing with fund insurance pay you back. This works fine if a small to mid-sized bank fails and if you don't have more than the insured amount deposited, however there is not enough insurance to cover a big bank failing.

In terms of availability and integrity of your communication with the blockchain there are enough measures in place that this is mostly a solved matter from a security point of view (i.e Electrum: utxo root hashes, SPV headers, checking for longest chain on multiple servers, making use of Bitcoin core on the server side). In terms of confidentiality (IP address link to whole BIP32 address tree) improvements are needed but this can be solved in the future (encapusulating requests with encryption and spreading them over a number of servers from a master server node).

It's entirely possible to control the price of Bitcoin with just USD without previously having aquired Bitcoin. It's just going to cost USD (buy high, sell low) - and that's hardly a problem if you can issue those.
It works fine for gold with a market cap in the single digit trillions - granted there is central bank gold which is used to deliver at least some metal.

FOMO? Bitcoin will get Segwit but there is no need to rush it now and risk interruption / hardfork in August 2017. 
I believe the community will come to the conclusion that we should have had a flag day for Segwit in the first place and that BIP9 MASF was not the ideal way to do this. As most times it's easier with hindsight and yes it will hold back Bitcoin and stall growth to some extent for another year. However in the meantime we can get LN working properly in wallets and with UI on LTC and start building the backend network. It's not like that would be large scale production ready in August 2017 if we had segwit for BTC then. Granted segwit would already help by increasing the number of tx that can be made but for the growth challenges ahead LN is even more important and dilgigence + patience now will pay off.
People genuinely concerned Bitcoin will not survive another year before the scaling debate is solved can hedge with LTC / ETH. We're still looking good right now though...

Thanks for the insights! 
Poloniex lending for example is (for all we know) full reserve. Margin traders pay lenders interest for coins lent there. Technical difficulties aside traders and lenders can pay out all Coins deposited and Poloniex needs to be able to cover that and cannot just go to any "last resort lender" to make up for it. Obviously there will be businesses running fractional reserve wit Bitcoins and they will fail gox style and it's for the better that way.
WRT to banks and lending: It's hard for me to get my head around this as well. As long as loans are not cashed out (because cash is central bank money) *or* transferred to another bank it can just sit on the balance sheet of the bank. 
Cash can always be obtained through the lending windows of the central bank.
It gets interesting for the transfers to other banks. From what I  understand there is netting going on, so an offset between inflow and outflows when settling between two banks. Large banks can run more fractional reserve if they have continuously high volumes between them because of netting.
International payments are also interesting. For example inside the Euro-Zone there is a system called TARGET2 in which the national banks of each member country are recording debts to other central banks. Needless to say Germany has a high TARGET2 balance wheras countries in the south of Europe accumulate large debts in this system. Essentially what is happending here is that more central bank money is being issued as a result of it.
From what I've read by publications by the Bank of England for example there are some core capital requirements and some central bank reseve requirements (very low 1% in Europe) but other than that it's largely the risk appetite by the banks and the ability to re-finance. To my knowledge the intra-bank lending market has all but dried up after Lehmann, so these days it's more common to actually make use of central bank tenders for re-financing. I don't know the situation in the US, but at least in Europe these tenders by the ECB have been very popular with banks to prop up their capital to lend and there were few to no limit wrt the value of these tenders.
From what I've read 90-95% of currency is on banks balance sheets rather than central bank money and the positive money initiatives around the world (for example in the UK and Switzerland) would like to change this. See this [PDF]( from the Swiss Vollgeld (full reserves) initiative for example.

I agree, but from what luke-jr says it looks as though remaining 0.13.1 - 0.14.1 nodes might be harmful in such a scenario because they might not be prepared to get old style compatible blocks.

Thanks for pointing out that the non-BIP148 chain can get orphaned while the BIP148 cannot. I need to wrap my head around this first, I don't understand it yet.
WRT BIP149, it's a bit disappointing that BIP9 timeouts can only be handled with an eco-system version upgrade but if that's really the case it's a lesson learnt and room for improvement the next time (possibly avoid BIP9 in the future). Obviously it's unfortunate it's Segwit where we learn that lesson but it should not take years to write safe code. I know much too little about the technical details but I would have thought you don't necessarily need more elaborate code for BIP149 to deal with 0.13.1 - 0.14.1 clients but rather a community effort to upgrade. The past has shown even without a shout out to the community to upgrade a year will lift a good majority of nodes to a recent version.

Headline does not match article content. Bank of Canada is aware Bitcoin works outside of the current central banking system and monetary policy by central banks would be obsolete when the monetary order was based on Bitcoin.
Negative interest rates only work as a monetary policy if you're forced to keep funds at banks - and it's effecively just another tax. This is harder to enforce for Bitcoin holdings.
If you are your own bank it won't work this way but only through taxation on wealth.

Some Electrum servers with ~4 GB RAM have a harder time coping with the large mem pool attack. It can take a longer time (up to a couple of minutes) to sync to a working node while it's processing a new block. If it's not processing a block, normal sync times are ~5-20 secs. If the node is defunct it will never sync (5 min plus)
The issue here is: auto-connect will only move on to the next server if the connection is refused. So you can get stuck on a slow / defunct server which is syncing forever.
Have a look at 
and choose a server near the *bottom* of the list. Those are the faster ones.

No, it just appears logic that a higher price means more funds are needed to move the market. But obivously there is no rule for it.
Currently it could be anything - I don't think there is one specific reason why the price is up, growth and influx seems to happen in waves and I think is largely linked (still) to adoption - people finally considering Bitcoin as an investment after having heard about it a while ago, and more sentiment than news - like FOMO, trading Altcoins back an forth...

He doesn't say "created" - he says "funded" + "provided". Even if Daesh (ISIS) weren't funded directly, no one is denying support for opposition forces in Syria by US.
Now if you hand over weapons, cars, man pad rocket launchers and money to opposition forces in the area it's irresponsible to just leave them to it and have their stuff ripped off by Daesh forces. So irresponsible that it's easy to assume negligence or even intent.
Edit: Destabilizing both Iraq and Libya (Daesh is active there too) created the vacuum for ISIS to be created in the first place. Moreover one has to wonder why US airstrikes were mostly ineffective for a year + why a blind eye was turned by the US to rogue black market oil exports by Daesh (but cutting off terrorist funding can be a top priority when part of the greater agenda). 
It paints a picture of either a naive, awkward and clueless super-power with little idea of how to act or it's part of a greater covert geo-strategic plan.

Electrum is an open source effort and should be treated as such. It's dynamic, meaning new features get added when written or approved by ThomasV. There is a community and there is open discussion about developments (for example on github).
I agree it was merged without taking care about notifications. It was specificially mentioned in the [github PR]( that the patch does not take care of notification and there was some discussion why it would be a good idea to implement notifications. Merged means it's not yet in a relased version just in the master development branch.
ThomasV stated back in March "We should also detect unconfirmed RBF transactions." but added "it makes sense only if we also check that all the parent transactions are confirmed". The latter appears to be non-trivial. More specifically he commented later in the thread: "[...] if we warn users about RBF transactions, we should be similarly warning them against any transaction that has unconfirmed inputs." A notion I second.
I think there is a good chance we'll get this implemented soon enough, hopefully in time before a new release version. All it'd take is a good pull request which can be merged. Alternatively we can ask Thomas to implement it but patience is a virtue here.

If Bitcoin manages to preserve purchasing power in a highly price inflationary scenario that's already an ideal reason to invest. 
Chances are it'll perform multiple times better than just preserving purchasing power because adoption will also increase in such a scenario.
The "rest of the world" would benefit greatly if a larger number of people understood that they are "invested" at all times. When they hold fiat in some government currency they are already making a default choice to keep value in the form of this currency. Depreciation is built in by design because of a price and monetary inflation target exercised by central banks.

They issue debt to customers like individuals buying houses or a car or businesses needing it to grow their business, sometimes themselves if they need it for trading. 
A banking license is practically a license to issue money. As a bank you're free to take on risks with little core capital requirements dictated by the Basel agreements. Now if debts go bad the bank may be at risk to go bankrupt. This is good as banks then have initiative to limit their risk and credit creation but it's crucial that banks can in turn actually go bankrupt if this happens (like gox and so forth). However these days if you're a large player and the whole financial system is at risk the government might need to bail you out or the savers have to pay with some of the money on their bank account (bail-in).
90-95% of money is created by banks and sits in their balance sheets. 
See the following PDF as an example from Switzerland where there is a positive money (full-reserve banking) initiative
This is part of the reason why Bitcoin is refreshingly different. Of course there will also be fractional lending at bank like entities but they cannot be bailed out by printing more money, they will go bankrupt which is important to weed out bad players in the market.

Electrum uses estimatefee from bitcoind as reported by the server and has [a sanity limit client side]( of 300k Satoshi per kilobyte (currently 5.43 USD) or  75k Satoshi (1,35 USD) for a ~250 byte tx  to deal with faulty logic / fake reporting.
If tx in the mempool keep piling up competing for blockspace it might well hit the hardcoded sanity limit already but I guess at this price tag it's worth deciding yourself whether you want a higher fee or not by manual override.
Edit: We're already hitting the sanity limit. "In next block" still goes above the sanity limit because it's just 50% on top of "estimatefee 2" but I guess it's time to set manual fees for now if you have a high priority tx
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:49:52
Unfortunately there are parties on the Bitcoin network re-broadcasting tx, so this is out of your hands in a way. Chances to double-spend increase with time, especially if you find an electrum server that does not show your transaction in the memory pool anymore.
You can take a look at the mempool  and judge what the confirmation time might be for the fee you have set.
You can try the VIAbtc accelerator as a last resort, but has an hourly limit so you need to re-try a lot of times.

It makes sense, I'm still reading it - and it's hard for me to arrive at a conclusion yet.
If the borrower and the seller have their bank account at the same bank it would work. Extending this there will be many loans concentrated at a few larger banks within an economic zone where funds are wired back and forth between those banks (netting). So really the problem here would be if credit was not created in lock-step (a huge disbalance between loans by some banks rather than others) but there is interbank-lending to deal with that. 
Interbank lending from my understanding is risk taken by one bank to loan excess funds (deposits) to another bank - so that would be where the deposits come in after all. Now the question arises how do deposits come into existence. They appear to be loaned into existence either by borrowing from the central bank or trickling down from public spending of government bonds or aforementioned loans by banks being interchanged between each other...

I know this is controversial but:
In the light of the [1 million LTC segwit bounty]( shouldn't it be possible to pool to pay miners using segwit tx, so they can redeem high fee transaction if they mine segwit blocks?  
It won't work on August 1st because after signalling it takes 1-2 difficulty retargetting periods for segwit to activate on the segwit chain. Yet it might still be a nice incentive to make segwit happen asap to mine the tx?
Can we ntimelock funds or is there no good way to ensure we won't doublespend and miners can actually redeem the fees in the future?

If it replaces a good deal of the legacy banking system while trying to weaken SHA256, I think that's more than a fair tradeoff.
The keyspace is just too large for any sensible brute-force attacks. Bitcoin just throws raw power at the problem, there are no algorithmic advancements in solving the problem.
Quoting from [Stackexchange Security]( in regards to some known algorithmic attacks against SHA256: "SHA-256 has a time complexity of 2^256 to crack normally. Reducing it to 2^253.5 is a negligible difference, and it would take centuries of such changes before cracking SHA would be feasible." and ""2^&gt;200 will likely never be feasible barring changes to known physical laws"

In Electrum 2.8.2 the setting in options is called "Porpose Replace-By-Fee" with a drop-down: "Always, If the fee is low, Never". 
Set that to "Always" and once you put in an amount to send, there is a checkbox in the send tab called "Replaceable". When it's checked the tx is RBF and you can then bump the fee in the history tab, by right clicking the tx. You get another fee slider and the option to manually set the fee of the tx.

Luke-jr [writes]( "0.13.1-0.14.1 think they understand segwit, but won't accept it as legit until the BIP 9/141 deployment activates; a redeployment must gracefully downgrade them to non-segwit. If a 0.14.1 node downloads a segwit block instead of the stripped equivalent, it will reject the block because it believes segwit is inactive."
How do we deal with this in BIP149? To me it sounds like it's a hurdle we need to consider for BIP149 deployment, without BIP149 being at fault by itself. 
I don't really get the point why 0.13.1-0.14.1 appear to have segwit "half-activated" - they understand the logic but deem blocks invalid if not activated by BIP9. 
Clearly it would only make sense for them to "understand segwit" when it has actually activated and not before. If that's actually the case BIP8 is superior because you can't get the situation of clients "being dead in the water" with an expired BIP9 deployment in the future.

Bitcoin is disinflationary so it cannot be compared that way
Actually if you take "Figure 4 : The Number of Banknotes issued in the U.K" from [History of the Gold Standard]( and just pounds sterling as an example: It worked well from 1800 - 1912 and then starts showing a hockey stick movement due to fractional reserve / central banking decoupling from the actual metal.
So Bitcoin may well have a much longer life span just looking at inflation figures and has more properties of gold in terms of scarcity.

Technically this should be possible in any democracy b/c all power is supposed to emanate from the people. Obviously this does not really work so well b/c of representation, (lack of) education and nudging.
But as long as freedom of contract is upheld it should be possible to have a user activated currency.
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:55:18
BIP149 is not an altcoin. If there is a new rule by UASF and you don't care to verify it and someone else breaks those rules you shouldn't complain to have your block orphaned by the rest of the network. You don't have to use the new feature if you don't want to but failing to upgrade to know what's going on is trusting others to do the verification for you.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:08:57
It would make sure Segwit activated by MASF during this BIP9 timeout period making it compatible with the installed user base of 0.13.1 - 0.14.1. 
Otherwise we might need to wait a year or a little longer to account for update inertia. As you've pointed out on IRC hypothetically older clients won't enforce segwit rules because they don't know it has activated but will not try to get the backwards-compatible stripped header version either. This needs more looking into and is not a confirmed issue at this time. All credits to - I'm just writing this up.
I think forcing MASF through UASF because BIP9 timeout looms must not be the only reason to do it. 
Update inertia from pre 0.12.1 to 0.13.2 was around one year  (for 80% to have upgraded, amongst the remaining 20% are also alternative implementations) so we might still be good if BIP149 is merged and released before or around July 2017, with a flag day on 4th of July 2018.

There is no reason to believe Electrum developers would like to see their users scammed. It's more about not giving the wrong impression that non-RBF unconfirmed tx are somehow safe.
I personally think there should be some general note about unconfirmed tx, indicating that both RBF and non-RBF are not necessarily final transactions. Ideally it should be added that RBF has a higher probability of not being final.

No, I'm pretty certain these two things are separate. There is a pgp signature (.asc file) which signs the actual binary you download. 
There's also a MD5 hash published on the website, to quickly check the integrity of the download, for example with md5sum.
pgp is better to establish trust, especially if you have the public key imported a long time ago and from a different site, because websites can be manipulated to show the wrong MD5 hash (SSL MiM, defacement etc).

Also: The binaries provided might have nothing to do with the innocent looking code on their github repo. For all we know it might be stealing coins. There is little point in having signatures for binaries without saying who signed them or providing a public key. Making it look trustworthy while deceiving users would be one point that comes to mind however.
With them breaking deterministic builds no one can verify that the binary builds are from the published source either, so that might be intentional.

"child pays for parent" only works for the sending party if you have change left from your transaction which went back to your wallet. Electrum can then use this change to make another transaction with a higher fee and miners will pick up both the parent and the child in one block and collect the fee.
In your case maybe there was no change, because you sent it all or there was too little to be able to make a new transaction.
Depositing btc to then do CPFP won't work I'm afraid. The alternative would be the receiver doing a CPFP transaction with what is to be received. Most of the time that is not an option as the the receiver then bears the fees and might not have the functionality at all (exchanges)

If it still gives you a preview window when you click send that might be a bug with settings carried over from older versions to 2.8.x - can you confirm this or does this only happen with CPFP?

"Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept"
It reminds me a bit of qmail trying to save the Internet  from MTAs sending bare line feeds by dropping the connection during transmisson because it doesn't conform to RFC822. Especially Exchange servers do this (to this day?) and many qmail installations were patched because otherwise you'd lose random mail which might have been important - and Microsoft ignoring the RFC was just too much of an economic player to ignore. 
We'll see, but economic majority would need happen quickly in June (announcement by major exchanges for example) to have lead time to reach critical mass before August.

Growing pains are not a crisis yet IMHO. 
Blocks are already full. Help is on the way. Some people believe things are moving too slowly. I believe it's better to do things slowly (and risk it being too slow indeed) than to rush things. 
Software development has been around for decades.
Running a stable decentralized system with a paradigm changing consensus mechanism invented merely 7 years ago is different than rolling out some bugfixes to established software.

While this is correct most new users are using Circle, blockchain.info, coinbase etc. These services all know your bitcoin addresses and most often your personal data too. At least with electrum you can run your own server and/or decide which server to use.
The default setting for electrum server these days is to log the IP address of users when they are first connecting and independent of IPs the tx ID of sent transactions but no addresses at all. Sure you could add your own logging but 99 out of 100 servers won't bother.

Wait for the mempool to clear out, which is unlikely but possible on weekends.
Try double spending using a server that does not list your transaction anymore (cycle through servers, possibly restarting electrum and see if tx is still in history). As time goes by chances this works will increase. The default hold time in mempool is two weeks these days but it might get evicted earlier on many nodes if the mempool is larger than the default 300 MB.

We don't know the details for sure, but it was most likely a tampered version of Electrum loaded on the laptop, that would verify everything that had "CSW" in the message.
Apparently they first tried a git clone / zip download of the source from github first but couldn't get it to run on Win (granted it's not that easy when you also have to install the correct version of python for win).
They then decided to download a binary. 
I tried to isolate the actual download happening in London from the official download server around the time of the verify together with Gavin using reddit private messages. We could not find it conclusively.
There was no checking of a pgp signature for the downloaded binary whatsoever...

Thanks for this very thorough and thoughtful reply, much appreciated and a valuable point of view for me.
It's fairly normal for the US to act primarily out of self-interest. There were reasons to intervene in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya and I believe they were not about "democratizing" those countries for the betterness of humankind but because of a multifaceted geo-strategic agenda at hand (i.e. balance of power, control over resources, trade and passage rights, US dollar dominance to name a few). Decisive action was taken to reach goals within a certain timeframe. 
The US wasn't allowed to intervene in Syria because of Russian interstest afaik, hence the strategy to foster a proxy war to get rid of Assad. Allowing ISIS/Daesh to fill the power vacuum in Iraq rather than taking action before taking ground troops away from Iraq wasn't helpful. Saddam was a threat to the world (remember the lies about weapons of mass destruction at the UN) - while Daesh was annoying but convenient to uphold terror warnings and patriot act measures at home and helping to destabilize the region. It's this selective action by the US that makes bystanders believe it's intent.

There is and will be interest to be earned with Bitcoin - but there will also be defaults on debt. Interest is meant to compensate for the time preference (spend later) and the risk of default of the debtor.
In the current fiat system, time preference is blurred because of low interest rates and large defaults are avoided at all costs by bail-outs.
With Bitcoin no one can create an obscene amount of Bitcoin to bail someone out. You can however lend and make money - for example on exchanges like Poloniex or Bitfinex, with the risk of default of these exchanges. There are p2p lending clubs with lots of stories of debtors defaulting.
The idea of Bitcoin's disinflation is that it appreciates in value as demand increases through usage and adoption while supply decreases. Thus you don't have to take the risk of lending to counter monetary inflation as there is perpetually less of it as time moves on. You can pursue it as a source of income but bear in mind that unlike in the current debt based fiat system the risks are (much) higher.

I'm all for a BIP148 success, I just don't see it happening unless some people have very good connections and convincing powers with exchanges. The same group of exchanges which [released contingency plans stating they'd not support BU as BTC]( would need to make the same statement about BIP148. So whoever got that going back then should try again.
As for BIP149 I believe the suggested date of July 4th 2018 is pretty realistic if it was part of a core release in ~August 2017 if BIP148 didn't reach economic majority. One year should be enough for clients to update their 0.13.1+ client to the new flag day.
True, if there is no quick consensus to include BIP149 in a core release we might be talking years from now... I just hope that won't be the case
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:26:59
Bitcoin core and miners decide about the functionality of RBF. Electrum is merely a client enabling to see and use the functionality. 
Just because Electrum doesn't support it doesn't mean it won't be used. There is no reason to cripple Electrum's functionality just because there's functionality out there you don't like.
In fact planned support to warn users of RBF is better than leaving it as it is.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:38:08
Electrum is working hard on releasing 2.9 which has generic
chain split detection. There is also a generic way to split coins using RBF and different fee levels which will work with BCC as well. I know they have their own flag for replay protection but it's unlikely to by vanilla Electrum in the light of generic coin split options.

This is not a problem. Electrum 2.9 has fork detection and this cash node will not work after the fork as the headers will be refused.

1) That's the best way of doing it. This way you're transferring to an address that can be recovered with the electrum seed (13 words these days) for the wallet
2a) If you find yourself unable to send coins to a different wallet you can export the relevant private keys from the client and import them into another client. In the GUI use Wallet -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Export
2b) Make sure you have your seed written down ans safely stored somewhere. The installer wizard will ask you to do this.

We need to figure out how 0.13.1 - 0.14.1 core clients behave once BIP9 for segwit times out in November. [Luke-jr noted on IRC]( that old clients might not ask for the backwards-compatible stripped header version of blocks. If that'd be the case in my understanding segwit is half-activated for them even today and it'd be a bug that needs to be fixed. When BIP9 times out in November clients should behave like segwit is not happening (for the time being), otherwise they'd be dead in the water for another round and we'd need to wait for the eco-system to update. Update inertia is about a year from past experience.
BIP149 is (by itself) designed to be as minimally invasive as possible. 
You add segwit blocks as compatible on flag day (if not activated before) which means starting that day you can see segwit blocks on the network. If your software is up to date you can verify that segwit blocks on the network are legit and by the rules. If your software is not up to date you won't know about segwit blocks and transactions will look compatible but non-sensical. If your software is outdated you cannot verify that the segwit block content is acutally legitimate. Yet if it's the longest chain as a miner you will build on it. 
I don't have figures on it but to this day we don't see invalid blocks on the network on a daily basis because the incentive to get the block reward and fees is higher than producing some block that is against the rules.
With that in mind in all but a very few cases miners mining on top of unverified segwit blocks is not a problem. For the few times when there is a actually a bad segwit block around which non-segwit miners build upon there might be a 2 block reorganisation like with BIP66. How often do we get BIP66 violations these days? I know of none other than the one incident which was widely reported.

This is true until it isn't - the current system has been working for some generations but it won't work forever because of mathematical progression and erosion of trust. I hope you get to enjoy your pension. As Greenspan said: "We can guarantee cash, but we cannot guarantee purchasing power!"
You're probably invested in company stocks to dodge that bullet - however many of those have accrued a lot of debt and few will be left standing at a fraction of their current valuation. Stock prices themselves are inflated as it's cheap to borrow money.

I beg to differ and second Chris Powell's quote: "[There are no markets anymore, just interventions](
In a working market, short term yields ought to be determined by the interest rate policy of the central banks, while long term yields are set by the market, reflecting risk ratios. By Basel II/III standards investment grade government bonds are treated as no or very low risk investments for banks therefore little or no core capital is required (mostly 0% actually) to invest in it. Moreover central banks are determined to control both the short and long tail of the curve, if they have to by buying up excess supply.
Governments have and will default on their debt, so why banks and institutional investors actually pay a fee to hold govt debt amazes me. There is no obligation that Germany would pay back these bonds in Deutsche Marks, should the Euro dissolve. I assume it's just very easy to invest large sums of excess liquid reserves this way and no one ever got fired for buying AAA rated govt bond - so it might come down to laziness + risk averseness of the investors involved.

Replays can be done by anyone watching the blocks / mempool so are independent. You can use techniques like RBF and different fee levels to get tx confirmed on both sides of the fork in different blocks or mix coins - see here  .

Many thanks for the insightful view! 500 bits Yes, I guess time has to move on and volatility needs to match that of (precious) metals like gold and silver before banks can offer LTV. Banks commonly allow to loan against blue chip stock and gold for 50% loan-to-value these days, so I'd hope in 5-10 years we'll have that for Bitcoin too.
Forking is a low probability - no party is really interested in a fork which would split value (however the bank would also own both coins on a split) in two chains, with one emerging as the one where most or even all value is held. In my humble opinion the scaling debate will be resolved with segwit happening 2018 and layer 2 technlogies like the lightning network happening.

I think it's close to solving identity management and authentication with blockchain, as the ability to sign and possibly encrypt comes as a basic building block of the tech.

By full reserve I mean you only lend out deposits and don't refinance at all. Just as an example: In a gold standard based system it would mean you actually have all the gold in your vault that you issue bearer notes for and don't run fractional reserve. In the current fiat system it would mean lending out central bank money, so the central bank gets to steer the credit volume directly and disallowing the multiplier effect.
Bitcoin is similar to gold - so for Poloniex they get people to deposit Bitcoin to a lending account where you can offer to lend out your Bitcoin for 2-60 days. They are then not available for you to withdraw or trade with. The person who borrowed the money can use it to trade with it (sell short Bitcoin or use it as collateral for a leveraged call on another coin). To me that is 100% reserve - fractional reserve would be saying: look people don't withdraw all their money anyway so we can actually issue more loans than Bitcoins have been deposited. As there is no central bank or other bank to go to in case of a "bank run" on Poloniex they don't run fractional and actually have full deposits for every loan made. I don't quite follow how that is 0% reserve for you.

From looking at the [reference implementation]( it's still 95% for early MASF activation (unless I'm reading it wrong)

Yes, please lets have more of this world wide.
Credit is inevitable, but it's a difference how much collateral is needed by banks to loan. Ideally 100% but they will run fractional reserve but never to the extent possible these days, where banks have minimal core capital requirements. The blockchain can also be used to make it more transparent at what reserve ratio a bank is running (proof of solvency). 
Hopefully it will also be possible to use Bitcoin at banks as collateral for fiat loans (Gresham's law applies, where you'd rather borrow bad money against your good money rather than using your good money directly).

As long as you don't transact it's ok to have an old version installed.
BCC will implement replay protection so using old versions of Electrum should be fine to transact in Bitcoin (BTC).

How much of global energy is currently used up by the industrial military complex?
Price of electricity is a feedback mechanism - it'd be strange if you could get 10% of the world's electricity almost free, because current growth of hashrate depends on very cheap energy...
Also block reward will go down as time goes on - this is another feedback mechanism to not grow hashrate and power consumption indefinitely. That's one great advantage of disinflation over an altcoin that uses PoW but inflates ad infinitum. That might be one of the reasons why altcoins with steady inflation are looking for proof-of-stake type of systems.

It's a soft-fork. It should not need unanimous support by miners. It's sufficient if we have blocks supporting the tech when enough nodes are able to validate it. BIP9 is used so that miners can activate the tech and secure the network before users upgrade. The initial assumption when designing und using BIP9 was not to meet miner resistance, that's why the 95% threshold was placed.
The rest is history...

Intersting thoughts, good link to China and precious metals. I don't think a nation state will pay off debt with crypto currencies.

The servers have a so called "Patricia tree data structure", also called "Ultimate Blockchain Compression". 
This data structure allows a client to get the balance of any address instantly, and it also generates a "proof of completeness" (the root hash of the patricia tree), that can be used to check that the server sent all UTXOs related to a given address to the client.
It's currently implemented in the way that servers which publish the wrong root hash - i.e. have corrupted or incomplete data - will get kicked from IRC which makes them unavailable on the public server list.
Ideally the root hash (universal for the bitcoin ecosystem) will be published in some decentralized form someday so clients can check for themselves.

The "design error" with BIP9 is that it requires a version upgrade after the timeout date if a timeout happens. It's not prepared to activate the same tech another way and might even be incompatible with future attempts. This costs time b/c of upgrade inertia. It's debatable if that justifies forcing orphaning of blocks just to get it done before the BIP9 timeout and keep older versions alive.
Edit: It's not really a design error, that's why I put it in quotation marks to begin with. It's rather a shortcoming to avoid complexity and code duplication which has a higher grade of stability in mind.

If you control 10k bitcoin core nodes, doesn't that mean you are effectively running more than 51% of public nodes, leading to a high degree of involvement in the consensus mechanism? Certain soft forks require a percentage of participaction for rules to come into effect.

A lot of Banks in Greece for example to this day (and some in Italy / Spain I would imagine) depend on ELA to do their day to day business, as there is no other liqudity and they are technically insolvent.

You can check the fee paid by the actual transaction that was received by your wallet. Just put the transaction Id into the search box at blockchain.info and it shows "fee by byte" in Satoshis per byte.
What they probably do is "pay to many", so indeed they charge you a flat fee and then create a large transaction with many outputs including yours and pay one (larger) fee for it.
Looking at  the mempool was slightly less full in the early hours UTC yesterday but yea, Polo probably has a good fee estimate going otherwise many more unhappy customers if payout tx were stuck for days.
Edit: So I don't think it'll have an effect on any UASF decision and it's unlikely Polo has any agreements with miners. I believe Polo would go along with whatever flag day / UASF core decides to put in their client (if they do decided on anything wrt). Polo have stated in the past they support core.

Really? Why would chinese miners want a block size increase at all, let alone more than 2 MB at the moment. I thought it increases their orphan rate because their latency and bandwitdh isn't as good as it's in the west.
I don't think they are seeing some price-elasticity concern wrt fees. Larger blocksizes would most probably mean less fees per tx, so overall the tx fee per block would remain roughly the same. As long as there is a scaling plan at all (including a possible hard fork at a later time - Greg Maxwell states this on the mailinglist and it's linked in this thread) I don't see why Chinese miners would need to force lager blocks. It's not like the price has been declining in the past year.

If it can be done, do it.
It cannot be done for 7k Bitcoin after 2-3 confirmations. That's one of the points of what makes Bitcoin what it is today.
The most realistic possible intervention would have been trying to re-place the 0-conf transaction by paying a higher fee or specifically coordinating with miners not to mine the transaction like that. But there is no such collusion between miners going and it's better that way.
Edit: I called replacing a 0-conf transaction collusion. Coming to think about it - I take it back, it's fine to do this. Two parties are holding the same private key (attacker and Binance), competition about who gets to spend it first is allowed. Usually in the form of paying higher fees to miners.

Ok, I take it hardfork and chainsplit are used synonymously when they should not be. A lot of people will call a chainsplit a hardfork.
So we're risking a chainsplit with BIP148 and I don't see how that could be good for Bitcoin if it happened. By all means if the large exchanges are onboard I'd say we could even live with the chainsplit. Some exchange would probably try to make the "fork" tradable and chances are the BIP148 one is the one with most value. However I'd rather have segwit activate later trough a flag day with less noise. Maybe that's just ,  and myself - if so, fair enough.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:22:11
You lose at least 2 blocks, more likely 10+ - depending how much hash rate you have and dedicate, how long you think you can win to re-org. I see where your 100 BTC figure comes from - that's 8 blocks worth of block reward currently. 
However risking to lose 100 BTC to potentially win 7000 is a gamble  best taken at the dice site of choice, not in Bitcoin mining. At the same time unless you HF you need someone in posession of the private key to support this action.
The larger the value of the transaction the more ressources there may be for double-spending, the more confirmations you should wait to ascertain there will be no successful double-spend attack. Waiting 20 blocks to clear 40+ million USD worth of value should be fine. So ultimately it's the party acting on the transaction determining what security is acceptable. The cost increases exponentially with more confirmations.
There may and likely will be rogue miners in the history of Bitcoin. This may work for certain, low depth (blocks mined) attacks but becomes rather unlikely as the height increases. There are very few situations where pulling off a low depth attack even makes sense; only when the other party in the transaction has no way to retaliate.
One that comes to mind is theft as has happened here with Binance. It's sort of a perverse incentive. Preventing or reverting theft once a transaction is signed fully and sent is not part of the security model of Bitcoin. This has to happen earlier with multi-sig, harware wallets and so forth.
Edit: correcting spelling mistakes

It's possible but unlikely. There's opportunity cost - it is much higher because if you don't win you potentially lose a lot more blocks.

You're missing that most cryptocurrencies are neither finite nor decentralized.
Bitcoin strives to uphold these properties and does it best in the space.
Other than that you need to understand the issues with the current monetary system to see why Bitcoin has a good chance of changing everything. Never before did we have money independent of (the trust in the debt of) any nation state, yet it can be transferred at a distance over the Internet.  Trust in centralized currencies will increasingly be broken - censorship of transactions, de-valuation by currency / debt creation, overreaching taxation, negative interest rates, bail-ins, abolishment of cash.  Bitcoin has a best fit of the important properties of money in the 21st century: Medium of Exchange,  Unit of Account and Store of Value. I don't mean short term price fluctuations but generational trends - i.e. the next 30-50 years.

Many thanks for all your insights, I really enjoy the discussion and didn't expect this to be such a valuable interchange (and this is probably mutual)
I'm not at all from the field just interested in trying to understand how banking / money creation works.
It's interesting to see that core deposits account for ~80% of loans and this sounds healthy. I still don't get how fiat money is created in the first place (origin of deposits) and how much of the core deposits are  inflated by the multiplier effect.
The topic is highly controversial still - please also note ["Money creation in the modern economy"]( by the BoE: 


the printing presses of the Bank of England, but by the
commercial banks themselves:  banks create money whenever
they lend to someone in the economy or buy an asset from
This paper argues individual banks’ lending is largely limited by considerations of credit risk taking and core capital requirements as laid out by Basel (which are lenient if you hold lots of sovereign bonds) rather than actual deposits.
As the other paper by R. Werner states there are three prevailing credit theories. He gives a good historic overview and all three of them have been stated by the BoE by different people there at different times. It looks as though the current put forward is indeed that banks can create money if they would like to take the risks - obviously there should be some collateral but it's hard for banks to get the valuation right.

My guess would be because (chinese) miners don't actually want more than 2 MB in the near future and very much like to see all the improvements for latency with segwit to be deployed first.
I'd also guess core devs would like to see in how much segwit and lightning already provide enough improvements for a longer timeframe than 2017 and would rather like to delay a HF for blocksize for as long as possible.
Whether or not miners will start to apply pressure by supporting a fork in 2017 will remain to be seen. As long as segwit and lightning are starting to be used I don't see pressure from miners happening.

If we don't - we should do. Arguably it's part of the "freedom of expression". As Andreas Antonopoulos explained Bitcoin makes money a means of expression because you can communicate value in a self-determined way.
Before the 18th century you did not have freedom of thought, especially in religious matters. Separation of church and state was eventually achieved.

All this is fine, if you're not coerced to use or do it exclusively. I can tolerate it, if we're allowed to use blockchain technology we deem superior. It'll take at least a generation or some fundamental rift in the current system for the money side of things to change profoundly.

Some guy who does not run a mining pool wrote a proposal in formal chinese and talks about violation of the [Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus]( from March 2016. Except there is no violation, the project plan to hard fork in 2017 is still good. 
There is no reason for Chinese miners to switch to Classic now. There might be sympathy for a plan B should the 2017 hard fork deadline pass but that's nothing noteworthy for the time being.

Thanks for pointing out this issue before LN is launched.
What if LN funds come out of one or more specific sidechains where it's "easier" to settle at some point in the future. I know this sounds weird and even more complicated but has there been thought about using LN within a sidechain to possibly allow for smarter settling?
It needs to be possible to convert back to Bitcoin but that could be done at a time with less load on the Bitcoin network. I'd certainly prefer a sort of time delay introduced by this to the potential loss of Bitcoin in the payment channel.

Great explanation. Just to add: It's a generic detection of a chain fork, so it'll apply not only to BIP148 but to any planned or accidental forks in the future. This will come in handy with HF for blocksize increases as planned by segwit2x (currently for September) as well.

Classes of Vulnerabilities we will look at:
* Firmware vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities affecting the software that runs on the hardware wallet. Since most wallets provide update mechanisms this class of bug can be patched in a future firmware release.
Software Vulnerabilities 
* Software vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities affecting the host software that runs on the PC or smartphone and communicates with the hardware wallet. Since most wallets provide update mechanisms this class of bug can be patched in a future release of the host software
* Hardware Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities affecting the device hardware of the hardware wallet. Hardware vulnerabilities are generally incorrectly set configurations of the hardware either during manufacturing or by the firmware. If the configuration is set by firmware these vulnerabilities can be patched in a future firmware release. Otherwise, they are unlikely to be fixed by the vendor.
* Physical Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities affecting the hardware design of the hardware wallet. Once the device has been manufactured, hardware vulnerabilities cannot be mitigated and can only be fixed in a future hardware revision of the device. This class of vulnerabilities is unlikely to be fixed by the vendor.
* Architectural Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities affecting the overall architecture of the hardware wallet. These are inherent design flaws in the device and can only be fixed in a major hardware revision, i.e. a new version of the device. This class of vulnerabilities is unlikely to be fixed by the vendor.

You wouldn't blacklist, you'd spend to another output, redirecting the funds elsewhere. 
As long as it's not confirmed (0-conf) and you have the private key, I think that is fine. With more than one party  holding the same private key competition about who gets to spend it first is allowed imho. Technically there is some discussion about how easy it should be to [replace any unconfirmed transaction after a certain amount of time]( with Peter Todd stating: "Try actually doublespending some time - it's a lot easier than you think it is."
Of course for certain forks using 0-conf as part of a scaling solution it would not be seen as morally right but that's another discussion.

Apparently it's the "Hodler's edition" because of the recent price crash. Everyone updating is applauded for hodling their coins nice and steady in their favourite wallet.
Please note there has been a minor update today to fix a crash bug for invoices.
Please find the release notes as follow
    # Release 3.3.1 - (December 20, 2018)
    
     * Qt: Fix invoices tab crash (
     * Android: Minor GUI improvements
     # Release 3.3.0 - Hodler's Edition (December 19, 2018)
     
      * The network layer has been rewritten using asyncio and aiorpcx.
        In addition to easier maintenance, this makes the client
        more robust against misbehaving servers.
      * The minimum python version was increased to 3.6
      * The blockchain headers and fork handling logic has been      generalized.
        Clients by default now follow chain based on most work, not length.
      * New wallet creation defaults to native segwit (bech32).
      * Segwit 2FA: TrustedCoin now supports native segwit p2wsh
        two-factor wallets.
      * RBF batching (opt-in): If the wallet has an unconfirmed RBF
        transaction, new payments will be added to that transaction,
        instead of creating new transactions.
      * MacOS: support QR code scanner in binaries.
      * Android APK:
        - build using Google NDK instead of Crystax NDK
        - target API 28
        - do not use external storage (previously for block headers)
      * hardware wallets:
        - Coldcard now supports spending from p2wpkh-p2sh,
          fixed p2pkh signing for fw 1.1.0
        - Archos Safe-T mini: fix  signing issue
        - KeepKey: full segwit support
        - Trezor: refactoring and compat with python-trezor 0.11
        - Digital BitBox: support firmware v5.0.0
      * fix bitcoin URI handling when app already running (
      * Qt listings rewritten:
        the History tab now uses QAbstractItemModel, the other tabs use
        QStandardItemModel. Performance should be better for large wallets.
      * Several other minor bugfixes and usability improvements.

I don't believe this will happen because Bitcoin has very good chances to resolve whatever is happening in the months to come and there will be a segwit chain carrying most of the value within the next 12 months maybe earlier, maybe much earlier.

Litecoin is a possibility wrt "we'll have segwit on a chain carrying most of the value" - but the timeline for Bitcoin is still good, nevermind the solution supported. 
segwit can happen with BIP148 in August/September this year, segwit with a Silbert HF can happen this year, segwit with BIP149 can happen spring / summer 2018. One of the three it will be. Sure BIP149 is the one that would make the least noise. Even if chains split permanently most value will be carried on one of them and that one will have more value than LTC.

In fact with his "$5 trillion in 5 years" statement Novogratz makes the argument for 10k USD / BTC in that timeline. It may be all over the place on its way there.

If ViaBTC actually mined BIP148 to help shift coins on chain or made a vow to stay neutral in the game, this could be seen as good.
However we must take into account the possibility for viaBTC to actively attack a BIP148 chain to be able to claim the tokens.
Best at this time would be no chain split and miners signalling for segwit using BIP9 (be it as part of their NYA agreement code compatibility or otherwise)
Edit: I just realized this is not directly on topic but concerning the other move by viaBTC to offer [various BIP148 trading pairs]( . To also do an ICO for a split chain means they are not neutral and their 148 trading pair should be traded with caution (or not at all). It would make more sense for them to offer a segwit2x trading pair, but of course their point of view is that segwit2x *is* Bitcoin, while 148 isn't.

It's the second halving, the first worked like a charm, and I don't see why the second would be fundamentally different. They might eventually turn the power off if the price doesn't increase. This is part of the self-balancing mechanism of Bitcoin and completely normal and expected. Sure, it might mean slower confirmation times for two weeks but I'd assume a majority of the hashpower is already getting very cheap electricity prices and would like to keep operating until their mining equipment has ROI'd. This won't coincide with the halving for most miners and some miners dropping off is better for the others who can then ROI eventhough the reward has dropped. I don't expect a sharp drop in hashing power, rather a gradual one should the price not increase...

Oh, music and films also require proper licensing before you can hear or watch them. That did not keep a generation of Internet users from doing it without licensing because there was no sensible approach by the industry. These days you can buy a streaming subscription and be done with most of it. The market eventually provided a sustainable solution.
If democracy is worth anything tax laws can be changed to make senisble use of Bitcoin as a currency. There is no point criminalizing Bitcoin users by making it unnecessarily complex to account for. Unless of course you're on a agenda slyly to ban it this way without calling it a ban. Which would be a legitimae reason to dissent from a Bitcoin user point of view...

There is a lot of money at stake and at the end of the day all parties involved appreciate this and are likely to agree on something that benefits all. Yes, there may be losses and yes, there may be ill-informed choices and more money lost because of that but it's unlikely to extinct Bitcoin.

As far as I'm aware this only applies under the following circumstances (which is good enough but still):
- You apply FIFO and have enough coins aged for one year for your purchase. In this case - because hodl time was reached - capital gains do not apply.
- Your purchase uses unaged coins (as per FIFO) but the total gain for all purchases of goods with Bitcoin is below 600 EUR for the year. There is an exemption for capital gains tax per year on gains of such private properties.

In fact I was referring to BIP149 as something that can happen within 12 months.
Core can merge and release it after the BIP9/141 timeout in November with a flag day six months later.  That would make it May 2018 with the compressed time frame. The original flag day by shaolinfry in July 2018 is still a viable alternative and I guess that would make it 13-14 months but still not years out.
I support BIP148. I don't want the "NY agreement" Silbert HF at all. I see BIP149 as the least noisy fall-back option to make sure Bitcoin advances.
We need to remind ourselves: Miners can activate Segwit at any time before the deadlines, with BIP148 just as much as  with 149 and we don't need a HF at this time - not for segwit anyway.

Key takeaways (quoted from actual document):
* Bitcoin may face additional selling pressure in the near-term, but we believe prices will bottom in Q1 2019 based on our analysis of holder dynamics during prior boom-bust cycles
* Lightning Network development has progressed rapidly, allowing Bitcoin to scale without sacrificing security. The success of this technology will be crucial and may prove superior to other scaling solutions in the long run
* Total Bitcoin supply is finite at 21 million given that its inflation schedule is predefined and governed by a mathematical algorithm. The vast majority of Bitcoin have already been mined with a significant amount (~2-3 million) presumed to be lost.
They base the first point on something they call "UTXO Analysis &amp; Market Cycles" which is worth considering.

685 Users, 	2.9 % of Slush userbase, 6.600 Ph/s 2.64% of Slush hashrate. 
If I did the math correctly that's 0.1% of global hash rate. Lucky. Let's have more hashrate.
Edit: I just noticed
"Pool decides" is at 26.34 % (1,13% of global hash rate)
and 
"Not voted" is at 11.42 % (0,49% of global hash rate) which means 29% of that could potentially also go to BIP148 (0,14% global hash rate)
**That's a potential total of 1,37% of global hashrate. Nice start.**

Except the power analysis bug is closed already. You need to enter the PIN. I'm thinking more along the lines of using an electron microscope and/or fuzzing/glitching to extract the private key from the smart card type of device, like organized crime has done before for pay TV setups. This is probably not what is being disclosed at DEFCON but still it'll be interesting to see whether they require user interaction or are capable of extracting keys by just stealing the device and no other info.

Thanks for clarifying. I tend to think it's unclear whether miners will actually HF unless there is also broad consensus in the userbase. They hardly want the coin that carries the minority of the value. They'll be watching the prediction markets / synthetic trading pairs closely. If it doesn't go in their favor they might not fork.
Bear in mind miners, especially Bitmain, need a way to save face in the whole "we don't want segwit" debacle. They do it now "on their terms" (or so they think) and it's always easier to just back out of the 2x when they realize it's not wanted or necessary.

It's good this type of research is happening so the next gen devices can shield against it. These are pretty advanced attacks - normally available to organized crime / state level type of attackers. 
It's much easier for small time crooks to trojan PCs with keyloggers to snag private keys from non-hardware wallet setups.
Still good practice to get a hw-wallet over plain vanilla keys on a PC.

It does, you can set fees manually and it has dynamic fees (estimatefee) too. 
However estimatefee (coming from Bitcoin core) is not ideal, it usually overestimates, which is OK if you don't have RBF but with RBF it makes sense to keep fees on edge and then bump if conditions change.
I'm pretty sure fee estimation will be improved in Bitcoin core in the next versions and eventually make it to Electrum too.

Just his commitment to buy more at 2000. If a billionaire buys at 2000 USD that's a good sign, because it won't be small volume and it'll help build a wall around that price tag.

Notheworthy: Litecoin has had a Segwit activation threshold at 75% but actually managed to reach 95% in time.
Granted this was after the "LTC round table" securing a majority of miners but the NY agreement is a similar round table, securing a similar majority.
It might help to lock in Segwit with BIP9 after all and possibly before Aug 1st.
Edit: However Jihan won't like it - officially because of some "unfair weighting fee advantage" for Segwit. He wants to implement another Segwit than BIP141 and that's not in line with the NY agreement (for what that is worth). Garzik clarified on github (towards ) that BIP141 should stand. So there will be some infighting between btc1 and Bitmain.

Open your ledger nano s (apparently it's easy) and see if someone built in an long piece of wire as antenna to be able to press keys using UHF radio ;)
The ledger nano-s did get away pretty lightly. Basically most of the attacks are supply-chain related, so swapping out chips or implaning a radio device. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a failsafe way to tell whether your device is bugged. It's hard to do these kind of attacks on a large scale as it's involved to modify hardware - so buying it from a trusted vendor should be fine.
There is one more severe Ledger nano-s bug wrt to flashing custom firmware. It's possible to circumvent the blacklisting to write to certain memory areas by writing to another space that mirrors it. This should be fixable by implemeting whitelists as was stated in the talk. 
Nano Blue got a bit more than a blue eye. The change of colour when you press PIN keys on the display can be received and decoded using a software defined radio at a distance of several meters. I guess it could be fixed by not changing the colour of the buttons pressed.
Trezor got it pretty bad. They commended them for their open source work and good protection of the firmware verification code.  However the chip can be glitched so that it writes the seed and PIN code to RAM which can subsequently be dumped and seen in plain text. It's from a convenience function which allows you to retain seed and PIN when you upgrade the firmware. Apparently this feature is disabled when you use an additional passphrase when you set up your Trezor, so that seems to be the secure setup of choice.
Very good work by the presenters. Kudos to them presenting at 35C5 and Bitcoin is on the right track when we see these kind of presentations at hacker congresses rather than just gaming console hacking of previous years (which were always a highlight, so no offense)

Yes, I forgot. We're immature and need to be protected by our government and it's in our own best interest. /s 
This is justification for some of the social security schemes like forced state pension fund payments. At least - for now - you can opt out of the latter by being self-employed.
Then again we know the pension payments are guaranteed. As Alan Greenspan famously admitted the only thing the government cannot guarantee is the purchasing power of those pensions. 
Which system is a "scam" is always a matter of the point of view you're taking.

"They" have then detached from those who they govern. It's an act of authoritarian rule and against the democratic order like freedom of contract. 
Now you could argue "they" have already detached and the democratic order in most countries is an
euphemism for "you voted for it" (when actually the issue at hand was never up for vote) to justify why you should obey and I won't disagree...

[Term sheet in German PDF](
The emission volume is 1500 certificates, each cert representing 1 BTC. So the volume at current price is around 1 million USD. That's not much really. Testing the waters I'd say.
Total expense ratio is 2,5% as entry charge at the time of the initial offering. It'll then be traded OTC at Vontobel for two years so it might well see premiums like for GBTC.
The risk is basically Vontobel as a counterparty going bust during the two years.

So ~50k TH would be ~1% of hashing power currently?
If 1% of readers got an S7 that'd be ~12k TH and not sure if that amount of hardware is even around and up for grabs.
So it would have to come mostly from existing miners.
Can they be incentivized to mine BIP148?

This is about something called "minisketch" - an efficient way to sync the mempool between Bitcoin core nodes. The tech might also be useful to improve block propagation times in the future.
AFAIK up until now mempools are not synced at all between nodes but are read from disk from from the last state when shut down and re-populated live as new transactions are coming in.

A central bank blockchain is still more transparent and auditable than what we have today. 
Of course they can hardfork and rewrite history or change rules, but at least you can follow the chain and notice it happening when it's happening. 
At the end of the day it's important to have choice i.e. freedom of contract. If someone chooses to do a transaction in a national currency - on a blockchain or not - so be it.

The article is shady around Samsung's involvment with producing mining chips on its own effort (rather than just producing a blueprint on a contractual basis).
Launch date for Galaxy 10 is February 2019 so it'd be reasonable for this to be announced properly by now. It has not, thus it's unlikely to be true. Article just states "may be in Galaxy 10". 
Some official statement by Samsung to have cold wallet capabilities in a future phone would be good enough...
