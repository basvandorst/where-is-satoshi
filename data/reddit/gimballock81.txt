Pretty sure it will immediately follow the ball drop

i guess thats a sign to just settle the fuck down and wait for the ride to be over

have there ever been any cases of people being identified by use of this taint metric?  Or of coins being confiscated or refused due to high degree of taint?

Anyone from SF interested in meeting up to go?  
Anyone going to Startrek?  
Maybe we could do a reddit mini-meet?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:26:20
yup, same for me.  I just checked.  At least i know where they are now

I bought mine yesterday! Called today and they expect my shipment to go out by July

i'm seeing this too, i moved a few coins to mtgox and am seeing no activity.  Also mtgox just started showing 502 Bad Gateway

say I exchange $ for btc into wallet x then send those btc to wallet y created securely and not linked to any online services who then sentd the same coins to wallet z which is also unconnected to any online identities (etc.) why is this less secure than a coin washing service?
 
Just saying all coin traversals are straight lines but it doesn't imply any relevant connection that i can think of.  
If i give a coin to cross a bridge and that coin is used by toll worker to buy a soda there is no implied relation between the vending machine guy and the guy who crossed the bridge.

Actually I read it wrong. How do i read the number of confirmations?
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:08:46
So yea I have zero confirmations, there was no option i saw to include a transaction fee when sending from blockchain wallet to mtgox.  I guess with all the activity today the miners are being very choosy with the transaction they are selecting
