Netherlands here. Occasionally we need to fill in captchas for google searches too, if some student has been abusing google again :P

If a company has already had a warrant or gag order, they should publish a warrant canary of the form:
“We have not had any gag orders since [Date]”

I'm calling BS. The link OP posts refers to a target of
However, googling for the number shows the link
which is an article about Imtech.
In addition,

Check out this blog post, that should get you something similar in the US:

They only offer the Bitcoin payment for US customers at the moment. But yes, it's without CC verification afaik. They're still working on getting it out internationally:

Me too. I tried reporting it, but Google temporarily banned my campus IP range from reporting. *glares at fellow students*

My last 6 flight bookings have been with CheapAir. Paid in Bitcoin, of course :)

I have had 2 customers from Germany who were unable to send me money, because my bank account is in the name of "Mqrius' Bitcoins".
So as far as I can tell, Raffeisen bank in Germany is affected.

Ooh thanks for mentioning it! I didn't actually see that blog post :)
I put a reply to their blog post.

Oh cool, someone posted my video \^_^
Thanks waspoza, whoever you are :)

Too bad, you missed their black Friday sale! It was pretty good, and payable in coins! :D

I've had that problem yesterday too. I mentioned it in the  IRC room on Freenode, and eventually it got escalated up to the server guy, and was fixed a while later. I never did find out what caused it.

You don't need 51% to double-spend on a 0-confirmation transaction, check out Race attack and Finney attack here: 
Both of these are pretty hard to do in a live, face-to-face environment though.

To be fair, they did underline it with word's red squiggles.

Because now it doubles as an ATM.
But seriously? Probably because of technical details; the Bitcoin module he built on top of the normal system seemed very ad-hoc.

There's quite a large overhead to fraud, because creating a hologram itself that's equal to that one has a large overhead. They're quite detailed (see  for example ).
So while I agree that a personally made paper wallet is safer (if done right), the risk of fraud is not as large as you would make it seem.

It allows anyone in the world to pay them without being blocked. It also allows Europeans to pay them without dealing with hefty currency conversion fees. It also allows anyone to pay within an hour or so.

Jydani in that thread is being reasonable. You're not approved, and while Bitcoin makes it easy to see how much donations you're getting, it also makes it easy to run off with it afterwards.
As they said, including both a bitcoin address and a paypal account is probably your best bet at this point. Alternatively, get verified by the mods.

If your order is large enough, then sure you would still buy all the way up to $50, and it has happened in the past. I see where the confusion comes from though.

If there is a buy order at $110, and you place a limit sell order at $100, you will first sell for $110, and get the full $110.
[Info based on experience, and from having done that just a few minutes ago.]

There is a lot of fluff, but distilling it down I find these two excerpts provide the strongest indications:
"But the most unique commercialization opportunity is in the emerging digital currency/commerce marketplace. Using the team s already existing reputation (as the enablers of the world s first BitCoin/vending machine transaction) and relationships, the RADTiN/DAM3ON software will be demonstrated as a key enabling technology for the establishment of trust and the security of transactions between digital wallets and physical point-of-sale machines. The key to penetration in this emerging marketplace is to maximize automation (ease of operation), verified security of your smartphone and digital wallet, and trust in the sales machine, the protection of your data in motion (to the machine) and at rest (in the cloud) The ability to clearly attest to the security of your smartphone, your digital wallet, and your data before, during, and after the transaction will be of interest to the firms attempting to broaden this emerging economy."

Are all your backups occasionally at the same physical location?
Because that would be bad. If your house burns down, you lose all your coins.
I usually suggest uploading an encrypted backup to dropbox or gmail.

Shit, I always say "plenty", but your answer is much better :D

Nope. Daytrading is a good way to kill your coins. Just buy and hold, or in this case, hold a sign and hold.

Ha, BTCurious here. Most of those pictures are indeed mine, and at least one is from DeadTerra. Here's my original album: 
My commendations on your photoshopping btw! (compare  to the original:  )
Anyway, most of the coins have actually been sold by now, and new ones already ordered again. If anyone's interested, feel free to contact me for information about stock and prices.

Jesse is a pretty cool guy, I met him a few times on conferences. Originally he set up Ogrr, a forum with a mBTC tipping and sending system built in, which got a reasonable amount of diablo players introduced to Bitcoin. That's run by other people now; Jesse moved up to start Kraken, and seems to be doing pretty well!
