"I know who you are, I know what you done. You thought you could get away with sending out these anonymous scammy email and you wouldn't eventually get some man like me with the resource to backtrack and find you? You've make too much mistake of your life, and if you want to live you give your wallet right now."
"I so sorry, I no have good English. Please no kill, I give money". 
Sliding his wallet out, he tossed it on the ground. When he finally heard his attacker running away his curiosity got the better of him and he turned around... just in time to see another employee of the same scummy fake company running back into the same building wearing flip flops and for some reason blue jeans.

Nice ~~UTG~~ KSG, but I hope your foregrip is rated for pump shotgun use. I read a story about a guy who blew his fingertips off when his foregrip (an airsoft one, durr) failed.
I think the part about SWATing being an exploitable vulnerability of the police is spot on. The priority should be to hunt these people down like animals and send them to prison for a decade, but since we don't have the resources for that in law enforcement at a bare minimum we should have a higher bar of caller ID before escalating to sending a SWAT team to a residential address.

It's not an issue of copyright... of course there is no way to argue against it from that standpoint. Do you really not understand why this is wrong?
Ever order something from Amazon, then you get it and it looks completely different from the description? 
That's bad enough, but then this is like if when you complain they tell you it's the "real" product, and the one you thought you were buying is just an American knock off. Then you ask why they even list it on Amazon under another product description and get no answers except personal attacks... and Amazon just ignores you when you ask them to take it down. 
Can you imagine what kind of class action pissed-off public pitchfork outrage this would lead to?

Basically, a guy named Roger Ver became popular in the early days of Bitcoin... before people realized he was actually a con artist incapable of producing anything of real value. He did some really stupid stuff like tell everyone he saw proof Mt.Gox was doing fine and encouraged people to invest on it (you could see he was reading from a script the whole time from watching his eyes).
Anyway, the guy has wild mood swings and is extremely predatory towards new people coming into the market. He bashes Bitcoin non stop and refuses to call it anything but "Core", and calls his own version of Bitcoin that he copy-pasted (Bitcoin Cash) the "real" bitcoin. Then he bought up the twitter handle to tell people his fake "BCash" is the real Bitcoin. Thus, why their subreddit exists on instead of or They would have taken by any means, except they have none because they are an opportunistic minority.
He excels at nothing-speak and uses buzzwords to trick people into believing BCash is the "real" Bitcoin. Basically, the only fervent defenders he has left are people who are too deep in the hole to admit they fucked up, or too uninformed to understand what they have is NOT Bitcoin.
BCash "users" hold their coins like a ball and chain. Most of the first investors were tricked by the lie that BCash had a sustainable scaling solution before SegWit was adopted (they didn't, don't, and won't). Anyway, they knew something like SegWit could come along someday, they just didn't know it was SegWit itself because they were entranced by the autistic siren song of a false prophet. If only they'd never touched their garbage coin, but it's too late now and they'll eat bubblegum from the undersides of Dennny's tables at 3:00 AM for sustenance before they will take a loss.
*"It wasn't a mistake. It wasn't a mistake." they repeat to themselves in the shower while slamming their palms against the wall. A single tile falls loose from each of their showers after months of this repetitive stress relieving behavior. They don't even notice. Their food tastes of ash and soot, their wine like cat urine and vodka. Eyes swollen shut from grief, hunched backs from getting too close to their screens, and breath so bad tonsil stones go flying as they speak like their mouth is starting a food fight with a spoon full of cottage cheese. Their critical-hit body odor is butt the tip of the iceberg, as human waste collection was long forgotten under countless layers of no longer tighty whities. Their aggressive behavior and aversion to direct sunlight are the final nails in the coffin, to ensure that they abstain from going outside or engaging in social behavior forever henceforth... they belong to the forums now.*

BTC is BITCOIN's abbreviation. Mark my words, the longer is allowed to pitch a fraudulent coin under Bitcoin's abbreviation, the larger the backlash on Reddit will be once people realize how fucked they are.
The problem is that if someone new to the space goes to before we've lost them forever. Over there Bitcoin is the fraudulent coin copying Bitcoin Cash's technological advances. They defend this outrageous claim by piling hate on anyone who dares interject to speak the truth: **Bitcoin Cash is an alt coin completely unaffiliated with Bitcoin, save for the fact it's what they pretend to be.** Once they've been steeped in the lies and hate their subservience is inescapable. 
Every day is up is another day an unknown number of crypto-newbies are sticking their heads in the guillotine and fighting us from pulling them out... and reddit is currently complicit. If there is any sub that should be removed for public interest, it is the den of scam artists and vitriolic hatemongers that is (*Fraudger Durr also owns Why in the hell isn't that their main sub? Guess.)
