Bitmain dominance may not be a future problem but we must be proactive in stopping it today. We cannot risk the financial repercussions if Bitcoin gets damaged. I have heard the China surplus energy argument. The fact that the Bitcoin network is heavily reliant on 1 centralized company in China is dangerous even if they haven't shown their darkside.
One way to do this is to create crowdfunded community driven decentralized mining nonprofit company. And it should not be an ICO.

BLOCKCHAIN BLOCKCHAIN BLOCKCHAIN. So much BS using this buzzword. It's sickening. Blockchain is 1 feature of Bitcoin among a whole list of great features. Now its all about blockchain and these big corporation and powerful government agencies using it to entice the masses on their centralized sh

And if the network is congested and we have 200 dollar fees. What then? 
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:26:41


No. The vision was and still is, to remove trust. All the altcoins in the world can let banks adopt them. Leave bitcoin alone. We don't want your filth. Deal with that

Yes! But what's even more exciting is that Lightning is gonna be way way way faster than Visa; it's not even gonna be competition. That's why I think LIghtning will be the ultimate micropayments platform. We're gonna use it to buy coffee, to stream with at 1¢/min autopay, etc... the application is massive and innovative. The world is going to change because of Lightning! That's not even hyperbole. If anything, I undersold.
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:16:10
Yes you can if you declare it legal tender. You do know it's an open blockchain right.

This is primarily a Zcash video but I decided to share it here because in here I talked a lot about the lightning network and how Zcash is copying and improving it to create their own second layer called BOLT. Basically the same with lightning except privacy is improved.  
What's interesting to note is that this is actually compatible with BTC with minor adjustments. I think this is significant because privacy is almost necessary if not totally necessary for censorship-resistance. What do you think guys? Correct me if I'm missing something.

But there are results but you cant make the LN production-grade world currency overnight. You cant rush this. So much is at stake cant risk all our money in there. You have to understand how this works. If you dont thats up to you. Im no techie but atleast I read technical articles or papers on crypto. Try to understand as much as I can. It actually gets a little intuitive as time goes by. Im thinking about learning code. We have to understand the technology man. Rule # 2 is do not invest in what you do not understand. A lot of us our breaking that rule. Watch hashrate and the LN releases more. Staring at CMC wont earn you sht

You're not useful. How d o you feel now?
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:16:24
I love what you are doing man. Putting your business on the line to test out the LN even in its beta stage. You are in 1 way a hero. Be sure to give feedbacks to the the community esp the devs working on it.

This is great for hyping up but in reality it is the success of crypto projects that will make this last.

Exactly.... and the LN Trustchain is the best way to hype it up. It's the paragon of "hype with substance". My point was that it's the Lightning Network itself, not the fact that fidelity took the torch, that will make long term success.

An ETF may actually bring more harm than good. More manipulation of prices.

I said Jihan Who. Not Wu. And I think you need to loosen up there buddy. Why so serious
@_date: 2019-01-23 06:56:20
Yes we are the early adopters. But perhaps we're too early that we expect the price to plummet soon.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:13:23
Yeah... And that was without ETF. Screw futures that's not very accessible. With ETF its a gamechanger for those old money. We will see unprecedented rises again when an ETF gets approved but unless there are working projects, its not gonna last.

Very simple math bro.  
Money supply (physical and digital natioal currencies) -  $90.4 trillion 
Broader interpretation of money (includes precious stones like gold, financial products like stocks, derivatives) - $ quadrillions
Bitcoin marketcap today - $62 billion
**I REST MY CASE**
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:35:10
thank you
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:41:18
I do too. The technology, users, and platform is what gives Bitcoin value. These things are inseparable.
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:55:32
Maybe an ETF not being approved this year is a blessing in disguise. I mean think about it, if $1 trillion  institutional money enters the market today, do you think they wanna play fair? No! They will manipulate the sh out of the market and leave Bitcoin bone dry once they multiplied their capital. And we are gonna be what's left.
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:13:19
It's sad that although Joe believes in Bitcoin and crypto technology, he couldn't explain it in his own terms when Mike wanted him to talk about it. All he shared was how Bitcoin helped raised funds. Damn, I think Mike was interested to know more.

The appetizers are what we have now. The main course is what this technology could become.

Reading that old paper is only for the purpose of capturing essence of why bitcoin is created. The technical details are not as important

Interesting. But Linux already dominates the world of devices.

Yeah I know. My point still stands.
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:55:50
I appreciate this because they are helping mainstream adoption. However, based on the current circumstances, BTC atms are not advisable to be used yet. The fees are too high. Right now we need to raise more awareness and improve our existing technology. For me atleast, we are on the right track. Faster than we should, even.
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:31:29
You cannot mine profitably if you don't have a warehouse or are not part of large mining pools anyway so this won't be a problem
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:38:06
Bro he never said spend bitcoin. All he said was ask if they do. If they say yes you can just say "good to know. I'll be sure to bring my Nano S next time". The goal is to raise awareness
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:21:08
I get where this quote is coming from but please note that the first thing that comes to mind when people see this is Bitcoin is for buying drugs, which is not even 0.0001% of Bitcoin's potential. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:25:39
I think 5 years is a good estimate considering the milestones hit by the devs these past 2 years. I think we should start the timeframe at 2017 and end at 2022. Hopefully 2019 is the year of production-grade distributed exchanges and in 2020  John Mcafee is running for president and this time he will focus on endorsing crypto. The synergy these 2 key events alone will have a huge impact on adoption
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:21:35
Some do but's you could commit fraud with a barter system too but atleast Bitcoin doesn't allow centralized power and those who wield it to abuse their privilege again and again like the banking system does.
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:31:18
I think I'll wait for a 2k Bitcoin judging from the fact that great things are not expected to come until late 2019 so I am expecting it. People are impatient. They will sell if Bitcoin doesn't go to the moon by April. Nevertheless, mid to late 2019 we are expecting Distributed Exchanges to explode. Hopefully Binance and Resistance will do a good example for the others.
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:19:17
Because its not.

Number 5 though. But they don't want us to win. I mean it's not like nobody tried to work with the government, but when you do, you end up with a bad product because they don't want decentralization to win. They want us freedom anymore than a bird merchant wants to set his birds free. He wants to exploit them. Same with governments.
