Interesting model.  Given the abundance of mining pools in China due to their cheaper electricity cost, this model could easily be used to show the RoR of mining in other areas of the world with faster internet.  
What would it take to overlay average electrical cost of a given region, with the regions average internet speed, to come up with the "ideal" location for mining?

A secure front end that can manage multiple HD wallets.  Something like "Quicken" for BTC.  Ability to calculate capital gains for those that live in the US or other country that will want to tax the gain as income.

What's wrong with Bitpay and Gemini?  Bitpay is a trading platform and provided a great multisig wallet with Copay and Gemini is just starting out, also providing a trading platform.  They are both supporting a portion of the financial industry which, through their work, now includes bitcoin, bringing it to the mainstream as investment vehicles.

Thanks for the comment.  As for syncing, my thought was more around mobile wallets.  I've noticed that if I open my wallet, it syncs to ensure that it is up to date.  This makes sense to me, but sometimes this takes a couple of minutes if it's not an online wallet (Bread Wallet).  If this is the norm, then it will be really inconvenient to use if I just wanted to pay for dinner or groceries.  I'd have to start the sync when I entered the store to make sure it was ready by the time I had to pay.
With web wallets, the sync is much faster, I'm assuming because they maintain an up-to-date copy of the blockchain.  Everyone always says to not use a  web wallet due to security, but if this delay in syncing is expected, I think I'd have to use a web wallet just for convenience.

Currently, Circle isn't charging any fee to purchase with linked bank accounts.  I'm not sure if Coinbase is now, but they used to charge 1%.
Other than that, Coinbase seems to have deeper market penetration, for example, they've made arrangements with Purse.io to allow a single click to fund.  I haven't seen anything like that from Circle yet.

Ethics aside, without the cost of electricity, it would be tough to ROI in less than 6 months.  
Using the following assumptions:
Difficulty will double in the next 6 months
S7 costs $1300  THash
Electricity is $0.12 kWH
F2Pool pays 0.00464763 BTC/THash today.
Adjusting for the change in difficulty by changing the payout rate of F2Pool linearly to 50% in 180 days, I calculated the following:
Electricity used: $668
Bitcoins mined: 2.316
Gross $ based on the following exchange rates:
 $996
 $1158
 $1274
 $1389
 $1992  
Lots of speculation here, but as you can see, if you are bullish on the price of BTC, the difficulty will likely follow as more miners add hashing power.  If that is the case, just buying and holding would likely return a better profit.  If you are bearish, and think price will flat line, then hashing power will stabilize and you might get more life out of your miner.
FWIW, I've been running 2 S3's since November-14, and just recently ROI'd, due to the price increase.  I'm barely profitable right now, barely covering the cost of electricity but all my gear is paid for (miners, shipping costs, and power supply ~$600).  I've mined about 3.3 BTC over that time, and was "lucky" that the price was stuck at ~$250 for much of it, keeping the hashing power down.  Now that the next gen miners our out, I imagine the hashing power will continue to increase as the pools change out their older equipment, then it will stabilize for a while until the next chip comes to market.  A couple more bumps in difficulty, and I'll be turning my rigs off.

Thanks for the response.  Actually, I don't have a Danish bank account yet.  I was assuming I could make the DanKort account, then link to the Bitcoin broker.  Is "DanKort" just a generic name, and I need to choose a bank to provide the DanKort?  Or will I need to set up 2 banks?  1 for the DanKort and 1 to link to the BTC broker?
Do you know if Circle.com can connect with Danish banks for this purpose.  I already have a Circle account.

I agree that scaling seems to be a major hurdle to overcome.  If bitcoin is expected to go "to the moon", then my assumption would be that usage and transactions would increase at the same rate as the $/BTC increase (or at least some increase; and I realize price and transactions are not directly linked).  If that is true, and the stress test was an accurate representation of the current systems capability, it is going to be extremely difficult to get to the dreams of $10,000/BTC or more.
On a side note, I read once that the block difficulty is there purely as a way to manage the solutions to 1 block every 10 minutes, and the the computing power could easily handle just the transactions.  Is it possible to lower the difficulty in order to process more transactions and still stay within the 10 minute target?  Is this what would be happening if the block size was increased from 1MB?

How difficult would it to be to establish an account with Circle in the US and link it to the US bank account, then with Kraken in Switzerland and link it with the Swiss account?
Then, you can easily move the money with only the ~1% fee that the BTC exchange charges.  I' use Circle and had my bank linked within 2 days and deposits are almost instant.  I'm guessing Kraken would be similar.
Circle does have a $2500/day USD to BTC limit once you are verified though.
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:22:16
This makes sense to me.  As people's usage increase, so does the exchange of the merchants from BTC to fiat ensuring there are plenty of sellers, since services like Bitpay will convert back to fiat almost instantly. This will keep the price pushed down for the immediate future.   
In addition, with services like Coinbase and Circle making it so easy to get bitcoin, I can see people making more BTC purchases as a test.  I did this just last week, when Rakuten announced a $30 discount on orders over $100 if purchased using BTC.  I simply made my purchase, then immediately (and instantly) repurchased those coins on Circle.  
I'm a holder, but also a user when it makes sense to use BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:38:23
I too had my first bitcoin purchase, drawn in by the $30 discount.  The process was VERY smooth, completing the transaction using my phone and the QR code they displayed.  Everything populated accurately to my phone.  I did notice, however, that the price Rakuten displayed was $83.61, with a corresponding BTC amount of 0.35034055 BTC.  After scanning the QR code from my cirlce account, the same 0.35034055 BTC showed up, but the value was now $86.23.  I guess that's to be expected with the different payment processors and exchange rates, but could still be confusing to people.  Having saved $30 already, the difference was meaningless.
One part of the transaction that was somewhat tedious was when they required a bitcoin address in order to handle any refunds.  I had to then log on to my Circle account in order to cut and paste the address or type it in.
@_date: 2015-10-07 17:41:59
Agree.  There is a theoretical minimum, and then there is the realistic minimum.  My non data based feeling is that the current hash rate is way above the realistic minimum.  To the OP's original question about energy waste, in this case, I would consider the delta between the realistic minimum and the actual hash rate to be waste.  The miners, however, look at this waste as an investment, since it generates bitcoins, theoretically, buying the BTC at a discount, assuming they've hit ROR.

In the US, it could be used to instantly fund a college kid's debit card if the kid has a different bank than the parents.  Currently, Venmo still takes 24 hours.  With ACH restrictions, I don't believe there is anything faster if the banks aren't the same.

Love this.  Then all the coins that Colorado owns would be "dirty" by Coinbase's standards.  How would the State cash out to fiat?
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:04:27
Nope.  Never said "why bother..."  I just asked a pretty basic question on how this would work, given the reality that many people's accounts for BTC off-ramps have been closed due to "illegal" activity.
Regardless of the percentage being pulled out, if the wallet had been flagged by the "bank" there is a chance it will be closed.   I guess my question is really "would a business risk their account being closed in the current environment?"  
Another problem the closed loop doesn't address is BTC volatility.  There is no way for a business to protect themselves by cashing out if BTC declines eating away any profit.

The way I see it,  now there is an established network, the ROI will always be determined by your electricity costs.  The difficulty increases along with the price, which in turn, relates back to the ROI.    From my calcs, since buying my S3's a year ago, the ROI has maintained about 6-9 months with electricity at ~$0.11/kWH.  Now that my gear is paid off, I'm "buying" my mined BTC at ~20% discount, so it keep it plugged in.  
If the price surges, I'm sure more hardware will be turned on, and the difficulty will adjust accordingly to bring back the % profit back in line to level it is right now.  Sadly, I don't see a reason to buy more miners unless I can get cheap/free electricity because the current network is self correcting and it seems unrealistic to expect anything to change.
@_date: 2015-10-07 16:32:08
Sorry about that.
My understanding is the the computational power that is needed to manage all the block chain transactions is MUCH lower than what the current hash rate is.  This lower value, to me, represents the minimum computing power need for a "secure" network (Maybe this is my critical error.)  So, continuing with that assumption, any additional hashing power is "wasted" and would only solve the blocks faster, so the difficulty is adjusted to maintain the 10 minute block interval target.  I do feel that higher hash rate improves the networks security IF it is distributed evenly across the mining pools, only because it provides a higher barrier of entry towards the 51% attack. But, IMO, the hash rate is really not the measure of security, the distribution of the hash is really the measure, assuming pools don't collude.
Back to my initial statement, additional hashing power is only added so the owner benefits with earning more coins.  But as the power is added, difficulty increases, so the benefit of mining is reduced.  Individually, the owner of the new mining equipment will gain some extra coins, but at the expense of someone else, who hasn't upgraded, and their rig is now providing a smaller percentage to the network.  It's just really an arms race for the miners.  And as long as the distribution among the pools stays relatively stable, security remains the same.

I don't see the point of this.  The article says it will sell for $235, but it only delivers 63GH/s at 18W.  At $0.12 KW/h, this will take over 2000 days to ROI.
@_date: 2015-10-07 19:45:02
Well, if it's a matter # of  transactions/ MW, the OP cites Bank of America at 363+ MW and BTC Net at 246 MW.  With the BTC net averaging ~130,000 txs/day, that's only 528 txs/MW/ day.  
In 1983 B Of A required their network to process 208 txs/sec!  In an 8 hour bankers day, that's 6,000,000 txs or ~16,500 txs/MW, if using 1983 data with today's energy usage.  I'm sure they have increased their transactions per day since then, so the comparison would still hold true, assuming OP's energy usage is accurate.
Today's BTC network, in theory, can process ~7 txs/sec.  This is still only 604,000 transactions per day or 2,458 txs/MW, almost 7 times LESS efficient than BofA's.  Now, if the Hash rate is reduced to the value I mentioned before, then the BTC network would be operating at 6,500 txs/MW, about half of BofA's.
@_date: 2015-10-26 17:19:53
How exactly would a closed loop system work?  Wouldn't there be a need/desire at some point to turn BTC into fiat?  I feel that it is unrealistic to expect that a supplier's entire business is operating in BTC.  They will still need some effective way to convert BTC to USD for some items, and no business owner would risk their business funds getting frozen due to a  CoinBase type sweep.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:08:54
Sure.  Current Hash is 408,110,638.15 GH/s.  to defend a 51% attack against the largest pool, F2pool, who has 18% of the current mining power, 146,919,829 GH/s would do the trick, which is 2x F2Pool's hash rate. This would be over 60% less power than we currently have.
@_date: 2015-10-06 19:49:24
The power isn't going to securing the network, the power is being used to earn bitcoins...a secure network could be done at a much lower hash rate.  Difficulty increase to balance when more hash power is added to the network, to ensure the 10 minute per block standard.  As difficulty increases, more power is used, regardless to the number of transactions.  I wouldn't be surprised that difficulty and hash rate will decrease once the reward is halved, especially if the value hasn't doubled by then.  Miners will quit, but the network will still be just as secure, assuming miners quit proportionally across all the active mining pools.
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:17:59
All great suggestions.  The only problem I see is that even a closed loop system, still needs an exit strategy to fiat at this point in time.  All that needs to happen is have a couple suppliers get some BTC confiscated from a CoinBase type exit ramp, and all momentum is lost.  As long as weed is still federally illegal, all these "banks" will continue to protect their business models by staying overly compliant.
Maybe an exchange in some "safe haven" country can be set up, where weed is legal, then the USD could be wired back to the states?

Per the site, i'm fully verified, and have been since June-14.  Transactions from my bank were instant.  To your point about the transaction going to China, I'd assume they examine the blockchain and know that some addresses are tied to certain vendors.  I'm also throwing darts, as they haven't told me anything about why it was blocked.

Interesting....Coinbase responded.
"Please refer to our User Agreement – Appendix 1 – “Prohibited Use” – Item 1 (
Based on a review of your account, we are unable to provide you with Coinbase services as one of your transactions may have been used to facilitate illegal activity."
Following the link, item  is:
Operating as an unlicensed money transmitter, money service, payment service provider, e-money, or any other financial services business which requires licensure, including but not limited to exchanges of virtual currencies, sales of money orders or traveler's checks, and escrow services
So, does that mean exchanging coins for cash is illegal and considered acting as a unlicensed financial service?  
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:44:33
Exactly my point. And they won't answer my emails to explain what the TOS issue is.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:43:50
Gotcha.  In it's current state and usage, I wouldn't consider it super efficient, but it's still new.  Assuming the block size debate can be agreed upon, and the transactions/sec can scale, I don't see anything that can compare.  
I am interested to see how the network size reacts when the rewards are halved.  Currently, 3600 BTC are mined per day @ ~$240/btc=$864,000.  The assumption can be made that that's what it costs to run the network per day.  When the reward is halved, the balance would have to be made up by a combination of fees, an increase in the value of BTC, or Hash reduction as miners shut down.  My fear is that huge fee changes drive away adoption, which drives down the price, and the whole thing implodes on itself. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:47:54
I agree.  While I also hold a small amount of bitcoin for investment, I also spend it whenever I can.   I do this to support the bitcoin community.  I don't view this as a sacrifice, because I always immediately repurchase the bitcoin that I just spent.  Using Circle, I can easily replenish the spent bitcoin without fees, without worrying about any price fluctuations.  
When using purse.io, I do the same, but replenish based on the pre-discount price, which then increases my overall investment amount.  My rationalization is that I'm buying things which I would anyways, so getting additional bitcoin is sweet benefit.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:29:51
Yes.  I transferred what little I had in there to my other wallets.  My account still appears to be active as a wallet, but not as an on/off ramp.

Yeah.  That looks to be the case.  But keep in mind, these coins had already been moved from my Coinbase wallet into his Circle wallet.

Good point.  In my case, I've only spent from there once.  I had purchased the coins I needed, then immediately made the purchase.  The other 2 transactions were transferring out to other wallets.  It is a shame that we are still looking for an easy on-ramp to get coins without some sort of baggage. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:21:53
That's what I thought... btc and the blockchain are inseparable.  So if the current blockchain becomes the backbone for the majority of "things", can that happen without the value of BTC increasing dramatically?  My small brain thinks that it would have to increase in order to handle any sizable amount of currency use.  
On the other side of things though, if a new alt-coin is developed by, for example, Big Banks and Corps or Big Gov't, which handle the majority of sizable transactions, wouldn't that be a bad thing for BC/BTC?  They would have a vested interest in a system that they still control, and they have the influence to make it take hold.
It seems that any news suggesting that blockchain or cryptocurrencies is greeted with excitement assuming that it automatically means adoption of Bitcoin, aka an increase in BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:13:31
I understand where you are coming from, but I don't see that as being  realistic to the majority of the people out there.  If bitcoin is to succeed, getting people their first coins needs to be easy.  The reality is that people will use Bitcoin Banks, since they are able to set up drafts from their checking accounts, or credit cards. Prior to using coinbase, I looked into LocalBTC and all the sellers were applying large loads to the cost.  Is Mycelium the same?  Why would I pay 7% when I can pay 1%?  In addition, I don't have to go meet someone someplace to finalize the transaction.

@_date: 2015-02-06 21:28:22
Hmmm....  interesting.  I've had 3 total transactions exiting the Coinbase account.  The first was in July, for a transfer to a wallet I own, which I did just after opening and buying my first BTC's at CB.  The second transaction was in October when I purchased some mining equipment from Bitmain.  In this case, I bought just as many coins as I needed for the transaction, then placed the order.  And the third was the transfer to my friend's son.  2 weeks later they block me.
Would it be bad to post the blockchain transaction and see if some of the ninjas can figure something out from it?
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:47:47
Obtuse?  Not at all.  I do understand what they are telling me.  The one thing both you and Coinbase are assuming here is that I am the one that did these things.  I was not.  I sent coins to someone who did.  Sending coins is not illegal.  Please explain how I should have prevented whatever happens with the coins after I sent them?  I'm really curious as I don't know.

@_date: 2015-02-06 20:43:10
I understand your points entirely.  I too view(ed) them as the white knight.  The main point I tried to make is that even if I am squeaky clean, and use bitcoin for things that are 100% legit, what happens with those coins afterwards shouldn't be traced back to me.  I'm being punished for exchanging $110 for bitcoins.  That is exactly what bitcoins are intended for.  What happens with them after I make my transaction, is entirely out of my hands.  Am I expected to do a back ground check with anyone I'm doing a transaction with, and should I expect them to do the same?
As for bashing them, I think I have every right to expect a response to my email regarding my account.  I'd expect the same out of my cable company or internet provider or any other service of which I am a customer.  If they expect to be the safety net for the new people coming on to bitcoin, their customer service should be top notch.
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:28:34
Yep, fully verified.  Actually, I can still access my account and send BTC, (I emptied it).  It still shows my verifications as level 3 for buy/sell and level 2 for instant.  I tried to buy some more, just to test, and it appeared to go through, but I received and email shortly after saying that they cancelled the order.

@_date: 2015-10-11 22:36:57
The current network operates at ~$885,000/day (3600 coins*$245).  So, as the halving occurs, there will be ~$400,000 gap in income that needs to be addressed.  Some miners will quite, others will stay in to try to ride out the correction of difficulty.  Those that are left and still in the game may increase fees to stay afloat.  IMO, this could be the most dangerous part of the halving... increased cost, decrease network efficiency since transactions may be stuck.  My fear is that this combination drives away users and kills bitcoin.
If the price increases between now and the halving, AND and increase in transactions occur (more fees), this problem may not be as big of a deal. Thoughts?

@_date: 2015-02-07 16:14:44
First, it's a friends son.  Secondly, I'm not defending his action at all.  I put that detail in as context for a potential reason for Coinbase's  decision.  I'm annoyed that this happened, for sure, since I was potentially being held accountable for someone else's actions.  Like you said, it's his fault, not mine.  
I posted later, after they responded, that their reason was for "Operating as an unlicensed money transmitter, money service, payment service provider, e-money, or any other financial services business which requires licensure, including but not limited to exchanges of virtual currencies, sales of money orders or traveler's checks, and escrow services."  So I guess they didn't like me exchanging money for BTC.  This seems like this could happen to anyone, especially as more and more people are trying to get their first bitcoins.  It's much easier to buy them directly from someone than to set up an account.
