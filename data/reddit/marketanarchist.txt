Wow. Okay. I can see that all of your questions are completely understandable and valid. But by your questions I can tell that you're a Bitcoin noob. Not trying to be offensive. It's just obvious that you don't understand why the bitcoin protocol was designed the way it was. Have you spent any time on bitcointalk.org? That is a forum filled with very knowledgeable bitcoiners. They can answer every one of your questions in a much easier way than on reddit. 
I hope you will take the time to research the protocol more, because I think if you do your concerns will be alleviated and you'll better appreciate just how brilliant the system is. Good luck!

I was being facetious. Back in the day there were tcp/ip competitors. Ultimately, though, tcp/ip "won" and everybody uses it for the internet. The altcoins are superfluous, largely. If they are experimenting with new designs it's cool, but most are just copycats of Bitcoin with superficial changes, like Dogecoin. Dogecoin will ultimately die like the tcp/ip competitors did.

This is pretty awesome because I emailed them like a year ago asking them to take BTC as donations. They responded that they were unsure of the legality of it (because they are in France). Nice to see that they are taking it now, either because legal or because fuck the government.

Unfortunately, we live in a world where IP laws exist. Ideally, somebody like myself who doesn't believe in IP would simply write some code and release it into the wild, for anybody to use, modify, share, etc. The problem is that nobody will use my code unless I specifically tell them that they have my "permission" to do so. And the only way I can give them this "permission" is to release it under one of the numerous free software licenses. 
Nobody needs my "permission" ethically speaking from using, modifying, and sharing my code. Legally, they do though. So yes. In a world without IP, no licenses could even be necessary, not even "free" ones.
Good question!

I understand your position. On the other hand when you display Mt. Gox's price it's sort of a tacit approval, and it sends the wrong message, especially to newbs, that Mt.

Source? I can't think of any early adopters who are giving up on Bitcoin. They're all still passionately spreading the message as far as I know. It's just that there are so many new people in the space that their voices carry less weight. And that's fine. As Bitcoin continues to grow it will be much less a cult of personality. It will be nice when we get to the point where we don't have to see Andreas Antonopolous's face every day. There was a time when everyone using Bitcoin knew the names Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees. I'll bet many users now have never heard those names. And that's good. It means we're growing.

Did I mention anything about magic?

Then you'd see how much wealthier we'd all be if we were in control of our own money instead of the bankers who have complete control over the printing presses.
Houses aren't cheap, but they're not rocketships to the moon either. Without the prices being artificially pumped up through fractional reserve banking, they shouldn't take more than a few years to save up enough to buy a new one with cash.

As an anarchist, I can tell you right now the idea of Bitcoin being dependent on government passports in any way is something I'll be vehemently against. 
I can list many reasons why this is a terrible idea, but I'll give just a few.
1. Governments are criminal organizations. I'm using Bitcoin to help overthrow the state and its monopoly on money, not continue my dependency on it.
2. Passports can be taken away from people and are often used as weapons against political dissidents by governments. 
3. What's to stop governments from artificially creating passports in order to create false nodes? 
I'm really surprised they're wasting any time on this idea. It's some tiny remote problem that isn't anywhere near surfacing, and I'm sure there are other solutions out there.

4. And let me guess, the government will know exactly where this location is, too? 
5. What's a reasonable time frame? Do you mean like the speed at which the government responds to its constituents? Slow as molasses? 
6. Ahh, so you want to make sure that only the big boys like HSBC get to launder money, but not the little guys? 
7. Let me guess, these two people will be licensed and forced to hand over Bitcoin to the government if/when demanded?

Well, you touched on it at the end. The existing system is such that a very large segment of society KNOWS that the government frames people, throws victimless criminals in prison, is terrible at finding thieves, etc. and yet... are still being FORCED to pay for their so-called protection. The beauty of the market is that if said company were corrupt, word gets out and they lose business. Even if you, personally, weren't affected, if you see them, say, beat up somebody who did nothing wrong, you'd likely fire them. Can't fire the government police, though, they'll put you in a cage.

There is a creative commons free software license as well, I believe. And there are lots of people who release code with free licenses that DO allow individuals/businesses to use that code in a proprietary manner.
I, personally, don't have any issue with somebody using "free software" code and then releasing a binary that contains that code. I'm against binaries whose code is not open for security reasons, but the real problem with "proprietary" code is that it's not just a proprietary binary, it inevitably comes with some copyright license which is backed up with the guns of government. 
That's what is all comes down to, is the guns of government. Not all free software licenses are as "restrictive" as the GPL. 
In a world I envision, without IP, people write code. Then they either give it away freely or they sell it as a binary whose code is secret. Any code that is not secret is fair game for using in any way, shape, or form, anybody else chooses. No violence. If you don't like closed source binaries (like me) then you don't use them. If you write code for somebody who is willing to pay you for a closed source binary, that's their choice. I won't interfere. 
See what I'm saying?

Pretty much most countries, including that of western countries. In India, for example, the corruption is well documented. You can't do any commerce whatsoever unless you pay off tons of bribes.

First of all, yes it is because of paperwork. A merchant isn't going to accept silver for his goods and then worry about filling out paperwork because he paid his employee or supplier in silver that was worth slightly more than when he accepted it.

Because this will impose extremely onerous record keeping on individuals and companies, effectively eliminating the utility of Bitcoin in the marketplace and turning it strictly into a speculative investment, much like gold.

The decreasing purchasing power of the dollar is the effect of inflation, but it is not inflation. If the money supply started at $1 trillion, and over the course of a year, the money supply increased to $2 trillion, then you had a 100% rate of inflation that year. That's not to say that a $1 item at the beginning of the year will now cost $2. We don't know what it will cost. There's a lot of factors that go into the cost. In fact, the $1 trillion newly printed dollars may never have left the Central Bank, but the inflation still happened.

I think the douchebags in this comment section are trying to make Bitcoin look bad by being jerks. 
Here's an honest and helpful answer for you. Don't worry about mining right now. Worry about just getting some Bitcoin. Also, Bitcoin IS real money. The point is to turn your Dollars into Bitcoin. Eventually, after you've seen how much better Bitcoin is, you'll want to get paid in Bitcoin when you get a job. But for you, you need to just get some Bitcoin and spend them somewhere, and maybe even save a little. Ask your parents to set up a coinbase.com account and have them purchase $300 worth for you.

There are major corporations that print up all of the paper money for countries around the world. I'm sure it's possible to get them to print up high quality paper bitcoins. They have fees and such.

Then, you're looking at one bitcoin being equal to about $0.64 right now instead of $0.00064.

Then why don't they figure out ways to make money and cut out the middle man? Why pay for a "distributor" like Redbox when we can distribute it ourselves?
Here's one, JUST ONE, possibility of how it could work. James Cameron, amazing director, wants to produce a 100 million dollar movie. He has lots and lots of fans and a proof of concept for a movie I'd really like to see. As soon as he raises his 100 million dollars on indiegogo or whatever he will produce the movie. He could get donations from all over the world in Bitcoin. 100 million people send him a dollar each, bam, the movie is made. Again, that's just one model. Entertainers are creative people. I'm sure they could come up with a lot more.

Let me ask you this. Do you like monopolies? Because I don't. Monopolies lead to higher costs and lower quality of service. Do you like the drug war? Is it not criminal throwing millions of people into cages for putting certain plants into their bodies? 
Yes. I want to be able to fire my defense agency if I am not happy with their service and hire different ones. 
Welfare? Let me ask you this, suppose you were donating your money every year to a charity you liked. But one day you learn that your charity is doing a really poor job. It's giving money to people who don't deserve it and the administration is getting huge incomes and benefits they don't deserve. Would you keep donating to that charity or would you find a better one? I know for damn sure I would not voluntarily donate to government. They've done an absolutely horrific job of charity. They give most of the welfare to corporate billionaires. They also give it to a lot of people who are simply lazy and don't want to work. But the people who are truly needy, like disabled people, they get pennies. PENNIES!!!! But I don't have the choice to stop giving my money to the government, because they will throw me in jail if I do. They have no accountability.

These are laughably easy. The world must be very difficult for you.
1. People can already trade pounds for bitcoins. But if there were a government mandate that all taxes be paid in bitcoins within 1 year, I guarantee you that there would be a specifically Scotch Bitcoin Exchange popping up in about a day to serve that market.
2. It takes about 5 minutes to learn the basics. I'm pretty sure in one year it could be done.
3. There's no reason why the state can't print paper money 100% backed by bitcoin. Bitcoin paper wallets. Normal counterfeiting laws applied, too.
5. With paper wallets as currency, problem solved.

The difference is this would be making changes at the code level, instead of letting individuals decide for themselves. For example, Bitpay might show a price as 0.0012 BTC, whereas coinbase might show a price as 1.2 mBTC. If the price increases 10 fold we could easily switch our standards, and then if it halves again, switch back. With this approach, we're leaving things up to the devs. I don't like it.
Furthermore, right now there is a cap on how little can be spent per transaction, to weed out spam. Open it up to where people can send satoshis and you're talking about a lot more transactions that are worth essentially nothing, but filling up the blockchain. I'm not necessarily against this, but it opens up that debate all over again.

You're not the only person having this problem. Yes, I agree it's ridiculous that things aren't tailored a little bit better for the most ethical and safest OS in the world. Do you think they'll release a new binary that addresses this issue? I'd rather not have to build from source, as that usually requires installing newer dependencies, which I don't want to do. Should I wait? Or will it build without me having to update or install any dependencies that aren't in the Debian repo?
Edit: Just tried building from source. You're right, it's complaining that libdb_cxx headers are missing, in other words, my version of libdb is too new. The build instructions want me to add the oldstable repo to my sources list, which I'm unenthusiastic about. I think I'll just stick to running 0.8.6. What do you think the odds are that their next release will address this issue? I should have to jump through a bunch of hoops to build bitcoin-qt on debian stable.

I disagree. If you're a new business it's important to make sure that you have a solid foundation to build on. If you allow fiat, central bank notes, into your business you are building an unstable foundation, and when fiat either collapses or some new regulations target your business, you're in trouble. Whereas with Bitcoin you needn't worry about the whims of your local government's central bank.

Why are you here? Honestly, what are you doing here? You're clearly not a Bitcoin user. If you're happy with paying 3% plus $0.30 every time you receive a Paypal or credit card payment then don't use Bitcoin. If you're happy needing to use a bank to send money from point A to B, don't use Bitcoin. If you're happy with the massive counterfeiting of your fiat money by the central banks, don't use Bitcoin.
Everything you just wrote is a feature as far as I'm concerned, not a bug.

Ultimately, the participants of Bitcoin will decide which is better, and both sides will get their way.
Say, 30% of Bitcoiners want a hard cap, okay, they'll get a hard cap. If 70% want no cap, okay, they'll fork the blockchain and get no cap. And there will be competing currencies and they'll coexist at least for a while, maybe forever, but likely 1 way will prove the better and most everybody will eventually switch.

My home Internet connection is getting about 90 megabits download bandwidth per second right now. An average Bitcoin transaction is about 2,000 bits, so my current consumer-level Internet connection could download 45,000 transactions per second, over ten times average Visa transaction volume.
While it is nice to know that I could run a full node handling more-than-Visa-scale transaction volume from my house, running a dedicated machine in a data center somewhere makes more sense. 15,000 250-byte transactions per second works out to about 7 terabytes of bandwidth per month. One of my hosting providers charges $20 per month for a virtual private server with 8 TB of bandwidth per month-- or $240 per year to handle MasterCard-level transaction volume today (August 2014).
He explains how we have the bandwidth ability, but he doesn't address the storage ability. Does he do that somewhere else?

Well said. 
Obviously, in a voluntaryist society an individual can trade money for a compiled binary free from third party aggression. 
I agree with Richard on one position though, and that's his stance against open source software. Simply having the source code available to read is not enough. As a market-anarchist who doesn't believe in copyrights, individuals have the "right" to share the source code with others and modify the source code and share those modifications as well. 
So, we have a lot of software that is gratis and open source, but still relies on copyright, or the guns of government. to threaten users if they modify or share the source code, which is wrong. 
This is why I only use software that is "free AND open source software." 
That being said, I still use the term "free software" because the term "free software" implies that the source code is open.
Ultimately, however, the most important part of software is that it's open source. And the reason why is because there may come a day when the government seizes the copyrights of all free software and sells them to the highest bidders, thus, no longer making it free software. At that point all software will need to be A. open source and B. pirated. 
Perhaps in the future instead of everyone running around using the term "free and open source software" they will use the term "pirated and open source software."
In other words, the privileges the state grants me are inconsequential. My concern is that the software is open source and vetted for quality control by the developer community.

I think you gravely misunderstand what Subjective Value Theory is. SVT has to do with values, that's it. It mentions nothing about not knowing what other people value. It says that other what other people is subjective, i.e. personal to each individual. But that doesn't mean I can't know what other people value.
If it were impossible for me to know what other people value, then the market wouldn't exist. How else would I know what goods and services to offer in the marketplace? That's the whole idea between supply and demand. If I think lots of people demand something, then I supply that demand.
As far as the debate goes, I feel confident that there are crazy sons of bitches out there that would resort to mass violence if threatened, and so I want to limit their supply of destruction making capabilities.
Some people are better at judging the values of others. Some people are poor at that. The people that are good at judging the values of others succeed in the marketplace. The ones that are poor fail.
You would fail, I believe.

So yes, let's make sure that the mining pools don't pass legislation that forbids anyone from mining outside of the mining pools. Then we should be alright.

Insurance is nothing like saving money for a rainy day. Insurance is about covering the costs that would be too great to bear on one's own, even if they did save for a rainy day. The idea behind insurance is that the majority of people pay in to a fund with the intention of NEVER drawing out on it. The only people who do draw out would be people that had something bad happen to them. Considering everybody draws out of SS at a certain age, you most definitely cannot call it insurance unless you're intention is to pervert the definition of insurance.

I suppose it sort of depends. If it was a $200 meal, then sure. But if we're talking about $20-$30, it's just not worth the hassle. The waitress already had the hassle of trying to get him to pay with Bitcoin, then wait 30 minutes, then end up paying anyways with a credit card.

I think the best way to promote bitcoin is to get Bitpay and Coinbase to start advertising on television and radio the fact that they can set your business up to pay 1% fees or less.

If you're really into the topic of health care you should check out a book published by the Independent Institute called American Health Care. It will blow your mind just how F'ed up the whole system is. To address your example, if you and your family members and a bunch of friends, say, a couple hundred people in total wanted to get together and create your own insurance, that would be illegal. There are so many laws on the books that absolutely prevent the sort of community health insurance you're talking about. You've got to have permission from the government and they won't give it to you, because the corporations have got the politicians in their back pockets. 
In other words, government thugs will come and throw you in a cage if you attempt to do anything to challenge their little health care cartel.

I would recommend just letting the restaurant keep the money. Call them up and let them know you don't want the money back, but that the waitress should get it as a tip.
If you ask for a refund it's going to make the owner think twice about accepting BTC. If you let the waitress keep it, you'll have made her day. 
And no, a 120% tip isn't the end of the world. People do that from time to time. And waitresses don't make much money.
Something to consider.

That's actually a good feeling to have. Never lose that feeling. 
The fact is your money is under constant threat. It's only with government fiat are people lulled into thinking that their money is safe. Their money isn't safe. It's constantly being looted and the entire system could implode any day. 
Your Bitcoins could be stolen. They will always be the target of thieves. It's up to you to protect them.

Disclaimer: I've never used any other alt-coins and don't currently have any desire to.
I see alt-coins as a release valve. Bitcoin isn't perfect and never will be. Alt-coins allow people to explore different ideas and see how they work, without having to beg and plead the Bitcoin community to accept them. Maybe even some of these ideas will end up getting implemented by Bitcoin in the future.
These alt-coins help keep Bitcoin on its toes. They also help to keep the state on its toes. If the state attempts to go after Bitcoin, there'll only be 100 alt-coins waiting to take its place. 
I see a lot of value to alt-coins and so do others, otherwise they wouldn't exist at all.
I don't think there's any reason to feel threatened by alt-coins.

To all of the people downvoting this, you have to understand the definition of inflation/deflation is as controversial as the definition of capitalism. 
To the Austrian School of Economics, inflation/deflation is strictly defined as the increase or decrease of the money supply.
To the Keynsians, however, inflation/deflation is strictly defined as purchasing power of the currency relative to itself an arbitrary amount of time before.

If the block reward is greatly reduced so that it is equivalent to 25 BTC every ten minutes, then 1 second blocks would also mean much less need for miners to join pools. Even GPU solo miners would likely find a block now and then.

Bitcoin is a jailbreak from a corrupt and inefficient system. Windows is very much a part of that corrupt and inefficient system. When that system is so insecure that a simple misclick could land malware on your system resulting in the theft of your bitcoins, it's time to look for alternatives.
There are only two types of people that need to use Windows: People who game, and people whose work/school require it for some B.S. programs.
In either case they can run Linux for 95% of their daily computing activities and switch to Windows only when they absolutely must.

That's not the same. If the Apple and Google investors had a bunch of friends that were poor, they had tried to get their friends to invest in Apple and Google, and they didn't, and then they got rich, their friends would definitely resent them for it, bigtime.

Are the true identities of the owners known? On the one hand, it would be nice if they are known so that they are easier targets if they try to scam. On the other hand, if their identities are known, it makes it easier for the feds to nab them.

I don't really know what to say to you. You've successfully managed to skirt the issue by employing Greenspeak, A.K.A. "purposeful obfuscation."
I think you're relying on your Chicago? School economics more so than basic logic. Perhaps you should pick up some Austrian School text and learn about Praxeology, the study of human action. 
The truth is value is subjective. That's econ 101 and it's unfortunately missing completely from modern academia . Rational Choice theory may be great for people who are in their right minds, but it still doesn't address people that are acting irrationally. Furthermore, it assumes that there is such a thing as correct valuations. The truth is there is no such thing as correct valuations, because value is subjective. And there are some people that value death and destruction, even of themselves, if it means remaining on top, more than they value peace and freedom.

I really think competition brings out the best in us and I'm sure the same goes for crypto-currencies. Hell, maybe Litecoin will win out in the long run. Anything is possible.

They don't make their money on transactions. They make their money on changing between dollars and bitcoins. They would need to change 300 million dollars worth into or out of bitcoins for it to be profitable. Considering Bitpay alone has done 100 million dollars, I'd say that's easily doable.

Yes, we love accepting bitcoins for orders, we just don't have a payment address built-in to our shopping cart. When you place an order, select "Purchase Order" as the payment method, and mention you'd like to pay with bitcoins. When we receive the order, we'll send you an email with the payment address and amount.

This could be very negative for the Bitcoin ecosystem if the hardware is closed-source and contains any sort of malicious design.

The only thing BitInstant really had going for it was the ability to purchase Bitcoin with cash anonymously. Since they got rid of that feature, there's no reason not to use coinbase.

Clearly my name, market-anarchist, should imply to you that I am a stalwart defender of the free-market. If a buyer and seller want to do pre-orders, I support their freedom to do so. 
But I also support my freedom to say it was a bad practice. Pre-orders might be fine and dandy with a multitude of goods, but when it comes to the highly competitive and time-sensitive nature of bitcoin mining, pre-orders have largely been a disaster. 
BFL delivering several months behind schedule. Avalon fulfilling batch 3 orders before some batch 2 orders were fulfilled. ASIC companies "testing" the hardware for a couple of weeks before shipping. Here's your sloppy seconds! What a nightmare. 
I've been into Bitcoin for over two years, so your assumption that I am ignorant of the hardware market from a year ago is wrong.

A. Brand names can charge more. Brands that have been around a long time and have a solid reputation charge more for often the same product as their newer competitors.
B. The security that goes with purchasing brand names allows for newer upstarts to charge less. Then it's up to the consumer to decide, pay more for brand name or pay less for an untrusted brand.

Hoarding equals savings. Saving money now to spend at a later time is the backbone of civilization. The world is dead broke and steeped in debt. The world need genuine savings now more than ever. Bitcoin allows individuals to save for their future expenses, like retirement, health care, etc. instead of relying on criminal governments who promise security in old age, but blow the money on wars and police statism.

There are no absolutes, for starters.
If I am not free to, say, smoke a joint in my own home, then by extension I am not secure, for I could very well get kidnapped for doing so.
If you have zero freedom, say, because you are in a FEMA camp, you likewise have no security, for your life could be extinguished at any time.

Like I said, I want to laugh at the guy's face for his statement. But his credentials are orders of magnitue greater than mine. Am I going to stop promoting Bitcoin or change my behavior in any way? Hell no! But I used to mock Bitcoin before I fully understood it. So, let's just say I've learned my lesson when it comes to mocking things I don't fully understand. 
It's kind of unfortunate because Dan really didn't get a chance to "make his case" on that panel. He was being interupted by others on the panel and the original person who asked the question. I'd like to see Dan really lay out his argument taking as much time as he needs instead of being under the clock.
He's earned at least that much, I'd say.

I think I am starting to see where we are having problems. You are saying I lack empirical evidence because clearly no one has ever destroyed the world. And what I am saying is that just because they've never succeeded, and I'm not saying they ever will succeed, doesn't mean there aren't people out there that would try.
Also, I know people like to have sex. Empirically, the argument is there. I also know that there are crazy motherfuckers in positions of power that would push some bad buttons under certain circumstances, too, although empirically, the evidence is not there.
When I say that my evidence is historical empiricism, I'm looking at many examples of people who would have pushed buttons had the circumstances been just right, like Hitler, or suicide bombers. 
Have any of the modern day hegemons pushed the buttons in an attempt at the scorched earth policy? No. But they've also never felt threatened in any meaningful way, either.
You said in another thread that my belief in these megalomaniac scorched earthers conflicts with my anarchist desire to oppose them. Not at all. I want to make it so that even if these hegemons want to push a button to say, turn off the internet or nuke large swaths of the planet that are outside of their control, that they cannot because they lack the power to do so.

I don't think issue credit is the right term here. What you mean is, a government taking on debt. In that regard, the government would ask for individuals to loan BTC to it to be repaid, with interest, at a later time.
If nobody thought that were a good investment, then they're not getting any loans. End of story.
But if people do loan the government money, then one of two things will happen, they'll make good on their debts and pay back the loans in the future, or they will default and the loans will never be repaid.

People! 
Obviously, nobody here would destroy the keys because that would be money out of OUR pockets. But this isn't OUR money. It belongs to the guy at Wired and he can do whatever he wants with it. 
I have absolutely no problem with him destroying the keys. In no way shape or form is it going to hurt the Bitcoin ecosystem or protocol. 
It's not even hurting the soup kitchens. There's only one person this hurts, and it's the owner of the bitcoins. 
He just made all of our bitcoins more valuable. So, let's pretend he destroyed 2.1 BTC. That's one ten-millionth of all BTC that will ever exist. So, if you want to donate to a soup kitchen, go ahead and multiply the amount of BTC's you have by one ten-millionth and then donate that number to the charity of your choice.

Miners are NOT forced to upgrade, because some miners running 0.8.1 and some miners running 0.8.2 will not create a fork.
