Individual units of coins don't have digital signatures associated with them. There are not unique coins.
It is addresses that have digital signatures and are unique. These addresses just have an accounting of having X amount of coin. Right now, that field is denominated down to 8 decimal places, but at any point in the future the protocol can be updated to recognize however many decimal places are necessary.

So, you are blaming Coinbase for the requirements that the US government puts upon them.

Upvoted for the fact that this is actual discussion with reasons even if I don't agree with the assessment itself.
