It's interesting that the governments and central banks keep making these policies on behalf of the people without ever actually asking the people what they think. Governments are supposed to represent the people but somehow it seems that the people are often spoken for without being consulted. Interesting also that those in power also tend to be in the pockets of the bankers.

Methinks you did not watch the video, or its clear logic was lost on you. "I could care less" means that you *could* care less. The only way for you to care less is if you do in fact care some amount. If you cared no amount, then you would have no ability to care less (seeing as it's impossible to care a negative amount) and thus, due to the fact that you have zero amount of caring, you *couldn't* care less. If you *could* care less, it means that you care enough such that it is possible to care less than you currently do. And in that case, you've offered no indication of how much you care, only that you care some amount (which could be a *lot*). So while you're trying to convey that you have a very low amount of care, all you're actually conveying is that you do care, which means you've completely failed to successfully convey how little you care.

(a) Why does this retort always come up? They can use Bitpay, BitInstant or something else. Then they don't have to worry about what they are going to do with Bitcoins. They don't need to actually hold Bitcoins. How is this not obvious?
(b) So what you're saying is don't ask companies to accept bitcoins, just use bitcoins and then they'll accept bitcoins! *raised eyebrow*
Companies typically take action based on customer demand. If you don't ask for something, how can you expect to get it?

Ah right, that makes sense. I just assumed a trade would result in a transaction, as I thought each person's balance was kept at their own MtGox address and therefore to trade, you would have to move the funds to a different person's address.

I kept avoiding this because I don't have a car at the moment and travelling in person to trade for bitcoins was a pain. Then I noticed that there are usually a few sellers who will sell around market value and accept bank transfer. Seems risky at first until you look at their established credibility, OTC rating, etc. You start by buying just a few coins to test the waters, then once you're satisfied that it's a good, easy way to buy and that the seller is trustworthy, you buy more. Easy as. I bought about 18 bitcoins the other day, at market value, using this method, and was able to do without leaving my computer, and each transaction took only a few minutes.

Back in the old days, gold was a base standard of trade. But gold is heavy, so it's not all that convenient, and if it gets stolen, you've got nothing. So banks sprang up and what they did was store your gold in a vault and give you a promisory note, which was essentially an "IOU" on that gold, which was considered as good as having the gold itself, as it could be redeemed for the gold whenever desired. And people were willing to exchange promisory notes with each other knowing that anyone could redeem it for the gold it was backed by if they ever needed to.
After a while, promisory notes could be exchanged at banks for multiple promisory notes in smaller deonimations representating smaller quantities of the overall gold that the original note represented, and people would trade these too in lieu of the actual gold, as it was more convenient and easier to secure than carting gold around.
This was how fiat currency was born, and it literally represented a debt, in that the bank now "owed" you the gold that was backing the paper money (or promisory notes) that you held. And because gold had a fairly fixed and precitable supply, it did a pretty good job of fixing the value of the currency that represented it. A long time passed though and eventually fiat currency was so ubiquitous that the gold it was backed became somewhat irrelevant in people's daily lives, as all you needed to trade was the paper currency itself. 
In 1971 Nixon dropped the gold standard altogether, which meant that money became backed only by the confidence in its purchasing power and the trust in the central banks of the world who issue the currency. Those banks have been betraying the public's trust of late though, pulling various tricks in the way they handle the flow and issuance of currency, and without a backing standard to anchor its value, it has become a lot less stable and subject to the decisions made by the powers that be, who can print as much as they like.
Look up "Zeitgeist Addendum" on YouTube and watch it; it has a pretty good primer on fiat currency and fractional reserve banking, which is how the world is running these days.

Maybe this will be the catalyst that overcomes banks' near universal blockade on bitcoin. If bitcoin is ultimately going to succeed, it needs to be easy to move to and from other currencies and right now banks are making this extremely difficult.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:45:02
That is awesome that they're thinking about it as a funding source, as it would mean a super easy way for almost everyone to move between their local currency and bitcoins on demand, and it would allow them to capitalize on bitcoins, via an exchange fee, rather than succumbing to obsolescence if bitcoin gets too big and starts eating their lunch.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:53:43
In my opinion, there are two primary needs right now:
(1) Getting a critical mass of merchants on board - if people are going to be excited about having bitcoins, they have to feel like it's actually solving a problem for them, and this will only be the case with much greater merchant adoption.
(2) Making it easier for people to acquire bitcoins - it's hard to convince a lot of people to hold a bitcoin balance when there's the inconvenience of acquiring their bitcoins outweighs the utility afforded by holding them.

No, however trading for an altcoin that is difficult or impossible to trace can done with the only possible repercussions being the question "why did you trade for that", and that's assuming the trade was performed on an exchange that even provides that information externally. And if we have a distributed exchange managing cryptocurrency trades, then the currencies won't even flow into a central repository that anyone is able to report on; they'll simply appear to flow to another "random" address that likely has no relevant identity attached to it.

I'm suggesting the speculators can be both if they are willing to spend a small amount of their balance. Disclosure: my balance is extremely tiny...
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:56:03
A wall is simply a large order, or a large number of orders, at a particular price, to either buy or sell. An order to buy or sell at a specified price is a "limit" order. An order to buy or sell a certain amount at whatever the going rate is, is called a "market" order.
In order to create a market sell order, you need people sitting and waiting to buy at some price. Whoever is paying the most will be sold to first, followed by the next highest bid and so forth until the sell order is satisfied.
Conversely, a market buy order requires a bunch of limit sell orders sitting and waiting for buyers. The market buy order will first buy from the lowest-priced sell order, followed by the next-lowest priced sell order until the buy order has been satisfied.
A "wall" exists when there are a large number of limit orders at a given price, as a market order will need to completely drain all of the orders at that price before the next limit order in the queue moves to the front and thus becomes available to satisfy market orders. The next limit order in the queue will be at a slightly different price, otherwise it would have been part of the "wall".
In this way, once a wall is drained, market orders deduct from the next limit order at the price set by that order, thus affecting what is considered the current market rate, which is simply what people are paying for bitcoins at any given point in time. If a huge order comes in, it will soak up a lot of limit orders in order to be satisfied, which means the price will shift rapidly, as it goes through each of the successive limit orders, each priced a little higher (or lower) than the one before it.

The big *if* is whether PayPal implements it as a one-way or a two-way mechanism. They can easily do either, but the most exciting prospect would be if they allowed you to withdraw funds to a bitcoin address. It's entirely possible they won't do this as they can't then reverse the operation, but who's to say? They have no qualms about putting your PayPal account into the negative if they have to.

Counterpoint: BitTorrent doesn't require exchange into a legal medium in order to be used by the common man. Bitcoin requires a network effect which is built on Joe Average being able to change his USD into BTC and back again, then tell his friends about it, and allowing them to do the same. If the average person can't easily acquire a BTC balance with which to transact, it'll become a closed pool, inhabited only by those already  possessing Bitcoins and then only with a reduced number of merchants now that the majority of legit merchants will drop BTC as a payment option.
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:48:26
I suspect volatility is a factor for some of them, but moreso I'd say that it's simply a chicken-and-egg problem. Why put the effort into supporting a payment method that you don't think a significant-enough number of customers will use? And why put the effort into acquiring bitcoins when there aren't a significant-enough number of merchants who accept them? And that's not counting the greater majority who either haven't heard of it, or have heard of it in passing but don't really know anything about it.
I think the chicken-and-egg problem, i.e. acquiring critical mass, will be assisted via a few more bull runs (aka bubbles). When there's a bubble, more of the public becomes educated about bitcoin and more of them jump on board, both customers who want aboard the bitcoin train, and merchants who want people to spend their bitcoins. The more this happens, the greater the number of people who will exist within the bitcoin economy, and the more activity we'll see.
So... I guess for  the way forward is education - spreading the word - demonstrating the benefits of bitcoin and leading by example.
For  I think that comes down to startups with innovative ideas for selling bitcoins. Largely I agree this is for exchanges to do, but you can still be creative; I am sure there are multiple ways to facilitate the transfer of bitcoins to newcomers and make a profit in the process.

Erik, please make a point of debunking the whole intrinsic value argument. Bitcoin may not have intrinsic value, but it's a pointless argument to make, because Bitcoin doesn't need intrinsic value. Money has historically had/needed intrinsic value to overcome the limitations of what constituted money at the time. In other words, **intrinsic value solves a problem that Bitcoin doesn't have**, and thus the argument that *not* having intrinsic value is bad for Bitcoin is irrelevant and wrong.

I'm not really the guy who goes around yelling Gandhi quotes at anyone who'll listen, but this does sure as heck seem like they're fighting the spread of Bitcoin, and I'd be very surprised if it's just because they're being cautious. They have every reason to fear it developing into something more mainstream and if I were in a position of power in the banking system, and wanting to ensure that the power is held for the long term, I would be doing whatever I can to ensure that Bitcoin (and any other similar threat) is cut off at the knees and dealt with harshly, through whatever means possible.
@_date: 2013-05-30 11:00:15
The movement of coins in and out of MtGox, specifically, isn't important for the anonymity aspects of the Bitcoin community and its ideals. What is needed is stability and consumer confidence that the regulators are not going to mess with the primary mechanisms with which Bitcoin is traded, which means MtGox's move can only be a good thing. If genuine anonymity is required, one can always fall back on localbitcoins, though I think this is not of huge importance for the majority of consumers.
I think localbitcoins may end up being a target in the future, but if the BitMessage and OpenTransactions combined network begin to take off in the future, it'll largely supercede localbitcoins and thus this won't be an issue.

Hello, good to see more options popping up for transacting in Bitcoins. My feedback on your site:
* Put products on the front page! You're a product marketplace - it's crazy to make customers have to click through to another page before they even see a product!
* On your FAQ page (and possibly others) your text is centered, making it incredibly annoying to read. Have you ever seen a book, newspaper article, magazine article or professional website that uses centered body text?
* Truncate product names in thumbnail view or they can blow out the size of a cell, making it look ugly.

I agree that the pricing is way too high. Make pricing based on volume so that small vendors can get started without a huge barrier to entry. Also realise that they'll want to make money on transaction fees, so price in a way that leaves enough margin for this. Other exchanges charge less than this and they have no middle man to split profits with.

It means that the currency is effectively an "IOU" for the thing that it is backed by, and that there is an expectation that you can redeem your currency for the backing commodity if you choose. Hence the stability of the currency is pegged to the availability of that commodity and the perceived value thereof. While you can still "buy" gold with dollars, dollars no longer act as "vouchers" for gold, so there is no requirement that anyone be able to give you gold if you want to trade your dollars in.

I have a rig mining at around 50Gh/s and I'm earning barely 0.025BTC/day at the moment. If your laptop has good enough graphics hardware in it, you * might* get up to 100Mh/s from it, which is one five-hundredth what I'm making, or 0.00005BTC/day, or just under five cents per day at the current exchange rate. And that'll keep going down every two weeks. Even if the exchange rate rises by a factor of ten, you're still making a measly 50 cents per day, declining by the fortnight. And realistically your laptop will probably not exceed 10-20MH/s day.
