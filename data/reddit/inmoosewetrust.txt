A new car can be a good investment. I bought a brand new hybrid because my Prius had a dead battery and needed major electrical repairs. I bought a Hyundai Ioniq knowing I would drive 60,000+ miles a year.
Today, after 145,000 miles, I still get over 50 miles per gallon and just the gas and maintenance savings alone are enough to pay for my monthly payment. I'm spending 1/2 the amount I used to spend on gas and maintenance is very minimal (synthetic oil  still original brakes, no error codes whatsoever).
And with the safety features like smart cruise control and automatic brakes, driving is easier/safer/more fun. The automatic brakes saved me from serious accidents many times.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:36:39
1. Way more. Even if Bitcoin fails, there are lots of good alt projects and they will survive. Blockchain technology is the internet 30 years ago.
2. We already have record high money printing among central banks, and it will start to affect the inflation rate as the money slowly gets dumped into the economy. Land and stock prices go up first, and then slowly everything else.
3. Yes, which will make it more expensive.
@_date: 2019-11-27 10:32:07
That can't be the original battery

It depends on the country but if you're using any bank account or even ATM, you're not safe. Bitcoin has an open ledger so you don't have much privacy either.
If you want to avoid taxes, you can trade on decentralized exchanges with no KYC and then give it to someone in exchange for cash.

The inflation rate is just as high today. Look at asset prices. Consumer Price Index is a bullshit measurement and it doesn't measure real inflation.

My 2008 Prius was getting worse gas miles than my 2007 Corolla in 2017, and was having horrible electrical problems (WTF is an ABS actuator?). I traded it in for a 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid and never looked back. 145,000 miles later it's still good as new with original brakes and 50+ mpg.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:15:08
Almost no one uses it and I don't use any software wallet that supports it. I personally like the idea behind it because Bitcoin Core is very slow and transfers are expensive, especially when there is a lot of price movement like in late 2017. Lightning Network is unreliable and I've never used it. I would like to see Bitcoin moved with Ethereum's faster speed and lower transaction fees.

I actually had many opportunities to buy between 2012 and 2017, and I just cringe every time I think about all the useless junk I accumulated online shopping back then. If I just bought a couple hundred dollars worth, I would be doing very well right now.
Then 2017 happened and in a sick and twisted way, looking at what other people lost makes me feel a lot better.
I did have about $60+ worth of DOGE and shitcoins in 2014 on a laptop I recycled and forgot about until recently. It would be worth a few thousand today.

You can put stablecoins in a savings account and get 6-8% yields. Also, I'm sure you remember, back when you were my age, banks used to give out a lot more money to savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Today they can't even keep up with inflation.

I meant that Bitcoin transactions are not private and if you do a little bit of research, you can figure out who certain wallets belong to. From there, governments and other people can track you down and figure out how much money you have. That's how police can find people who buy child porn on the deep web. It might be relatively easy to avoid taxes today but it's going to get much harder in the future.

I Trust cryptocurrency banks more than I trust JPMorgan Chase. If you look back to the 1970s and 1980s, banks would often give you over 10% interest on your savings account and they would still make a profit. today, they're making even bigger profits and you're lucky if you get more than 1%. Also, these banks are more likely than ever before to take all of your money during the next financial crisis. They're already doing that in other countries like India.

@_date: 2019-11-19 11:12:22
On these online banks, stablecoins give higher returns and it's easier to withdraw stable coins quickly as you need them instead of having to worry about fluctuating prices.
Let's say Bitcoin is $100k at all time high and I have 10 BTC, so $1 million. I put it in a savings account and get 6% on crypto.com or BlockFi.
This month, I get $5000 interest. Next month the price tanks and it's now $20k. I get $1000 interest.
With stablecoins, I can use that same steady income to pay my mortgage, or car, or some other essential expense and focus my time on things I actually enjoy doing. If I want to buy the dips with my stablecoins, I can still do so easily.
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:41:29

Ask any investment broker. If you're someone confident in stocks, you can get over 5% per year in dividends. Some mutual funds pay more.
If you put your Bitcoin in blockfi, you can earn 6.2%. and if you put stable coins in nexo, you can get 8-10%
Put a couple thousand dollars into Bitcoin every year and just leave it inside blockfi, by the time you're ready to retire, it will be worth a lot. That's exactly what I'm doing right now.

Wife and I had extreme financial problems at the beginning of 2019 and I was very sick. We finally got on our feet and got new jobs in July and we decided we had to plan our future. We can't risk losing everything again so we had to invest in something long-term.
Because I heard about a new round of quantitative easing, I would rather buy cryptocurrency. So we started DCA in late July and since then, the entire market has been going down except for a few alts.
We lost a lot of money (over 1/3 of our initial investment) but we are still going to HODL. At this point, if we have another major financial problem, we will be bankrupt so I hope prices go up soon.
Next bull run I can settle credit cards and pay off student loans, and if it's high enough, we can also put a down payment on a house.

Stocks and land crashed during the last recession, and the rich people who HODLed stocks and land made back everything and gained even more. Same thing happens in every recession. During the Great Depression, literally the best financial strategy was to buy stocks and land and just HODL.
Cryptocurrency is in a bear market today. Dollar cost average after every paycheck, and HODL. Wait a few years and the next bull run will inevitably happen.
I'm waiting stocks and the housing market to crash again. When that happens, I will start to DCA and HODL in those markets in addition to crypto. Never only invest in one asset.

I've seen 55 inch 4K TVs sometimes on clearance for $300.

Can I do that all in one day, or do I have to wait a week like I do with Pro?

I agree. You can also eat gold and trade miniscule crumbs of gold for basic necessities.

U.s. dollars are made of cotton and linen, not paper. In fact, there's no paper in them.

Just tried and it worked. Thanks.

That's essentially ho Muslims read the Quran. The longest chapters are at the beginning and shortest at the end.

I can't for the life of me figure out how to use coinbase pro. I have $40 on it, which took over a week to add, and I haven't been able to do anything with it.

What are clothes like in the future? Do people dress fancy, dress in plain uniforms like every science fiction, or are they basically nudists?

Why can't you buy now and why haven't you heard about dollar cost averaging?

Anytime anyone says there are no transaction fees, you know they're lying. There's no such thing as a free lunch. I bought and sold stocks there before and they always take a few pennies from every transaction.

You know when you have a few hundred in the bank account after paying your bills? It'll crash one day later.

All Muslims, terrorists or not. The order of chapters and verses in the Quran make absolutely no sense. It's not organized by time or topic.

Now the number of cores will rise exponentially, until we shift to some other paradigm.
Hard drives topped out so now Moore's Law applies to SSDs.

Eventually the price of gold will be so expensive that you will have to break up your bars into goldtoshis and exchange those for goods and services.

CPI is not real inflation. Compare price of gold to get a more accurate reading
