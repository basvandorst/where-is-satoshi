You are wrong, my order was at 506.23, the low was 500, to reach 500 it should fill my order first before reaching 500. 
It was open since february 7, look at the link I gave you. Is not a order below the trading range, it was an open order and didn't get filled because Gox treated as if it wasn't there.
My order should get filled at 506.23 before the low at 500.
This is a serious bug.

There is a lot of money from Silk Road that passed through MtGox in the past, this alone is an excuse for an intervention. 
Also Gox have almost 10 million dollars seized by the US government, this gives them a good leverage for Karpeles cooperation.

Now it made sense, thanks.

But if those coins where sent to an adress under gox control in 2011 and never withdraw, that doesn't mean that the coins are still there but inacessible who knows why?

[12:29] &lt;bit14&gt; there's some proof that gox has at least 200k btc

I say again, you are wrong, the bid/ask matching process is like a queue line.
if I had a buy order at 506.23 it is impossible, I say again, IMPOSSIBLE to reach 500 before filliig my order, if you disagree with that you don't know how an exchange works.
Trades are executed whenever a purchase or sales order is submitted, the bid price of a new order to buy meets or exceeds the lowest ask price in the Ask Queue, or the ask price of a new order to sell is less than or equal to the highest bid price in the Bid Queue.

If he lost the keys or they are corrupted and unrecoverable is the same as throwing away all that cash in the ocean, but if he somehow managed to recover than all is not lost.

Can you join  Charlie and other guys appear to arrive at MtGox adresses and are preparing to publish. We could use your help.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:49:39
Maybe because there are other parties involved and there are other factor in the matter that we don't know? 
There is some evidence about the involvement of US gov.
What is not being said is what matters most.

Anyone know where I can plot a chart of the transaction versus price?
It seems to me that is the first time they are not correlated.

I didn't lost any money, but I should get filled if the low was 500 and now I am not filled and it is 585. 
What you are saying is that there is a bug which show a trade happening at a price that it is not the real one? So the 500 low wasn't real?
Please elaborate more...

Maybe they tried to access the coldest wallet prior to resuming withdrawal to prepare for a high outflow of btc and then discovered that it was corrupt/unavailable

Also no coins on btctuilder from me. Just spreading the findings.

Analysis from leaked japanese court filing, mtgox to be acquired by silk road (equity).
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:26:43
Thanks I got it now, so basically I missed the bottom by inches. 
That is better to accept than an unfullfilled order due to Goxing.
BTW this is a very convenient bug for gox to have, they are basically stealing from the seller some ticks each time this happens.

For those who sold their usd claim on mtgox, what happen if a civil rehabilitation happen? It's my understanding that they only sold the usd claim which is covered by the sale of ~40k btc in January. Would they be entitled to the remaining btc if mtgox does get rehabilitated?
