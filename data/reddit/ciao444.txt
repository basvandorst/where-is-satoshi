First all few countries have taken in millions and many dont allow migrants to work. 
doubt it will lead to bankruptcy, when you have million of potential workers. Just need to ensure they receive right support to enter the workforce. This has happened throughout history, migrants need time but do become productive. Many have already opened buisnesses

really ? your going to spread authoritarian fascist propaganda on the bitcoin sub ?


Really in which country ? Asylum Seekers are eligible for financial support but its less than what unemployed locals. Average wage in Europe is EUR 1508 monthly, which country gives welfare more than this ?  


You do know its 2017 ? Something called computer database and dna.
 Migrants are not allowed to claim asylum in two european countries, every day 100s of them are deported back to the first country they claimed asylum in 


Most travel alone and children have their details stored, they actually verify that you have children before paying such benefits. Would you prefer to see children starve


yea you already mentioned this in your first sentence why repeat yourself ? your just rambling now
 &gt;no costs (free house, money).
By Free House, you actually mean 1 room in a refugee camp and you already said money so your rambling again because you ran out of lies. They do have costs  food,clothing, transport etc  


You really are a twisted person to spread lies and fabrications about incredibly vulnerable people
