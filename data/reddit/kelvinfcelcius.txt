Woah, those fees are indeed high. Guess I didn’t think about that part. I think I’m just gonna wait a little bit and put a small amount into all three and let it sit for a while with a focus on ETH, it seems like it has good potential from what ive read (inb4 hodl memes). What do you mean by contagion of ETH and LTC?

Really? But then you wouldve lost the profit of the dip. Do you think bitcoin is going to go in a downwards spiral, like back down to the 4 digits?

To be fair, wasnt gonna dump a whole lot in, just around $50 to see what happens. But, do you think its worth it to invest in altcoin like litecoin or eth?

Hey man! I totally feel you, I am a student lol so I don’t have money pouring out of my pockets but I’ve actually started saving money and not buying things just for the sake of it and today managed to reach my first $100 in, by putting $20/$40 here and there throughout the past two weeks! (Again, not much to a lot of people, but for me I’m pretty proud of myself for actually saving money.) It’s been well thoughtout, if I wake up tomorrow and have $0 its whatever it was $100, I hvae a whole lifetime to make t back. Also, not only have I started saving in the form of crypto, I’ve also started saving in a proper savings account, matching each investment.  I’m quite thankful for this dip! Heres to being crypto newbies haha.

I’m a btc noob as well, buying my first crypto soon, only putting about $10 or $20 a week as well. I live in AUS and I was just wondering if the Coinbase AUS account allows you to send crypto to exchanges? It doesnt let you sell from in app in AUS. Also, what are the fees if it does? Does it cost money to send from coinbase to a different wallet? Also, would it be better for me to buy LTC or ETH since it would be a much larger fraction?

true, if it rises, ive made some money, if it falls,
ive only lost $50 so not too bad in the grand scheme of things. i am gonna do some research so i invest wisely, but yeah i wont be too mad if i lose.

Okay, thanks for this advice!

fair point, i wont be able to buy til paypal confirms my bank acc (recently switched) so hopefully monday. if only i pulled the $50 gamble back in the day when my friend was going on about how cool bitcoin was at $10 a pop (he and i were young so he only bought 2 but sold out at 1.5k.) lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:15:09
Thanks for the suggestion! I dont think I’ll be at the point to put 1k into bitcoin for a while, (im a student with a part time job) however maybe a lower amount but more substantial than $50 is reasonable so I’ll look into setting some aside each paycheck. 
edit: with that said, do you have any book suggestions?

@_date: 2018-01-10 14:50:33
yes! i actually was wanting to put most of my crypto money into ETH. I think it has good potential from what ive read. thank you :)

I’ve been trying to get into the habit of that, it’s just hard when you wanna buy so many things right now even though I’m saving up to buy something that can make me money if I try hard enough (A new camera, I’ve been doing shoots for people for free for a few months just trying to get my name out there but I wanna up the quality) and something that I do genuinely enjoy, but I’ve been getting better about it I think!

while you’re probably (pretty much definitely) right about men dominating the market, i (a girl) think it probably has something more to do with the overall male bias in the business/stock market/investing type jobs along with technology in general having a mainly male market. (don’t mean to start an argument, but before you go calling something male dominated, you should probably consider the fact that more women probably just arent exposed to BTC because they dont care too much for technology in general) also this isnt meant to be some tumblr sexism rant im just saying theres a lot more factors to consider other than “males take bigger risks”
