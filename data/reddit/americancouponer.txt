i understand about the giving aspect.....  but im talking about spending it on stuff for yourself....   for example... lunch at subway....  I have no problem spending $7 for lunch in fiat..... but if I only had bitcoins to spend id probably make my lunch at home.   Next year that $7 in fiat will probably only be worth $6   and $7 in bitcoin might have be worth $25
