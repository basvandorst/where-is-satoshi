Making margin call / forced liquidation isn't scamming, btw. It's part of leveraged trading.

You think America enters wars for altruistic purposes? Cute.
There's usually motivated by a combination of strategic advantage and private profit.
The US been dragging other western countries into wars since the 60's.

By swapping out proof-of-work, the benefits of zero-trust and decentralisation are lost. But that's OK for some applications.

Where available, hydro power usually is cheaper than coal or nuclear. IIRC, many of the main Chinese miners are using very cheap (or even free) Hydro power.
Marginal power use may be carbon neutral, but building the damn is a goddamn disaster for the local environment.

Same story with ETFs. Doesn't matter that your ETFs are denominated in dollars, their value is based on the underlying assets - which in many ETFs is profitable businesses.
If you're holding bond ETFs, well, their underlying asset is fiat debt. So, I guess that's one exception :)

Was the passphrase some kind of academic, literary or pop culture reference?

Yep. I don't introduce people to it, especially not family. Sometimes I'll ask friends if they've heard of it, and if they have, we might talk about it. But I still don't promote it/pump it up.
Had a family member invest $500.00 of my hard-earned cash when I was ~13 and it went to $0.00 in the .com crash. Never want to be in that situation again - in either position.

Somebody didn't do their research. This only reinforces my belief that MSM articles about any advanced topic (in any field, not necessarily technology) are probably more wrong than right.

Do the right thing. You've earned money, pay tax on it.
Either that, or form a company / trust that (supposedly) produces economic value and get an accountant to help you with it.

I use "lightweight clients" because, well, downloading the whole blockchain is simply stupid.
To help out the network, I run bitcoind on my VPS and Seedbox. Once BitcoinQT can connect to bitcoind remotely, then I'll consider using it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:44:29
Now I'm just confused. Was it a significant balance? (100 mBTC+).
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's safe to rule out the sending wallet because it couldn't have performed the second transaction without knowing 1C...'s private key. It's possible that the receiving wallet did this - through some bizare bug or through malice. It's from the Bitcoin Foundation, so I don't think it would be malice. No need for extra bitcoin. So... Bug?
If somebody already pwned your Blockchain wallet, why did they wait to steal your money?

I've heard of sychronous/asynchronous communication and I personally use those terms to describe the difference between say, a phone call (sync) and email (async). These terms are used a bit in Software Engineering and Computer Science.

By voluntarily joining the military, service people explicitly demonstrate their support for the activities they engage in. You suffer from cognitive dissonance.
Your argument does works if service people are drafted - forced into participating in war (e.g. Vietnam, WWII)

I liked the story.

I'm extremely curious about how this happened. Did any pf the addresses in your Blockchain wallet have a balance before sending this back to it?
The only explanation I have is a compromised Blockchain password, probably through malware but possibly through a weak password. The "automatic" transaction from 1C... is not normal - it was initiated by somebody who has access to your private key!
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:38:48
Fair enough.
A treasure hunt sounds like fun - time to download the blockchain on my VPS ;)

This guide is about running a bitcoin network node. Even though `bitcoind` will create a `wallet.dat` file, it will never have a balance unless the configuration file is modified to set `gen=1`.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:53:05
Yeah, pretty sure you're right.
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:22:18
My guess is "lakhs". AFAIK, Indians like using the "100s of thousands" units and they call them lakhs. There's also "crore" for "10s of millions".
So that number might be reads as 1 crore, 17 lakh, 62 thousand, 5 hundred and 50. Happy to be corrected if wrong :)
Edit: Mispelled "lakh" as "lack". Added crore.

Nodes form the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. Many nodes also operate as miners, but not all do. Due to the increased difficulty of mining, I suspect fewer nodes are also miners.
So what do nodes do if they don't mine? They ensure network availability, keep a copy of the blockchain, share the blockchain with new or out-of-date nodes, share bitcoin network information, accept new transactions for broadcast, and relay transactions / new blocks.
