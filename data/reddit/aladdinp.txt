I'm behind on my bitcoin news. What's going to replace GPUs?

After glancing at both types of hardware, I'm not completely convinced that they will replace GPUs for bitcoin calculations.
The GPU is heading more towards a design that lends itself to general purpose computation, making mining for bitcoins possible with some basic gaming hardware. The GPU might evolve into something less specialized than its current state and maybe even end up getting a new name, but I have a hard time believing that specialized ASIC hardware will ever beat the phenominal price/performance ratio that GPUs have. We're already generating millions and millions of hashes per second; maybe GPU architecture already lends itself to hash computation so efficiently that designing new hardware will be unnecessary.
Man, heterogeneous computing is exciting stuff.

I always assumed there was a way to sell bitcoins anonymously. What good is it making hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of BTC if you can't liquidate it into your currency of choice? There's a pretty limited number of BTC vendors at this point.

I'm sad to see such an obnoxious, caustic response from reddit to such a reasonable question.

You won't be holding BTC, because you'll be converting it to USD instantly if that's a concern.

Oh yeah, Bradley Manning is just rolling in dough, isn't he?
