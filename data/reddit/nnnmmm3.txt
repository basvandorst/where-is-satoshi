There is no reason to assume all miners will always be profit seeking.
There's every reason to believe state actors and banking giants will want to cripple bitcoin, or take it out entirely, if possible.
Going in as trojan miners sounds like a good way for that.

So epic that you brought that up! :)

That's definitely a guy with his back to the wall, watching an impending loss of a billions worth.

That depends what you mean by most important.
Those two entities have different roles.
Miners are the ones that can create blocks, and are the only ones. 
Full nodes relay and verify the blocks.
While all mining nodes are also full nodes, much less than 1% of all full nodes are mining nodes.
So it doesn't matter really if BU is 10% mining power or 90%, if the nodes don't approve of the blocks they are not accepted as legitimate part of the blockchain.
On the other hand, it's not very hard to spoof full nodes (you can have one entity spinning hundreds of nodes on cloud services), and mining power is absolute...
So none of those is a definite answer as to "what's more important".
That's why consensus is a tricky bitch.
It's pretty subjective. Though I believe it's quite evident with side is more popular among the community of users businesses and exchanges.

Luke, much respect obliged, but what's the point of a throw away anonymous poll, where anyone can vote multiple times?
Why not use something like  that actually takes real bitcoins as vote?

I didn't realize both BTCC and Bitfury are still game with 2X.. That's very disappointing.

While this piece is not something that I agree or identify with, I hate that it's being down voted. We can use the occasional cast of doubt, there's no shortage of circle jerk going on.

Either the wallet you are using sucks, or this specific transaction is abnormally large, or maybe you really need this tx to pass in the next block and you configured it that way.
If you can stand to wait say 3 hours then even in these expensive times 3-4 dollars as a fee would do.

On average less than 50 cent is enough. Not now though.

I understand this is still premature for Bitcoin at the moment, but a question about a hypothetical implementation in the future: Assuming that CT will remain CPU intensive, is it a problem to implement a different fee, or an addition to the existing fee, which is not based on sat/byte but on CPU usage?
It can be as simple as a constant addition to the fee for CT's, no?  
This leads me to a related question, is it obvious by looking at a tx that's it a CT? (Because if a miner doesn't know than I guess he\she can't ask for the xtra fee).

Well I consider myself a staunch NO2Xer, yet I never thought that the DCG thing is a valid argument for/against any side here.
As an investor I know for a long time that it's best to have a stake in all sides, and DCG sure hold it.
If one wants to worry about something, it's not about DCG pushing this agenda or the other; It should be about the sheer omnipresence of DCG in  the ecosystem that may be pushing away the 3rd or 4th or 100th option that you'll never hear about in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:26:28
Right. And it just dawned on me that being CPU intensive means that nodes will heave a harder time verifying tx's, and they don't get paid.. So this feature can also effect negatively network centralization by decreasing node count. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:50:38
Well, you should know that DCG has stake in many companies in the ecosystem? (I only skimmed through, so maybe you did know?).
Full list of DCG portfolio: 
And also, it is unclear how much of Blockstream DCG holds, do they have any kind of majority at all?

Read into the thread a bit, the so called proof there is absolute rubbish.
It's just an irrelevant snapshot of a GUI, but you can see from the code in the Bitmaintech Github page that the exploit is always running nonetheless.

Downvoted, and here's why.
There have been more than a few posts recently that are very pro-core\anti 2x in the content, yet the headline gives a very different impression. 
people then upvote for the content, but what reader of r/bitcoin see on the top post is a headline which appears very much pro 2x, with many votes.
There is plenty of shilling going on, as many of you know.
Sure, some of the cases are very innocent.
But next time I would like the headline for this post to be "stop giving shitty reasons against 2x - here are the real reasons!".
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:41:22
That's disappointing, to say the least.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:12:33
Thanks! That's exactly what I was looking for.

While I am certainly bullish about Bitcoin, I find some the reasoning in this piece not very robust.
There should really be some knowledge about the scale of Chinese shorting to seriously give a prognosis based upon it.. And something resembling proof of it, if possible.
