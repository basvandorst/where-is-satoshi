Never getting into tech and not investing in start-ups are different things. He's not a venture capitalist.  
While not as risky as investing in coins or start-ups, Apple was tipped to have peaked and a downward trend was expected, so there was risk involved. And I don't see not taking on risk as a sign that he is not into tech.

Previous to that, he/BH owned a massive amount of the shares in IBM. He definitely invests in tech, it would be ridiculous to close yourself off to one of the largest sectors in the world, especially considering the growth.

That's why credit cards and online banking is a thing. Most of the money transactions in  for example Norway (and a lot of other European countries) are completely cashless and free. 
In 2020, Norwegian businesses will no longer be obligated to accept cash as payment. The current government has set a goal of completely eliminating cash by 2030. And that's not because of cryptocurrency.
