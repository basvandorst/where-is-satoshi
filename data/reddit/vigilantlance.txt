Lolol. I knew this too. Battle brothers... hodling the front line while the noobs run around with weak hands getting their coins quickscoped.

Unfortunately even if another app came out. It would take a year or more to build reputation. I use Coinbase for convenience. So what if I pay a couple bucks more on my buys. 
Convenience is king. Eventually I’m sure there will be more options but by then Coinbase will probably restructure to compete. 
Gemini sucks on mobile. Just keep hodling OP. Someone who likes money will make an app soon enough.

Haha, the dems try but fail even on this front.
For all the idiots that downvoted. Stay salty. MAGA.
The democrats shut down the government because of a temper tantrum. They don’t care about how it affects the economy. The great thing about crypto, is it doesn’t get affected at all. I’m here hodling and trusting in the Emperor. My ancestors are smiling down upon me. Can you say the same?

Buy a small child from Uganda and bring him in for show and tell. Then show your teacher that he isn’t a sex slave and that bitcoin is meant for buying all types of slaves, not just child sex slaves.

No point in selling to instantly buy back. Unless the dip is lower than the moment you sell , minus fees.
