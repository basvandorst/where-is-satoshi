Exactly. I'm not sure how people look at 200,000ish years of consistent cooperation, community growth, and societal betterment and say humans are hard-wired to be greedy. Money didn't even exist until 20,000 years ago, let's maybe dial it back on the armchair psychology and let our biological imperative to look after one another speak for human nature.

This is pretty fascinating actually. Since there's no really efficient way to store energy for long periods of time, or sell excess energy to anywhere that isn't local, big cities that generate a surplus of electricity could have their own crypto mining division that would be more efficient and more profitable than storing or selling the excess energy. And since it's all renewable there's little if any impact on the environment.

Mining rewards are set to halve in May, possibly before this venture even has a chance begin operations. Their core investment team, and Peter Thiel, all think that they're going to be able to turn a profit (and likely a BIG one) by mining, post-halving. Not to mention the added security such a massive mining farm would add to the network, making BTC more valuable. 
This is super bullish. It shows the Bitcoin blockchain has longevity, even 10 years into the experiment.

There's still a demand for bitcoin, and they get mining fees for securing the network. They've sunk hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars into their mining operations, they won't stop. They won't be selling because even if they did they wouldn't break even, so supply dwindling and demand staying the same/increasing is going to lead to a higher price no matter what.

Yes, I know the banks are holding the securities. 
And they don't control it directly, but they certainly can't be blindsided by the value collapsing. Look at all the banks that sold off their CDO's in preparation for the 2008 bubble burst. And the only reason they were able to do that is by holding the valuation agencies hostage, because losing a $200b contract will put your business underwater, and it makes no difference to BofA who they got their appraisal from. So if things were actually that dire, they wouldn't be tossing their shitty securities to the FED knowing they'd have to take them back in a day, yknow?

Because the bond yeild curve reversed recently, meaning selling their investments is a bad idea right now. They're holding their assets in a downswing, and they can still leverage the value of those assets to take out a loan.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:59:48
I completely agree that they're holding the financial system hostage.
If the FED doesn't make the loans then the short term lending rates go up, which is currently against FED policy. Last night they went up to nearly 10% (the FED's stated goal is 1.75-2%) and would have likely continued to go up had the FED not stepped in. This is because if some banks don't have liquidity, bigger banks can charge whatever interest they want, since they're the only other players at the table. They have total control.
Also, thanks for that link about the FED owning a ton of MBS. Makes me wonder just how secure the value of the dollar really is, since it seems like every way you look at it it's already stagnant and on the verge of slumping. One small push could send it tumbling down.
Edit: Also the FED did say no a little bit, ~$80b was requested for loans and only $75b was approved
@_date: 2019-09-22 05:10:34
Any number of reasons, but generally so they can meet short-term obligations. Whether their credit rating falls, they experiences sudden unexpected cash outflows, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid trading with or lending to the banks. It doesn't mean they're insolvent, it just means they're in an unhealthy market trying to weather the storm without outright selling their assets.
If the money was just going into circulation, they wouldn't be able to pay it back basically immediately, like they have been. The previous deals shored up at the end of business the following day, and the deal they have now is for the next two weeks, at which point the loans will be paid back in full, plus interest. It's not adding money to the supply, it's adding debt to the banks, leveraged by their assets (treasury and mortgage securities)

@_date: 2019-09-19 11:23:08
Actually I just read up on the deals, it was largely treasury and mortgage backed collateral. There's no risk of substantial losses because the banks control the value of the mortgage securities and the FED controls the value of treasury securities.
It's still barely a band aid on a ridiculously unhealthy market, though. There are huge systemic problems that need to be worked out, instead dof just providing liquidity whenever it's needed.
