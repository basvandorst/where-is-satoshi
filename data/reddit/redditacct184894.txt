when you short sell an asset, you incur that asset as a liability.
if you have 450 btc then open up a 450 btc short position you DID just “give up” your 450 btc. you own ZERO btc, until you buy them back (cover).
if you want to “capitalize on pullbacks”, this is STRICTLY worse than selling your 450 bitcoin straight out (say, for $10 each) then buying them back when the price goes down.
how do you not understand this? sucks what happened to you, but you honestly do deserve it for being so stupid and ignoring what the bitfinex support person originally told you. smh
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:21:43
you do understand that when you have 450 coins in your account but are simultaneously short 450 coins, you dont actually own 450 coins right? you own 0. which is coincidentally (woah, shocker i know) the exact same number of coins you would own if you straight out sold 450 coins.
math!! amazing!!
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:38:49
what you are describing and thinking is happening is not how trading on bitfinex works, lmao, and not how shorting has ever worked on any cryptocurrency exchange to-date for that matter. im not going to bother wasting my time trying to explain, bc even when you realize that you are wrong, you wont admit it, and probably will delete your reddit account and/or delete all your comments.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:43:58
you’re an idiot. your “hedging strategy” is just strictly worse than selling into usd. there is NO possible price movement where you end up ahead.
you are literally in the exact same spot as if you sell into usd at all times, except because you are holding an active position too, like a complete moron, you are paying .1% a day or whatever the margin funding fee is. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:56:54
you are just wrong and extremely dumb to boot. its not perfect for anything, except if you are extremely dumb and like paying strictly more margin fees for no reason. there is LITERALLY no scenario where doing what OP did provides any value to anyone except the person who is collecting your interest fees. its not “hedging”, its not “good strategy”, its just being retarded paying money when you dont have to.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:18:02
LARPer alert
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:50:38
hahaha hows that going for you?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:38:44
im really worried about your sanity, the future of bitcoin is looking pretty grim when people like you start investing
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:25:26
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:05:42
youre dumb
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:25:09
tell that to those who bought up btc price, they would disagree w u
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:36:50
yep, magical fairyland! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:17:24
of course they can, and its why bitcoin is going to get crushed. all these savants on here blabbering about a new world order... have no clue. broke now and will be broke in 1 year because they wont sell
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:29:30
its amazing how many people talk about this. bitcoin “debit cards” and “paper currency backed by bitcoin” if anything just proves exactly why bitcoin will never be used as a real currency- because in the end, its inconvenient, and deny it all you want and cry about the banks being evil, but you will never truly cast them aside bc of the convenience they offer.
fwiw: bitcoin debit cards and bitcoin paper money are both concepts that are literally impossible, and defeat the entire purpose.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:59:24
the value of btc right now is based solely on the fact that buyers think they will be able to sell it to someone else for more later on down the line
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:01:21
this gets dumber every time i hear it
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:30:04
and you are dumber than a brick wall
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:07:35
hi redditor for 3 months!
see what i did there? i didnt make a point. amazing.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:24:39
not really.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:32:31
its shown how delusional this sub has gotten when people are talking about “what would you do when you win the lottery by investing in btc now?”
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:37:00
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:34:21


loooooooooooOOOOOOOOlllllLLLLLLL, oh boy you are are in for a big surprise
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:17:24
uh wow, someone has been drinking way too much koolaid. hundreds of billions a day... lmao. keep buying btc bud!
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:02:25
youre dumb. if you bought when you said you did, youve still lost money, just slightly less than when i made my comment (4 hours before you necrod this)
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:30:37


k then youre either a liar or a halfwit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:51:01
hows that buying goin for you?
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:10:48
so massive jumps are business as usual, but massive drops could/would/should never happen? it was &lt;6k less than 5 days ago, get a grip buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:54:59
dont feed the troll guys
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:15:19
thanks for confirming the sell signal- dumbest of all dumb has finally invested in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:22:47
uhhh, because it should be going down? it should never have jumped in the first place. segwit coins were priced into btc, now they arent. derp
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:20:49
so i just make a comment about creating different accounts for every sub bc privacy, and you think im going to tell you how old i am? lmao
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:44:05
oh thats good to hear, because you’ve given zero indication of that so far. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:16:00


oh my god does it get any dumber than this? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:50:52
oh boy, the delusion has taken full hold. doesnt look curable at this point
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:06:10
did you complete high school? honest q.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:17:46
probably not good for bitcoins price...
“With the availability of futures contracts, it will be easier to sell bitcoin short”
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:57:17
what happens if it dips 300-600 and all of a sudden the retards who sold house + maxed out line of credit and maxed margin to go long start getting liquidated automatically by margin calls?
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:08:21
if i made 1,000 accounts last year, for the purposes of being able to use a new account for every subreddit so as to protect my privacy, do my comments become more credible?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:35:18
uhhhhh, maybe because people wanted to buy btc at any price premium just to get their money out quicker. derp, not defying anything, just your stupidity
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:04:15
right, because the people throwing out numbers like 7k, 10k, 25k, 100k+... those guys arent just throwing out random numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:27:14
futures markets != institutional money flowing in. it pains me how retarded you are
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:25:13
wow dumbest thing ive read in a while, and thats saying a lot considering all the shit that gets posted on this sub
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:13:40
you dont, because he’s right and youre wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:19:49


hmm, you must literally never trade on their platform then
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:30:12
yes, because you can lose 30,000 USD by forgetting a pin. *eyeroll*
why so much stupid in this sub?
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:32:21
you can disagree all you want, doesnt make you any less wrong
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:34:24


pyramid/ponzi much?
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:11:32
because a) derivatives doesnt even close to mean “money flowing into” the underlying. and you saying “not everyone on earth will ever be able to own 1 btc” as if to imply that makes bitcoin valuable, is like me taking a shit in a toilet and saying “it isnt possible for everyone in my country to own one ounce of this!!”
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:12:50
congrats on losing all your money!
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:36:05
my thoughts are youre a fucking insane delusional lunatic
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:11:23
do you even know what reserve currency means?
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:58:36
of course it is. but expect to get downvoted if you post anything rational in here
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:39:39
wrong, its in you. you cant lose your life savings in the real world banking system because you forget a pin or because your computer gets hacked. you were making fun of the article for making that point as if it were an incorrect one, which it isnt.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:14:20
is that how you justify you pathetic non-educated existence? sad
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:39:15
you are feeding the troll. stop it
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:37:09
“if bob sells to 1000 of his friends, and each of those thousand sell to another thousand...”
good job. youre describing a pyramid scheme and you dont even realize it
