Well I can understand that. There's just always such negative things said any any crypto in here that isn't BTC, but talking about ripple I can understand that at least.

Yeah, but I'm pretty sure hating alt coins isn't a requirement of this sub tho? I enjoy Bitcoin as much as the next guy but I'm also a lover of crypto currency and decentralized currency in general. I thought there would be more like me in this sub, it's just interesting to see that's all.

I edited the main post to include that the actual *purchase* was done on the 27th of May, approximately 8 days ago, shouldn't really take 8 days should it? Maybe just high traffic?

People would uh, need to use it and stop looking at it as an investment and more as a currency. You know... Like what it was invented for in the first place.

Really? Care to provide references for that statistic? 
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:05:28
Aw man okay this makes me feel a little better, so you think it'll clear eventually?
