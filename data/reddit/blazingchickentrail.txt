Are you reading what I am writing? I have never supported any kind of political view in my conversation with you. I corrected you on your definition of communism and you don’t seem to be participating in that argument anymore. Why do you think that your time is well spent writing that diatribe against an enemy of your own making? Please stop spitting poison.

How can you have a free market without a profit motive? That’s like having rain without water isn’t it?

Letting off some steam? Don't insult people for projecting their views in a civil manner. Communism is a STATELESS, classless society by the way. So communism by definition would have to exist without a government.

You are jumping the gun here. You have no idea whether I am a communist or a fascist or a believer in the flying spaghetti monster. I was merely correcting you on your definition of communism. Show me where it says that Communism requires those 10 planks.

Yes, that’s a wiki page. Well done. Please show me where it says that Communism requires the 10 planks. If you want to use wikipedia as a source, the opening paragraph on the page for “Communism” states that communism is a “socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.”

The ten planks of the communist manifesto are a means to an end, the end being communism. The ten planks do not define a communist society at all, but the means with which it can be achieved.

I am a libertarian socialist but this idea of mutualism looks really interesting. I do have a question though. If each person acts as an individual with their labour, how are we supposed to work together to accomplish more complex tasks?
