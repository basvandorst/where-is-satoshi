Demand has to be higher than supply for the prices to rise. Demand ran out around 19400 at the very top. We know this, because prices turned down from there, supply (selling) overtook demand. Higher prices attract supply, lower prices attract demand. The market is looking for the demand now, it will go as low as it has to, until it finds it. It can be at 9000, 7000, 5000, 3256, 2345, or 1500, 500 or whatever price, no one knows. It might not find it ever, maybe just at very very low prices. Nobody knows.

The procedure he explains is the usual process of a campaign from market professionals. Happens everywhere, everytime on different scales.
But even if professionals are covering their short positions right now around 10 000 (could be, but I think it will happen lower), it doesn't guarantee, that they will start marking up the price again. They might just leave the market and price will pretty much stay at the level, where it is abandoned 
(or since it is not supported by professionals, it drifts downward slowly, to be more precise)
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:41:14
Agreed, decreasing volume on the upswing means no demand at these levels, a downswing is coming.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:15:11
- People who bought below the current price, and rather take the profits they have left, before it falls further
- People who bought above, and minimising losses
- People who are shorting the market anticipating lower prices

Every time there was a big selloff in bitcoin, on the same day there was large selling in the US indices. Bitcoin is used as a distraction
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:10:56
You probably have zero idea how much money they trade with, or the way they trade. But surely you are better than them ;)
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:10:17
This is just a correction in the downtrend. It will go way below the February low

I'm a transsexual midget and I find this offensive
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:01:32
Do you use any kind of stop loss, or you just let it run against you if you are wrong on the direction? If the second you were just lucky, and 1 really bad trade, which doesn't recover, is going to zero all you gains sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:17
There needs to be a simple enemy to blame for the losses, because understanding the markets is more difficult than pointing fingers
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:50:55
With logarithmic price scale you see what you want to see, not what the actual situation is. I understand it is easier to look at this, than the normal price chart with a huge drop, but you are only fooling yourself with this.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:07:56
It is just trying to find its true value. Too high at $10k

Nobody will be able to tell this, because it is not a fixed amount. It can change from a relatively "small" amount, to huge amounts, depending on the liquidity of the market.
On a sidenote, HODLing is actually helps the whales to manipulate the price, because HODLing reduces the floating supply (more BTC locked up in HODLer hands), thus reduces liquidity, meaning whales need less BTC to push price around.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:33:44
Not true, price behaves differently prior a dip and prior a selloff
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:03:55
The downtrend continues
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:55:48
How do you know this is the bottom? If it goes to 5000, selling at 9000 doesnt look too bad
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:00:11
So you see the future, okay
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:14:34
Bitcoin is amazing for the loud 1% who made money with it. Not so amazing for the rest who lost/losing money
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:39:35
This is what also fuels the downmove. Here people might say they HODL their lambos to the moon, but elsewhere overall a lot of people who kept buying during the downmove realise they fucked up, and their selling is putting more pressuse from above.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:26:30
When it crashes below $2000 I'm sure it won't take long to buy the rest.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:52:05
Whatever method you use, you'll need 2-3 years of practice, before succeeding. Just saying. Because you'll probably get some magic methods telling you you can learn it in 3 days/1 week.
Also always use a stop loss. Many many people will tell you here and everywhere else, that you don't need it. Bullshit
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:33:18
Bitcoin is going to plummet this week
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:23:36
The hype changed. First everybody was hyped up, now everybody is sobering up
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:33:58
Not really.
If 1 person buys 10000 bitcoins and 9999 people sell 1 bitcoin, price still moves up, even if there are more people selling.
What matters is how much BTC is put out by buyers and sellers all together.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:42:00
You can't foresee the drop, but you don't buy into a downmove either. You see the drop, and watch for the reaction, if it is in a hurry on nice volume you buy, if it is sloppy on low volume, you let it go. Or short.
Can't explain it more simple. If you don't understand it and think it is still in hindsight, don't trade, just hodl lambos to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:27:21
Holding short positions, that is

America and freedom in the same sentence, okay. Indirectly you guys are the most enslaved people
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:51:05
Slowly stabilise somewhere at a lower level (no idea where, I'd say around the level where it started, 1500-2000$, but no one sees the future), then just goes to sleep for a couple more years again.

Somebody short-covering is buying as well

Here is how much you should invest: $0
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:53:15
Bitcoin goes to $0 -&gt; it's a dip bro, just a correction
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:15:21
Make that 1500-2000$
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:14:16
Next stop, $3000
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:55:15
It is very close to turning down though
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:08:00
Now some hacker will read this and steal your bitcoins :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:30:23
If everybody is making money with Bitcoin, who is losing? Looking at the longer term chart it is obvious a lot of people have bought above the current price and selling currently. Strangely they are very quiet, and the losses likely won't be talked about.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:06:55
Possible, but there is no trader in the world who can see the future. Lines on a chart mean nothing. The price gets decided moment by moment
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:45:55
Those who come to the market without knowing how it works, will lose their money on the long term, 100%. This is no charity.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:33:42
No, it is not a good point.
1. They manage so much money, their positions move the market. It is very hard for them to move in or out of the market, unlike individuals, who can buy or sell anytime, anything. This puts them at a serious disadvantage.
2. They risk a very very small amount (0.1% or even lower) of the hundreds of millions, or billions, or whatever amount of dollars they have, per trade. Put in this perspective that 5-10% of return they made just this month. Also calculate how much is 5% return on a billion dollars in one month.
3. They hedge, meaning they spread out over several assets, to minimise risk. Simply going long or short and waiting (like buying BTC and hodling) is called naked trading (naked meaning you didn't hedge your position against one or several assets). You do this once in the professional environment, and you get fired on the spot.

I dont trade cryptos, I'm with currency futures.
Thanks mate
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:49:56
When the downmove is a dip, price quickly rallies and recovers the dip -&gt; dip is getting bought up by strong demand
When it is a selloff, price just stays around that level, and grinds sideways -&gt; demand is not getting stimulated by lower prices
So now, it grinds afer every selloff, followed by more selloff
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:55:08
I'm saying maybe not noobs panic selling, but almost nobody buys, and normal levels of selling is pushing down the price
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:13:17
Since I brainwashed myself that Bitcoin actually worth a million dollars, everything seems like a good buy
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:12:27
Watch and learn mate
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:23:26
The very last thing the people will do is realise they might be wrong about Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:58:01
Like it didn't happen similarly before, when strangers hyped up the crowd to buy
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:03:55
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:37:23
Because they don't want to face even the possiblity that btc is not a world changing thing, just some extremely speculative asset.
Traders buy, and sell, they don't give a shit about the instrument they trade. Those who invested emotionally into the whole bitcoin story want to defend their investment, that bitcoin is holy and selling it is stupid. Even if it seemed like, that was the good idea.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:58:56
They HODL the bag
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:43:25
Next time don't use logaritmic chart, because this is biased towards what you want to see compared to what reality is
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:49:22
This euphoria scares me. Usually this is the time, when it starts to turn downwards

In my country after a cop identifies himself, you do what the fuck he says you to do. Why does he have to pull this "I'm a poor black man, cops are always harassing me" bullshit?

Can you spend Bitcoin on English lessons?
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:33:37
Yeah, it's a good question *jumps on the chair
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:06:29
Maybe it is not valid to every HODLer, but in those what I read, they had a target in mind, if what is reached, they fully cash out. So not just buy food and spend small BTC like so.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:39:38
You are right, I think I need to 'grow up'
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:36:45
He wants to sell at 7k, why is it illegal?
He'll keep feeding the market, until all buyers are satisfied, then the market collapses with supply being greater than demand, enabling him to profit, while hodlers sink deeper into losses
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:46:12
It's called short covering
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:39:26
What? I thought there are only winners with Bitcoin. Or at least always they post about it
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:21:45
This rise in price just a technical rally following the previous drop, not a real demand. The low and declining volume is the clue for that
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:31:42
Just like 12k, 11k, 10k, 9k, and 8k was

How much money do you have invested in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:40:23
Like the bulls down from 19400 to 5900.
"this is the bottom", "no, this is the bottom", "no, this is it"
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:45:34
As another trader, I agree with you, but it is careless to ask from the average person to try to trade the market. Personally that took me 2,5 years of constant, hard practicing to be able to execute it. Active trading will only make them lose faster.

"Everything is worth as much as you can sell it for"
If you can sell your coin for a 1000$, it worth just that. If for 100$, then 100$. If 0$ then 0$
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:52:51
Me too. I also can't read a chart
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:47:43
Prices can fall because of more selling than buying, or less buying than selling. Meaning there might be no more selling than before, but there is just zero demand for bitcoin. 
We'll never know, but if supply is contant and demand decreases, prices fall the same way, as if supply increases and demand stays the same.

Strong hands are shorting this market. Strong hands doesn't mean to hodl everything blindly. Strong hands mean they can read the chart and see this is a bear market
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:45:39
People here can't make the difference between a dip and a selloff.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:35:41
Because no demand left to come in at the good news
