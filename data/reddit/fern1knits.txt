You're either being intentionally deceptive or you're completely ignorant about how the crypto market works.
I assume you're intentionally lying in effort to shill for cheaper coins.


The thriving/growing illegal transaction market speaks for itself and proves this point wrong.


Many posters here know from experience that this is wrong.  The OTC market has enough depth to easily absorb 10k blocks of BTC.
Even if you market-sell 10k BTC on exchanges right now, it would drop the price less than 10% before bots and arbitrage from the OTC market quickly rebuilds the orderbook.

Good point.  Free speech is also illegal in countries like China.  
Bitcoin can be used to anonymously rent VPN, web servers, virtual phones in order to speak freely anyways.

Two old guys who worked for the World Bank, IMF, and Federal Reserve undervalue technology that takes power away from those institutions.
Shocking revelation
