When I explain bitcoin I tell everyone that this is the revolution that we have all being waiting for. No one wants a violent revolution most are too scared of the “dark unknown.” But introduce some code and now we can fight without bloodshed. Pick up your bitcoins and fight for your freedom! 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:34:58
I find it hard to believe you had 22 btc without a hardware wallet. Usually people with that amount of bitcoins would have heard of a hardware wallet and stored it there. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:28:05
Welcome bro yeah try a place that doesn’t to kyc like hodlhodl be careful with tumbler services some may be scams. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:29:19
Why would I buy a token when I can buy bitcoin smh ��‍♂️.
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:32:07
Everyone needs a slap twice in a while. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:33:59
Or Trezor. I still doubt that he had 22 btc. Usually people with that amount of bitcoins would have heard of a hardware wallet and stored it there. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:34:51
I mean that would be hard set up since all electronics need electricity. Bitcoin can be sent not just through internet but also via phone text or other wave means. I mean if there is no electricity then other more pressing issues would be involved. But as we saw with Tangem paper bitcoins can be used by people and even denominated paper wallets themselves can be exchanged. So there is always a solution if bitcoin is really needed. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:30:00
Also now that you have a node look into setting up an LN node.

If they are staying in fiat then it doesn’t solve anything. however, if they move to bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:47:28
No obviously not 
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:04:15
They do kYC and monitor transactions. But it’s cool at already they are getting the word out. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:27:08

@_date: 2018-08-24 02:02:43
1st figure out how much money you put in and calculate what it would be worth in bitcoin has to held it from that today and then see if it beats the 111 the gave you. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:57:35
Good one haha
@_date: 2018-08-13 01:06:09
Let’s say 90 % of miners today shut off their miners. The system is made such that the difficulty of solving problems (mining bitcoin or verifying, transactions ) will change and become very easy to the point that I and whoever else wants to get rewarded will be able to use a simple laptop (cpu) to mine and verify all the transactions. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:20:27

Of course they own bitcoin. And just like other countries they may have to disclose the amounts they own. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:51:17
Yes people that are technical and willing to learn will be able to own their own bitcoin and use it directly however do you really think everyone will be able to come to this level? Yes it’s a pretty world to think that everyone would want to learn etc but it’s not going to happen some people will rely on centralized figures so that they can have time to watch Kim kardashian’s new episode etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:57:16
Yeah I got an android just to use my samourai wallet and eclair for LN. the apple store is too centralized to allow quick innovation. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 17:22:57
1. Try to get into this because you believe in the revolution, not just charts. 
2. Yes now is still a good time to get in but please focus on the ideology so that in the future you can make better decisions. 
3. In terms of buying bitcoin, it would be best to find a friend that can sell you maybe at a college or meet up group idk. But if you don’t care about giving up your privacy an exchange would be good such as Bitfinex,  Localbitcoins which is half private, hodlhodl, a bitcoin atm (at a bad price), Square app etc.  
4. Whatever you do just make sure you eventually send your coins to a hard wallet or to a private wallet, samourai (android), mycelium etc, 
5. Whatever you do please watch Andreas Antonopoulos videos so that you understand that this is a revolution, that happens to be a good investment. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:38:19
Segwit has almost reached 50% pretty sure they won’t get that high again. Plus let’s hope the guy that was spamming retired. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:49:41
Dude just hodl you never go wrong holding bitcoin other coins ehh. Now it’s way below 17k you can lower your entry average point by selling your fiat. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:15:48
Yeah I heard about that haha. I wonder if it’s because they are getting pressured by bigger forces? You never know. At those levels things start getting scary. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:12:58
I know right like if someone really needs to buy more bitcoin they should just get a 3rd job and sacrifice their life for 2 years before the halving in 2020 it will be worth it. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:25:36
What wallet? Stick to segwit enabled wallets like samourai.
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:58:44
Bitcoin maximalist here and basically Andreas Antonopoulos is my hero. Truly decentralized brings true freedom. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:40:45
The point is to never cash out dude lul. Bitcoin is the new form of currency owned and controlled by the whole world not just one centralized entity. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:52:55

@_date: 2018-05-27 23:41:57
One would think that since its being here for a long time that they would appreciate the tech better and be among the first to implement segwit guess not. lol
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:26:22
I suggest you buy an android so that you can use Samourai Wallet and eclair for LN. But you don’t even need a phone plan dude just use the Wifi or other phone’s hotspot lol. But yeah just use a hardware wallet or an app on your phone, it will be way better than just leaving your funds on the exchange. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:42:32
HODL OR use it nothing can be done.

Depends on what country you are in bithumb users see their bitcoin in Korean won value. It’s just a perspective. Koreans have their own “coinmarketcap” website, for example, as do other countries. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:26:34
Or Trezor. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:55:38
Also have you used Eclair, (on android)? There are a couple of websites that allow you use LN right now like moneni. If you want to experience opening a channel and sending pennies or less. Of course this won’t be the way LN is done in the future but at least you get to see it working live. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:05:31

So in the ratified article it doesnt specify but like u/chocolatesouffle3 said I am guessing its for those who one accounts at institutions with KYC/AML which would make sense and not wallets since it would not make sense to make a bill for wallets.

Lolo Lolo lol �� 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:29:35

Samurai is great and they have being in the space for a long time. They were among the first to activated segwit. And now they are on android. Great company that is here to provide services to the space. Unlike most of the other money grabbing companies. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:23:35
Lol yeah exactly. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:41:24
There will obviously be competition (banks) but none will compare to the decentralized and secure nature of bitcoin. Bitcoin was born at the right time with the right people. How many people can find trillions on a table and just give it away to the world and have no desire to even take credit? Even Vitallik premined a large sum and came out publicly for the fame. How many ICOs did not have insta mined or premined or insider preICO access?

Dude:  1. Whales Don’t need to make friends with krill. They eat krill for a living. 2. They don’t need money so most whales actually provide services for the better of the community instead of charging a big amount for entry to some exclusive sausage club. This is just typical dealer tactics. Sell something at a high price people will think oh it’s expensive it must be good and empty their pockets. ��‍♂️.

Use a segwit enabled wallet like samurai wallet for your android. But put most of it in a Trezor or other hardware wallet. Trezor is open source so I personally prefer it. As to where to get them. Well depends on if you want to give up your privacy if you don’t care then which ever top exchange in the country you are from Or buy from another person using Localbitcoins or HODLHODL or a friend. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:18:44

Tell them samourai wallet is great bc it has segwit enabled (cheaper txs) and soon lightning network. Also you can always lend your bitcoins on exchanges like Bitfinex which would bring a constant income way better than any bank.
