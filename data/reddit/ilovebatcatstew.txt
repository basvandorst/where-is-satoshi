Honestly, you can own as many guns as you want. The point is that they dont give you the right to defend yourself anymore.... If the goverment wanted you dead, do you think they would bother sending people, or just a drone?
I mean, argue for gun ownership freedom, sure. But it isn't going to be the thing that protects you from the government.
My problem with america is legal slavery, \(Your prisons allow it in for profit prisons\) Corruption of a judicial system allowing mass incarcerations \(good example: [
health care that will put you in debt for life, \(My friend is diabetic for example. She cant even VISIT america, because insulin is so expensive, here, its 13 bucks a script, there, she pays 20k a month for it\). net neutrality, and so on.
America being "the land of the free" is a total myth. It's been one of the most heavily oppressed western nations for quite a while now.
And the late stage capitalistic banks and government are the main issues.

Yes. 100%.
Because the market cap of bitcoin is lower, it has a higher PERCENTAGE of manipulation, but the actual amount of money being used to manipulate is many multitudes greater in usd.
As the market cap of bitcoin grows, the manipulation as a ratio to "good" money will drop.
Don't strawman, and twist words when you haven't understood the point.

Bingo. If he massively shorted it, and crashed it to 200$ for example, I would be buying as much as I can. Because when he closed that short, it would jump right back up. Sure, It might lose 50&amp; of its cap after the jump, but you could still make a killing off of a long post a massive short.

if they purchase fed coin it still has value to the fed, right? Pay your taxes with it. Once you run out, stop giving a shit about it and stop accepting it.If the government still values it \(and it will have to to attempt to keep it running\) the government can be your bag holder.
\(at least for a period of time before it becomes truely worthless.\)

Bingo. But it's also at a FAR lower ratio to that of bitcoins ratio of manipulation to "good" money.
As market cap increases, we will see a larger amount of bitcoin used to manipulate, but a lower overall ratio of the supply of bitcoin being used for it. Combine this with a deflationary currency, and the rate at which someone can risk the currency TO manipulate, is drastically altered.
Effectively: Adoption will resolve the issue of what RATIO of bitcoin is being used to manipulate, as it will require FAR more money to manipulate it. Which is the original point I was making.

You do realise bitcoin is social\-democratic setting in the sense of how currencies go? Socialism in its removal of power from large incumbent banks and goverments. Democratic in that miners and nodes have access to stake thier mining power and notes to signal and vote for support for changes or forks.
The network itself has huge amounts of social idealism built into it, however it's designed to work as a capitalist function.
Probably why it works so well: it takes the best pieces from both.
You clearly don't understand what a social democracy is. \(It looks a lot like norway, australia \(Aus is slightly less of a social\-democracy however\) and a lot of European countries\).
America however, is closer to an oligarchy: Incumbent power holds the power, does whatever they want, and has democracy at the higher levels of government, but the lowest on the chain have very poor access to democratic process.

Bingo.If it's progress to have people die when they can't afford medicine, it's not a progress I'm particularly interested in.
Balance is ALWAYS key, and an evangelical or extreme in any political structure or monetary policy is nearly always wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:35:00
Sure. But extreme capitalism is selling peoples bodies as well... which is also slavery? Extreme ANYTHING forced on a population is slavery. It doesn't mean that all slavery is communism. Slavery is slavery, but it doesn't dictate whether a society is capitalistic.
America had huge amounts of slaves. It's never been a communist country.

It can't SOLVE the problem. But it can prevent it. You can't hyper inflate a currency with limited supply: Ie, bitcoin. Has limited supply. Now that the cat's out of the bag though, there is no "Solve". There is "Watch hundreds suffer and die" but no "Solve". 
A good economic policy is meant to prevent this shit, not resolve it. Because its a hell of a lot harder to fix, than it is to simply prevent.

Wow. What an incredible burn... and what an idiot to not even realise the extent their own company is using it, but to just bad mouth it.Seems a bit of a career limiting move.
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:07:35
I'm absolutely POSITIVE that you could sell a freshly harvested baby brain for way more than a bitcoin.

Physical goods. A can of beans has more "intrinsic value" Than bitcoin, the usd, any currency in the world, or any stock market. It's ALWAYS worth something, and doesn't need 'faith' to remain worth something.
That said, that doesn't mean it's BETTER to own a can of beans than a dollar, or a bitcoin, it's just pointing out the irrelevancy and stupidity in the argument of "Intrinsic worth"
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:29:22
Fiat is definitely not communist, as nearly every nation in the world uses fiat and a central bank. It's not a great idea, but it isn't "communist" and to suggest as such isn't just silly, but deeply uneducated.
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:04:50
Nope! Because you cant buy the food EITHER due to it's price. You sell a chicken for 100k when bread is worth 20k, and two months later a chicken is worth 300k, and bread is worth 60k. 
Due to hyper inflation, any thing you sell, is more expensive in the next few months, meaning the money you sold it for is increasingly worthless.
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:57:48
exactly this.
I just created one as a joke/play with technology 4 or 5 weeks ago. If I ever bothered to release a proper wallet, any bitcoin user could claim their \(as of yet, unnamed\) coins. You wont be able to send them anywhere as I'm mining it on a single computer however. So yeah, there is no stated accurate number, because It's impossible to know how many forks are produced at any given time.... because they aren't bitcoin.
This is basically the BCH problem: Which fork is valid? Well.... the one with most acceptance. Which coin has acceptance? BTC. So it's bitcoin. Whatever you want to designate the other fork as is irrelevant: without the highest adoption, it's not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:51:06
It's pointing out WHY they are shitcoins. Stop being dumb.
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:20:07
Will someone be offended? Yes. 
Are people already offended by bitcoin? Yes \(Baby brains? Really?\)
Some really really religious muppet will certainly find this offensive... but what DON'T they find offensive? 
Offense is a meaningless thing, unless you are being a real dick and actually harm them physically or mentally, or use offence as a means to insult someone.
This does none of the above.
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:59:43
Consider however:
Manipulation is only possible due to large single holders. As more buy in, manipulators will slowly cash out, having made a fortune \(fine, thats part of the market\) and it will become increasingly difficult to manipulate the more is owned in general.
We are still NOWHERE near mass adoption. Of course there is some degree of manipulation, there is in every single money supply.
\(And laughing my ass off at your worry about a currency being dependable if it can be manipulated.... Look at the american dollar, Venezuelan, whatever. You dont think those are manipulated? Of course they are, and in much larger extremes than bitcoin. The only difference is that with its current \(comparitivly to global financial market\) low market cap on bitcoin, it's slightly more prone to it at the moment. It wont be forever.\)

Well according to [ it will equal NEGATIVE 20k in august this year. SELL YOUR BITCOIN NOW GUYS, OTHERWISE YOU WILL NEED TO PAY PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM OFF YOU!

That is a surprisingly good representation, in that I knew exactly what you meant with a single forward slash.
