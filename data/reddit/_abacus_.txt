Greece requires better politics, technology has nothing to offer at this crucial stage

It works in my browser. Does it not open in yours?

Greeks hardly use credit cards and are generally hesitant with any new technological financial instrument. How will they be able to use a -much more complicated- cryptocurrency? This would be science fiction

Even 1% chance for collision may be too much to create problems

so what

still the current search volume is not larger than that in the 2014 spike

As it is impossible to make payments/transfers abroad, Greeks do not have access to bitcoin. Moreover 99.9% of the citizens does not have any idea about what this is. So the statement in this article has nothing to do with reality.

so bitcoin=battery? wtf?

Greek people are generally not aware of bitcoin. Moreover greeks are not generally comfortable with new technologies (credit/debit card use has always been quite low compared to other parts of the world). Having said that, bitcoin will not play any role in the near future economic turbulence.

On the other hand, despite how easy it is to make a bitcoin transaction from egypt to anywhere in the world, it would still be hard for your egyptian client to get bitcoin in order to send it to you.

Wouldn't this explode the blockchain size?

This is an interesting scenario. A government could perhaps also keep the fiat-cryptocoin rate stable. Of course in that case the crypto-currency becomes centralized in terms of price in relation to fiat. Still one would keep the other benefits of quick transactions around the world without the requirement for intermediaries like banks .

an interesting question...

I guess it is one of the addresses that seem to be owned by satoshi nakamoto

this statement is not justified by the rest of the article

I am sure I have seen this webpage more than a week ago, it is not new

I think the most important aspect of bitcoin which explains everything in a few words is that it allows fully trusted transactions between any two parties around the world without any third party intermediaries (incl. banks). 
How to use unfortunately still is complicated to explain...
