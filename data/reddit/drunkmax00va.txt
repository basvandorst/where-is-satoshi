you probably should be looking for "wallet.dat" file or eventually "multibit.wallet" not sure if this file is named exactly like that

I hope you didn't steal it thinking it's a wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:40:10
Probably you have right
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:21:06
BCH have same looking addresses as BTC, so when you are looking on explorers that support more crypto than only BTC and not specifying you want BTC, it shows you both BTC and BCH.
If the new address you created shows 0 Balance and also 0 transactions on BCH blockchain then you are OK.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:34:32
I made these tests using other tool, not vanitygen (sorry I should mention that, I also edited my post).
So I don't know it vanitygen is generating both types of addresses or only uncompressed

@_date: 2019-07-18 14:14:00
I wonder how this script works, does it generate both compressed and uncompressed addresses?
Is there more chance to find 30 character address as compressed or uncompressed? Or the chances are equal?
I made some tests with other tool by generating 33 long addresses and the amount of generated compressed addresses is similar to amount of uncompressed addresses, so I think the chances for finding 30 long may be equal for both types of addresses

@_date: 2019-07-24 17:10:05
yes it will be useless if the wallet.dat file is encrypted, but there is a chance that the owner did not encrypt the wallet. Each wallet.dat contains a magic number which can be identified, probably there are also other bytes which could identify the wallet.
You would need to decrypt the wallet (if encrypted) to spend BTC, but for checking the addresses and the balance you don't need to decrypt the wallet
Also there is a chance to brute force the encrypted wallet if the owner choose weak password

QR codes can differ with same message encoded because there are multiple QR code versions. Total number of it is 40 but for address is used something between version 2-6 (not sure exactly). Also each of those version can use different mask. There are 8 different masks if I remember correct, then there are 4 different error correction levels and also different encode modes but for bitcoin addresses I think only 1 is used (byte mode). Each of those produce different QR code
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:36:31
That was all fake. The 310 BTC solution has never be published (because there is none) and the "unsolved" 0.31 BTC is a great excuse not to publish the 310 solution

Thanks for answer. Maybe you have right about the security, but I was thinking about situation like this - Lets say I made a terrible mistake and put my seed somewhere online like twitter (lets assume I wanted to copy other text but CTRL + C has not worked this time and instead I pasted my seed :) ).
Now I probably have better chances when I was used a custom derivation path, because the most thieves will use the standard derivation path  I guess. So I could have more time to move all my coins.

Those are coins that have cloned Bitcoin blockchain at some point in time and made some modifications, then after this point they are completely independent from Bitcoin.
If you was having Bitcoin on your wallet (not exchange) before the time those fork happened (most of them happened in late 2017), then you have also other coins like BCH, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, Clams and other shit coins which can you claim using the same private key as for your Bitcoin, but it is not recommendet to claim them before moving your Bitcoin to completely new wallet.

Yes why not? You can generate a seed or paper wallet for someone else and then send btc to the right address.
If you choose to use paper wallet, use the offline version of 
but paper wallets are obsolete now and you can easily loose all btc on it if you use use it wrong. So maybe better is to use some wallet like  there generate the seed and send btc to the newly generated address. The seed then is all you need to have to access btc.

You probably already know abut Bitcoin forks, but just in case you may have also access to 2000 bitcoin cash to dump.
I don't know how you saved the passwords for those 3 addresses, if it was on paper or on keyboard. My ideas would be to try to replace similar looking characters by others like B to 8 or for example character g to t,y,h,b,v,c,f (position on keyboard).
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:49:31
Thank you for you answer, I appreciate it, that's a great answer! Right now I'm testing to parse bitcoin cash blockchain and as I see it takes much longer than the other smaller blockchains that I have tested. At the moment it runs \~2 days and I'm only at block 180 000 of \~579 000. It will take years to get there. I'm using sqlite DB for storing the transactions and balances. I tried to optimize the database best I could, but I believe it can still be better.

Probably it would be worth to get every usb, cd, hdd you got 10 years ago (I know how it sounds), maybe you have exported your private keys or wallet somewhere and copied it to other device (I assume you don't remember). If you have formated those devices and copied other data, then the priv keys could still be there if it was not overwritten with other data.
Also check your old mails, old secret paper documents and old messages of any communicator you used

how to read these keys?

bad bad bot

How can it be safe when they store priv keys in logs?
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:34:36
it looks very cool but I still don't get how it works. How could I affix the holograms to my printed keys and also affix them to this metal card? Sorry for me being so dumb
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:44:32
so that's the analog representation of the Super Bitcoin (SBTC)

@_date: 2019-01-19 00:43:49
it is not really inf because all possible private keys are no more than 2^256, right?
@_date: 2019-01-18 23:51:36
ok but then how electrum generates different addresses? I though that one address has one private key, isn't that?
@_date: 2019-01-19 01:01:15
I'm just fascinated by bitcoin and want to know everything about it and how it works
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:19:36
hmm so everything I knew about bitcoin was totally wrong, thanks, I have to read some solid book about bitcoin
yes that would I ask, but when from one seed we can spawn almost infinite addresses, then is there a chance that with other seed/private key can be spawned at least one same addres as with the first seed?
@_date: 2019-01-22 22:09:01
Thank you, good answer ��
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:39:10
Thanks, you know if there is some online tool that could I use to generate WIF from integers? I'm looking for some to verify coreectness of my tool
@_date: 2019-01-19 13:43:48
and that's exactly what I wish to know, so there is a chance but the probability for this to happen is almost 0%
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:54:27
That's it! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-19 01:19:20
Love to explore new things, will take the red pill ;)
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:30:57
It's a scam
@_date: 2019-09-07 15:59:01
I thought that the change addresses are only generated on HD wallets and using only a private key (instead of seed) does not make an HD wallet and therefore not generating any change addresses on send. I may be wrong, am I?
@_date: 2019-09-10 12:11:41
As I see it now, it could also be an "N" maybe, but probably then it should be visible something more than just one line
@_date: 2019-09-28 11:25:35
Your BTC is a fake one. The real BTC never rusts.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:09:42
Depends how long have you used your HDD after you wiped it.
Have you checked all your old emails? Maybe have you send your wallet somewhere?
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:40:56

By saying 24 seeds you mean 24 word seed right?

All are mentioning the btc address which OP deleted later from this thread
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:04:46
I would also suggest not putting your private keys to any other altcoin wallet before moving all your btc to other wallet
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:21:25
You're welcome
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:40:04
How did you calculated it? I though it would be something like 79,691,776, assuming the 10th word has length of 5, last character is 'F' or 'E' and the one before last is 'I' or 'L', so there are 19 seed words with those rules and the calculation I made is 2048\^2\*19.
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:55:53
For my understanding almost inf.
@_date: 2019-09-15 23:47:23
Have you checked exactly what ransom you have? Maybe for some of them there are free decryptors (at least I read somewhere there are).
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:57:55
I'm curious how you found all this domains. Did you manually typed in or used some software?

Thanks for answer. So it is not possible to convert legacy address to bech32 address, but having a private key of legacy address it is? I tried to import priv keys in electrum by using formats p2wpkh:&lt;privkey&gt; and p2wpkh-p2sh&lt;privkey&gt; but it does not allow me to do that. I thought that having a private key I'm able to generate all 3 types of addresses.
