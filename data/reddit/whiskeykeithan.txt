Value for alts is measured in btc
Value for btc is measured in usd
So when btc price increases, alts will go down because they are worth less btc.  But they still hold the same usd value.

No possible way in hell btc could be used as a currency in its current form.  Can you imagine adding several hundred thousand more transactions per minute?

no such thing as unrealized profit

That's why I loaded up on verge $$

I like it, but money is a social construct.  It only has value as far as people value it.
Bitcoin seems to be the future though.

by January 1, 2018 is not the same thing as on January 1, 2018.

The gains are nothing compared to alts.  Yeah btc is up 50 percent in the past couple days, in the span of minutes I watched nxt go up fifty percent.

Just saying, you could make 100 percent a day if you were good.

It's not, which is why the IRS has made several special papers concerning crypto.  If it just fell under a blanket clause they wouldn't be worrying about it.  Go back to your fancy grade school, you show yourself as a dipshit by making insults like that.

I don't need to argue in front of the IRS, they don't know I have bitcoin

This isnt how law or regulation works.  If there is nothing specifically stating how to deal with crypto transactions from a taxation standpoint, the default is you don't need to worry about it.  This is why the IRS keeps commenting on the matter, to at least let everyone know they are working on it.  
In law and regulation, if something isn't expressly forbidden, it is by default allowed.  If there is not a way to deal with a situation written into the regulation or law, you can do whatever you want.  
The sticking point becomes interpretation of the laws.  So say you pay taxes on your crypto, even though you arent specifically required to, you won't see that money back.  Now, if you didn't pay taxes, the IRS would likely never know.  If you got audited, they may or may not require you to pay taxes on crypto stuff.  No one's been audited yet, so we don't know.
Personally, I would set aside a portion of my gains, only when converted back into USD (as cryptos aren't recognized as actual currency yet, they shouldn't be treated as such) and be prepared to need to pay tax.  I wouldn't claim it on my own though.  
You won't go to jail, you will get audited and owe money in the future, or nothing will happen at all.

You know what a grade school is right?  You need a bachelor's degree to get into any school that grants a jd, and grade schools don't grant college degrees last time I checked.  If you are being facetious, you sound like a dildo.  Just say college so you don't unnecessarily convolute a conversation.  
I've read bulletin 2014-16, and it's intentionally vague.  Virtual currency is taxed as property, and "in general" "may have a tax liability."
It's vague, and that's why folks can argue about it.  You can't argue your income tax, you can't argue your capital gains tax.  The tax code is very deliberate in most areas, which is why it's so easy to get out of paying taxes.  The crypto stuff needs to be put into actual code and not in a random bulletin, and use more specific language.  26 CFR wouldn't be a billion pages long and tax law wouldn't be a profession if generic one page catch all's was all the IRS needed to enforce tax laws.
But hey, I'm just a guy with an Ivy League MA and three other degrees from defense academies.  I'm not arguing that virtual currency is exempt, I'm saying we don't know the rules yet, because they haven't been created.  A generic paper with generic phrasing that may or may not apply exists, but code does not.  When code exists, we won't be able to argue on Reddit (well, dummies will) but my point is we aren't there yet.  If I get a 1099 from coinbase I'll report it, if not, I won't.  If I get audited I'll dig up my records and pay, but I've been audited twice (tell me how that works out, agi under 40k and 29 years old) and both times the IRS ended up sending me money.

Well, no.  I'm arguing you can't prosecute me for having Bitcoin and not telling you because you don't know I have Bitcoin because my preferred platform doesn't know they may or may not be liable to the IRS for tax purposes.
You are adding another crime.  The silk road folks weren't shut down and or prosecuted because they weren't reporting their transactions to the IRS, it was because they were selling people and drugs.

You mean every time you swipe a card to pay for something and don't have to wait days to know if you swiped your card the wrong way and just lost your entire payment?

Credit shouldn't be allowed for anything other than houses and cars imo.
