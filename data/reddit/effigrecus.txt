Agree! As a 16 years old teenager, I invested my ~$1000 USD and now I have almost ~$1800 USD. That’s a big profit for me. I am trying my best to learn everything about Bitcoin and other cryptos. I also have 10 IOTA  and 0.3 ETH! 
I am just hoping that I’ll make enough profit on my way to college life.

I don’t know anything about and where to start programming etc. Where can I start learning from? I really wish to become an expert as you said!

Especially in Turkey, because Turkish lira is losing it’s value everyday against the USD and it’s not worth holding it. That’s why I bought Bitcoins at first time.

Yes, I am living in Turkey and don’t even know what IRS is.

We have a constitutional blankness about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies so we don’t actually pay taxes for them. I think they’ll work on it soon but right now, I am not paying taxes for Bitcoin as I know.

I am sorry.

I know it was a dumb movement but it was actually a symbolic movement for me which aims to see that 100 Turkish Liras on the bank account. It just motivated me, that’s all.

I remember that it was 1.75 once. We were counting euro as “2” many times. For example, when we see a nice jacket worth 45 EUR we were saying “Woaah dude, it’s equal to 90 TRY and it may be affordable.”
Now when we see a jacket like that, we are saying “Oh come on dude this jacket equals 225 TRY, let’s just forget about it.”

With high inflation, Turkish lira set all-time low against USD and EUR. Maybe this would be a reason.
