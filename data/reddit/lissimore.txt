It can't, I have to give you a discount code that you can use at checkout

Definitely. 
We have over-ear headphones loosely categorized on our site as "Open-Back" or "Closed-Back." 
Open-back headphones let air in and out of the earcup (they are open) In general, open-back headphones are going to give you better sound (more natural and spacious sounding if that makes sense) 
The trade-off is that you need to be in a quiet environment to enjoy them because noise from the environment leaks in and sound from your music leaks out. 
The "closed-back" over-ear headphone category provide's more isolation because they are not letting air in and out (like the v-moda crossfade or audio technica ath-m50x). The degree of isolation depends on materials and how good the ear cups seal over your ear. 
In general, the more isolation the more "sound stage" you're giving up because the sound waves can only bounce around the ear cup with nowhere to go. 
That tradeoff is worth it if you're in noisy environments because the noise will ruin your music anyway.

Haha no way! Which site were you on? Ya, SEO is definitely a different game these days.

Thanks so much! I'm actually talking to spendabit right now. Bitcoin logo is a great idea!

Hey all. I'm the CEO at Headphones.com and we're really excited to be accepting bitcoin. DM me for a special bitcoin discount (also happy to answer any questions about headphones)

So far 100%. But that will go down to 75% if it becomes a greater percentage of revenue.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:29:33
I will for sure!
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:26:03
Actually working on that :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:30:51
No we don't. I love Planar Magnetic headphones in general and we'd love to carry them, however they basically only sell on Amazon and their own website.

Hey, thanks! Getting the domain was tough. It was a 4 month negotiation, and at no point did we think we would actually get it. Amazingly it all worked out in the end.

Hey, thanks for the message! We don't ship to EU yet, but we plan to at the beginning of 2018.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:12:56
Hey, I think that issue should be sorted out. Try again and let me know if it works. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:29:17
Thanks, that's good feedback. Not many of our headphones are noise canceling and almost all the in-ear-monitors are noise isolating. We focus on great sound and although I think noise canceling technology is getting a lot better, we're still giving up some sound quality.

Shipping in Canada &amp; US only right now. However we are expanding to international shipping next year

That's an awesome question. 
You want to maximize your value to cost ratio for whatever you buy. So the trick is choosing a budget for an upgrade and then figuring out how to get the most value from that budget. 
Value is subjective, so to get a better idea of the best option for you, I'd need to know a little more...
Here are some good things to think about (and if you answer these questions, I'll totally get you the best recommendation I can think of): 
How do you like the MSR7? What do you like about it and what do you not like about it? 
In a perfect world what would your headphones sound like? 
What kind of music do you listen to? 
Will you be listening mostly at home, gym, office, commuting, all of the above? 
What is your music source (iPhone &amp; Spotify, Computer with Tidal etc.)?
Are you open to buying headphones that need an amp / dac? (If you don't know enough about amps / dacs to make a decision, no worries, let me know and I'll make a separate comment to explain them)
What is your budget range? (It's okay if it's not much, the trick is maximizing what you have to work with). 
If you can answer those questions, I can tell you the right upgrade from the MSR7.

Fire me a pm if you're up for it ;)

Yes, as soon as we can accept Ethereum we will. We'll have to see about other Alts. Anything you're looking for in particular?
