Gottcha, so I understand the miner's economic incentives.  But if somehow they had enough computing power and wanted to start verifying transactions without the proper digital signature would they be able to do that?
For instance, if the miner was sending a bitcoin (without the private key) to himself and then acted as the miner to verify that transaction.

I'm pretty sure I understand all of the high level concepts related to public/private key encryption, updating the ledger, the blockchain, miners confirming transactions by solving the hash function problem, prevention of double spending etc.  The source code is what I'm trying to get into now.  I realize it will be very difficult, but that is why I am looking for any source code that is uber user-friendly comments (if that exists at all)

Wow this is great (and terribly sad)!  I wonder if anyone lets their computer run in the hope(ful/less) belief that they'll get lucky and nail the private key.
Thanks for sharing!

Is the reason only the holder of the private key can transfer a bitcoin because the recipient will know whether it truly belongs to sender?  And if this is the case, could someone accept a bitcoin that has been inactive for a long enough period of time from someone who doesn't have the associated private key?
Or rather, does the hash function require use of the private key therefore its mathematically impossible to perform the transaction without the private key?

I think this is what I'm looking for, I'll dive in later today.  Thanks so much!
