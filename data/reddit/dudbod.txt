What is a shell game?
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:10:34
You have all lost your minds. Eventually you will lose your money too.
Some are so far gone that they think nobody can be against bitcoin and those that claim to be are actually part of some scheme to buy it cheap!

He is sort of right though. We all know it's manipulated. Don't play dumb
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:03:11
At least they are ready and waiting this time. Now all we need is that moon shoot

The market is totally unregulated. All of the underhand manipulation and basically cheating that goes on here is banned in legitimate markets. We all know it. Don't pretend it's not true
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:00:15
It's a place where cowards and losers can pretend to be brave

Well my brokerage friends said the exact opposite.

What is washed trading?
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:32:04
We have different views but we are both interested in cryptocurrency so we are similar too. 
That's cool. Peace

@_date: 2018-10-16 09:14:57
Focus on the point he made about the big jump half an hour before the announcement. This market is rotten to the core and that's what will keep legitimate institutional investors out. 
Without regulation this market is heading to nothing

Kyc is the excuse
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:55:02
To a degree it probably happens yes. But crypto is a free for all. If we have different opinions that's cool too. But there are some spouting shit on here that seem to think crypto is squeaky clean while in fact it's the total opposite
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:30:43
Thanks for explaining. So if there were two transactions for example one buying one unit then a second one selling one unit to cancel it out.  
Is that accurate?

Wtf does that have to do with anything. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 01:03:23
But it's not reliable at all. It comes last in most reliability scores.

Maybe it's just me but they don't seem to be as sharp or readable as Binance.
Also remember Binance said they would have fiat pairings this year?

Do you want to buy a reliable car or do you want to buy a Tesla. Two different things

@_date: 2018-11-18 09:31:20
Lol what the heck is the matter with your brain. Im spoon feeding you stats showing how unreliable Tesla is and you are trying to twist it.
Are you saying the parts on the car are not reliable but the car is! Lol wtf
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:47:17
What is this?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:20:21
Dude. Do yourself a favour and delete this junk
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:06:18
Wow. You either have a shit ton invested or you are a bit mad
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:46:44
Strain on the alternator as well as the engine. You should test run it though and see what the difference is. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 09:35:35
What does that have to do with racism? 
Islamic things are ok as long as it's in the middle East. I don't know where you are from but we've had enough of Islam in Europe

@_date: 2018-11-29 20:26:31
It's a clever idea. Might the extra load on the truck use  more fuel so it's not really free?
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:01:30
Haha. Sure it is

I hope you are joking
@_date: 2018-11-17 23:12:37
No worries but you haven't a clue in reality.
The stats are out there for all to see. You are talking out you ass.
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:40:20
No you don't understand how it works. More electricity use means the alternator works harder which uses more fuel. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:38:16
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:59:15
Delete this junk

Because I don't agree with you saying the Us/ China trade war is really about crytpocurrencies?
Someone called you a neckbeard earlier. If the shoe fits

Im good thanks. Reality can be cruel sometimes but such is life. 
When you decide to emerge from your bubble hit me up for some beers
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:02:32
So I'm a troll now. Either you have lost a lot of money or you are mentally unstable . Maybe both
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:59:42
If you like low prices just wait until next month

We all have our opinion. Go live in China if you want censorship

Same as any gold rush. The people who sell the shovels and buckets are the ones who make the money

No they aren't. Nobody is buying into this scour anymore

Trolls on Reddit caused BTC to drop hard. What drugs are you on?
Stop looking for someone to blame. It's sad

What if it has peaked?
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:55:43
It's not governments. It's the fact that the bubble has burst. Nobody wants bitcoin because it's not a store of value. It's a crock of shit
