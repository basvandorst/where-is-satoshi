i was just playing around with some of their tools and set one for a few blocks ahead of when i made it to play around and it seems to have allowed me to make an address that is unusable? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:05:39
so i have a redeem script that i made from coinb.in - here's an example to a similar one - in this case, the nLockTime would be 1337 which seems to be part of the mechanism that generates teh actual P2SH address? 
How would I go about doing this?  I was simply pasting the redeem script into coinb.in and populating the outputs to create the initial unsigned TX, and then signing via the same webpage (under the 'sign' tab of coinb.in') 
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:55:48
How do i make a "normal, standard" one?  I have the redeem script and the private key.

I've bought crypto for a long time, it's not a risk. 
I'll be making the stupid god damn bank wire now since there is no other reasonable alternative out there. 
Gee, thanks a lot US government for making it impossible for people to actually buy and sell bitcoins without having to go through a fucking monopoly like coinbase (that bans your account for no stated reason, of which i'm still waiting on...) 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:17:45
of course :) 
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:18:07
i've tried this and unfortunately no - it's the redeem script which is too large
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:50:43
It’s a 7of13 P2SH multi sig address - the size of the redeem script is over the 520byte limit as I provided some keys out of the article 13 possible in “uncompressed” format 
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:52:17
10% fees both ways. $200 to buy $2k worth of bitcoin, no thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:27:21
I created the transaction on the coinb.in website by using their UI.  So i'm basically fucked here right? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:21:48
I'm going to! I hope they accept me based on where i'm living...
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:18:56
The market is being held back right now with how much of a pain in the ass it is to transfer USD to BTC
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:18:40
the public keys that were required to sign for the address are things i dont wish to divulge (they are used elsewhere ;)) 
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:20:31
I learned a ton about how the bitcoin protocol worked by spending hours learning why my TX would not be accepted so I would consider the BTC loss worth it in the end.
Now, when BTC goes &gt; $1m a coin, i may be slightly irked that i have coins in an unspendable address [of which i still have valid keys for].... Oh well, if ever a time comes; perhaps people with issues similar to mine will have a solution :) 
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:51:03
Please elaborate some more - I cannot even broadcast a transaction created with such a large redemption script (even tho the 7of13 sig requirement is met) 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:43:09
Yeah instead you get to trust banksters with your coins!
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:52:36
Another thing to mention is that any time bitcoins are sent to a ‘corrupted’ address the overall supply of available BTC is permanently reduced 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:20:33
just use timelock address and HODL that way you can't sell :) 
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:17:46
Cool service but considering i have &lt; $200 in this address it's not really worth the time, its just a bummer 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:19:01
This.  Coinbase is awful. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:21:13
Circle used to be a better alternative. It was fair in that consumers had choice. Right now unless you wanna pay ridiculous fees u need a CoinBase acct - they shut mine down.  I have legit proof Of I come and everything.  I want  use them but I can’t so now I’m basically screwed for buying more btc (to hoard)
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:17:42
That’s stupid. (Not that I disagree tho)
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:01:41
This solves nothing if they still need a bank account to accept ACH deposits...
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:19:21
I can confirm this - glad to see nobody else will have the same issue. 
Unfortunately it doesn't help me with my situation :( 
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:21:38
coinb.in isnt really wallet software per se - they let you manually craft transactions by providing inputs; they don't act in the same way a 'wallet' typically does (however they do have a 'wallet' type sort of feature on their site, but it's not what i'm referring to here) 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:20:00
Hard learned lesson number one: never sell *all* of your bitcoin :) 
Always save 1000 bits here, 1000 bits there.  Look into timelocks for such things :) 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:08:30
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:54:38
what about the P2SH redeem script? as far as i can tell this is needed to spend from the address as well 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:55:34
I said that is *not* localbitcoins....
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:46:01
i'm going to. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:48:55
I’ll make a similar one later tonight as to not divulge too many details about my coins :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:52:43
Ill make an issue later tonight when I recreate the problem using a similar set of keys I did for the original as I do not want  I share the address since it could reveal details I wouldn’t necessarily want being revealed (
I’ll provide the corresponding private keys and deposit a small amount of BTC into the address as well so people can see  exactly what happened 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:22:37
unfortunately this hasn't been the case for a lot of times lately - fees are insane right now and need to go down. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:29:09
I was one of those who didn’t listen. I regret. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:55:25
because your bank was on their list (the charge comes from my bank and how much it costs to send a wire; not gemini) 
if your bank isnt on their list you need to wire in your first deposit before they'll let you do ACH. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:21:49
They were awesome right til the day my acct got banned for no reasons despite repeated emails asking  why. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:52:25
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:22:17
Also, just wanted to say thanks to the community for actually responding to this thread.... I felt as though it was going to disappear into the void of nothingness as it was rather complex in nature. 
Awesome community :) 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:07:57
Because it’s true. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:41:20
Looks like they do.  Unfortunately i may have to wait up to 2 weeks for them to verify my identity because of high volume....
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:34:35
* respect * 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:54:14
You assholes could've told me this before making me upload ALL my fucking validation bullshit. 
Thanks for wasting my fucking time (because of this, i don't plan on using your service in the future; even if you were to come to WA state - way to fuck yourselves out of a great customer!)
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:26:41
Why are you linking to blockcriean.info in your post? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:30:20
This indeed. This guy is a fucking moron. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:49:46
Is there a possibility in the (far distant) future that such a restriction would be lifted? My redemption script used some uncompressed pub keys causing it to exceed this very very small limit.
How come the system even allows generation of an address that is unspendable? Things like this should be rejected so that nobody else winds up in this mess. I’m just glad I caught it before more BTC got deposited into the ‘corrupted’ address..
I’m willing to pay a rather large fee to cover a TX of such a size so I’m confused why this is even an issue in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:53:46
I may just fucking do this....
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:28:51
Are you being fucking serious?
