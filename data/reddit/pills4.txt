I'm dealing with it. I read the 2 versions and decide what to think. The problem is that I see that the other side debunks what is said here while this side only states things.

we did not have a conversation, it's not possible.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:47:41
That phrase applies for both of us. Reality is different for each person.

I would like to know what BU supporters have to say about this
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:22:26
That this sub is "moderated"? I would like it not to be.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:56:14
I have been reading both versions, but they say this sub is not open to discussion, is that true?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:38:34
Because we want currency we are sure will be devalued, without people noticing it too much, devalued by corruption and wars, go fiat

I would like to trust what I read on r Bitcoin, but you don't let me... Why do not you discuss other points of view? Or is it just that's you have decided that differences can not be solved? Differences can be solved, an agreement can be reached, or at least put some faith on it.

I can not put that here, I do not want to be moderated. But maybe if you go to main posts at the other sub you can find some topics.

well, if level it means no formation of bubbles, that could be good, people could buy at some average to prevent volatility issues

I see, for my country I usually found someone selling them cheap, arbitrage opportunity? I'm looking into that

Grandma still had to learn how to use the bank, now she doesn't want to learn anything :(

Yes, that's so low, I wonder why people don't use coins with more transactions per second, there are just too many others, and some options to make exchange between cryptocurrencies smooth, experience will at least be smoother than credit cards
@_date: 2016-12-09 21:25:32
Too many negations.
Is it the same as 'historically, no medium of exchange has become a store of value'?

If it's a good amount you could try buying tether on tether.to, they charge $20 or 0.01%, whatever is higher. 
Then change tether to BTC in poloniex
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:13:59
Why people don't buy on local bitcoins, is it expensive? Just a fee of 1% paid by both buyer and seller
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:12:17
Ethereum reached 20 billions market cap faster than bitcoin, volume in USD reached in the last days. No one is an exaggeration.

What about the other blockchains with potential for Visa levels transaction capacity? Bts, str, dgb, and others
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:29:29
 just because it is not used now it does not mean it can be used very soon.
Let me guess, you would not have invested in bitcoin 2009 because nobody was using it.
To switch is easier than you think it is.
