Apples to Oranges.  It isn't that they "can't" stop drugs from being smuggled from the border.  It really isn't.  It is they don't want to have to check every car.  Otherwise there would be a line from mexico city to san antonio.  That much is OBVIOUS.    Information is stopped all the time.  Look at the voting system here on reddit which hides excessive negative votes for a comment.  This board HIGHLY censures dissenting opinion from detractors and advocates alike.   Just because of the "internet" (I use quotes here because some people treat the internet like it is a magical information void) doesn't mean information cannot be stopped or censured.  Majority/Democratic/Mob rule is sometimes wrong.  Humans as a species tend to be have in mob-like ways EVEN when it is supposedly goes against their self interest.  So it would be absurd to argue in the notion of a free market where rational actors exist working with one another as reason as their guide.  And goes against everything we know and learned in psychology

So are you going to give us any real answers rather than what you've gleamed off wikipedia?

Firstly there is no such thing as rational self interest.  Everything we know in both fields of psychology and philosophy shows that, period.  Let us just give an example.  If each individual was acting in their own individual self interest then there is no reason for the price NOT to fall.  There is no reason for there not to be a point someday when the largest holder of bitcoin sells off.  There is no reason for the exchanges to collude and or artificially inflate/deflate and/or manipulate the prices in order to get an edge on fees.    What I'm getting at is no man is an island there is no serious reason to believe an individual acts in their own individualized self interest.  That is some protestant ethic bullshit.  You and everyone else in the bitcoin/psuedolibertarian community are social creatures just like everyone else  If you really believed that everyone's individual self interest is paramount then the form of government you should be advocating is far from an ancap and or any flavor of a libertarian government.  Upon rereading your reply you failed to argue for or against any point I brought up except for the low ball one from the libertarian playbook.  Even then you just repeated something from the echo chamber.

He's got free electricity though so why not take advantage of a money making opportunity?  Drug dealing is certainly more profitable than investing in bitcoin

Digging ditches and working in a factory is more profitable and has better long term prospects than day trading or investing in bitcoin

Can you name the specific "foundations" and how they are "stronger"?

So thinking electricity is included in the rent equates to the electricity not being monitored?  Don't you think that's a little idiotic?  But congratulations the socratic method doesn't work on everyone.

Isn't the whole point of an exchange is to bring people together to exchange their goods at an agreed upon prices?  Hard to do that decentralized.

If exchanges are fabricating data. Or if the possibility exists readily without much interdiction then the fundamentals you speak of are absolutely meaningless.  It is the same argument that if a hot stock is in the news then their price should go up.  However there are other factors always at play.  You can't simply say (which it sounds like you are saying) "because increase in popularity, ergo free market, ergo increase in price"  There is no reason to believe that because of what I said earlier.  If there is even a fraction of a reason to engage in price manipulation without consequence then fundamentals mean nothing

Do tell.  What game is that?  If I chose a job with a steady income and a stable paycheck I'm more ahead of the game than bitcoin "day traders." So tell me please if you will  What game am I ahead of if I invest in bitcoin rather than college.

You know because the exchanges are...unregulated...they can if they so choose just inflate the price back to 1200.  There's nothing stopping them from arbitrarily setting it to that price is there?  They are not being forced NOT to? So why aren't they?

Except you're not willing. If you truly paid 100k to develop a website your investment is huge. You're not going to be motivated to switch to a "better" (a weasel word) you're not going to switch because your sunk cost is so high.

Yeah but I didn't. I see a lot of people in the so called "pro" magic beans camp complaining that no one "gets it" and is in need of some sort of nonsensical paradigm shifting revolution or the younger generation of some such nonsense. If you think the problem with magic beans is that not enough intelligent people "get it" then YOU are the one (not them) that doesn't get it. A good analogy is if you think everyone around you are assholes, odds are you're the asshole
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:37:44
Why would I invest any money in anything if the return on investment works the way you say it does? If I invest 100 dollars in something with a 100% ROI why bother? That is a net gain of 0% so therefor there's no point.  I'm more scared that YOU'RE investing. How is that an investment? 
@_date: 2015-09-29 22:58:09
That's not his argument. He spelled out his argument for you in perfect English. Which is good considering it isn't his native language.
His argument is that the currency arbitrage that has to take place in order to exchange the local currency for magic beans, already places it at less of a value than magic beans's equivalent in US dollars. So therefore it is easier to just use dollars in place of magic beans.
This is exactly why using a "commodity" like magic beans where the price changes at arbitrary not regulated market fluctuations as a currency is absurd.  
If you want bitcoin to survive then put in place market regulations, peg the price through a centralized authority, and instead of trading magic beans itself on an unregulated exchange; trade future contracts.
If you want bitcon to be like a currency make it a currency.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:44:39
If your only way to judge if people "get it" is to agree with your position. Then YOU are the one that doesn't "get it." It is perfectly acceptable to "get it," and not agree with nor be a part of it.
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:33:43
$750 - 500 = $150
$150/$500 = .30 or 30% 
I would call saying 30% == 150% is a "trick" would you not?

You wouldn't type http commands in a telnet client because that's not what telnet was used for. Nice attempt at a straw man.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:14:31
I'm sorry but correct me if I'm mistaken if I invest 500 dollars and it goes UP 100% it is now worth double or 1000 dollars. If it goes up 150% it is now worth 1250. A gain of 50% on a 500 dollar investment is 750.00
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:22:45
In most contexts a 150% roi is a 150% gain. If someone tells me "If you give me 100 dollars and I'll give you a 100% return." I would assume I would get my 100 back, plus 100 or in other words double my money.
