You are the dingus for even thinking those one percenters had a chance

His policies are the same as 90% of the Dems. He is super quiet and not nearly as much of a presence as he needs to be. If you watched the debate you would see he is not presidential material. He had his first debate to get his poll numbers up and he landed with 1-1.8%. Not great at all. No way he beats Biden even if Biden is an old idiot.

And even better, when they realize that there are crypto’s that are more secure and require hundreds of times less power to run than bitcoin, one of his main problems will disappear

“The Trump Organization is the collective name for a group of approximately 500 business entities of which Donald Trump is the sole or principal owner.”
He makes $655mil per year. Obviously he doesn’t pocket that much but it’s hard for me to believe that a man who owns 500 businesses is worth less than 3.5bil

If you actually read my comment you will see I said, “only serious candidate.” 
Yang is polling at 1% of the Dems and Tulsi isn’t even at 1% lol. They are jokes and have NO HOPE of even becoming a runner up for president. Gtf outta here with that crap. 
You must be sad in your existence as an SJW thinking that trump is bad. Sorry your feelings are hurt, have fun with your 1% President. 
Trump 2020
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:13:44
Well how could I not read into a comment like “our only hope.”
At least trump is against regulations and Biden is definitely pro regulations
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:50:56
This is just wrong. Assuming he got a $400mil loan in the year 1990, he would have a 720% profit. That’s $2.8bil. He has $3.5bil on Forbes list, so yeah that’s definitely outperforming the s&amp;p

Is your dad the hodge twins
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:31:25
Why is it any surprise trump isn’t pro crypto? Do you think Biden or Bernie or any other serious candidate is pro crypto? It goes against the United States federal reserve
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:49:51
This is a quality post

Lol �� one of my alts had a x1120 increase. And that was in 7 months not a few years
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:11:08
I just tell them to save the laughing for ten years from now. I also buy better coins than bitcoin because anyone with sense knows it won’t succeed

Was there a dip?
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:05:36
When they print more, the dollar loses its status of “gold backed”
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:43:20
Well, in the original comment he said “any currency in history” 
At one point good was a currency
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:40:41
I get excited, but I dont make a post every time it goes up 9%
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:59:21
What are you even saying here lol. Proving my point? Yeah the argument was about how much a dip or growth makes you or loses you in terms of dollars. 
I dont know how I can make this anymore clear to you.
$1000 of bitcoin and $1000 of let’s say Cardano. Cardano is $0.08 and bitcoin is $12,000. 
When bitcoin goes ALL THE WAY to $24,000, that’s a 100% growth. You now have $2000. 
If Cardano jumps up to $0.16, that’s also a 100% growth and you now have $2000.
No matter what the dollar value of the ups and downs are, the percentage is all that matters. 
God these newbies coming into crypto know absolutely nothing.

In the rules it actually says, “shit memes are permissible after crazy gainz from the end of at least a one year beat market.”
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:28:29
There also are fees...

I know everyone else has coinbase horror stories, but the one time I needed support I called and after like a two minute hold they answered and fixed my problem
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:12:01
How do you print gold?
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:50:31
And the phone case
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:58:35
It will in the history books
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:56:54
Whether i like bitcoin or not is irrelevant in this statement:
Even if bitcoin somehow goes to $100,000, that’s only an approximate 8-9x profit.
Altcoins will see 50x profit. In that picture the lambos will unfortunately be the altcoin holders.

Such a funny post���� God this doofus gives us so much entertainment
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:57:11
If it’s gold backed you can’t print more
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:35:32
Good old tech bitcoin will boost up the fees down the line. Not the crypto of the future

Driving from one end of the country to the other at night takes 10 minutes. During the day it takes 40 because of traffic. I have no idea who would want a lambo in Singapore other than status i guess. When I was there I saw like 10-15 lambos per day, it was nuts
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:18:52
While I’m doing that why don’t you read a basic math book that talks about percentages. Maybe start with fractions and work your way up to percentages
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:59:05
My question for u/homeyhomedawg is: as a true OG who at one point owned at least 81 bitcoins, did you manage to keep any through all the profit and ups and downs?
Everyone says they wish they bought when btc was $10 each, but most people doubt they would have held. 
Did you sell at $1000? $2000?
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:00:07
You realize the money doesn’t matter? Only percentages matter If a coin that costs $1 goes up to $2 you will make the same amount of money if bitcoin went from $50,000 to $100,000.

Google photo metadata. It’s like the time it was taken, and some other details. Sometimes even the location is in there
@_date: 2019-09-29 01:03:25
Okay so what? A 2014? Even later? Way less than 50k
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:21:21
What do you drive?
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:12:08
1) doubt you can provide proof 
2) if it IS true you drive an S5, I doubt it’s anywhere close to a 2019 so not $50,000 in price 
3) S5’s are common as they come. They look plain and compared to a Supra they are garbage.
Supras are rare and much cooler than your old s5 (if it exists)
