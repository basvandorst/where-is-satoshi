I'm assuming 20-50 btc.
I always see someone who's making ~22 BTC trades on GDAX.  If you can throw a lot of coin around, you can (temporarily) influence the price on the exchange. This is what people were worried about banks doing for the futures market.

Wait, they definitely aren't opening the market on a weekend... 
I think the article got the date wrong--at least about when people can first start buying and selling.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:33:39
It's because this was on Bitmex, not the CBOE.

Fidelity did a study between 2003 and 2013 and found that the highest-performing accounts were from investors who were literally dead.  
The second highest-performing group was investors who forgot they had accounts at Fidelity. Playing the stock market is impossible for individual investors.
The people who are out there making a profit are--if stocks are a good analogy to bitcoin--probably those who have enough money to manipulate the market, similar to institutional investors in the stock market.

If you know what you're doing and have experience, then go ahead.
If you were like me, and *thought* you could do it, be warned.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:15:17
Hmmm, it seems they don't have the same price limits as the CME. I wonder if that will make it more volatile...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:52:21
If there were a tried and true way of predicting the market, the market would factor that into its prices and compensate for it.  I think all evidence suggests that individual investors cannot consistently beat the market over long periods of time.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:55:19
I guess that's true, but isn't the worry that Bitcoin will keep on going past your limit price sell?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:48:35
To tell them not to do that?
Like, I somehow thought it was a good idea, so it seems likely that other people might have a similar thought process.

The red represents how many people are trying to sell at the prices on the x-axis (the horizontal line with $ on it).  
For Bitcoin to get above $10k in price, people have to be buying it above $10k.  And to do that, they'll first need to buy out all the people who are selling at $10k or less (because they're not going to pay more than people are trying to sell it for).
As long as there are people selling Bitcoin for less $10k, the price will stay below that value. The steep rise in red is an indicator that a lot of people are trying to sell at around $10k. 
The dragon is a reference to the popular TV show, *Game of Thrones*. In the show, the dragon destroys a huge wall by shooting fire at it.  Here, it represents our hope that people will buy through this "wall" and the price will rise above $10k.

Yeah, but for some reason whoever posted that knew it was cash settled but thought there might be something possible with the contract specs.  Don't really know what they were thinking--not too familiar with it myself.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:44:38
By the way, I really appreciate you for taking the time to go over this with me! 
I *don't* know 100% what I'm talking about, but what I *did* know seemed to run against what you were suggesting. (I edited my original post a few times to suggest that.)
So here's where I can't make sense of what you're saying, which is at two points you made.
1) If you send your public key out in the world, as you do when you are making a transaction--it's basically out in the world for everyone to see forever (at some level), is it not?  If the public key is not destroyed in the process of going from mempool --&gt; block (which I don't know if it is), it could at least be recorded by anyone monitoring the mempool.
Once you have this public key then, why couldn't it be used to crack the private key, as you say?  I was trying to understand how you were arguing against this as being possible earlier.
2) Is it not the case that a miner's public key (for the amount that they received mining the block) is exposed during the process (or receipt) of mining that block?  Ie, when they successfully complete a block, I was under the impression that the address receiving the mined bitcoins shows its full public key.
This would mean that the Satoshi blocks (along with anyone else who had mined and not spent anything) would be exposed. 
You didn't say anything about the Satoshi blocks--I was just raising this concern.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:41
So I believe it's a cumulative graph--anybody who's selling at $10k is also selling at $10,200, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:54:58
You either don't understand quantum computers or how encryption works--you're completely wrong: 
edit: apparently I don't?  I'm not even sure at this point.
edit 2: I take it back, it seems I was right?
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:22:49
Huh, interesting.  It seems like it would reduce it from 2^256 to 2^128, but I guess 2^128 is still a huge amount of time?
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:20:40
Awesome, thanks for the explanation, that makes total sense!
I'm assuming it could also work the opposite way? (I.e., if futures were significantly *less* than the price of bitcoin?)
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:11:28
Yeah, absolutely agree.

Honestly, if you're a relatively newcomer worried about the fork, you should probably just use Coinbase.  The new fork doesn't have something called "replay protection", but Coinbase has come up with their own protection. 
When you make a bitcoin transaction, you encrypt something with your private key so people know that the money is from your account.  This encrypted bit will be the same for both bitcoin and 2x, so if you send someone money on bitcoin, people will be able to take that encrypted bit and use it on 2x, so that you end up sending both bitcoin and 2x to the receiver.
Coinbase will be able to let you separate your money, which you might be able to do yourself, but you'd have to be technically savvy. However, it sometimes takes a while to open an account with them (idk how it is nowadays), so you might not be able to get some in time.  If you have bitcoin when the fork happens, you'll have both BTC and B2X, but afterwards you'll have to buy both separately.
As far as the fork affecting the price--who knows?  I don't think it will have a significant long-term effect, especially when you consider getting two coins for the price of one.  The upcoming fork is certainly not a disaster.

I think we're going off the [same wiki page](  I was trying to be charitable by considering the least dangerous option, but doesn't this page pretty much prove what I said earlier?
The outlook is pretty bleak for cryptocurrency in the face of quantum computing...
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:16:25


Fuck, this is going way past my paygrade.  Now, after much research, I think it's the case that generation transactions *used* to contain public keys, but do *not* (to the best of my knowledge) do so anymore.
For evidence that older blocks had generation transactions that included public keys, but now have changed see:
* [The most helpful post I found](
* [A user in 2014 asking why the public key is included in coinbase transactions](
* [A helpful redditor answering a similar question](
* [An old block with the generation transaction form: `&lt;public-key&gt; OP_CHECKSIG](
* [A new block with the generation transaction form:  `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;hash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`](
As far as I can understand, this means the bulk of the earlier Bitcoins could be cracked by QC, which is not the same attack you were originally referencing, but could be just as damaging to Bitcoin as a whole 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:53:14
Wait a month or two after the CME futures start selling.  
Nobody knows how institutional investments are going to affect price, but it could be a game-changer.

Quantum computers are nowhere near the level they'd need to be to actually be practical. Once/if they get to that point, there will be more important things to worry about than Bitcoin--as earlier posters have said, almost all modern encryption is screwed.
In regards to this:


I believe you're saying that if you keep switching private keys/addresses, you'll be fine?  I get that, but what about the *huge* amount of bitcoins tied up in those earlier accounts, like the million-ish bitcoins Satoshi mined?
They're not going anywhere, and if you used a QC to crack the private keys, you could either 1) become the richest human in existence 2) *destroy* Bitcoin by unloading them for cheap.

See [here]( it isn't clear whether there will be any delivery or not at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:35:02


Can you explain how this works / makes sense? (Not that I disbelieve you, I just don't understand.) 
If it's all cash-settled, nobody is ever actually touching bitcoin, right?  Would these arbitrageurs just being buying bitcoin because they believe the futures market is good at forecasting the prices? 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:51:31
It's definitely an amount I'm comfortable leaving in a paypal account.  It would hurt to lose, but wouldn't be disastrous or anything like that.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:52:00
Just send me a couple coins over first to see if I can trust you.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:02:45
Thanks for the advice, but you may be misunderstanding my position.  I'm not dabbling with my livelihood here--I only have about ~0.175 BTC to begin with.  I really only ended up "investing" because I was too lazy to cash out all those years ago.  I'm using bitcoin mostly out of curiosity and fun at this point.  
However, after browsing and for the last couple of months, I wonder how many people on these communities really *understand* bitcoin, like you seem to describe.
Segwit, Segwit2x, BIP148, block size changes, etc.--these are generally rather explicitly defined proposals, but the way people argue about them makes it clear that very few have any sort of firm grasp of the facts.  All debate seems 80% strawmanning, 15% appeal to emotion/fear-mongering, and 5% contradictory "facts".
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:50:55
Huh, this seems promising, I'll check it out.  Thanks!
