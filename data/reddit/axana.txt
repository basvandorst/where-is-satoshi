Nothing. It's their own pretentious way of rationalizing camwhoring. 
I'm not against camwhores, but I'd prefer that they be honest and upfront that they're doing this for cash instead of trying to excuse it with pseudo-intellectual bullshit.

I know exactly what thread you're talking about. I tried finding it on Google to link to it here, but haven't had any luck.
IIRC, the main deterrent against setting up a bitcoin cam website is finding talent willing to accept bitcoins as payment. What incentive does the talent have to work with a start-up for an unsteady stream of bitcoins when they can just as easily get steady work with professionals who pay in dollars?

Quoting from the article:






Everything Jeff Garzik said here is absolutely true.  It's the idiot writer who implies that Bitcoin transactions can be used to track down individuals.  Blame the scaremongering media for taking his words out of context, NOT Mr. Garzik.

I got the dreaded 502 error while submitting a post.  I've cleaned up the clutter and deleted the extras.  Sorry about that.

Kudos to Google for that, but Gmail users should still be paranoid and change passwords to everything ASAP.  Somebody already tried to access my Paypal account using my leaked Gmail address and password.
FUCK YOU MTGOX

It was "big" compared to the other online alternatives, which are small to nonexistent.  There are private drug trading forums, but they're smaller, even more hidden away, and could hardly be considered in the same league as Silk Road.  Perhaps "visible" would have been a better adjective to use in my first post.
In any case, it's naive to think that Silk Road/Bitcoin drug activities weren't already on the government and CIA's radar prior to the Gawker article.  They have probably been aware of it for awhile, and now that it has received media attention, the politicians will jump on the opportunity to make it look like they're "tough on crime" or whatever nonsense they use to justify the prohibition.

If you don't mind paying for the extra electricity, then give it a shot.  I've been very satisfied with the Reddit mining pool so far--no fees, easy to set up, and easy payouts.

It was only a matter of time before some big media outlet did a story on it.  You simply can't be a big marketplace of very illegal things without getting *some* attention.  Surely whoever runs Silk Road had to have anticipated this inevitability.

Is the 0.65% trade fee in Bitcoins or in USD?  
Sorry if this is a noob question.  I saw this last night on the Mtgox website and couldn't find an answer.

There's a bitcoin video poker website listed on The Hidden Wiki.  Don't know much about it and don't feel like firing up Tor just to look for the address, but it exists.

Looks like this website is targeted at high volume Bitcoin users who are looking to exchange thousands of dollars or Bitcoins at a time.  When you've got 500K Bitcoins sitting in your account like that one guy, then $25 is a pretty good deal for the extra security.
This is very disappointing for anyone who only needs it for small transactions (which I'm guessing is most people).

Thanks, but they're even less "proven" than TradeHill.

I've already had someone try to access my Paypal account using my leaked email address and password.  This has been a huge pain in the ass.
I know, I know, I should have used a separate email and password for Mtgox.  Lesson learned.
@_date: 2011-05-23 13:03:52
Exactly. I can't believe people are taking this "*I heard this from a friend of a friend off IRC*" shit seriously.
@_date: 2011-07-11 14:34:27
If I could pay my landlord with bitcoins, I would :/
I think I'm going to go with this strategy and take my chances. Thanks!
