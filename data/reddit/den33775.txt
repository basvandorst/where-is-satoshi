All GetGems users get a referral link that takes iOS users to iPhone store, and Android users to Android store.  It then gives the user whose link it is 25 free gems to play with if person clicking installs getgems.  There's a big micro-tipping culture in getgems so it's fun.  At present, 25 gems is worth enough to buy two thirds of a bag of crisps, so not a big deal - use of GetGems referral links is more about growing the network and micro-tipping fun.  :)

It uses strong crypto in all comms, which is more than WhatsApp.  It's the local storage that's got security issues (like plain text secret chat in memory).  So if a hacker hacks my android phone remotely and uses certain attacks, he can read our chat.  But to be honest i would expect a hacker to go after my financial information, crypto wallets, contact list, not my chat.  If a criminal gang are after a sellable list of names and contact details, they would go after the telegram servers not a million individual phones.  And the important bit about security is that your chat is encrypted on the telegram servers so nobody can read it outside your phone, and it does that very well with strong crypto between phone and server.
Julia uses a properly written oauth to secure coinbase authentication.  If you know anything about security, you gotta admit it's more secure than the plain text alternatives like WhatsApp, but i agree with you in that i wouldn't recommend it to criminals, since the US managed to hack TOR successfully, which is arguably a lot harder nut to crack! 
 I think it's a shame this thread has turned into an argument.  Is that all reddit is?  A place where techies can argue?  
I think you started from a very valid concern - I imagine reddit isn't supposed to be an advertising billboard, and you were checking we weren't GetGems salesmen hijacking reddit.  Fair enough.  And you're right that professional hackers could walk into Telegram on an iOS or Android phone, but why would they bother when stuff like Oracle patch 68 shakes the corporate security world? Wouldnt it be easier to pop in a key logger than to exploit the known SSL, iOS and Android vulnerabilities?  And what are the chances of your own phone getting hacked so someone can read your messenger conversation?
Anyway, to your original concern.  We're just fans of GetGems, and Julia is a great way of helping non-IT people get into cryptocurrency.   Seriously, download GetGems and give it a whirl, maybe you can contribute useful knowledge during the development of the beta.  :)

First time I ever used reddit.  Gotta start somewhere.  GetGems is attracting more reddit users (like me, because I am a GetGems fan, and Julia is pretty cool), but if reddit is just a Monty python argument sketch, I'll probably close my account again.  :S

You link your GetGems account to your coinbase account and then GetGems sets up a strong encryption link to the CoinBase API using properly implemented oauth.  The AI (Julia) then drives the buy/sell/balance/send/receive processes for you, and payment is from your CoinBase account, so secure and traceable.
