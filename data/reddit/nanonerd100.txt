Laugh all u want. But wo coinbase, the market penetration for crypto would be 2-3 years behind where we are.

So segwit is needed to pave road for LN traffic. So how does LN happen wo segwit adoption? 
It just makes transition easier right. Otherwise they have cram segwit and LN in one gulp. More testing needed then. More risk. Better to deploy in chunks and test as parts become available. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:44:04
Segwit is not a requirement for LN. but it makes it work much better. (I think).

"This arrangement works well for parties that frequently do business together, such as a patron who buys coffee at the same diner everyday or a company paying its employees’ salaries. "
This is the part that I don't get. The coffee shop (likely) cannot leave money on the LN for more than a week as it needs to pay salaries, bills, etc. So after one week, it must close its channel(s) to collect the bitcoins, right? Then it must open another channel(s) to continue doing business. When it closes its channel(s), it needs to collect, say bitcoin from 200 customers. Does it now need to send 200 separate transactions to the blockchain to settle all the customer payments that was done during the week on the LN? 
This is a problem, yes? If I am not understanding this correctly, can someone please point out how it works so that it makes sense?

I actually like the thought of banks opening exchanges. More competition for coinbase. Money moves seamless and quick between bank and exchange. Easier for mainstream adoption. Easier for ppl to use. Imagine Bank of America marketing bitcoin to all their customers. FDIC up to 250k for acct holders ( cb does this as well ). 
Prob good for bank too to not fall behind great financial renaissance. 
Millions already convert fiat to crypto while cb holds private keys. So that is option for users. Let bank hold or move into wallet.
Point being that banks in the exchange game will greatly facilitate Main Street onboarding.

What we need is mass education on how the fed and banksters operate. 
Opening eyes of mainstream is like arming bitcoin with both a shield and a mighty hammer. 
It is neutral money. It is the people’s money. And we need the people to support bitcoin to fight the powerful bankers.

U miss the big picture. Obv they can’t stop bitcoin. But they can go after the innovations that fill the crypto ecosystem. They have resources to bully startups into the ground via legal fees over patent enforcement cases, whether their claim is legit or not. 
This is legit concern. In fact, patent trolling might be the best defense or angle by the banks to fight growing usage of crypto. If they can target crypto commerce innovations, etc they can really slow things down.

Right now it can’t serve as a currency due to so much volatility. The only play right now is the digital gold theme.

Just be sure you understand exactly what you are doing. Sounds like it. But just in case ...
Cash out 401k, let's say it is $10,000. 
Come April 2020, you owe IRS:
Early withdrawal penalty of $1,000.
Additional taxes on 10,000 income ... say 20-30% (Fed and State) so let's say $2,500 to make numbers easy. 
So from $10,000, you will pay Uncle Same $3,500. So you really only have $6,500 to throw into Bitcoin. Hopefully, u are only considering Bitcoin, not other alts. 
Obviously, if Bitcoin succeeds, you will overcome your initial hit. 
So that is the rub. Are you comfortable with the risk? Are you OK, if bitcoin crashes (because there is ALWAYS some risk of it happening)? 
These are the main questions you have to answer. How you answer (be honest with yourself and your situation) should guide you to go or no go. The answer is different for everyone. Good luck either way amigo ...

For starters, bitcoin is not yet a currency. At the moment, the best way to describe bitcoin's usage is akin to digital gold. As a store of value. 
Because of its strong volatility, bitcoin cannot serve as a currency until it saturates the globe and becomes more stable.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:17:32
Pretty sure cb and gdax use the same order book. So it is one underlying exchange. Since all cb orders are market orders, cb captures a nice spread for profit plus the 1.49%. Very lucrative.

Etrade charges small interest on the amazon it lends.

As others stated u just need ur seed. To understand better just try this. Go to diff computer that u trust. Download electrum wallet. Find option to restore and enter ur seed. 
Btw u can create new wallet password than what u use on ur Mac electrum wallet. What truly matters is being able to access ur private keys. The same seed will recreate the same private keys on the second wallet. 
You will see u can see, control, access ur btc from either wallet now.

On coinbase. Credit card is 4. Purchase instantly via bank acct is 1.49%. Gdax is much cheaper. Not really difficult but need to load it money first. 
(Edit) FYI- to load money into gdax will take 4 days using normal ach bank transfer. Or u can wire it same day for a fee. Whereas if u buy on coinbase, the purchase is instant but u don’t get coins deposited to ur acct for about 5 days or so. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:59:24
Not correct. User does not need to do this to verify identity. That is done via License pic upload. 
If u want fast access and feel comfortable about entering bank password (prob safe), then use it. 
As for me I wasn’t comfortable and so did it the old fashioned way. On list of banks, select manual entry like “yum” states. This process takes 2-3days but hey, at least u don’t give out ur online bank password. 
Also, using this method does not limit u to smaller deposits, etc. like I said, the verification is via license pic upload. The limits are raised on a scheduled basis after verification. Eg, after 30 days ur limit gets increased, etc
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:04:10
Pretty sure the open and close fees that u speak of are not LN fees. Those are actual bitcoin transaction fees. Open payment channel requires blockchain Tran as well as close payment channel.

This is what everyone seems to miss. U did thousands of trades. Btw, use “trades”, not “exchanges”. They are difficult to keep track of. Especially pair trading vs other coins. Keeping track vs fiat is doable. But when u start btc to ripple and vice versa, things get shitty very fast to track. I tried to keep track but once u start doing arbitrage, sending coins to diff exchanges, trading versus other coins, and exchanges themselves not keeping history well for it, well things get messy fast. 
Pretty sure even pro accountant will prob find it difficult to map out all ur trades, if not impossible. 
I understand ur predicament. Just do ur best to report. That is all u can try to do.

Bitmega is right. 
Bitcoin blockchain does not have updates nor deletes. It only has create/insert new transaction and reads. 
The way it figures out if the sender has sufficient funds is reading all transactions for that public address and seeing if funds are enough. It uses indexing of some sort. 
Ethereum, on the other hand, has updates because it maintains state. Meaning your account address is updated as u would normally think w traditional databases.

Isn’t raiden a solution to ethereum scaling? The goal of ethereum is to be a platform for building decentralized apps on top of ethereum. Ether is not designed nor architected nor intent to be a currency. 
Bitcoin on the other hand, was designed from day one to be a peep to peer currency. Bitcoin cannot scale for commercial use. So LN will fill that gap and btc will be the secure underlying anchor. 
LN goal is to solve bitcoins scaling problem w respect to mass commercial/mainstream currency usage. Not quite there but am optimistic. Let see what happens by next summer/ fall.

Before 2009, the answer is no. But something was born in 2009 that is presenting itself as an alternative system of monetary trust. 
That is the correlation between the post and bitcoin.

Hi Zts,
I agree that cc usage and convenience are very good and mainstream is not apt to use crypto.
For a consumer, if they begin to factor in privacy, that is reason to use crypto. But yes, this will only account for a small sliver of the population. Generally, I agree that mainstream will not want to use crypto to buy coffee at Starbucks. 
However, the drive towards crypto use over cc may end up being driven by merchants. 
Merchants don't like the high 2-3% fees nor chargebacks. Take groceries for instance. Their profit margins are razor thin (literally 1-2% of sales). If they can use a crypto system to capture/save an extra 1%, that is plenty of good reason for them to encourage/incentivise users to use crytpo at their stores. That 1% may literally double their profits. 
So I do see a path for greater usage of crypto for mainstream commerce. But I think it will/needs to be driven from the merchant side.

There is no incentive. Good chance your dad will never pay for coffee w crypto. Maybe if u walk him thru, he may do for novelty sake. But otherwise he likely will not. 
In fact there is really no incentive in the USA for most ppl as well. 
Ultimately btc is an alternative system of monetary trust. The only incentive really, aside from speculation or hope that it goes up in value, is that the younger generation mistrust of centralized govt controlled fiat grows. Which will likely happen, is happening. 
Using btc or holding btc is a vote for an alternative system.

Of course no one will wait 15 min. Even 30 sec wait will be a bad experience. It has to be near instant, 10 sec or less. 
There is 0 confirmation option, which is immediate but risky. On the one hand, who would go through the trouble to scam a $5 coffee over and over again? But then, someone might. 
I don't know. But regardless, even if LN is in the picture, I still doubt the ability to buy coffee with crypto will make much impact  on mainstream adoption and usage of bitcoin.

U said btc. That would be worst way to show $4. Using sat is little better but why not create millibits, etc

Or another denomination where u could price latte at 10 bits or something?

Fiat is air. 
Bitcoin is air. 
The relevant point is what do u trust? It is that trust that gives it value. 
As more and more fiat gets created, the trust in fiat erodes daily. 
Once ppl understand bitcoin, as compared to fiat, theory is that trust in bitcoin should increase. Hence the value increases. 
Education and time are key factors.

" Obviously they would have to make the transaction time similar to checking out with cash or card. "
\- From what the others are saying, if bakkt implements their own 2nd layer, the transaction will be fast. However, what you and many others miss is the fact that for crypto to gain mainstream traction, it has to be more than just fast. 
CC is fast AND they offer rewards, buyer protection, can use everywhere easily, and so on. 
For merchants to succeed, they MUST offer rewards and/or discounts when ppl use crypto. The average consumer doesn't care if the merchant is being sucked 2-3% on each transaction. The average consumer, however, cares a lot whether they are getting 1-2% back on purchases. 
Unless Starbucks (and other merchants) sell coffee (goods) for crypto with incentives (e.g., rewards, discounted price, etc), I doubt crypto usage for commerce will ever surpass 10% of mainstream society (at least in the USA where CC rewards are everywhere). 
Let's see how Starbucks/Bakkt implements coffee for bitcoin ...

Starbucks will allow crypto POS systems at the counter, so that ppl can use their phones to scan QR code and pay in BTC. 
Bakkt (provides crypto POS and handles backend processing) takes the btc from customer, converts to fiat, and gives fiat to Starbucks. 
If it works this way, the customer does buy coffee with bitcoin, right?

That makes no sense. Borrower has to pay north of 10 percent to borrow bitcoin that could shoot up 20 percent within a day. In order to protect against that kind of volatility they prob also need to hedge using options or futures. Hence another cost of trying to short.

Bingo. I think that Bitcoin wins on paper, theory, and with hope, in reality. But in order to win in reality, a big fight with the banks must and will happen. I think a big part of winning is to educate the people on what a rigged system the FED and banks have going on. Educating them will get them on the side of Bitcoin. Because ultimately, Bitcoin is neutral money. It is the people's money. 
For others, like OP, who just want to speculate and make some bucks (completely understandable), the risk/reward profile of bitcoin is still tremendous, even at $12k. Put some into your portfolio as a hedge, if nothing else. Bitcoin is non-correlated with the stock market moves, etc.

Ultimately, the question boils down to what do you trust more: the current fiat system (eg., US Dollar) or a new and alternative system of monetary trust (bitcoin)? 
The only way to answer this question is to go on a discovery journey to learn how the current FED + banking system works. And contrast that by learning how Bitcoin works. Once you are able to paint both pictures, the decision becomes trivial (at least for me), which I trust more. IMO, bitcoin is neutral money and has the chance to disrupt the global monetary system. 
But the journey is not a short nor easy one buddy. There is quite the learning curve on both sides.

The truth is that Bitcoin may not succeed. There I said it. That being said, I support your decision. 
Suffice it to say that there are lot of brilliant people, who having looked at bitcoin, it makes perfect sense for them to hold, at a minimum reason as a hedge. A hedge vs the fiat chaos that is likely to ensue within a generation's time. 
To keep things simple, you could just reply, "I have Bitcoin because I think it is a idea to hedge."

Hopefully the glacier hits a tipping point, 3-4 years out maybe when bitcoin gets adopted and trusted enough to bring onboard Main Street, Wall Street, and everyone around the world. Then the glacier breaks and the water of knowledge spreads globally. ��

"Banks can also make alot of money facilitating crypto."
\- Perhaps you do not realize how banks make money nor how they depend on the central bank model to print money out of thin air any time they issue debt, etc.
\- The purpose of crypto is to cut out the middle men, which in the case of the monetary system, are the bankers. It is either fight Bitcoin to maintain their presence or wither away like Kodak into the pages of history ...

" banks are looking into creating their own crypto assets "

This is also why if u are doing a meaningful size transaction u should wait for at least 2 confirmations. Because those 1 confirms can sometimes be rolled back in these situations. Granted they will just be put back into mempool. 
And if are doing a very big trans, consensus is wait for 6 confirms to be deemed permanent and secured on blockchain.

Peaceful so far because the bankers, for the first 10 years, saw it as nerd money. As such they took a passive stance. 
If bitcoin is on road to true success, the bankers will not let that happen without a fight. Once we get to that point when bankers become offensive, let’s see how peaceful or not that becomes.

"Bitcoin indeed doesn't solve this. It just makes the system fair and hence we will not have a wealth gap between those who take and those who left with nothing."
\- Correct. There will always be rich and poor. Bitcoin doesn't solve this. What in fact can? Maybe communism in a pure sense but there is always the risk of corruption so that is why it never works.
To NiceColdOne (OP), Bitcoin is neutral money. It makes things more fair by removing control from central banks (always corruptible). I don't think you understand how powerful and important this "neutral money" idea is. If you did, you would appreciate Bitcoin far more and understand why a "decentralized network" is a key reason for Bitcoin's support ... please take time to ponder this ... once you grasp this, you will then understand a key part of Bitcoin's purpose ...

When bitcoins get created, yes, they are created out of thin air. But the miners have to do work to earn the bitcoins via spending a lot of resources. Although I say it is created out of thin air, they are very hard to earn. No one gets them  for free. It is a very disciplined system. 
On the other hand, when the FED prints money out of thin air, it is NOT earned. The banks get them virtually for free (every time they make a loan).  Dollars are very easy to create. It is a very loose system. 
If the FED was disciplined and responsible, Bitcoin would not exist.

Another way to put it from a high level. It is a way to make miners earn the money by creating some difficulty. 
There is a money principle that if it is easy to create the money, it is less sound and over time, it will be vastly over printed and it will be debased. Think any fiat. It is very easy for govt to print money. That is an inherent flaw and the money, in the long run is not sound. 
The harder it is to create money and thereby scarcity, the greater the foundation for sound money

Is the reasoning this? 
Ppl are so worried about near term that demand for long term bonds go up. This pushes up prices of long term bonds. So this drives Down the yield on long term bonds to point that it is below the yield on short term bond.

I don't think I can give you a definitive answer to your concern about a small % of owners owning a majority of supply. But here are some thoughts ...
Ultimately, it comes down to an issue of trust. Do you trust the existing fiat system or do you trust the Bitcoin system?
Bitcoin price volatility today prevents it as a good use of currency. But what do you expect 10 years in? Give it another 10 years ... once the market gets more saturated, then price volatility should decrease.
At that point, the question again arises, "do you trust Bitcoin"? If it was common knowledge and true that the majority of bitcoin was horded and controlled by a small group, then people may not trust it. Then usage would not be as great, price would decrease, etc. It all comes down to trust ...
Also, you assume that Bitcoin can be horded by a few ... maybe so, but how is it any different than with gold today? Gold is valuable and being horded by central banks. They all vie for it. There is open competition. Yet, people still trust and value gold. Probably Bitcoin supply dynamics will be similar. As Bitcoin trust improves, it becomes more valuable and there will be players with big pockets trying to horde it. But I don't necessarily think that 10 years later, it will be as easy to manipulate the price as it was in 2018.
I suppose this is an assumption on my part ... there's actually a lot of details that is hard to foresee by anyone on how it will play out. But a cornerstone of my thesis is that fiat has passed the point of no return in its journey to self destruct. When, I don't know ... but it is reasonable to say within 1-2 generations, it is a near certainty. Bitcoin represents an alternative system of monetary trust. It is the anti-thesis of a fiat system. A simple way to view it is simply as a hedge. IMO, that alone is enough to warrant some exposure to Bitcoin ... good luck.

Wallets should stop you from sending to an invalid address. Like if you put in "2euouewri1", the wallet knows that is not a valid address and should not send. 
But if it is a valid address, the wallet does not know if it is the correct address or not so it will dutifully send. 
Cutting and pasting: yeah, I always do a manual check on the address before I send. Just make sure that first 3 and last 3 characters match on the Submit screen with the address that you intend.

"... zero default risk."
\- big assumption bro. I agree with most of you say, but never assume there is zero risk. Bitcoin is largely an ongoing experiment. Granted the Bitcoin blockchain has withstood 10 years of attacks, which I find very impressive. For the record, the FED is also an ongoing experiment (which is unfair from inception if viewing from the average Joe's point of view) and will likely run into massive problems within 1-2 generations (25-50 years). 
OK, going back to your zero default risk ... there are so many variables and avenues of attack (rather not detail out concerns on public board, would rather not inadvertently seed some ideas for bad actors reading this). I fully support you sharing your views, but please don't say there is zero default risk. Because that is not true.

Bakkt is also trying to create a payment layer. Think lightening network except bakkt is central and only hub. Hence the partnership w Starbucks. I am ok w the idea of a 2nd layer but am skeptical of mainstream adopting crypto to pay in the USA any time soon. 
Mainly because credit cards are so easy to use combined w rewards. This is a very difficult hurdle to overcome. 
I think the correct angle for crypto adoption in commerce has to be driven by the merchants who seek an alternative to dealing w credit card payments. 
W respect to bakkt futures, although physically settled is better for bitcoin market and holders, I think they will have a hard time competing w cash settled futures, as is the case thus far.

I understand your point about some percentage of people wanting services (e.g., they don't want to or is able to take care of their bitcoin with respect to security, etc.). That will always be the case. So there will definitely be services that will develop as crypto seeps into mainstream. 
But perhaps it is how the banking system works that you may not understand clearly. Banks basically get easy access (print money out of thin air) every time they create debt (lend out mortgage, credit card debt, etc). They take that easy money and earn interest on it. Bitcoin is designed to wreck this system. 
For a while, banks will continue to exist in their current form as society transitions to crypto (assuming this ever happens, maybe it all fails, but total failure is doubtful IMO). But probably, the new services that people desire will be created by new start ups. The current banks, by catering to crypto, only speed up their demise and relevance. Perhaps it will take an entire generation for banks to crater (e.g., 25 years). Probably as you suggest, some banks will acquiesce and cater to crypto in order to survive. But once people learn how the current banking system works compared to Bitcoin, I do not see how the current Central bank model, which banks thrive on, can continue. 
This is why Banks will fight tooth and nail because Bitcoin threatens their unfettered ability to print money via issuing debt.

" Bitcoin adoption is inevitable "
Dude, I cringe when people say that. "On paper", I agree with you. But you CANNOT assume that ideas on paper (no matter how much it may make sense) will work when the idea is thrown into the real world. The real world contains many hazards ... at this point, Bitcoin is still a grand experiment full or promises. I think we still need another 10 years to see whether Bitcoin has created the greatest infrastructure inversion in the history of finance ... or if it turns out to be the biggest bubble in history.

Legit. I used them already. Spreads are wide on most trades. Prob mostly because they only got started a few months ago. 
Very soon they will offer bitcoin mini options. They will trade at 1/100th of the regular option prices. Regular options can easily be over a thousand each. So this offering may really open the doors for retail traders. I’m very interested. They said they have the tech side ready to go. They are finalizing approvals etc. 
Just be aware that until the minis come out, u can only buy/ sell whole bitcoins. No partial trades means that u can’t buy 0.3 bitcoins, etc     When minis come out, partial trades will be available. 
Also bitcoin withdrawals has a fee of 0.005 which I consider very steep. Not sure if they will adjust later. I Moved 1 bitcoin there early on without realizing I couldn’t trade partial bitcoins. They were kind enough to let me withdrawal and refund me the fee. 
If u have questions just email them. They are very responsive which is a plus.

Hi. Below is my post to a thread about coinbase wire. It is a detailed roadmap on how to get a wire transfer reversed. But the diff is that mine was a 1 day ACH (which coinbase does not support; hence my money was stuck in la la land). But regardless, given that you should have received your money in your CB account within a day's time, I think you have cause to contact Bank of America (see phone # below) to initiate a wire transfer reversal. But maybe you give it a few more days? I dunno. The fact that you have a Fed # shows that you did a Same Day transfer. 
Good luck.
It took 7 weeks. Largely because no one spells out the steps. This is w/ respect to Bank of America. If diff bank, follow same process. If you follow these steps, you can probably get money back within 10-14 days.
Call Bank of America non fraud dept. 877.337.6703. Normal protocol is to send to another dept to review which can take 10 days. Noooo, tell them you want to escalate. It's your money, get angry if you need to. Not directed at BOA but express your frustration. If they escalate, they can send reverse transaction request to Metropolitan (coinbase bank) within 24 hrs. THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT. DO NOT HANG UP PHONE UNTIL THEY AGREE TO ESCALATE.
Call BOA next day to see if they fax/emailed request to Metro. If they did, get the time they sent it.
Call Metropolitan Commercial Bank (Remote Deposit Capture) at 212.365.6739. It's a manual process there. Give them your info and date/time that BOA sent the request. They may not be able to find right away, so leave your phone # and ask for a call back. Tell them you will follow up next day if you need to. Fortunately, the lady called me back in 10 min to let me know they found the faxes from BOA.
Now, Metro will send the request to Coinbase. Basically, they send a message (email) to Coinbase. At this point email Coinbase to let them know that Metro sent the request to them.
Once Coinbase approves, Metro will reverse the transactions.
These are the necessary steps. But NO ONE SPELLS IT OUT. The key thing is BE PERSISTENT. FOLLOW UP ON EVERYTHING QUICKLY.
Lastly, if the lady at Metro is named Mary and she helps you out, please thank her very much as she is very helpful.
Good luck !

Edits in brackets to improve accuracy:  
\[Banks\] control of the money supply will be eliminated by Bitcoin and this is why they (Banks) will fight tooth and nail. The ability to print money is the reason \[banks\] can grow year after year ... 
\- You are incorrect if you think the Govt has full independent control of the money supply. The FED controls the money supply and the FED is a private entity masquerading as a quasi gov't organization. The banks own the FED and dictate policies that favor them. 
\- The FED should be banned from using "Federal" in their name. And considering how much power they wield, they should be made transparent. Who are the shareholders and be open to audits. But this will not happen because they are too powerful to let it happen.

It is about control of monetary system. Fiat system is rigged to benefit banks and rich. 
Bitcoin is neutral monetary system. Coins are not rigged to benefit rich. 
Rest of ur statements are largely valid. There will be rich and poor still but it is not rigged for banks to get easy money to earn int of the masses.
Also no hidden tax from systemic printing of money.

You totally miss the btc concept. 
The end game is to be able to use btc on its own without converting to fiat. Pay direct using btc only. Goal is for btc to become the global currency.  At that point, the relevance of any fiat hyperinflation is irrelevant to value of btc other than probably create more demand for btc. 
Btc cannot hyperinflation because it is deflationary, built into code.

A lot of what you say has merit. But a speech with a similar tone can easily be found 2 years ago, 5 years ago, etc. 
The song remains the same, but here we are ... not dead yet ... ;-)
I've actually given some thought about merchant adoption/accepting crypto. A huge amount is riding on Lightning Network becoming user friendly and the infrastructure built out over the next year. But the questions remain:
1) will merchants accept crypto?
2) will ppl use crypto to make purchases? 
\ - I think there is a reasonable chance. Merchants are by large driven by profit. Groceries have razor thin (1-2
%) profit margins. If they can increase margins by 1% by ppl paying in crypto vs using credit cards, the merchants will be greatly incentivized to promote and encourage the usage of crypto. Many may see a viable path and try. Also, there are other benefits such as no charge backs. With respect to volatility, that can be managed by using a service to convert crypto to fiat right away. 
\ - I think the bigger question is, will ppl en masse use crypto to make purchases? The initial answer is no. When someone can use a credit card, get 1-2% back, not pay for 20-30 days (no interest loan), get fraud protection, and it's easy to use and accepted everywhere, then why will the average person want to use crypto? The answer is they Will Not. - So a key factor for  to happen is that merchants will have to be the ones to drive the perception and cultural change. They will be driven by profits themselves. Maybe they run promotions, maybe they offer a discount for crypto purchases, etc. But I think the only way for mainstream society ( in modern countries such as the USA), will be if the merchants help drive this change. 
It is a tricky path, but I do see a way for it to happen. But definitely not an easy path. And for you, it doesn't really matter if I prove correct. Because my theory, if I turn out to be correct, will take time. And as an astute trader, you will see the tell tale signs along the way and pivot your position as needed. Or if I am wrong, then you can continue to ride your short position even lower. 
I guess my point is, the long term viability of bitcoin will reside in its usefulness. Its usefulness is greatest if used as a currency. I'm hoping that Lightning provides a path for this ... let's see what happens over the next year. 
These are interesting times ... cheers !

Seriously doubt that 5 more years is enough to declare bitcoin victory. We will be lucky to gain merchant traction by then. There is so much tech infrastructure that still needs to be built out. 
Also before bitcoin wins, there will be a big push back by banks at some point. That will be a tough fight legislatively, etc

Why do you keep talking about protocol? GS built nothing on top of bitcoin. They give "access" and charge 20-30% premium to newbies via their fund. 
Yes it is a free market and if ppl are willing to pay high, GS is allowed to do that. That has nothing to do with the Bitcoin protocol. **It is US laws that allow/disallow GS selling shares for their fund, not the Bitcoin protocol.** 
The Bitcoin ethos that I speak of is what you keep trying to argue for. It is a neutral protocol, yes. It is the closest thing to neutral money that was ever created. It is designed to be the people's money where control is not mandated by any gov't, organization, or rich person. **It is designed to be fair ...** 
I don't consider a 20-30% premium to be fair nor neutral. I simply said that I am not a fan ... if you are OK with some douche bag company that pillages newbies, I guess that is your prerogative. 
And there is NO way that GS has a couple hundred million customers. And billions who don't have access? What kind of Bitcoin access are u talking about? You don't control the private keys. You cannot move the bitcoin around. You cannot buy something with the bitcoin shares that you have thru GS. The only thing you do is pay a hefty premium and hope the prices goes up to drive the share prices up and then to sell the shares later. Nothing wrong with that if all you want to do is profit on a bitcoin price move. Oh right, but for that $1000, you only get $800 worth bitcoin instead of the near $1000 you could get elsewhere. 
I'm not debating whether GS is allowed to do what they do. Clearly they are within US laws to do so (again, Bitcoin protocol has no relevance in this discussion). 
Going all the way back to my first statement ... the way GS is structured goes entirely against the ethos of Bitcoin (what it was designed to be), thus I am not a fan.

Deficits. Bitcoin doesn’t help or change it. The point is that bitcoin is a hedge against what is seemingly a big fiat crash coming. The crash is coming because of continued deficits that drive unfettered money creation/printing.

So the cost of time, effort, exchange fees (which are pretty minor), is for the sake of helping to get bitcoin transactions some traction. **In the long run, it is actually in line with your own self interest** because (since you are holding bitcoin) you want its value to increase. 
The ultimate driver of long term success of bitcoin is utility/usage &gt; which drives demand. By doing what I suggest, you help that cause in the early days to help show the world that people are willing to transact in commerce with bitcoin.

" rare and epic risk versus reward  "
\- Agree. In "theory and on paper", bitcoin wins ... IMO ... but the practical realities often throw a sidewinder that derails what looks great on paper.
So while there is tremendous upside, there is def risk ...
My gut instinct is that within 1-2 generations (25-50 years), the shit is going to hit the fan. As the US national debt creeps north of $35 trillion, the value of the dollar will erode severely as well as the confidence in the US gov't to continue servicing its debt.
At the moment, IMO, only gold and bitcoin are viable hedges. And between the two, bitcoin offers superior risk/reward. Gold may serve to be the better hedge in terms of stability, but in terms of risk/reward, there is no contest.
There is always constant chatter about the possibility of a better crypto that displaces Bitcoin. A better one may one day be drawn up but BTC is already building a large moat via the network effect. It will be very hard to displace. Not to mention that if there is ever a truly better idea, at the end of the day, Bitcoin is software and the code is malleable (based on community consensus).
There are always naysayers who say, "bitcoin will one day have a bad ending." Seriously, lol ... my response is simple: "the US dollar will one day have a bad ending ..."
There are two things driving my personal thesis ...
1. Jameson Lopp once stated: \[the way to make a better bitcoin is to improve bitcoin\]. Very well said ... ;-)
2. I hold Warren Buffet in very high regard. But with respect to Bitcoin, IMO, I hold the position: "Mr Buffet, I respectfully disagree" ... with reason.
God speed ... ;-)

This sounds logically spot on ... so JJW pays taxes on his $5k in gambling winnings for year 2019. 
But in the future, it can be confusing ... imagine if JJW hodls his 1.25 bitcoin he won. Two years later, the price rises and LN is prevalent. Bitcoin is popular as a currency. JJW starts to spend his 1.25 bitcoin using LN. Buy some starbucks coffee, buy a sofa from [overstock.com]( buy some clothes using LN, etc. 
How the hell does JJW keep track of profits, for tax purposes, as he spends his BTC over multiple purchases? It is just not practically possible. Let's say JJW is a super nit and does track everything. Great for him, but I guarantee that for mainstream in general, this is an impossible task. 
IMO, the IRS will need to change the rules for crypto. The tax rules were made a century ago when there was no concept of a digital currency such as bitcoin. The tax rules will not fit with how bitcoin is bought and used. Currently, it is like they are trying to shove a square into a round hole. Sooner or later, they will either have to go after 95% of crypto users or face reality ...

Never say never. 
A nation state could have resources to do it. What if the western world adopted bitcoin and it was nipping at the borders of Russia and China. They do an outright ban, but of course, determined citizens can find ways via VPNs, etc. 
And the attrition is beginning to scare them as they know, if it became widely adopted within their borders, it would reduce their iron fisted control. Hence, the attack to destroy ... well, maybe this is a bit far fetched ... 
But the reality is that the attack, whomever it comes from, doesn't necessarily have to care about destroying bitcoin. They can create a huge short position via futures and options. Then conduct a massive attack. They only need to do enough to cause panic and a significant drop in price. Then they cover their short positions for a massive windfall and hide away ... until they want to do it again ... 
With the onset of financial products, there is now a "financial incentive" ... 
So there are at least 2 incentives ... 1) financial and 2) power/control.

I'd give you 10 up points if I could. Excellent post. Just a few counters ... 
" Debt is good. Runaway debt is not good  "
\- Where do you think the US debt is? IMO, it is a runaway train ... possibly the greatest threat to national security. There is a very reasonable chance that a democrat will win 2020. So many of  them have socialism written on their faces that it is kind of scary. If a democrat wins, buckle your seat belt as the US debt flies to the moon. Please understand that I'm not advocating Trump as he is def a threat to national security as well ... 
"  the thing about debt is that as long as payments are being made....no one cares. raising the debt from 12 to 20 trillion will not bankrupt the US as example. "
\- The US has to keep selling new bonds to finance their ever growing debt and to pay maturing bonds. One day, there may not be enough buyers of the new debt ... IMO, this can happen within 1-2 generations (25-50 years). BTW, there's another word for this setup, it's called a ponzi.

No one is stating the major reason for custodial services. At the institutional level, most investment firms are required to use a custodial service to hold their assets. CS helps to audit/deter fraud by investment firms. 
That is why coinbase, fidelity, and others are offering CS. It is not for the regular investors like us. The service is for large investment firms who run 10's of millions or higher. 
A firm like Galaxy Digital (all crypto fund) uses Fidelity for CS because CS is required by the SEC.

Excellent question. 
My take is that the fiat system is far too controlled by those in power who want control for their benefit. 
Govt prints money as they see fit eroding its value. Banks control the fed branches, thereby influencing the int rate. 
It is always the poor who suffer in the end. 
Bitcoin turns upside down the current paradigm of how money is created, how it is spent, and who controls it. It is a complete infrastructure inversion that is unprecedented in history. 
It is powerful ideas that drive bitcoin. If it was primarily driven by greed and not much on these ideas, it would have fallen apart already as a house of cards. 
Yet here it is. Nearly 10 years and getting stronger. 
Only time will tell if nakamoto deserves a Nobel prize or if bitcoin turns out to be the biggest bubble in history. I’m rooting for the former.

Why stop at Starbucks? Every company that relies on cc ands wants to lower the middleman cut will have incentive to encourage users to pay in crypto.

There is a mental barrier of btc at 20 k or higher. It is intimidating for newcomers and it looks really sucky to buy .10 btc for $2k. 
I think for continued mass consumer penetration, they need smaller denominations. 
Like 20 milliBits for $2k purchase or something like that. 
Else $20k bitcoin looks and feels like it is for institutions or rich ppl only. 
Reduce barriers to entry.

The model I'm hypothetically suggesting is that cc fees are 1.5 - 3% range. If, as you suggest, they cannot use LN  and even with some middle man doing BTC to fiat conversions, all costs inclusive, for less than 1.5%, then BTC as a payment system may completely fail. 
But I'm suggesting that where there is money to be made, if simply on volume, some clever entrepreneur will come up with a way to provide these services at way below 1.5%. So what if he has to process $1billion to make $5 million (0.5%). If the risk is low and there is money to be made, it will happen. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:53:53
Stocks. I think u are confused. If u use margin and buy stock, then u can possibly owe money. Otherwise u will not owe money even if stock goes to zero and company goes bankrupt.

" Debt based society is *not* necessary. "
That is true. And if you prefer that type of society, you can always move to Lancaster, PA and join the Amish people ... but then one day you wake up and realize that your desperate attempt to flee centralized and corruptible systems just hit a face palm. The Amish are run by a "centralized" authority figure/head pastor ... oh no ... ;-x
All kidding aside, the REALITY is that most people want the ability to buy things with debt. What sports fan doesn't want a 65 inch 4k TV now and be happy paying it off over the next 6 months? In your world, that person will have to save 6 months to get it. I don't think most of society, at least in the USA, will be happy in your scenario. 
So in all seriousness, your statement is theory only. Or a preference at best. 
" Debt based society is *not* necessary. "
I think that  the reality is that "Debt in modern society IS necessary" because that is what most people prefer. 
Also, this preference is not entirely just from a "I want it now" standard of living. It is also out of necessity. 
I agree that without fractional reserve lending system, prices of most things will come down. But let's think practically. A car will still have a big price tag. How to you get to work to begin saving for a car? You need the car asap, out of necessity, to make money to afford it. An auto loan is a very good solution to keep life moving. Without the current fractional reserve system, the pool of money to be lent out will be reduced by a huge factor (e.g., assuming the replacement system is to lend out bitcoin that is backed by bitcoin on a 1:1 basis). 
Overall, I agree with the OP's general thesis that the current system heavily favors the incumbent banks. Since the banks are the ones that created the FED, it is designed to protect/favor them. I would love to see a solution where that banking cartel is broken and replaced by a system that is more fair to the average citizen. However, that solution, I believe, still needs to include a form of debt that is reasonable to obtain. 
I don't know  what that solution will look like exactly, but a first step is probably to get rid of the FED.

Tuber, u are correct. Just read an article. Valid nonce range is up to about 4.3 billion. That can be ripped through quickly with mining pools. If no valid hash is found, the miner has different options. Use new timestamp, change transactions in the block, etc. All of these will change the base-hash. With a new base-hash, the miners then iterate thru the range of nonces again until a valid hash is found. If not found, repeat with new bash-hash. Thanks !

 - Did you factor in the elimination of the FED and fractional reserve banking (FRB) in your equation? 
Most Bitcoin proponents want to end the FED as well as FRB. 
The problem is that if you get rid of FRB, you will not achieve an equivalent supply of credit by switching from dollar to btc. Instead, you will suck the credit pool to a trickle if BTC loans have to be backed by real BTC on a 1:1 basis. Right now, I think the banks only need 5% of real deposits to generate another 95% in loans through FRB (someone please  correct me if this is not correct).

Hi. Let's say Bitcoin prevails and 50 years later, the entire banking fractional reserve banking structure is wiped out from earth. 
I'm trying to understand something. Whether we like it or not, the fact that banks are there to lend money creates opportunity. 
Without banks, how can I afford to buy a house if there is no bank to give a mortgage? 
How can I start a business if a bank doesn't lend me $80k to invest in a food truck and make good use of my culinary skills? Without that money, I am stuck working in a restaurant kitchen the rest of my life because I cannot ever come up with $80k. 
How can I even buy a $20k car in order to get to/from work without an auto loan from a bank? 
In the present system, banks are able to provide this credit access on a wide basis because of the fractional reserve system. 
In the bitcoin world, are you saying NO to fractional reserve lending? If so, how will that work? If a company lends out bitcoin and must provide "real" bitcoins, then that type of system will greatly reduce the availability of credit because of the limited supply of actual bitcoin. The reduction of available credit will limit what people want or is able to get. 
\&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm just a 2+2 guy trying to make sense of this. I'm trying to reconcile the practical reality of your proposed vision with the practical realities of what people want and need. &lt;&lt;&lt;

It was corruption PLUS what you say. 
All the f'ing rating agencies got paid to put a phony stamp of AAA on bonds that were toxic because if they didn't, they wouldn't get future business from the Wall Street (WS) firms. To avoid a serious dent to their revenue, the rating agencies sold out to the WS firms in order to prop up their business. That is corruption. 
W/ respect to the US gov't, I'm sure there was some. But it is harder to discern clearly. But just know Goldman Sachs had strong influence on politics/policies, etc. that allowed the 2008 train wreck to happen (e.g., persuading lawmakers to allow WS to increase leverage on bonds). Just look at who is Sec of Treasury. Another GS alum. GS has a lot of power and influence in DC. Overall, probably a big plus for WS but long term negative EV for main street.

Absolutely there is a place for debt. Not everyone wants to live in your debt free world concept. Some by choice and most by necessity. 
How do u get a $15k car without an auto loan? U can’t save 5 years for it because u need it now to get to work and earn money. That is a practical example that applies to nearly everyone. 
A diff example that applies to a lot of ppl is that in modern society, ppl want things now and will be happy to take on debt to do so. Many will pay some interest to get a nice 4K tv today versus saving 6 months for one.

Almost everything u say is true and correct TODAY. 
Short answer is to use a VC analogy. As a quarterback looking to pass, u don’t throw to where the receiver is now. U throw to where the receiver is running to. 
Long answer. With that, to appreciate bitcoin, u have to consider where it came from, where it is today, and where bitcoin is headed into the future. 
Seems like you just need to consider the future part more. 
Examples. Bakkt exchange coming. This is created by the owners of the New York stock exchange. Truly old school getting into a new game. They are bringing old rules to the new game. They are a good step towards reducing market manipulation, etc. at least in the us markets. 
Cc fees. Lightning network is in beta on the main net. Still not usable by mainstream but give it maybe 2 years. LN or some variation can pave the way towards mainstream usage. Think buy coffee, pay parking meter remote, or buy items online. Larger purchases like cars or houses will likely stay on Main net for awhile. Point is, the economics for a business to use LN to shave their cc fees from 2-3 percent to 1 percent or less  will compel many businesses to support it. 
Example is groceries. Their profit is razor thin. About 1 - 1.5% of sales. If they can boost profit by 1% just by getting customers to pay via LN, it is a no brainer. They will encourage ppl to use LN in order to double their profits. The groceries WILL HELP drive usage, IMO, because it will be in their best interest. 
So if u only look at where bitcoin is today and think that it will never improve and innovations will remain stagnant, then by all means, don’t buy and stay clear. But if u consider the ideas driving bitcoin and the future possibilities, then bitcoin is very  interesting. 
All that said, nobody truly knows where things will stand in 5 years. Just like me, we can only express our opinions. Let’s see what happens. ��

For large holders there will always be bitcoin at 20k. 
But for example A few months back, i wanted to buy $100 worth btc for niece. But it sucked to give her .001254 btc. Instead, although I preferred btc, I bought her 1.07 litecoin (when it was at 91). 
Just felt nicer and better to give her a whole coin of something rather than something that looks meager. They are same value technically but mentally a mile apart. For most ppl who have not bought crypto yet, they will have similar mental barrier. 
Also if u want mass consumer adoption, it would be stupid for coffee shops to say coffee is 0.000174 btc. They need to state coffee is 3.5 milliBit or something simple like that. Otherwise it is too confusing for general public.

Could be rogue country/org that hates bitcoin. Maybe a bank, who knows can have motivation to simply destroy bitcoin without care to price crashing. 
Or these days w futures trading. One can take a huge short position and try to cause temp or perm price crash. 
Maybe alt coin coder who competes w btc and wants to usurp it.

U guys don’t get it. The current tax laws are impossible for the masses to keep track of. If u are that one Anal person out of a thousand who can AND will keep track of all purchases using bitcoin and calc realized gains after a btc purchase, then God bless u. 
If u reply, but that is the law, then u are that one anal person out of a thousand. 
The reality is that it will be impossible for users on a mass basis, even if they want to stay within irs guidelines, to track everything. It will be confusing and huge burden. 
The reality is that irs needs to revamp and reconsider tax law on a whole new paradigm. 
The burden is really on them. Else they will get huge noncompliance by the masses. 
One possibility is to transition to a tax based on consumption. I dunno. All I can see is that current tax law is out of date w crypto. It needs revamping.

The only issue is that ach takes like 4 days for your usd to appear in coinbase acct.  keep that in mind as u plan ur purchases. 
If u want immediate market purchase u can w coinbase but u take a heavy hit on fees and spread. 
Cheapest route is wait 4 days to ach money. U can make ach request from gdax acct so it goes into gdax wallet. Otherwise u have to send usd from cb to gdax once received in ur cb acct. Not a big deal but small extra step that can be avoided. 
Once u get money to gdax, as some else explained, use limit order that doesnt execute immediately and your trans/purchase fee is zero. 
Good luck.

1. Banks. Lots of people say government. But at the root of it, it is the bankers wielding their influence on the government politicians.
Rest are not exactly enemies, more like impediments:
2. Ignorance - lack of understanding of how the banks are openly engaged in "legalized theft". A good understanding can help motivate people to tell politicians that we want neutral money
3. Complexity. For the average person (and less educated), it is still way too complex and confusing.
4. Lack of confidence in tech. If you are old money school, there is no way you will put in $1+ million into a tech that is just a decade old. Maybe another 5 years of no successful bitcoin blockchain hack + news flooding mainstream will give people more confidence in the tech.

Seriously, you just took one line totally out of context and tried to show how smart you are.
I was debating the OP's point where he suggested fair system is to (cut out banks) and just deposit the money into people's bank account for free.
I suggested that I do not agree with totally free. And to emphasize my point, I simply threw out some arbitrary numbers. I also agree on cutting out the banks, but instead of giving out money for free, just offer it a much lower interest, which will happen by cutting out the bankers.
How is cutting out the middle men (central bank) permanently an artificial means of keeping the interest rate low?  Amazon built an entire business based on cutting out the middle men and lowering prices.
Fine, let me restate. Instead of 4%, let it be based on market forces, but which will be greatly below 4%. Does that sound academically better?

" I'm curious why the banks are reluctant to lend one another "
I see your point now. Also, that is the true question that needs to be answered. It seems a mystery. One suggestion (per the news articles) is that banks had to pay taxes (I guess quarterly), but that doesn't make sense. Those kind of numbers should be well known and prepared for in advance. The banks either don't have the reserves (suddenly) to lend to each other or they consider holding the reserves very  precious at the moment ... 
The banks are very good on keeping the shades down. Wish we could just flip a switch to turn all their walls to glass for transparency ...

That is a very verbose way of saying that you like decentralization ... ;-)
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:19:47
I still don't understand how bitcoin transactions, directly on the bitcoin blockchain, can be commercially viable at scale. Without a 2nd layer of some sort, the only way to do instant transactions/approvals is to go the zero confirm route. Otherwise, the customer has to wait up to 10 min if the threshold is 1 confirmation and longer if more confirmations are needed. Granted maybe coffee shops can risk zero confirm transactions. But any merchant wanting to engage in higher amount transactions (a bit arbitrary but say $30 and higher) cannot risk zero confirms, can they? 
Thus, to work commercially at scale, a 2nd layer is needed. It can be LN, or maybe Bakkt creates an effective layer 2 that merchants trust and use. OK, users then have to trust Bakkt, but I'm willing to throw down $40 to try them out if they can build out the infrastructure (which I assume they are trying to do as an initial step with Starbucks). 
I disagree that the biggest impetus for LN to proceed are high trans fees. That is only part of the picture. LN is needed for instant transactions AND to offload the high growth of the blockchain size (should bitcoin usage be heavily commercialized). As we build layers, we may have to begin trading off some decentralization and perhaps security. But if there are bad issues at layer 2, the users can refuse to use and fall back to bitcoin layer, etc. 
Thoughts appreciated ...

 It blows my mind that even CNBC staffers do not understand bitcoin. At 3:15, why would anyone own bitcoin vs dollar? The answer is TRUST. The only thing propping up the dollar "house of cards" is trust, which erodes with each new easy batch of money print. IF bitcoin succeeds, people will own bitcoin because it is an alternative system of monetary trust. And they will trust the bitcoin algorithm over the central bank algorithm. - if CNBC reporters don't understand the root nature of bitcoin, oh boy, how long will mass adoption take? It will take time ... education is Key.

Hi. Can you help to clear up some fog for me (and possibly others)?
A joins LN with 3 btc. 
B joins LN with 3 btc. 
C joins LN with 3 btc ... and so on. Thought is actually hundreds of users but let's just use 3 to keep things simple. 
Joe's Coffee shop is also connected to LN. 
Over a week's time, A spends .5 btc (i know it's huge, but just work with me please ;-). 
B spends 1 btc. 
C spends 1 btc. 
Total week's revenue for Joe's Coffee shop is 2.5 btc.
Joe needs to cash out to pay weekly salaries (employees want dollars). Ok, so here's where it gets a little foggy for me. 
I asked something similar in diff thread. Ppl posted that Joe doesn't need to close his node to cash out. He can send 2.5 btc to a payment processor (PP) who will take the btc and pay Joe dollars. Does this sound ok so far? If not, please explain likely scenario of how Joe eventually cashes out BTC to pay employees. 
Assuming the payment processor sells the 2.5 BTC for cash (to restock the cash paid out to Joe), how does that 2.5 btc get reconciled on the bitcoin blockchain? I'm trying to find the connection of how User A's 0.5 btc transfer to PP is tracked on the blockchain. Same for B and C. 
I would think (not being an expert), that 3 transactions are needed. 
Trans1 to show user A sent .5 btc to PP. 
Trans2 to show user B sent 1 btc to PP.
Trans3 to show user C sent 1 btc to PP. 
But this doesn't seem right because I see X number of transactions (when the payment processor cashes out BTC) that originated from X number of users. Imagine 200 customers at Joe's and PP sells BTC from 200 users. Will there be 200 transactions on the blockchain? That doesn't seem efficient. 
Can anyone clear up:
1) what is the likely scenario 
2) how the coins get tracked on the LN when it moves from A to Joe to PP, etc.
3)why the chain won't get bogged down with hundreds of transactions when PP cashes out BTC?

jane street is a quant firm. they will look to make money based on movements and trends. directional trading. not long term holders like bill miller style. pretty sure they don't give a rat's ass about bitcoin ideologies such as decentralization, power back to the people, etc. 
right now, with a btc downtrend, they may have been of no help to bitcoin holders and perhaps, could have contributed to the downtrend as they unloaded long positions and took a bear bias and entered short btc position via futures.      
point being, this only serves to prove that wall street is interested in trading bitcoin and nothing more. this may or may not be of benefit to bitcoin holders. it is a benefit only if the wall street trader is looking to buy long term. This type of trader, at the moment is rare, as it is in the nature of all traders to tread caution on any extremely volatile assets, such as bitcoin.
this article, to me, is slightly positive, but hrmm, on second thought, probably more indeterminate than anything else.
if you say it is long term fundamental traders that view btc as a solid long term investment, that is bullish news. 
but if you say a quant firm wants to trade bitcoin, well, i dunno what the hell ... who knows ... probably not that bullish in reality for the reasons cited.

"Economy needs a healthy amount of inflation (1-2%) to aid money spending, thus keep moving forward."

2) Now think on a practical level. Say you have $1000 in the bank. When was the last time you thought, "OK, I better go spend or invest that money because it will be worth $990 in one year."
No one thinks like that. Poor people spend that $1000 because they need to pay bills. 
Rich people will invest that $1000 because that is the logical thing to do (grow their wealth).

My response was to the impediments of bitcoin adoption, not necessarily impediments to gaining wealth. But I understand your point ...
I guess half the point I was trying to make is that it is too complex to use. Today, email and text messages can be done by a 10 year old. They need to make it that easy. The UI issues can be solved. 
But the other half involves steps like getting the bitcoin, keeping it safe, for larger amounts maintaining a safe way to store and pass down to kin, etc. These steps can be confusing ... so I think while the key ethos of bitcoin is to be your own sovereign bank, I think there is a place in the world for institutional custodians. 
The point is people can choose ...

Crypto is meant to disrupt and replace money transfer services such as western union. 
The current hurdle is the last mile. Receivers still need to convert to their local fiat. This has not been solved. But the ultimate solution is to reach a point where they do not need to convert.

This. 
At some point, there will be a big fight. It will be banks against the people. The govt will be involved insofar as far as the banks influences can reach. 
It will be a difficult fight just because the banks are powerful. Money talks and they have plenty to throw around. 
Bitcoin has a chance because it is neutral money. Once people are educated to the two sides, central banks vs bitcoin, only a grassroots support via the people can bitcoin win at the legislative level. Bitcoin is the people’s money. 
Education is key. 
I would say probably at $50k, banks will circle their wagons and begin a concerted pushback. They will prob also turn into patent trolls at some point. They have been building a war chest of blockchain patents. They will use lawyers to stifle the ecosystem of startups.

You are the one being naive. Let's say in your reality, that miners were forced to change the rules and use a different algorithm. All nodes outside China would not switch to the new algorithm. In effect, the reality of your vision is that a fork would happen. 
Bitcoin would still continue to operate in the world (less China). 
A new bitcoin (let's call it Bitcoin-CH) will emerge which no one outside China would accept nor use.

I've watched a few of these CNBC videos on bitcoin where they bring on industry experts. I always feel like the industry people "get it" (obviously since they are in it) and that the CNBC reporters/analysts are still struggling to understand/figure it out.
There is one CNBC reporter (Joe Kernan, MIT grad) who used to be a skeptic. But about a year or so ago, he said that on a scale of 1 to 5, that he is now a solid 4.5 bitcoin supporter ... ;-)

2008 was an issue of fraud. Toxic MBS bonds ... when the music stopped playing, game was over. There was no money backing the bonds ... plain and simple, fraud and greed led to 2008, not a lack of trust. 
My theory on overnight repos problem is probably a big bank X is having short term liquidity problems. The other banks smell blood in the water so they are withholding their normal lending. Either withholding outright or charging exorbitant fees (e.g., 10%). So bank X went begging to Uncle Sam to help. And Uncle Sam is stepping in to relieve/saving that banks liquidity issues.

I considered Nevada. Actually got a job there but got cold feet. A big part was that I was about to start a family and didn't think Vegas was best place to raise a kid. So ended up in the great state of Georgia (have some relatives here and knew the cost of living was very good). 
In GA, the real estate prices have gone up 20% over the past 4 years. The housing market here is tight. But even still, my house would easily go double the price in SoCal. 
I do miss being near the ocean (landlocked here) and a few other things. But overall, it was a good move on our part long term.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:58:35
I completely empathize with you OP. You said enough so I know you understand the risk/reward scenario. Also, you know exactly the cost of living in Cali, etc. since you live there. One thing you didn't mention so I'll say it ... in addition to your financial plans, you should consider moving out of Cali. 
The weather truly is awesome and if you live near the beach (enuf said !). But I speak from experience, I moved out of Southern California because the cost of living was too damn high. For me, it was definitely the right move ... 
I like your play on Bitcoin. There is still considerable risk, but you are young and you have one advantage ... youth and time on your side in case Bitcoin doesn't work out.

@_date: 2019-09-12 17:04:18
Excellent. You see it as I do, except for one point.
" A truly fair method, would be to just deposit the QE money into every citizen's personal bank account. This way everybody gets to use the new money first (essentially some form of UBI). "
I'm still on the notion that things should not be freely handed out. I'm against free tuition at public colleges, etc. Keep costs low/reasonable, but not totally free.
As you state, the banks are just middle men. If they are cut out, why can't consumers still get loans, but just at a much better rate. It will still benefit consumers. So instead of 4% for a mortgage, let it be 1.5%. Create a gov't organization that runs this. The interest can keep this unit self running.
Everything else, I agree with you. 
BTW, for people to truly appreciate Bitcoin and a key part of its purpose, they need to be educated on all your points here. Well, except where you and I differ can be stated differently. Education is KEY. 
Thank you for posting !

The most important thing to remember is to save copy or two of your seed words. Write them down and keep them safe. 
Reason is if u lose ur hardware wallet, etc, u lose access to ur private keys. But you can recreate ur private keys using your seed words on any bitcoin compatible wallet. 
Therefore, if u lose hard wallet AND u lose ur seed words, then ur btc is lost forever. 
Make sense?
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:01:43
Difference is seed can recreate a tree of keys in a deterministic manner. Easier to save a seed that can recreate many keys than saving 5 keys as u create and use them. Then when u create 5 more and use, now u have to back them up as well. And so on. 
If u plan to use one or only a few addresses then what u say makes sense. 
A seed can recreate the same tree of keys each time. Easier to manage if u use multiple addresses for privacy purposes, etc

I was in the exact same predicament as OP. Lower amt but large for me. Timing is uncanny too. My Next Day wires were sent 5/31 and 6/1.
Guys, the key point here is that you CAN ONLY DO SAME DAY WIRE TRANSFERS FROM BANK OF AMERICA (BOA) TO COINBASE.  The BOA website offers Same Day, Next Day, and 3 Day options, but Next day and 3 day are ACH based. Coinbase only accepts Same Day wires. 
*** Now, if Coinbase would put that in the Wire section on gdax in bold red letters, that would be a good thing. 
Long story short, I was ready to call the San Fran police. The night before, I decided to call BOA to make sure I understood their process clearly before calling SFP the next day. Lo and behold, the BOA rep says that they can help. They have a non-fraud wire division (877-337-6703) to help in these situations. After waiting an hr on hold, I talked to a rep for 5 minutes. He said they would initiate a request to Metropolitan bank (this is Coinbase's bank) to reverse my 2 transactions and that the process was pretty standard. He said it would take about 10 days total. I expect the money returned within a week's time of this post. 
So I am not sure why the BOA rep told OP that BOA could not initiate a reverse transaction. Maybe it's not standard and you have to talk to someone in the non-fraud wire division. 
That's my story. Pretty damn frustrating. My plan was to submit to BBB (I did), call the SF police, the FBI, and the California Atty General. I only did step 1. Hopefully, I get my money back shortly. Will update if I do not. 
Summary:  1) Only wire SAME DAY to Coinbase. I actually did this before and it hit my account by 8 pm same day. Was impressed. $30 BOA fee and $10 GDAX fee. 
2) You can't rely on Coinbase support. If stuck in this type situation, contact BOA non-fraud wire dept at 877.337.6703 and BOA can initiate a reverse transfer.
@_date: 2017-07-05 03:38:45
 - I just posted a reply to OP. In case you can't find the post, call BOA non-fraud wire dept at 877-337-6703. They can initiate reverse transaction request with Metropolitan (CB's bank). Will take 10 days but hey, better than the wall you're hitting with CB. Good luck !
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:55:33
My general guidelines:
If you buy $100 bitcoin on coinbase, I woudn't worry about it.
If you buy $500 bitcoin on CB, then I'd consider a hard wallet.
If you buy $1000+ bitcoin on CB, then I'd get a hard wallet and move my core (long term holdings) there.
[Ledger.com]( sells for $59 (not bad) for a nano S.  Buy direct from their website, not from amazon nor ebay. Your credit card might flag it because Ledger is located in France. Just call them (cc company) to clear it.
But then, it also depends on if you plan to trade a lot on coinbase pro. I would not send BTC back and  forth from coinbase and your hard wallet. Like I said, just move your long term/core holdings to your hard wallet.
Bottom line: always remember, **not your keys, not your bitcoin**. That is the main point to understand when trying to decide the above.

Ledger live shows what's on your account. But if you try to send btc, manage portfolio, etc. on the the Ledger Live app, it asks for you to connect your nano device and put your PIN in. So Ledger live app is safe w/ respect to anyone trying to steal your bitcoin. This is because your private keys are safely stored on your nano device only. 
So since only you know the PIN to your nano device ... you should be good.
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:52:54
Here's my simplified view. Bitcoin changes 3 things. 
1) The way money is created.
2) The way money is spent. 
3) Who controls money. 
Bitcoin turns all of these upside down. The most rooted answer to why Bitcoin was created is  It is about control. Bitcoin takes control away from all centralized authorities. That is huge and IMO, it is probably the most relevant reason.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:02:57
At this point, it is what it is. 
What matters is control. That is the crucial diff. That will be relevant factor in future. 
If u understand fed and fractional banking, bitcoin can put an end to that. Hopefully what emerges is a better lending system without banks practically minting money at buyers expense. 
There will still be lending interest etc. 
but current system favors banks thru a rigged system. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:18:35
My sentiments exactly. Except the shaking ppl part. Rather not touch them. ��
I think that is part of the issue. Most ppl do not understand the problems w current fiat system. Hence they don’t consider that bitcoin is an alternative system of monetary trust.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:12:12
Whether you want them involved or not, there is no choice. They will be involved. 
But that does not take away or diminish Bitcoin's decentralized nature. This is very important to know that Wall Street cannot control the bitcoin monetary system the way they do the USD. Hrmmm, as I say that, that is not entirely true. Right now, the price can still be manipulated. But once bitcoin's value gets large enough and is held more broadly, then that will also reduce WS power to manipulate price.

Bakkt futures, if approved will be btc settled. 
Entire point of bakkt is that spreacher, owner of ice and nyse, firmly believes that there is much demand for crypto in an environment and in a form that institutions can ready begin dipping their toes in. 
U say u hear apathy from fund managers. He says completely otherwise. Spreacher has an ear very close to Wall Street. He is very sharp engineer at heart. He sees a prob and pushes hard to fix. 
At the end of the day maybe u are right. But until the dust settles I like bakkt entry. Let’s see what happens. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 04:08:43
The cheapest is something like [Electrum.org]( (free).
But paying for another ledger device, for me, was worth it. Long story short, went back and forth with support. Finally, they asked me to make/send a video of what I was doing. I stopped at this point ... bleh ... too much work/effort.
Along the way, I bought another nano S (just $59 now, not bad since I paid about $100 over a year ago for my first).
Was pain inputting seed into device. Choose Restore option (not new setup) and be sure to enter seed words into USB device (not Ledger Live UI). If the UI asks for seed words, that is a scam UI app.
I was glad to see the seed entry on a new device worked. So now, I have some peace of mind. The extra $59 was worth it for me ...

It is the Ponzi scheme point of view. Not about bitcoin but about the dollar. The fed prints more money out of thin air to service both the national debt and also the yearly USA budget deficits. 
It is weird but the fed prints magic money and buys the treasury bonds from the treasury. It is like the USA takes magic money from its left pocket and puts it into its right pocket. Now the right pocket owes the left pocket trillions. But it is Uncle Sam that wears the same pants with both pockets. 
Point being dollar is ponzi. And fed printing money continues unstoppable inflation train that will wreck the nation within 1-2 generations. 
Bitcoin is an alternative system of monetary trust. Maybe it is not the final or best answer. But it is definitely an alternative that ppl need to understand better and consider. 
That’s the relevance of bitcoin to op post.

Look huckleberry. Freedom is about who has control. Privacy may be a part of it. But control of the system is what u are completely missing. Control of the system can offer more privacy than the idea hiding ur financial transactions.

Riddle me this. 
I use cc to buy something. I get insurance against fraud or bad product. I get 1-2% back meaning I make money using cc. It is fast and easy and can be used everywhere. I don’t have to pay up to 30 days. 
It is like I get paid to borrow money short term. Sounds like a good deal. 
Now let’s try btc. I use btc to buy something. 
If I spend $100 btc and btc doubles in 6 months, I just paid 200 for that item. Instead of making money by spending btc, I can lose a lot of money spending btc. 
It is not fast nor is it easy nor is it spendable in too many places. And worst of all there is no insurance against fraud or accidental mis-click on my part. 
When given theses two options, why will society choose to use btc vs cc? Maybe long term as many of your concerns become more and more apparent. But in short term 5-10 years, let’s just limit scope to all modern societies, why will ppl use btc instead of cc on a mass basis?
Can I or anyone answer this riddle about bitcoin?

A lot of ppl do not understand etf. 
There are 2 kinds being proposed. Most etf will trade futures (which are settled in cash, not btc) to track the price. This will not affect btc supply/demand so much unless futures are on bakkt exchange (where they will settle in actual btc)
Other etf, I think VanEck, etf will be backed by actual btc. An etf of this type will throw btc into the sky. 
I think out of about 9 etf proposals, only one is the latter type.

If u can come down to 3-5%, that seems reasonable for atm convenience. But I have no idea what kind of volume u will get so not sure if U can be profitable in that range. 
I guess range u pick depends on ur reasons for having btc atm. If it is pure profit U will obviously go as high as the market will bear.
Also will ur atm require any kyc? If it is completely anonymous then I can see value for user and u can go a little higher than 5%.

They have bought a ton of bitcoin to run it up massively just before the futures market opened. Then it is easy manipulation/payday time as they take massive short futures positions and then dump bitcorn. Rinse and repeat a few times and who needs bitcorn to go to a million to make a fortune?

But you young'un's just don't seem to understand that even if I thought Bitcorn was the most amazing tech ever created, the fact that it is "so easily" manipulated and volatile scares the living pants off my scrawny butt. No way any of my precious retirement fund is going to touch any of that magic money. As you have seen, magic money can disappear quickly like \*poof\* ... gone.

By the way bitcoin is not about helping poor ppl get rich while excluding rich ppl from same opportunity. 
Bitcoin is about creating neutral control over money so that the rich do not rig system that favors them to make money vs poor. 
That is very important. No matter time and place the rich always try to protect their castles w rules that often do not benefit poor. Bitcoin tries to neutralize this.

Mostly, I just wanted to see if anyone had a practical answer to the riddle. 
I think that, in the short term at least, the riddle is a legit question/concern for btc adoption/usage in mainstream commerce? Your comments "seem open" to this obstacle.  
" In the near future, they might not. Until Visa censors certain businesses, or businesses can eliminate the \~3.5% merchant fee and use that service to offer better prices and innovate their service to better serve the customer. "
Think of it purely from a consumer's perspective. The average consumer doesn't care about details behind the scenes. They don't care if the merchant is charged 1-3% or who is really footing the bill for insurance, etc. The consumer only wants a good deal. 
And the good deal for the foreseeable future (next 3-5 years) is that CC usage outweighs LN usage. 
But things can change. If LN infrastructure is built out and businesses are able to replace CC network with btc/LN network to reduce their fees, then they could work hard to get customers to transition over to crypto usage. Part of it can be small discounts early on to get ppl to transition over, etc. But I think the incentives have to come from businesses who see benefits of consumers using crypto over CC. If it ever happens, the businesses will be the pioneers to solve the riddle. 
But until a solution is paved to solve the riddle, I do think that CC has a built in defense that will be incredibly difficult to overcome. Namely, consumers will use whatever deal is best. 
This being said, LN will get users. Some will use for its cool/novel factor. Others will use btc and replenish their stash right away. But unless the practical riddle is solved, these 2 groups will account for less than 10% (arbitrary number on my part) of society. Meaning that 90% (IMO) or most of mainstream consumers stay with CC. 
Lastly, the context for the riddle is in reference to adoption of btc as a currency.

Many things u say makes sense. Think of it this way. 
For me bitcoin is an alternative system of monetary trust. In long run do u trust govt controlled fiat which is open to abuse corruption mismanagement or would u rather trust in bitcoin which represents neutral and “fair” money. 
It is a choice. And u vote by using either  dollar or bitcoin. I don’t think the future for dollar bodes well. My biggest concern is runaway national debt. So for now I have some bitcoin as a long term hedge. Ok ok I hope it rises as well but regardless I am voting. 
Think of it as a long stretched out election process. I think it is foolish to think that btc replaces fiat any time soon. But w respect to how u perceive the future of fiat, u can vote on your preference.

All source code is open and on GitHub. However u need to know c++ programming language since that is what bitcoin core is coded in. 
If u are starting from scratch in IT, c++ may be tough. 
I would imagine there might be some c ++ videos on YouTube so u can take a look. 
Oh yeah, some knowledge of cryptography will be needed as well. U can def find YouTube vids on that.

Ok this might be another ignorant statement. If they want to use as store of value, can’t someone clever just smuggle in lots of US dollars and sell dollars (at a mark up)? Value would hold up better than bitcoin ( at least over past year).

ETF is not a scam. Bullshit perhaps. But this bullshit will be the bridge between a crapload of Wall Street money and Bitcoin. Right now, a crapload of regulations prevent WS fund managers from flirting with BTC directly. But an ETF that has the SEC blessing can become a hot security. And WS funds allowed to buy SEC sanctioned securities. 
Think of ETF as a small doorway through which all that pent up WS money suddenly meets bitcoin. I'm referring to a physically backed ETF. 
If a physically backed EFT gets approved, it will be a dream scenario for the btc speculators. 
For HODLERS, I think there is still benefit in that Bitcoin gets huge WS exposure and acceptance. It gains huge credibility as an asset. That can help to open a lot of doors with other nations and foreign funds. The global exposure helps to position Bitcoin as a global asset/currency. The uses cases will then filter down to retail levels. A boost in price will naturally drive the motivation of the people building the infrastructure. 
As long as Bitcoin can remain true to its decentralized nature, then I don't mind this forward progress. 
Lastly, bitcoin advocates want price stability. That will not happen until the global market is saturated. WS money getting involved, for better or worse, is part of the global market getting saturated. It is a necessary component for the path to saturation, at which point, we can achieve btc price stability.

Well said. You touch on a lot of valid points. But one thing that everyone seems to miss (or at least fail to mention) is what Bitcoin really boils down to.
It is an alternative system of trust.
An alternative to the incumbent fiat system. It is so ironic that all the bitcoin naysayers say that bitcoin will eventually have a bad ending. Because we can say the exact same thing about the dollar. The dollar, over the next generation or two (25-50 years), will get so shredded from central control/manipulation, that it will be in a bad position.
Right now, the national debt is a runaway train that continues to gain momentum. Within the next 2 generations, it will spiral out of control.
The FED can't help but fill the role of a band-aid every time there is an economic crisis by printing more money.
I can go on and on about the problems of the incumbent dollar system.
One day (within 50 years probably), when the shit hits the fan and the confidence of the almighty dollar is on the precipice of fracturing, what can people do? They better hope that there is an alternative ...
That is what Bitcoin is ... it is an alternative system of trust for money. Do you trust the dollar will survive another 50 years and beyond? With respect to an investment thesis, how about simply viewing Bitcoin as a hedge? With respect to the intrinsic value (IV) argument, times are changing my friend. For me, I take a more modern twist to IV. I place a lot of value in the Bitcoin infrastructure (it is one hell of a tech achievement), its current market leading network effect (yes, there is definitely value in network effect), and the intrinsic hope of money neutrality that Bitcoin may one day provide.
Cheers ... ;-)

True. But a large part of reason is that it is not easy to spend bitcoin yet. 
Build it and ... ok hopefully they come. Talking about LN. once infrastructure is built and if they don’t come. Ok then it is uh oh time. 
But all this bitcoin not used to buy goods is a premature argument. Not saying it will happen but it is still a large unknown and a matter to see.

Look here young man. Let's you and I understand something. I only have 15-20 years left. Do you think that I nor any of my comrades are ready to put our hard earned dollars at risk into something that is inherently risky and volatile? Maybe you missed that day when risk management was taught in college. As one gets older, it is prudent to take less risk (unless one has gobs of money to play around with).
No siree, I need my remaining funds as they are to continue paying my bills.
You young-un's think you know it all. You blame us old folks as being naive or ignorant. It is you who knows not. Put yourself in our shoes and you would be a fool to start toying in something that drops 80% value in 10 months.
And why the hell would I send 250k to someone in a remote/sanctioned country? You've been watching too much Breakin' Bad or something.

I don’t get how this works. U pay in btc. Then u want to leave quickly within minute. 
How quickly can store find out if ur btc is valid or not. It does not happen quick, right? The whole point of LN is to solve this transaction validation speed issue. Well and offloading a ton of trans writes to main chain. 
If a user sends invalid btc, how soon can store know?
I guess same question applies to Japan stores that accept btc.

" Comparing crypto to the internet is ridiculous.  "
You completely miss their point. They are just saying, at a high level:
\- new technology
\- most do not get/understand it
\- some (posters here) sense (while not completely understanding at an expert level), but they are able to connect enough dots and their guts tell them the writing is on the wall, you are now seeing the birth of the future
\- they take steps to invest (if possible)
\- later down the road, looking back, it seems obvious that they would be here.
This is the high level comparison between the birth of crypto and the birth of the internet. It is not ridiculous ...
