This makes me happy.
Are you guys in touch with coinbase too?

It is important that we do something as soon as possible, and I will try my best to explain why in this post. Please read on.


Yes, but being future proof means acting in the present in order to prepare for the future - not waiting for the future to catch up with you before acting. Foresight.


Ok, here is the best place for me to make my point. Waiting for the future to come before making a change is the wrong move because it shifts the impact from a small group of people to a larger group, can potentially stunt growth, and sets the precedent of Bitcoin not doing everything it can to be as good as it can in the present moment. 
In essence, we are laying the foundation for the future that we wish to see. Waiting is not an option. Once it is time for the new terms to be used, it will be too late to make that type of change. 
Besides, if you have been keeping up with the origin of this idea, we have been waiting for at least half a year now - who knows how much longer before it is completely in place.


Because the change begs itself to be made. It feels right. It is the right thing to do.

The word 'bit' had many different definitions long before the computer was invented. I'm not sure that your argument scales over time.
