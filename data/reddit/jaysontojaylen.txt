You know Venus is hotter than Mercury right? Despite being significantly further from the Sun? Do you know why that is? The Greenhouse Effect. That's the explanation for it. It's just lunacy to pretend like the same effect doesn't matter as much on our planet.
It doesn't prove that it's a political issue to *me* because I point out that someone else has a conflict of interest related to politics. It's a scientific issue that conservatives try to discredit for political reasons, pointing that out doesn't make it a political issue to me as well.

You already admitted that you believe greenhouse gases do affect climate, so why do you find it so hard to believe that burning fossil fuels and spewing one of the strongest greenhouse gases straight into the atmosphere for decades would have no effect on climate? You deny that but you accept Patrick Moore’s ridiculous arguments like “the climate is always changing”, as if that precludes humans from affecting it in any way? (By the way, he works for a conservative propaganda website founded by a conservative talk show host)

I guess it keeps someone from remote accessing your computer or stealing your actual laptop and accessing your BTC...

LTC might make a lot more sense for actual transactions that BTC, it's not unreasonable that an altcoin could win out

Yeah except pretty much every climate scientist. But what do they know, I’m sure some shit you saw your uncle post on Facebook has more credibility.

Are you trying to claim that climate science as a whole is pseudoscience?

Ecology is not remotely climate science.
