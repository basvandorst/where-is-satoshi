Really?  There are plenty of ways that governments could seriously harm bitcoins survival.  What if the IRS calculated income on your yearly appreciation of a US person's bitcoin to limit any flight risk to low tax jurisdictions?

If you purchased your coins through an exchange, they can force the exchanges to provide info on who owns the coins.  Now if you get audited, the burden will be on you to prove that you don't own those coins anymore.  You can fuck with the IRS, but you're probably going to lose.

The US, EU and other jurisdictions have deposit insurance for this exact reason.  It doesn't really matter if the bank uses money in your current account because it's guaranteed by the FDIC in conjunction with the Fed \(for the US\).

Visa does an average of 150 million transactions a day.  Bitcoin or any other crypto network would be unusable if it tried to match this.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:10:37
Well if it did happen, at least your funds are guaranteed by the FDIC or its foreign equivalent. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:28:46
But neither of them are capable of doing anything close to what Visa does and future capabilities are just speculation.

I hope you realize crypto doesn’t solve the creation of fake money.  Hell, just look at the 100s of ICOs that happened during the bull run, what were any of those backed by?  A big issue in the Big Short was that the CDOs and other synthetic mortgage backed securities were being used like it was as reliable as cash... but it wasn’t.  If billions in shit coins did the same thing, then we’d end up in the same place.  
In the end, you know humans are going to do it too because we all want more.
@_date: 2019-06-18 10:58:46
That’s the problem, it doesn’t solve the underlying problem of human greed.  Do you think everyone who missed out on bitcoin is just going to accept that fact?  No, they’ll find some new form of wealth to create.

In reality, crypto investors should be taxed every time they exchange bitcoins for altcoins as well.

It doesn’t matter, people can create all sorts of derivative instruments that DO constitute legal obligations. The same result could occur if Sally owes Jim 1 bitcoin that she doesn’t have as if she owes Jim 1 buttcoin that she made up and also doesn’t have.

If someone promises me bitcoins in a valid, binding contract, then I’ll have legal recourse against them if they don’t deliver the promised bitcoins.  You know, just general contract law.

Fair enough, should have said they know how much USD is in circulation.  One of the characteristics driving the Great Recession was too many derivative items in circulation (e.g., mortgage-backed securities). Since a lot of these were being traded OTC, there was a lack of transparency into the how many derivative assets were being created and put into circulation.  Kind of reminds me of something else, namely the 100s of alt coins that flooded the market and helped cause the massive 2017 boom, and subsequent 2018 crash.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:49:31
The federal reserve knows exactly how much money is in circulation, it’s pretty much their job.

That's why you diversify across the index... to minimize your alpha risk.  If the entire S&amp;P 500 crashes to 0, it's going to be irrelevant what your bitcoin are worth.

Yeah, exchanging it for $100 cash or $100 item on Amazon has the same effect tax wise.  You have to report and pay the gain on the appreciation of the bitcoin whenever you enter into a sale/exchange (there are exceptions, but I'm not sure how something like a 1031 transaction would apply).
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:41:16
So what happens when I own a road that is necessary for a large amount of people to use?  What's stopping me from charging you absurd amounts because you have no other choice?
You can't honestly think your solution would work.   If you do, please show me any large scale examples of it doing so. 
Hell, using your logic, if I'm an ISP company, maybe I should be able to tax every BTC transaction you do as well as monitor your usage.  After all, you are using my product to conduct your business.  You could start your own service if you don't like what I'm offering.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:50:52
Or because its not feasible?  There's a finite amount of space in this world.  Even if there's 4 competing freeways, that's a small enough set of competitors for oligopololistic conduct to occur such that all 4 would set above competitive prices, and you would be forced to pay one.
Jesus mate, you can't honestly think the free market is a solution to everything. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:18:39
Can't you do the same thing with bank accounts?  My bank account (Schwab) has no international transaction fees and no currency exchange rates.  If I get robbed I just cancel the cards and get new ones.  They don't have my PIN, so they can't pull out money through the ATM.
I don't get it, what advantage are you getting?

Maybe some days they are cheering it, but other days they'll question it.  Besides, financial reporting has more uses than just predicting certain big events.  If you work in the financial world, it's necessary to stay up-to-date on the big mergers going on, changes in the commodities market, etc.

Wow, so to avoid banks you are willing to do cash transactions with random people in a foreign country?

Because in a democracy people can vote on how they want that monopoly to operate.  Do you really not see the difference?

Because there has never been a guarantee that bitcoin will continue to moon.  Mooning requires significant infusions of capital into the bitcoin market, and countries like China heavily regulating it take away a source of that capital.

What? You could make those same arguments for most things.  Oh that cash?  I lost it.  Oh those expensive pieces of jewelry?  I lost them.  Oh those bars of gold?  I lost them.
Do you really think you're the first person to think of that argument?  Also, you'd likely have to attest to 'sending your bitcoins to the void' under oath, so enjoy your fraud conviction whenever you decide to use them.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:59:30
No, it doesn't.  If I'm looking to start a business and need financing, I go to a bank.  How is someone supposed to secure million or billion dollar credit lines with bitcoin?

It's politics sections are whatever, but it's pieces on the markets / economy are still very good.  Alternative paper choice is the Financial Times, which might be a better source for less US focused economic reporting.

My bank refunds any ATM withdrawal, has no international transaction fees, and has no monthly or annual fees.  Where am I being robbed?  My employer can deposit my paycheck directly into my account, without any hassle.  Also, the funds in my account are FDIC insured.  While the interest rate is minimal, it still technically means they give me money since they aren't taking any. 
Look, I like bitcoin and keep it as part of a diversified portfolio, but it's laughable that you think it is actually a viable alternative to having a bank account.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:15:38
But if the 4 road owners compete with each other for the most competitive price, then they'll eventually cut their profit margins to razor thin levels.  So, since they'd be better off just all agreeing to keep hypercompetitive pricing, then economic theory suggests that's what they'll do.
I get that you believe that, but you're belief is somewhat uneducated and you need to study how markets work, especially in the case of oligopoly and monopoly.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:16:41
How did you purchase the bitcoin?  When did you purchase it?  I'm sure the exchanges keep logs of what you have purchased and sold.  
You don't think courts have ever had to 'find' hidden assets before?

@_date: 2017-09-16 02:01:20
So, you're going to pay right?  Because since you seem so gung ho about it, I'm just going to let you pay and use it after.

The government or a bank could seize your bitcoin if they wanted because the alternative would likely be imprisonment.  Just because you "own" something, doesn't mean you can keep it.

I mean, a lot of debt is also corporate debt simply due the favorable tax treatment for debt financing.   With lower rates, it's possible that changes but would depend on the particular company's situation.

And if I rob you at gunpoint for your bitcoin, who are you going to report the crime to?
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:53:03
Isn’t a large share of bitcoin only held by a few individuals?  Wouldn’t this just redistribute wealth to those individuals, not everyone?
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:20:28
That’s true, but you have to look at the increases and decreases based on %s.
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:44:43
