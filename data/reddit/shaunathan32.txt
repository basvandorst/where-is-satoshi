Hi everyone, thanks for all of the support and kind words about the album.  Here is a link to photos of our final, headlining release show.  This album officially marks the end of our band, and pretty much encompasses the work that we have been doing over the last few years. We will continue to make music separately and possibly together in the future, and we will of course continue to support Bitcoin!
Thank you again

Hey dsterry, I actually heard about Bitcoin from a few coworkers of mine who helped me get the album up on Bitcoin. We felt that it would be an interesting and innovative way to get the album out early as an exclusive through a medium that is not often used.  I believe that both musicians and Bitcoin users are at an interesting crossroads in that they are looking to spread awareness and inform others about the (very different) products at hand.  Music is clearly quickly moving farther and farther away from physical product promotion and into the realm of online listening, and this has often resulted in lost revenue for artists. Using Bitcoin is a great way to embrace this trend. The best way for Bitcoin users to support artists is actually to spread the word about Bitcoin itself.  We are supporting an emerging medium that can really only expand with an increasing amount of people using Bitcoin, so the more people that know, the more visibility we receive as a band!
