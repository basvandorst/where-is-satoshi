Have faith in this atleast. If you're this sad, than trust me, if you had access to your coins since then, you would have sold LONG AGO. You wouldn't have lasted to this point. That takes a special amount of stupid/expendable income to make a decision to hodl this long

Hey man, first off, congrats! That's an insane domain to own! 
I have an idea! How about a really cool graphic design of "how to get into bitcoin" that has graphic demonstrations of each part of the process which also teaches how the blockchain works, etc. Rather than newbies staring into graphs that have no investment experience whatsover on the typical places that people are buying bitcoin at nowadays.
Anyways, hope this helps in some sort of way! I have lots of ideas. Let me know!

You’re assuming he has 1 bitcoin. Your attempt at being funny is failing miserably

you're a fuckin liar! Yeah right dude. This domain is worth millions. Maybe if you have/had money you would redirect it.

Sell. If you're panicking so much to make a thread about it, you've probably invested more than you can afford to lose. Sell.
