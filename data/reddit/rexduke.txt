in a lot of places "tax the rich, free health and dental care for everyone" is enough to get a lot of votes... of course the reality of the economy hits hard later

sure, but the idea was something to hedge against inflation long term, so you have your stash of small gold coins, then when the shit hits the fan you can always trade a gold coin for smaller silver
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:52:50
small gold coins would have been the far superior choice

I'm pretty sure proton mail takes it

not sure about a direct comparison, but they are based in Switzerland which is a benefit for privacy due to the government and constitution there which protects the individual, and they also have a vpn service, they seem to take privacy very seriously
maybe someone better versed on the technical stuff can chime in with an opinion, I am not an expert beyond reading the different companies websites

who supports dogecoin?  to me that is the real currency, at least as real as BCH and BTC

Everything you said in the top post is true, but the illusion is enough to draw more people in and keep it going for a long time, greed is a powerful motivator 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:47:04
Greed is what is driving it's current success and will also eventually drive its impending demise .

I do that too

I have 6 browsers open right now
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:56:34
I like to keep things separate, like I will have one browser open for programming stuff (Chrome, it has the best dev tools), and Edge for another interest (it actually supports features well), Firefox for another interest and some plugins that are useful, Chromium as another choice that is not as google-ized, vivaldi for another interest, Brave which is a privacy anti-adware tracking browser, Opera, and Tor if I want another IP altogether.  I might only have 4 of them open every day but occasionally I will have most of them with tabs going.
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:46:20
why?  it is quick and easy and helps me stay very organized, I also like that it keeps things separated as far as behind the scenes cookie sharing between sites that shouldn't be related

perhaps the community will get good again when bitcoin value drops below $1 USD again, give it some time

It could turn out in the end to be a good lesson in ponzi type schemes or how parents are fallible...

They'll be good to go for playing slot machines and buying lottery tickets as their 'logical' business plan

did those that paid get their drives unencrypted?

Detect the current environment: Mobile/Cordova/Electron
Check the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash balances on the victim’s copay account
If the current balance was greater than 100 Bitcoin, or 1000 Bitcoin Cash:
Harvest the victim’s account data in full
Harvest the victim’s copay private keys
Send the victim’s account data/private keys off to a collection service running on 111.90.151.134.
For users of the Copay app, bitpay recommends, “If you are using any version from 5.0.2 to 5.1.0, you should not run or open the Copay app.”

or something else will come along that will be more relevant and bitcoin will become less relevant, or completely irrelevant 
the future always holds surprises

that, and the fact that private funding solutions like paypal and gofundme and patreon are getting political and picking and choosing whether you are "worthy" of their service or not
