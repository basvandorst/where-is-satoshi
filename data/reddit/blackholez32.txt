Legit I've been trying to figure out what to do instead of coinbase/gdax. Are there others that are insured? Other markets with a similarly friendly/useful interface? Really the main reason I *haven't* left coinbase is because I haven't seen good recommendations on other trading platforms.

That got a lot of new blood in though. I've been mindful of bitcoin for quite a while but the frenzy got me off my ass. I'm in the negative with the drop but buying the drop and working the 11-11,5 fluctuations I'm almost at break even.

Don't you mean hodl?  
I'm actually doing this to kind of get a feeling for the system, how it all works and that kind of thing, before committing more to actually for a long term hodl.

I just withdrew last week. I don't make a ton of transactions though

Seriously...

Oh yeah, derp. Nevermind I'm totally backward.

I know several people like this. Maybe if they'd be real with themselves they'd realize there's a problem and do something.

The thing I found interesting was all 3 coins dropped at the same time on gdax.

You can attach a message to a transfer right? Maybe make another (small) transfer with your contact info, explaining that you messed up the address and would really appreciate it if they'd send it back?

I was just beginning to worry that it was going to keep going up, had a buy set at 6400. I'm actually a little pleased. I could stand another lap.

I've been just beginning to dabble in all this, today I took everything out of BTC and went into LTC and made 10% just today. Everything seems to have slowed down now, but it's been entertaining watching. I'll likely get bored in a couple weeks and just let things sit, but I'm definitely going to diversify a bit.

So (dumb)people see the potential to make money and try and buy and drive the price down. Shocking
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:27:28
I've been doing the same. More passively than you probably, because I've only gained ~25%. I missed out on the drop today, had my buy set at 6400. Oh well, still gained.

It did look pretty clunky, but it also looked like they'd just installed the app. (asking for camera permissions)

I thought it was workstation cards that were effective at mining, *not* gaming cards.
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:01:43
Yeah I thought it was all people that didn't know any better. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:53:06
yuuup.

There are still the minority of us that get more and more excited the lower it goes. There's still shouldawouldacoulda tho.

Yes, you have to pay tax on the gains, same as any investment.
@_date: 2019-01-13 18:18:40
What said, along with things vary by state/country and I think how much you make.

Dollar average really is king. I dropped mine ~3k while it was hanging at ~11k. Kind of wish I hadn't ridden the majority of this drop down but I'll recover even if all it does is level out.
