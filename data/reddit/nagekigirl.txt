Why have thicker cables, when you can have ｔｈｉｃｃｅｒ cables?

They have an address with thousands of Bcash. I believe it's the most Bcash on one address.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:11:18
Stop using them and let them die like the deserve.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:14:43
Bitstamp, Gemini, Kraken, Robinhood, literally anything else.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:52:39
Use the command line, or wait for the gui
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:16:39
If new users use Coinbase it will be bad. If they use an exchange that supports Bitcoin, LN and SegWit will be used.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:51:34
Has anyone?
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:51:04
In fact, it's gotten worse

@_date: 2018-01-25 03:57:14
Just wait till Brexit :-)
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:10:20
Bakkt still needs to be approved
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:41:31
Tether is most likely funny money
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:53:04
We don't need a logo. For the end user, a lightning payment and an onchain payment are the same. Bitcoin already has a brand name, so it's better to not confuse people
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:03:17
Yeah, I believe the chairman or someone high up told the UN that Bitcoin will have a large place in finance.
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:52:15
Why wait! bitwage.org I'm pretty sure this is legit, but use due diligence.
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:08:09
Zap is on iOS. It's not even on Android yet. I think you may have to download a binary from them, which will only work for 30 days and then you have to download a new one.
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:09:33
As much as I don't like Bitmain, this is a fantastic idea. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:25:47
But a large majority of nodes won't relay it or mine it.
@_date: 2018-08-22 10:28:51
There's no point in using Bitcoin over Fiat if you don't have autonomy over your coins.
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:24:08
Because exchanges are lazy dumbasses, about a third of all crypto volume is in USDT. If that isn't pegged market goes kaboom
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:10:34
Bitcoin needs no silver
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:51:16
If you live in Europe, Wirex is by far the best option. I'll post a list comparing every card later.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:46:20
Yeah, but there's a currency called bcash too.
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:31:17
And how much has it devalued in purchasing power?
@_date: 2018-08-06 03:17:50
Wouldn't that be fortunate?
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:41:44
For those of you looking for an alternative, Bisq, the best peer-to-peer exchange that even supports Fiat to BTC recently added an in person exchange. Unlike LocalBitcoins, you can trade an unlimited amount without ID.
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:52:59
Remember to never keep coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:57:30
Why use a middleman? Just use OpenBazzar
@_date: 2018-08-25 22:48:42
Is that a Kubernets cluster in the background?
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:40:51
That's with the default third party that Bisq uses. You can use other ones that don't require that. But yeah, that part is hard to get around
@_date: 2018-10-07 19:01:21
The thing is, if you think Bitcoin will be a world currency, or at least a large part in global finance, it is EXTREMELY undervalued, and thus you'd have to be a complete moron to do anything but accumulate.
@_date: 2018-10-07 19:23:45
Oh yeah, those people (Coindesk, etc.) are scammers.
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:22:35
Blockchair is the best exporter imo.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:40:28
Just because they are mining on Chinese pools doesn't mean they're Chinese.
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:56:05
Who's Silbert?
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:22:02
"even crypto YouTubers"... Who would've thought that random people online wouldn't have all the info..... I only read credible crypto sites like the Merkel and coindesk. Many companies do press releases on Medium as well.
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:55:16
And Mt. Gox crashed Bitcoin again. I love this nostalgia!
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:19:20
I mean, you're not wrong ;-)
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:36:17
Maybe we can learn from it and use Bisq and P2Pool this time!!
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:59:10
Bitsquare, or Bisq is probably the best.
@_date: 2018-03-03 06:22:42
I honestly don't see why generalizations are bad.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:03:10
Volatility means profit! Invest wisely, sell high, buy low, and bitcoin is always very bullish
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:39:27
How do we know this? Also just because Satoshi did it doesn't mean it's right.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:01:51
Yeah, so many weak hands. The finance people still think it's speculative. People like us who know that it's the future will win in the long run
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:47:32
Yeah, sorry. Sometimes when I'm up at 3 in the morning I get a little preachy about open source.
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:59:21

If child molestation doesn't stop pastors from having jobs, I don't think that can stop them.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:35:28
If you believe in Bitcoin, you'd realize that to use Windows you have to trust Microsoft to not give away you personal info. They do. FOSS is essential to Bitcoin and Satoshi's philosophy.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:48:58
The only way to fix Coinbase is to delete you account and use Bisq or Bitstamp.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:53:10
I think NEO has some kind of digital identity in the program.
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:19:23
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:16:30
Bisq is the best, as it's peer to peer, but if you want to put your funds at risk on an exchange, use Kraken 
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:56:21
It's still testnet only
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:23:37
If they use Monero they're smart enough to not speak about using Monero
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:25:46
Tbf, neither do 95% of us, me included.
