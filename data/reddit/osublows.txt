I don't want to be a dick to you, so I'm going to assume that you didn't understand the article. Is there anything I can help explain to you?

I absolutely agree with your theory, but that doesn't mean that they have invested in ethereum yet. We know they are invested in bitcoin since they have said so.

I provided a link showing why I believe that bitcoin is now majority owned by banks and large whales, I am more than willing to change my position if you can provide counter evidence. I have no dog in the race because I own no bitcoin. I'm completely objective and i'm just going off of what I've seen and read.

I've already provided a link. Enjoy.

Guess you didn't watch the market earlier this week.

bitcoin futures are now traded by big banking institutions. Bitcoin is now ran by big banks. Time to abandon ship to other coins such as eth.

Strawman. Cool.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:19:26
Like I said, I'm more than willing to change my opinion if you are able to provide counter evidence. It's all good dude. I'll even give you the respect of not insulting you.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:27:10
You just can't be cordial with some people. :/

Nothing at all. But anything that can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence homie.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:27:36
Nah. I'm settled nicely with low fees and transaction times.

I'm definitely willing to admit I could be entirely wrong in our conversation and my thought process. I just think that most cryptos have proven themselves to be far too volatile for bank investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:29:32
No tinfoil hat here bro. Just going off of what I've read and heard directly from the bankers and news agencies. You could definitely tell me I'm wearing a tin foil hat if I thought you were a lizard person or that the earth is flat.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:16:38
I'm not saying you're wrong, I would like to see where you got the info from though. I'm always trying to learn more about this market.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:22:56
You make a great point about eth being more stable than btc.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:36:57
I'll wait for your evidence.

The guy thinks the moon landings were faked and that the word "pervasive" is related to the word "pervert". Either a really dumb kid, or someone who is of forrest gump intelligence.

Best if you dont invest. Your posting history indicates that you are extremely gullible. If youre not interested in the technology, then theres no reason for you to participate because you are simply going to lose any money you invest.

Certainly there must be quantifiable thing causing the bubble though? Unless you're saying we don't even know if it is a bubble. This is why I don't have any risky investments.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:30:48
So what you're saying is that now is definitely not a good time to buy Maybe this is a dumb question that I can find elsewhere by simply googling, but what caused btc to skyrocket from ~700USD to &gt;8k in one year alone? I remember reading about btc for the past several years now and while price steadily rose, it never skyrocketed this quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:48:12
Gotcha. So if people buy with only the intent of holding and then dumping when it reaches a critical point, everyone dumping at once to avoid missing out on cashing in can cause a crash.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:12:06
Theres only one bitcoin. BCH "Bcash" is Roger Vers shitty attempt at ripping people off who dont know any better.
