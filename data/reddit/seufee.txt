It was not
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:09:32
I will try this when I get home tonight. I believe I have my keyphrase at home.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:09:12
If that is the case, then I might be screwed. It was 4 years ago so I can't remember if I had spelling mistakes or even different words in there or what.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:52:25
I used that program to see my wallet address, I just wasn't sure if I could access them without having the original wallet program
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:52:36
Ok perfect. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:50:36
No luck with this. Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:02:56
Yes I know that, but using the program btcerecover, it tried to generate your public key using the passphrase you originally made the brainwallet with, but with errors in case it was typed in wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:07:27
That is what I thought this program would do. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:28:27
is there a way to draw on that chart?
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:06:42
My history shows a video explaining the same thing I did. Just use bitaddress.org, go to brain wallet, enter my passcode, and you have your public and private key.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:01:20
Here's what I did, but I'm still a noob since I bought for the first time on Monday. I went to bitaddress.org, then disconnected my computer from the internet, then went to the brain wallet tab and wrote 8 or so random words into it. I also wrote down those random words on a piece of paper and stored it somewhere safe. Put all your coins in there (if you are saving them.) this way you don't need to even use a printer connected to a network, etc. then when you need to access these coins, just type in your pass phrase to get your QR code
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:05:26
When I try it with or without a space, I get the same public and private keys
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:09:32
I'm not asking to be a douche, I'm just trying to learn more about bitcoins since I have recently bought some. The engineer I work with is just calling me an idiot for buying some and I was trying to explain how they work
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:00:03
That's why I was asking. Seems too good to be true so it usually is
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:50:22
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:56:16
That's what my concern is with it. But if they advertise a certain Mh/s, and I plug that into an online calculator which calculates USD output using hash rate, power consumption, etc, then is their product going to do as they say? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:27:55
If bitcoins were to capture just 0.25% of the global currency right now, each coin would be worth roughly 15000 each. That's taking 72trillion dollars*.0025/12million bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:11:45
I both remembered and wrote it down. Also double checked it a ton before actually uploading my bitcoins. I don't know why this isn't working
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:01:43
I tried to contact him, but never got a response 
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:40:12
I use incognito so my history is gone
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:08:14
I can see the wallet when I search the public address up online and my BTC are still in there
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:22:17
What is the best way to buy bitcoins then? Which website, etc. is most reputable 
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:21:27
Yes. And I appreciate the concern people have for others security. Makes for a great community. I have created a cold wallet now and am moving all my funds to it 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:56:20
Yes it does start with a 5. Or so I think. I might just have to rely on walletrecoveryservices or something. it is terribly downputting when i can see my bitcoins but not access them.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:42:46
Do you know how I go about accessing my wallet with their website? I can see my bitcoins when I search the public key, which is the frustrating bit. i just can't figure out my private key now
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:55:13
I feel it... Inside me...
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:39:55
Thank you very much. Anything helps :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:30:11
There are spaces. I used a series of words, and I believe I used a single space between each word. i will keep trying with more or less spaces here and there
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:19:01
Everything so far. I'm trying typing errors and everything but I can't seem to get it. I would have caught errors when I was checking it over first
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:02:54
It was 8 words with spaces between each word
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:48:10
Sorry. What is the compressed key? Is that the private key that I get on bitaddress.org?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:49:43
And do you know how to import the compressed key by any chance?
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:52:52
That's the idea isnt it?
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:01:01
Thankfully he doesn't really build anything lol. And I'm using mobile so I don't see a sidebar 
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:07:18
That doesn't look familiar. Thank you though
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:12:36
Cuz that seems totally legit...
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:35:43
Is there an easier way? I don't know if I want to get into ubuntu and all that stuff
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:16:12
So it's going in Quebec then...
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:36:16
Where should I go to buy bitcoins? Any preferred website or service?
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:23:39
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:16:03
It's around 45 characters I think with spaces 
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:04:54
When I try that, my public key that appears with my passcode does not match up with the public key where my bitcoins actually are
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:09:21
What do you mean? Sorry I'm not good at this. I made my brain wallet using a passcode that i wrote down and double checked ten times before sending my funds to it with blockchain. Now when i use that passcode to scan private key, I get a different public address.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:05:51
I used my blockchain account to send my bitcoins to my brain wallet. I can see my coins in the address that I thought was attached to my passphrase
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:09:35
its been asked a thousand times the last few days. just look through some previous posts. media coverage and rising costs make people wanna buy now
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:17:41
How do I access coins from my cold wallet once I print it ?
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:14:32
Thank you very much. I heard about the ATM in Vancouver, and also saw the video of the fellow redditor using it, but I live in Calgary so it's a bit of a hike just to get there lol. I will check those websites out for sure though thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:19:04
What was the address you gave? Can you see the funds from that address before you made the transaction? What client are you using?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:11:01
Thanks a lot but it still never worked. the public key it generates is not the same as the public key where my bitcoins are so I must have not written down the phrase properly or I scanned some entirely different QR code. Thank you for the help though. And I am not doing this to take part in any scam. My investment had quadrupled in the last month, so I was going to take out 25% of them to get my money back and keep the rest
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:37:09
I am using my blockchain app on my iphone to import my private key from bitaddress.org. How do I choose between compressed and uncompressed?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:25:52
I set it up with bitaddress.org. I am 99% positive that I have the right password. I mean i checked over and over to make sure I didn't screw up because I didnt want this to happen lol. Now I'm a little mad about it. I will keep trying variations and spelling mistakes etc. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:58:31
Thanks. I just got myself a blockchain wallet with my iphone app. seems to work fine
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:19:52
Yes. i do see them in there
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:34:30
How long ago did you try the transaction? Sometimes it takes up to like 20 minutes to confirm your funds
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:50:34
Open up bitaddress.org and then disconnect your computer from the internet. The website will still work as it loads the code in your browser. Then either use a brain wallet to get a qr code or use the random generator to make your paper wallet. I use brain wallet and hide a piece of paper with my pass phrase somewhere safe :)
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:43:54
I live in Canada. Not sure if that makes much of a difference
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:47:13
yes I know the public address
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:04:04
Localbitcoins. Found a local guy who wanted to sell at market value and met with him to do the transaction
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:15:30
As of right now I don't have a printer. And I think that's the only way to print a paper wallet. I will have access to a printer tomorrow. Can I make an address/private key to a pass phrase I know, send my bitcoins to the public key without printing it, then just memorize my private key pass code? I'm way too new to this so I might need assistance. Also Blockchain sends me backup files of my wallet. Is this not a good enough safety mechanism on their part?
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:44:17
Canadian here as well. I tried getting an account on cavirtex but it was taking too long for my account to get authorized. I ended up finding a guy on localbitcoins.com and met up with him (I live in Calgary)
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:39:17
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:39:10
Well weren't we wrong. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:57:09
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:02:20
increase in demand met by slower supply. More and more media/reddit coverage on it means more and more people know about it which means more and more people are buying them. Nobody knows what the price will do in the future because it depends on some stuff such as government acceptance, economic acceptance (stores willing to accept them) and crap like that
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:48:09
Still don't really understand paper wallets lol. Any chance you could help me out with them? I just have them in my block chain account right now but I also plan on buying small amounts each month and leveraging. Maybe possibly doing a small amount of day trading on the weekends as well
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:52:37
I scanned the private key and it showed up as being 0 funds
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:32:44
I had it written down. I tried using my memory and got the wrong address, so I checked my piece of paper and it was written down the exact same as I remembered it 
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:32:22
Complete guess: $331
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:33:17
Will do. Thank you
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:11:18
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:47:04
yes I have tried my passphrase but it does not turn up the proper address
