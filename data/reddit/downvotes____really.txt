I was very happy with this inevitable announcement. My only concern is that this will lead to certain payment options being exclusive to Apple devices and/or competitors. If this simply means that every smartphone maker can add this option, I'm all for it, otherwise I hate the fact that we would allow a technology company to hold a monopoly over such things.

It looks like something that would be given away at a tech fair. I hope he's not expecting much money for it.

Oh we're comparing Bitcoin to IP addresses now? I thought it was the internet of currency. People care about the internet, no?
