I don't think it's gonna happen, this is back in 2013.
This was my "lol shit coin I can buy 10000000 of them for .1 of a btc" buys, so I didn't put a lot of thought into actually keeping track of it

In the past though Btc wasn't worth the price of a brand new car and the dips weren't some people's mortgage payments. This price hike is going to play out a lot differently

Well it sounds like he valued the experience enough to squirrel away what he could for it. And judging by him saying a few hundred is enough for a solid ski/snowboarding trip then he isn't in the best financial situation.
So in his case, it sounds like something he would be pretty upset about losing out on. I would consider that something he can't afford to lose out on

cryptowat.ch will let you set a line by touching the graph, then your phone will start going off like your morning line when it crosses it.

Check out those lines on the far right that look like slopes, those are sells on top and buys on bottom.
Walls don't necessarily indicate exactly where prices will go but can be a general indicator.
The sells are in red the buys are in green.

How often do h&amp;s and inverse h&amp;s trends follow the pattern, I've seen head and shoulders TA referenced more than any other TA on here and other TA related topics
Also, what interval do people usually watch for head shoulders? How do you decide on what interval to apply your specific TA model to?

Definitely, if there were a 100% reliable method then economists and wall street would be out of jobs.
I'm sure if you cross reference enough models over large enough samples you can eventually get into house odds, i.e right 51% of the time.
What I like about these techniques is that the merge the realms of mathematics, psychology and finance. Really almost an all encompassing look at human behavior through the simple medium of lines on a graph :)

@_date: 2017-12-24 21:49:34
Nice, so theoretically you could successfully hedge yourself with another alt if the crash of one didn't tank the public sentiment for all coins.
If I understand this chart right, then in a scenario where I had 75% of my portfolio invested in a coin that had a correlation of 0.25 with another coin, I could hedge my "bet" on my original coin by putting 25% into the 0.25 coin as it would more than likely go up in the even the coin it has a 0.25 correlation with went down?
Lemme try this with Numbers instead
Scenario: Coin A correlates with Coin B at 0.25
I put $100 dollars into Coin A, to hedge myself against a loss in the event A tanks, would I only need to put $25 dollars into Coin B to break even? This assumes that correlation remains the same
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:15:43
I've had coins lost on Mt Gox, and have held coins since 2013. Just because you bought during bitcoin mania doesn't mean you can lecture about this "weak hands" buzzword bullshit that's being thrown around by the news guys, who are in fact, the weakest hands there are.

You can make infinite bitcoins in the form of alts, they are entirely dependent on internet connection, they can be taken control of with a 51% attack, you can't hold them or use them for anything, they can be rendered obsolete with quantum computing (which is only a matter of time).

It was nice when I could actually use it as a currency and the value wouldn't be 10% lower or higher by the time I got to the check out screen for something (drugs)

I've been involved with bitcoin since 2012, I believed in it being the future of currency, but not anymore. 
After these huge hikes, it has killed it's chance of being a p2p currency.
I used to sing it's praises to any and everyone, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone anymore. It's meteoric rise has been it's downfall
