There is no hardened security through private blockchains. You appear to believe that the the hashes serve as secure checksums - but: 1. Either those private keys would be available to the server, in which case the attacker has access to those. 2. There's no need for blocks in such systems - just hash each transaction as it comes in 3. Transaction signing and ACK signings are really, really common in such systems where this feature is needed. Blocks only encumber such systems with reduced granularity. Also, see my comments above regarding tripwire over multi-session CDRs.


We have that already - you're advocating a version of swift whereby all messages are passed to all nodes on the SWIFT network. No one wants that 1. Because scalability 2. Because information asymmetry is the only way banks make money. Sending all messages to all banks reduces their ability to profit, and if forced to do so, they will resort to netting , which is a reversion back to what we have now.
This was your best thinking?

Well, let's say you want to secure you blockchain against attack. How much energy do you need to burn in order to secure it? Well, you need to burn enough energy to ensure that the attacker who wants to DOS the network and/or double-spend can't afford to do so. In the case of a consortium, that number might be 51% of the highest profitable member, or 51% of the profits of a collusion between members. So, by using a blockchain, citibank would have to perhaps make 49% of the profit it made before blockchain, and divert that money into securing their blockchain. Which is both inordinately stupid, and hard to persuade them to do.

Checksums and hashes are not blockchains. Or, if they are - then we've had blockchains since the 70s. Tools like tripwire have existed forever to tell you if your data has been tampered with. Also, its probable that in a private blockchain, your private key is stored/accessible on the server anyways, so an intruder would just access that key to make 'fake' blocks anyways. At least with tripwire, it would append to a multi-session CD-R, so that attackers couldnt write-over the previous data

Seeing that the deserted island is your **best** thinking. I'm pretty sure the point is that free markets don't exist. 
Early bitcoin was 100% the result of government regulation. It runs on public infrastructure (IP), and consumes energy that is provided at lowish cost by the regulatory environment.
As for nature - governments are largely an extension of nature. That's why they own the land.You *may* be able to cite an example of a free market on a deserted island (and I doubt that this is an example - because it's an allegory, and not an actual market), but what will quickly happen is that a roving gang will conquer the island and institute a regulatory regime.

I see. So BFT is your reason to be here. BFT offers less security than the current system of storing all messages that are received. In the current system, if all systems you communicate with are attacked, you still have a copy of all transmissions. 'Double-spend' Resolution goes through mediation. Mutability is a feature.


That is not the thinking that is generally advertised. The advertisement of blockchain is 'the technology behind bitcoin'. If Satoshi invented a new mechanism, that mechanism is secured by work. Work is the only part of this that's interesting.
 &gt; There is a lot of inertia. Some places still use paper documents, which obviously aren't efficient, but it just takes time to change processes.
These people use paper documents because the regulations require them to. As soon as the regulations change, they will switch to web based processes.

That's still a greater risk to participants than holding a copy of the data they've received. There's no value proposition here. You're better off simply persisting a copy of every message you've received. So long as that message is signed, there's a 0% chance you'll 'lose' data. If mediation is an option (which it is in private messages) then you can prove that a message was sent simply by holding a copy of the signature.


Nearly all message passing systems use ssl at this point. If the efficiency you're proposing is more encryption, then blockchains will fall out of favor as more efficient systems appear which only include ssl and PKI.


Then blockchain is necessarily uninteresting, and nothing will come of it.


As proposed, they also store data one everyone's machines. If the rubric for security is "Accessing private data" (which is often the case) then you've stored this data over more machines, and provided easy paths to attackers to get at this data.


All computers must store all data. If email was a blockchain, your company's email server would take up an entire building.

Paul, that's about half the daily issuance. (And that $600k is probably on the low side, I could see it being twice that). What threshold of the day's coins would you suggest is significant? And what are people using bitcoin for, if not retail transactions, and remittance? (and with whom)


You're completely missing the point. Stay focused, we can do it! I agree bitcoin is a small part of the global system. But stay in the context of this system - what do people use bitcoin for? Service they're not receiving online from competitors.


Paul. This is a basic economic concept. Look into what inelastic demand is. Listen to the interview with billy. The venn diagram of that supply and that demand, intersects completely.


No. Man you are an obstinate donkey.


Paul, recurse we me! We can do it! Why do people mine?

Relays, energy, and probably their degree of 'decentralization' . All of which are impacted by the size of the chain, bandwidth requirements, and processing time. I don't know the specifics of this contract, but it's a fairly trivial task to achieve in bitcoin. 
Additionally: 
* You'd probably want that algorithm to factor in a lot of private data about the day's volume and capital flows (all of which isn't publicly available on the blockchain)
* You'd probably not want the network to be monitoring your deposits. Particularly if you're a chinese exchange that needs to obscure/inflate it's off chain data statistics for marketing purposes.

The only efficiencies blockchains provide is service to the underserved. The only way that the underserved receive this service is through efficiency. Discussions of this technology, absent the opportunity costs involved are silly. That is also why we don't discuss attaching wings and props to our cars - no one wants their cars to fly, because of the opportunity costs associated with those wants. 


Ripple is centralized, as it Bitshares. Open assets is decentralized, and is in fact 'useful', because it's mining is 'needed' and subsidized by the federal government. (Just like counterparty) 


Correct. Which is why blockchains are for the underserved. Mysql does this job just fine.

I thought we were talking blockchains. You're describing RAFT and Paxos mechanisms. Which is fine, but that means you believe blockchain was not invented by Satoshi. Additionally, these systems have been around for decades now, and if they were an efficiency, we'd have been using them already. The only reason you care about them now is because they're as close as you can come to blockchain without needing PoW. The reason you don't want PoW is because that's the really, really, really hard part. PoW is the reason we're all here - and it's the pow calibration that was the breakthrough that is blockchain.

Mining is the process of converting registered value to fungible value. Bitcoin exists almost entirely due to federal subsidies, awarded by way of increasing the premium on fungible value.

Satoshi defined what a blockchain was rather clearly, and Proof of work was part of that definition. In addition, it's the calibration of difficulty that was the unprecedented innovation satoshi brought. Every other feature was already in place for decades, and is completely uninteresting. 
Any other definition quickly reverts to a linked list, which means all databases are blockchains. This is clearly what you believe and lo and behold you've been using blockchains all of your programming career! (They are in fact useful, and completely uninnovative in the year 2009)

Here's a good introduction to the underserved:  . There are many people like billy out there, and the more of them that are created, the more value that bitcoin will serve.

Oh funny, we talked about this issue and your project on this most recent podcast. Good timing. You ready to recurse Paul? I think you're capable, We can do this!
A little under one million usd worth of bitcoin per day is mined to satisfy **inelastic** demand. Those miners sell to people who **need** that bitcoin in order to survive. That's the function of mining, to convert registered value into fungible value, to use or sell to those that need fungibility.
I know you haven't gone to this place in your head before, but let's think about this together. Who needs Ethereum? What inelastic need will be served by eth, that isn't better served by btc? There is no good good answer. Ethereum is mined simply to sell to the greater fool. It is unsustainable, and is being supported by speculation, and not utility.
That's why Counterparty doesn't need to care about mining, it uses the inelastic demand from bitcoin users in order to secure its network. Double-secret protip twist: your project does the same thing.

This article is silly in a bunch of ways. But rather than write a long winded reply, I can sum up the principle reason this is a dumb response: Counterparty's mining is performed by bitcoin miners.
Piachu seems to believe burning energy is a benevolent process, and people will mine because they want to be different. Counterparty believes mining is a scarce and expensive resource, for which people will only burn energy if they have to.
Since Counterparty relies on Bitcoin, and bitcoin is a technology for whom energy is burned because of *actual need* (ie they're underserved), counterparty doesn't have to deal with need-based issues of Ethereum(who doesnt serve the underserved).
It's not complicated, and it's not a long-winded explanation of user preferences to "think different". It's simple economics that piachu continually fails to grasp because he thinks blockchains are a computer science innovation and not an economic innovation.

It may be that the hot wallet adds some utility, but I'm highly skeptical that there's enough counterparty risk here to justify the enormity of the mining overhead needed for it to run, relative to its centralized counterparts. Additionally, I suspect that money injected into a smart contract isn't cold-stored (or offers the same risk reduction as incumbent cold-storage), though I'd have to see the code.

Hah, did someone say flakka? I'm in.


This is augur proposition. I would suggest that the oracle problems here are no different, you would instead place a bounty that was shared by all voters. The problem you have with these crowdsourced oracles is that they make nothing from telling the truth, and exit-scamming their identity isn't likely to cost them much. If I were inclined to scam, I'd spend a bit of time building trust over many identities, with the sole purpose of coordinating an exit scam on a big ticket bet.
It seems to me that the best way to normalize the exit scam risk is to do what we do today - have a single authority whose reputation is tied to accuracy over a large swath of the market (casinos, nitrogensports.eu, predictit.org, etc). And once you have this - multisig oracling is more efficient.


I suspect this will be super cheap. How much money can there be in oracling a bet? at most, 1% spread out over many, many participants? Also, managing the reputation of this 1% is exceedingly difficult. I don't know how augur plans to do this, but I suspect sybil attacks will be very cheap to do here.


That may be - but if bob is going to lose all his money anyways, he might as well raise his bribe to his entire wager "minus one". It depends on a lot of factors in the bet, but it's highly likely that this inefficiency will be significant, and compared to an centralized institution that normalizes risk, there will likely be no reason to use this crazy complicated path.


Maybe. It depends on the cost. Don't forget I'm the Drop zone guy, so my proposition is that reputation needs to be centralized no matter what, and that censorship resistance is best served by the blockchain with the most energy. (bitcoin)

Because that's why bitcoin mining is secure. The federal government establishes that premium, and the baseline for its performance. Here's a good study, it's a bit dated, and the numbers are higher now: (


The reason you use the bitcoin blockchain, and using ethereum is stupid, is because the bitcoin blockchain performs value transfers the cheapest and easiest, due to the guarantees of the federal goverment. (And this is why ethereum is mega dumb - it doesn't receive those subsidies)

What matters more than the network effect is what subsidies are being captured by a blockchain, that are being applied to secure the chain. Network effect is a part of it too, but probably not in the way you're thinking. Bitcoin is relevant because it's as close as its users can get to the dollar.

No. Again chris - you will come back to this thread and realize that you *know nothing* about how blockchains work.
Public servers (blockscan/blocktrail/blockchain.info) provide immediate, indexed transactions - which are then referenced/verified/loaded via SPV.

Bitorrent is significantly more censorable than Bitcoin, and reputation events won't be seeded for lack of an incentive to do so.

It's ok for anyone to use the blockchain so long as they pay for it. As for Byrne - he's not using the blockchain! They pivoted. He's merely storing his checksums there.

That's simply not true. Hashes have been replicated over SMTP for years, it's called PGP. As for the time - that's correct. However, there's no risk of censorship for publically traded stocks. The controls on stocks are extensive, and when the data is changed - it's because the SEC requires this. We don't need the blockchain to tell us when that happens - because they do.
There may not be need to use the blockchain at all with stocks - the only reason you would use a blockchain (maybe - again this is currently illegal) is for bearer assets.
We don't need to blockchain all the things - and that's the point here.

Bruce - they lied about Gutenberg, DBS, and now Honduras. They lied to investors about the nature of their funding and profitability. They doxed Jimmy Song's anonymous writing at liberty.me, and threatened his employer because Jimmy was writing **very fair** articles that weren't flattering of Factom. **And on top of all that**, the product is completely useless: At best they're selling (maybe) censorship-resistant checksums. Probably they're selling trivially mutable op_return's.
Have you ever heard of a checksum (or as they prefer it - notarization) being censored? I didn't think so.  Oh and yeah, meanwhile, on one of their youtube videos they advertise that these checksums will help defeat terrorism. :/

Sounds like you don't have a very good answer. Did you mean to say "Because Archive.org is censored - and Factom isn't?". Because that would demonstrate some competency in the matter.
Unfortunately still,  Factom doesn't store anything past the checksum of a document. For which there's no counterparty risk, and no risk of censorship.
Or, do I simply misunderstand this technology, and the advantages here are far too numerous for my degree of comprehension?

Ok Chris, I recognize that your understanding of this technology is limited, so try your best to think real hard here.  A torrent requires seeders, which is fundamentally different than bitcoin relays. Bitcoin full nodes keep the entirety of the blockchain stored as part of the network incentive structure. Anyone who's used bittorrent will find out fairly quickly that torrents lose seeders all the time. Additionally, torrents don't work very well over tor - but that's a different discussion. You seem to be claiming that torrents are just as immutable and will persist longer than bitcoin transactions - this is a very ignorant position, and you're going to be humbled when you realize this.


Again, you have no idea how this software works. You should install the CLI - no blockchain data is needed, spool up is instant. Public indexes are fine enough, and SPV can/will be used for security.


That's not a real idea. It's a protocol. You use it if it works.


You have no concept of how a decentralized market works. It's astounding. When you try Drop Zone out (which you clearly haven't done) your fail will hit you like a ton of bricks.

Because Blocks that aren't 'truth' are reorganized does not mean that Bitcoin is mutable. It means the opposite. The false blocks were tossed out on a local computer because they were false.

There's also no qr code sending (which if you haven't tried yet, you need to!), and they have to have onerous KYC and AML requirements that make it tough/impossible for your fam and friends to create an account on their phone, as a first-time recipient, in under five minutes. Cash is great! Except that the chances of one having exact change (or even enough singles) is really close to 0%. Bank transfers are not going to happen when splitting up a tab amongst friends, and if it did - most of them would not have free bank transfers. Also- when was the last time you paid for something on the Internet with a new credit card/merchant? Probably you had to fill out 15+ fields to do so. With Bitcoin, there's zero fields to fill out for payment terms. It's way more convenient.

Here's the auction comments, in HTML.
PLEASE NOTE: Proceeds from this auction are going to a worthwhile Charity (Read on for more!)
You are bidding on a genuine 10-trillion dollar Zimbabwe Bill, Signed by none other than Andreas Antonopoulos himself!
You’ve probably arrived here via a link from twitter or reddit, but in case you haven’t here’s the story. At the Coins in the Kingdom conference on Saturday October 4th, I (Chris DeRose) was in attendance and asked Andreas to sign this very bill. He obliged, and added a great little commentary to boot. As you would expect from Andreas, the commentary was both poignant, and inspiring! “Inflation Matters” is written on the bill, followed by Andreas’ signature. [Here’s the video of the signing in progress](
This bill was given to me by a friend, and at the event, it was decided that we should keep the charity going. We asked Andreas what charity he liked, and he recommended RAINN, so RAINN it is! More on RAINN in a bit.
This bill itself is in perfect condition (no wrinkles or tears). It was given to me in a hard plastic container, and it will be delivered to you via Fedex, in the same container. The signature was written with a Black sharpie that I borrowed (yes Meghan, it was returned!) from the Bitcoin for Kids room down the hall. For those who are unaware, the “Ten Trillion Dollar Note” is indeed a real fiat bill that was printed in the first few months of the year 2009. It was the last denomination that was printed before the complete abandonment of the currency on April 12 of 2009. An unsigned bill by itself is currently worth nothing for its use in the exchange of goods and services, but can be bought for around $6 USD on Ebay merely for its novelty and numismatic value. More history on this currency [can be read in great detail on Wikipedia](
So – let’s talk about the Charity! The amount received from the winning bidder will be converted to USD and sent, in full, to “RAINN” the “Rape Abuse and Incest National Network”. This noble cause is dedicated to assisting victims of rape and incest, to promote programs designed to prevent sexual violence, and to bring perpetrators of these crimes to justice. It’s a cause that everyone can feel good about supporting, and to which I’m sure any winner of this memorabilia would be very proud to support. Bidders are highly encouraged to visit [ to read more about what’s being done by this organization, and how this money will be spent. For those who are not lucky enough to win the auction, please consider donating some small amount to this cause. My BTC address for this auction is 1CavNnuxJecSFSysoD6whiGCwEUnwsLCp3, and all amounts received to this address will be converted to fiat and sent to RAINN. Proof of our deposit of funds will be supplied by RAINN after this auction, in the form of a tweet!
So come on Bitcoiners, let’s show the world our best side, and prove that this community has more going for it than just the ‘bad press’ we unfairly tend to receive. This note is historically important, a wonderful display for your home or office, and a great collectible investment! So don’t be bashful on your bid, get that metaphorical wallet out and spread some love!
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:02:27


Respectfully, you have no idea how inflation works. All that your example proves is that some degree of inflation is a property in all currencies. And again, some currencies have features that make inflation more difficult to stabilize than other currencies. Sometimes you have to use a volatile currency, sometimes you don't. Thus, ven does not compete with BTC and/or fiat.

Counterparty works today, and is being used by a number of companies/sites.

CurrentC can only help our cause. We want as much fragmentation as possible in the payment mechanism space, amongst commercial and centralized institutions. CurrentC will not work for the unbanked, or internationally, nor can it compete with the 'fees' of Bitcoin. When Google, Apple, CurrentC, etc fragment the market; there will be an increased need for an open-source, non-exclusionary standard. And that is how 'we' win.

It's a cheeky claim, and I agree that it's fun. But, don't be deceived, what was written were 12 or so rudimentary financial functions (asset registry, exchange, cfd, etc).

@_date: 2014-12-23 00:19:05
So, what no-one is talking about, but which will happen, is a Credit account, that uses Bitcoin merely as a payment mechanism. Let's call this app "Bitcharge". You fill out a credit application, same as you do for a credit card, your application is approved and you get access to a phone app, instead of a piece of plastic. When you go to a Point of Sale terminal, the qr code appears on the screen, or the NFC request is initiated, and your phone displays the amount due... in USD. Let's say $10. You agree to pay the $10, and Bitcharge immediately compensates the vendor in BTC at that QR code. Meanwhile, your account is now due the $10 USD at the time at which your next monthly bill is due. The users of Bitcharge have no idea that they even used Bitcoin. The merchant was probably using Bitpay, and similarly had no idea. That's how Bitcoin will displace credit cards. And when your bank apps (wells fargo, citi, etc) do the same thing, that's how Bitcoin will displace debit cards. So Ken Chenault is quite wrong over the advantage of his company and product.
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:49:19
Thank-you for this. It's also worth mentioning that BIP70's trusted_instant_providers feature completely mitigates all risk to merchants. This is what Bitpay is using. This is how Bitcoin will provide effortless 0-confirmation transactions on a mass scale. 1 beer on me @_date: 2014-07-29 17:10:56


I get that, but if this is the goal, you're probably going to have greater support from bitcoin accepting companies by providing a web form that takes them under 1 minute to fill out, at (say) weacceptbitcoin.com, and then providing the list of companies via an html-based directory with rss feeds.


The spam would be a problem in this case no matter what mechanism you chose. The solution to this problem would be something akin to how the google ad-words system validates identity, via a /google-123456789.txt file in the http root. This would be even harder to do on the blockchain. Also - why encumber the process so much? No -one will use this system unless there was some great financial incentive, and that incentive is probably better achieved via a reddit post.


It costs bitcoin to store information on the public ledger. Counterparty is a great way to see how this works, if you want to spend the time seeing it in action. It costs nothing to store the same information in a centralized database. (aka localbitcoins.com)
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:49:01
You didn't ask about buying bitcoins. You asked about it's value as a payment mechanism. Also, localbitcoins.com is really easy if you don't want to deal with the KYC stuff. And no, paying with cash is not simple enough. Most of your friends carry a couple of bills, none of which are sufficient enough to make even approximate change.
@_date: 2014-10-26 01:42:58
So, maybe the take-away is that regulators feel it's illegal to deposit less than $10k dollars. I would suppose we should sit on all cash deposits, until we have a &gt;= $10,000 deposit to make.... Gotta love those regulators! 
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:47:39


There's a lot of reasons you lose value, but largely the demand-per-unit is the chief reason. Just because the rate of creation is 'stable', doesn't mean there's any bearing on the demand co-efficient. The way that centralized currencies 'control' this mechanism is typically by adjusting the reserve ratio of the central bank.


I suppose you can say that? But that's not how money works. At that point you're no longer describing the world we live in.

Ethereum doesn't have anything until it releases. Counterparty stands a very good chance of including a turing complete language before Ethereum does. Also, in the case of Ethereum, there's a lot more for the project to 'prove' as it's consensus mechanism is mostly-undefined, and certainly untested. Ethereum may indeed be a platform, my apologies. But it's also run like (and probably is) a 'company', which has typically not bode well for platforms on the Internet. It's not 'infinitely' anything, that's gross hyperbole.

Bitcoin has plenty of intrinsic value. It's stored energy. If you don't understand this, simply look into counterparty.io
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:26:24
FWIW - I see a lot of hype around Ethereum, and while I too was once very excited about the technology, I've since moved my focus to counterparty, which deserves a lot more love than Ethereum IMO.
Unlike Ethereum, counterparty works today. And it works really well. Also unlike Ethereum, there's no IPO or pre-mine period from which the devs are incentivized to sell their share of the coin for a competing currency. And lastly, Counterparty uses the existing blockchain. This is really important. I think a lot of people greatly underestimate the difficulty in maintaining a new blockchain. 
One of the big problems that Ethereum will have, is that the miners will be making a small fraction of the size of the traded assets, should Ethereum grow to any large size. This puts the network at great risk of a 51% attack. While using the Bitcoin blockchain is a bit slower, the chance of a 51% attack is significantly smaller, and the existance of your contracts and asset ownership records are nearly guaranteed in perpetuity. There's little to no risk that these assets would ever disappear as having them recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain is akin to being 'set in stone'. Also, there are a number of proposals on the table to speed up counterparty in the long-term.
Just my two cents, but if you're into Ethereum even a little bit, you owe it to yourself to spend five minutes with the online counter wallet.

Circle is just getting started. They *have* solved the volatility problem.

It's very close to free, in the same way that e-mail is very close to free. I was making an assertion that was easy, and accurate enough to assuage the reader within a significant degree of precision. I would suggest that if you polled the vast majority of and asked them if they paid for their email accounts, their answer would be "no". In this same way, bitcoin will cost people 'nothing'. The people that said email is free are incorrect in the sense that they have to view ads. Perhaps the people 'paying' for bitcoin may be similarly incorrect. How about that :) I love being precise, but typically people don't want to hear that. If you do, then kudos. As for know-it-all... hardly. There was a time when I would have told you that Bitcoin would never even be commented on by the president of a credit card company.

That concern is also true of Credit cards. Systems are designed for a specific load. It's not that Bitcoin is incapable of scaling, it's that it's optimized for the given workload. As the workload increases, the parameters and algorithms will match the requirements. For the same reasons bulldozers are inefficient for gardening, so too are the industrial strength solutions unsuitable for current use. Also, if your concern is that this proposed Bitcharge is 'too useful' , well, that's why we're all here. ;)

For whatever it's worth - I actually try to stay away from the more typical 'Currency' definitions of bitcoin these days. It makes people apprehensive, and they tune out. I try to start off with "Http is a protocol for managing resources of unlimited scarcity (data) Bitcoin is a protocol for managing scare resources." and then I segueway into "money is the easiest example of such a resource, and is the prime use of Bitcoin at the moment". I suggest that a 'satoshi' is the smallest unit of data and work in the Bitcoin protocol, and these satoshis make up the bulk of what a Bitcoin is. A satoshi is merely a unit of work on th e Bitcoin network. People tend to grasp that a little better, and understand the 'scarcity' component from there.

Hah - great point. Go for it pandaar!
I would guess that there would be room for a generalized 'feed' protocol on the Blockchain. Kind of like an RSS. But, keep in mind that you only have around 40-80 bytes available per transaction. And that each transaction costs about a nickel in mining tips to process. Feeds could get rather expensive in very little time. Too, you'd have to run a fairly serious indexing process to parse messages in the chain directly, so it's not like you'd be running a quick query, the way you would with RSS.
You really should look at Counterwallet's [Bets and Broadcasts]( feature to get a handle on the kinds of messages that are most-practical in the blockchain.

1. You assume he has good enough credit to have a card. 
2. It would have taken him a lot longer, and pull-based mechanisms are way less secure. Credit cards require 15+ fields to fill out just to identify your payment mechanism. Bitcoin requires zero.
3. You can expect merchants to start discounting their Bitcoin prices soon. Overstock has done so at times, newegg is doing so now. It's very likely that merchants will waive 1 or 2% off their fees in perpetuity at some point in the not-so-distant future, passing off their savings to consumers. But that's not here yet.

'Legitimate transactions' , ie those that represent the transfer of funds for goods and services, are likely the most important indicator for any crypto. Yes, transactions can be 'gamed' and often are, but they're typically gamed on altchains, not bitcoin (where the transactions costs are higher). So if, despite attempts to game the metric, Bitcoin is still higher - then transaction count is important. Another very useful metric is the amount of funding that goes into btc companies. There's not much going into any altcoins (maybe a bit on ripple? Maybe a bit on Bitshares?) but there is a whole lot being spent on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-17 19:36:26


Again, you have no idea how money works. The exchange rate is determined in part due to the scarcity of the currency, and in part due to the demand for the currency. If the price of the pizza was denoted in BTC as the unit of account, that pizza would be re-priced every single hour of the day. If you think that's an absurd claim, look into the history of the Brazillian cruzeiro real. Goods in Brazil during the mid-90s were denoted in the curzeiro, and prices on all goods were updated each day due to the constant inflation of this currency. Respectfully, you have absolutely no understanding of inflation, and economics.
The current exchange rate is the value of Bitcoin. It is always an accurate reflection of the value of Bitcoin. Everyone knows the value of Bitcoin at all times, it's the last purchase price of Bitcoin. This is Econ 101 stuff. It's great that you have an opinion of Bitcoin and that you follow the movement, but you should refrain from speaking about the economic side of things until you've researched finance a good deal more than you have.
Ven is the price that it's at due to it's being an asset that is 'backed' by real world goods and executable contracts. When you buy a ven, you're buying a share in this diversified portfolio of stable assets and currencies.

@_date: 2014-10-17 17:47:52
Economic Inflation is very different than mathematical inflation. In 2010, A pizza cost 10,000 bitcoins. Today, a pizza costs 0.05 BTC. Similarly, at the beginning of this year, a pizza cost 0.015 BTC. Meanwhile a pizza's cost, as measured in Ven, has only varied by 2% or so, over that same time period. The money supply is only incidentally related to economic inflation. And that's why Ven is a great idea for some people's risk profiles.

Similarly, if you define a debt instrument as always being a credit card, you probably own a horseless carriage, and got strange looks when you showed up asking to buy it at a car dealership. You probably refer to convenience checks as "convenience check credit cards" and similarly too, your mortgage must then be a credit card. 
On a more practical note, it probably doesn't matter much at all what anyone in this thread thinks about the issue. In the next few years, people will be offering debt instruments which leverage the Bitcoin protocol mechanism via apps on their phones. At this time, you will listen to people say either "I bought this tv using my amex account" or "I bought this tv using my amex credit card".

The community rules are very explicit, there is clearly room for articles which are tangentially related to bitcoin. Posts are only to "usually" relate to Bitcoin. I think you're the one who needs to re-read those.
And if you still think that the explicit overt reference to Bitcoin is mandatory, you should look through 'top' stories. Two of the top five stories are not about Bitcoin at all ( I could continue going down the list from there, but I think that secures the case for my assertion.

If you don't understand that, you haven't seen where we've come from. The price is going down because Bitcoin works. It will continue to do so until a new group of speculators realizes this and invests. I've been buying BTC once a month for *years* and I don't see myself stopping until the price hits a new ATH, at which point I'll chill a bit, wait for a drop and start anew. This is how Bitcoin works. It won't be this way forever, but it will be for at least some number of years ahead.

Proof of stake does not offer more security. Stake chains typically suffer from work-based attacks (which I find ironic) most/all of which are cataloged by Andrew Poelstra. Further POS is always pre-mined, which is pretty damned lousy.
If NASDAQ made mining a requirement, the results would be majorly insecure. How much energy would their customers need to burn in order to work with NASDAQ? $100 a day? $1,000 a day? At those rates, it would be trivial for someone to spend $100,000 and fork Nasdaq's network. For any amount of mining that makes sense,  nasdaq's clients would be spending massive amounts of money just to come close to the Bitcoin blockchain. And guess what? Bitcoin is super cheap for them in comparison at 0.03 per day. So NASDAQ would just use Bitcoin instead. And herein lies the intrinsic value.
As for the currency attraction - that's certainly a huge part of the speculative value. (Not the intrinsic value)

That entirely depends on how many people are mining on the chain. If there isn't enough people mining the chain, we will likely introduce fraud. Since no one has any idea how much *need* there is for smart contract gas (and I'm guessing it's very little) plans to secure the contracts via ethereum are a dubious proposition at best.


The turing complete part. I asked for examples of anyone who *needs* this. The best examples I'm hearing are really bad - and certainly not enough to sustain the mining needs of this network.


That's a feature, not a bug. 


You don't need a smart contract for this. If you wanted to, you could do this through a website and ACH or even a credit card. The reason to engage in a universal basic income is because you *have* to. This is what taxes are for, and I'm guessing most of the people in here don't want to pay more in taxes then they have to. Obamacare was a step towards universal basic income, and the reason it stands a chance of working is because you're forced to pay in. Smart contracts offer no efficiency here, as they don't expand service where service is unavailable.


Again, who needs this? Already we're worried about the size of the UTXO pool, and now you're suggesting that we blow that problem out of the water with support for variable storage. What features would that provide? In the case of your ripple example, OP_RETURN would likely suffice - though I doubt anyone wants to disclosure the nature of their bitcoin transactions  (I sure don't)

BitCharge would not be on the hook for any erroneous or fraudulent payments. This is in fact a feature of credit cards, but there's no law that requires this, prior to the invention of credit cards, there was no such expectation from customers that this would be a feature of their payment mechanism. Thus the phrase caveat emptor. This feature is only available in pull-based systems, and it's mostly due to the rampant insecurity of those systems. As for this being the only difference between fiat and Bitcoin... No.

You seem to continue to ignore opportunity cost evaluations. That will steer you into a weird place. If you want a more formal opinion 'Smart Contracts', in the consensus layer, should probably be supported one by one. A general purpose smart contract platform will have so many externality costs as to warrant, at best, a second class citizen status higher up in the chain, and not in the consensus algorithm itself.


And the fees to converse in this model? Again, no consideration of the opportunity costs of your proposal.


If tor isn't secure enough for transmission, then the blockchain isn't either. Monitoring submissions via port 8133 is just as trivial as port 80 (say).


Again, opportunity costs. In addition to having substantially less energy, it has substantially great costs to support by: relays, wallets, miners, etc. These costs are due to the smart contracts. Ethereum's proposition is that it can support billions of dollars in financial and governance models, which is meanwhile being supported by a six-figure (maybe) mining burn. The ratio here in enormous. Bitcoin, by comparison, only claims (and certainly only performs) smallish value transfer operations, for which millions are being burned to secure.


You don't know what an ad-hominem is. If I said Vitalik was full retard, that would be an ad-hominem. Criticizing the project itself is not an ad-hominem. (Though if we're on the subject, I do think vitalik is a total scammer)

The Bitcoin dev team  will never add the Counterparty features to Bitcoin. They are adamant about this, and their opinion is not going to change. With Bitcoin being as large as it is, and being the first cryptocurrency, the devs maintain trust by: not innovating to fast, expanding only on the core goals of payment mechanism improvements,and making BTC usage more accessible (sidechains).
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:34:04
Counterparty uses the Bitcoin blockchain to perform all its features, in much the same way that Bitcoin uses IP to perform it's features. Counterparty sits on top of the Bitcoin layer and mining network, and uses it for communication/consensus/etc

No it's not. The reason it's stiffled is that as an unmanned currency, the price is volatile, and conversion fees are generally higher than credit card fees.

It's hard for me to have an opinion on your paper without reading it - but, there are a number of problems with smart contracts and gambling. Primarily, people like the experience of gambling. They like going to glitzy destinations with women and fun. Certainly that's not true for all of them, but as a whole, gamblers seem to prefer marketing over marginal differences in payout rates. Additionally, there's probably not much counterparty risk in running an offshore gaming site. I suspect that sites such as nitrogensports.eu and bitkong.com will do a much better job of servicing the gambling industry than smart contracts, for these reasons.
Unambiguous code execution is already in ubiquitous use today. Package management systems use code signing to detect whether the code being executed is asserted as valid by the issuing party. Open source scripts are in abundance. I'm skeptical whether parties want disputes settled objectively, subjectivity in courtrooms is probably a feature and not a bug. As for implementing a turing complete system... I suspect that the bitcoin approach of supporting specific contract types will be the best efficiency here. And as such, I wouldn't be surprised if atomic swaps are supported by bitcoin at some point in the future.

The blockchain doesn't need to do anything. It's a blockchain, it exists, because it's sometimes useful. Right now, the blockchain is mostly subsidized by speculators and idealists, and not by utility. The utility of the blockchain is expressed in tips per block. In fact, Tips are so low right now that pools like antminer are frequently mining blocks without any transactions in them at all, as the subsidy is of greater value than the risks incurred by the time it takes to  relaying a block with transactions in it.
The universe doesn't owe you the blockchain you want. Right now, the tips per transaction are 3 cents or so. If your transaction is so unimportant that you're not willing to spend 10 cents for it - I dont see why the miners should accomodate you. they may do it out of empathy, but that's not sustainable. They need to do it out of profit.
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:08:57
Again, I hold btc. But, the "get rich quick" attitude that permeates a lot of these subreddits is toxic. And I'm dedicated to promoting the utility of these systems, not the speculation.

If all the nodes go down - then all of our projects are done Chris. But betting on them staying up is a great bet, again - *you know this* because your project relies on that same bet.


Correct. This is the same problem - those that would seek to double-spend seek to censor the first spend.


Hosting is a silly distinction, but if you insist: All blockchains host data, without exception. The point you're trying to make is that using blockchains to host large record sizes is silly. And this is true. Fortunately Drop Zone only stores the small amount of data that is the part subject to inordinate counterparty risk.


Proof of Work is an algorithm which achieves censorship resistance at **huge** expense. (Both in complexity and energy). I don't know what "Proof of Work" says, but your reductionist understanding of the technology seems to suggest that "Proof of Work" has intent. It doesnt' have intent - it has applications.


Well, if you want an argument from authority, Peter Todd disagrees with you. So does everyone in the : Open Assets, Counterparty, Mastercoin, Colored Coin, and Blockchain Notarization communities. Bitcoin core devs added OP_RETURN for this reason, which I'm sure you've never heard of and should look up. I am the dumbest person in Bitcoin, but even I am not dumb that I think blockchains don't host data.
Something tells me you'll be white washing this thread sooner than later...
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:43:25
The energy required to uncensored is enormously greater, and the number of nodes and supporting infrastructure in Bitcoin is commensurately greater. The economics of bit message is a bit silly, and last I checked messages don't persist for very long. Testnet is probably a more efficient messaging network for small messages in almost everyway
@_date: 2016-03-30 18:09:39
So, just to clarify to the community, I recognize that this seems inconsistent with my public comments on twitter. Due to the character limit on twitter, I was forced to say "No one needs smart contracts" when what I was referring to (certainly in the context of the discussion) was "Turing complete smart contracts". I firmly believe in non-turing complete smart contracts. So much so, in fact, that I believe them to be more efficient than turing complete contracts for most/all purposes.

@_date: 2016-03-19 17:01:47
hah - it's not marketing speak, it's just brief.
So, yes, one of the main tenants of Ethereum at this point is the switch to PoS. PoW won't work for Ethereum's ambitions because miners won't burn energy for this coin, and certainly not enough energy to sustain the economic load that Ethereum is promising its users. The original goals for this project, when it was pitched, were PoS. But, as vitalik realized how hard this was, they cobbled together the current SHA3 work-based algorithm.
Now you're in a weird spot, where miners definately don't want to invest the money into asics and such, because those large fixed-costs would be rendered redundant at the time of a theorectical switch.
The market is composed of get rich quick 16-year olds. If market cap is your metric for technical competence (which is kind of silly) you would believe that Bitcoin is more sustainable than Ethereum, and thus Counterparty is a better implementation than Ethereum.
Edit 1: OH - and this doesn't even touch on the problems with PoS. (Which themselves are insurmountable)
Edit 2: OH - and this doesn't even touch on the sustainability of smart contract gas as incentive to mine. (Gas for which, thus far, not a single person has ever needed)
@_date: 2016-03-30 22:45:26
Support: energy. And LOTS of it. Programmable contracts: atomic swaps are definitely useful, but those won't need Turing support by the time Bitcoin implements them. I'm very open to your suggestions for uses of Turing complete-ness. What have you got?

You're certainly not wrong, however, there's a bit more to this. Incurring that load on the network would increase the economic requirements to being a relay (raspberry pi-relaying? out). Also, the more complex these scripts, the more likely they will be used for manipulating non bitcoin assets (which increase the incentives to attack the blockchain). 
Lastly, for the scenario you're describing, there's a simple way to control looping - which is to do what ethereum does with 'gas' (or 'bitcoin' in this sense). However, the problem with gas is how you maintain the proper incentives that will encourage miners to process these contracts (how much gas is enough, where do you create a market?: Runtime, storage, etc). 
So, I maintain that the economic component is the largest component to why bitcoin's language is designed in this way. I think jeff garzhik has talked about this at length somewhere recently

Because currently the network is secured by 12.5 * $1200 every block. That 12.5 coefficient is rapidly shrinking. And if tips don't displace that shrinking amount, Bitcoin will no longer be immutable enough to offer an efficiency. Large blockers have no idea what the opportunity costs are for what they advocate. How much do you believe transaction tips should be? At that rate, How many transactions per block will we need to maintain security? And how big will those blocks be?

The subsidy has certainly been rising in usd terms. But it's 75% issued. That means you'd need a doubling in market cap every having day. That necessarily cannot be maintained - there isn't enough wealth in the universe to continue at that rate. Additionally, if bitcoin is going to work in the middle to long term, it can't be reliant on  capital inflows constantly arriving from greater fools. That would necessarily mean the bubble has to 'pop' as these fools are eventually exhausted. (plus it adds systemic risk caused by any inability to find fools fast enough)

The entirety of turing completeness. The opportunity costs of this feature are probably not worth inclusion into the core consensus protocol of a blockchain. If you asked me (say) which part of python belongs in bitcoin, I wouldn't say "lambda functions" , I'd say "Python".


The issues that I'm referring to are all opportunity cost related. Hence the example. I doubt we need decentralized reddit or the dark wiki for this same reason - there's not enough counterparty risk to justify the expense (given the overhead) of these features. (And since you like titles, this is coming from the lead dev of the Drop Zone project)


Whoever is willing to pay for it. I suspect that will include anyone who needs to issue a bearer bond online, and wants the security of a DEX. Probably that will one day include gaming companies who need to issue bearer instruments for their games. Maybe that will one day include banks which wish to issue relatively fungible fiat online (bitt.com and Tether).
Open transactions has no hashrate, and offers little to no protection from censorship. Thus, there will be no efficiency when compared to centralized offerings. Counterparty, though very expensive, offers (much - one day more) fungibilty and censorship resistance.

Yes proof of work is the component of Bitcoin that keeps drop zone transactions from being censored. You can laugh at that - but you'd be demonstrating a profound ignorance on what proof of work achieves.

Bitcoin's scripting language is not turing complete, you are incorrrect here.


I haven't done the math, but probably not. Plus, tips would go up astoudingly fast in this scenario. This conversation between you and I would end up costing $1.00 or so to have. As for the whistleblowers, it's far cheaper and easier for them to just use tor and an anonymous email program. (there's a lot out there)


Incorrect. Counterparty is secured by 1.5 million usd in energy. Ethereum is way, way less. So, you'll end up getting 1000x or so times the censorship resistance on Counterparty. (And this is not mentioning issues relating to relays and ethereum mining centralization)


I don't typically use analogies. These technologies have very little in common with blockchains, and I dont think the analogy applies here, in the slightest. Though if you insist, I could spend time explaining why, I suppose.

'Decentralization' isn't 'better' any more than the color 'red' is 'better'. Also, if this stores only one anchor for multiple votes in the bitcoin blockchain, then it's not decentralized, as someone has to collect the votes into that anchor for relay.
As for voter receipts, if you want to prove to others how a person voted, http does that just fine. You give the voter a private key, and their signoff is visible online.

First off, bitcoin core is not a 'central planner' in anything near the sense that 'the fed' is. But, You know that the market prefers central planners, because that's the current state of nature. If it weren't an efficiency, we'd not be using them.
How secure should we be: No one knows. But probably it's not nearly secure enough at the moment. What if the etf launched, and a hedge fund could short the price of bitcoin (say for a return of 3 million) and then attack it for a mere 2 million.
How much is enough: we know that $1million has secured it thus far. How much is too much: No one knows. 
You have a way to answer these questions: I'm not advocating central planning. I'm advocating that the market use its best science to make decisions on externality management. Bitcoin Core is the result of market deciding who to put in charge of the science. BU's scientists don't even know what externaility costs are.

No Chris, they do it because they need immutability. Because there's counterparty risk associated with the persistance and retrieval of their data. It's been made very clear to you that Bitcoin transactions can't be censored, and that Bitcoin is for hosting. Consensus is what's needed when data has to maintain its integrity under the threat of corruption. (You know, by a censorer)


This is a strange point. The degree of complexity here is staggering when compared to alternative persistence mechansims. You think that storing data on a blockchain is the path of least resistance? The reason I use the blockchain is because I need censorship resistance. You'd need that too if you intended to service the underserviced.


I actually use multisig for encoding as it lets me store more data. Web solutions aren't shitty - they're absolutely magnificent. The only reason to not use the web is because there's regulatory risk in hosting that data.

@_date: 2016-01-14 20:45:00


No they're not. I know you're a libertarian, because you haven't considered this to even a single degree of recursion. If ebay and paypal's fees went to 0 - do you know what would happen? All the sellers on ebay will reduce their fees commensurately, and make precisely the same amount of money that they do now. 
Ie, if the fees of ebay+paypal are tacking on 5% to the final price of the good that's being absorbed by the sellers, then as so as this 5% was removed, your competior would offer 1% off, then 2% off, etc all the way to 5%. And your take-home would be the exact same.


So, now you're thinking that "oh, I'll beat the ebay sellers because they won't know to use open bazaar, and I'll capture that 5%". Except that you're asking your users  to learn how to download a new web browser, how to navigate and use open bazaar, and (here's the killer) learn how to use bitcoin and take the risk on volatility. That 5% is now being thrust onto your users, whom (I'm betting) will just use the easier software that they're familiar with: ebay and paypal.


Well, then bitcoin is definitely not for you sir. SFYL:

Counterparty has no beef with Ethereum. But *I* certainly think the project is mega dumb.

I think they're exceedingly neat from an academic standpoint, and I love that we can explore them. I have no idea if they'll be an economic efficiency.
Conversely, not only does Ethereum think it's an economic efficiency, they designed a whole blockchain around an incentive structure that assumes this to be true. To date - no one has ever found a turing complete smart contract that's useful. (Maybe atomic swaps. Maybe)

That's the wrong answer Chris. Bitcoins data integrity persists even if all nodes are shut down, because work went into establishing truth. Further, if any marketplace (regardless of implementation) causes enough censorship pressures that a Bitcoin shutdown is cost effective- then that's the shutoff value. You know this is a stupid point because your project makes the same assumption about the impracticality of shuting down Bitcoin. The correct answer was : burn more energy than went into the blocks which persisted that transaction.
As for retarded design: what did you think censorship resistance would look like? Data that lasted two days?

I think whenever you say "people want" or "people consider" you're describing a committee. I get that the word committee is immoral/annoying/disgusting. But here's what the dictionary says a committee is: a group of people appointed for a specific function, typically consisting of members of a larger group.
And I think that's good no? If we didn't have people want or people consider, then anyone could go in and change anything they wanted. We've elected great leaders to prevent that. Same as all currencies created by humans. How else could we evaluate merit, without specialists? 
What committee did you elect to compile your bitcoin? Did you compile it yourself? What repo did you elect to provide your source code? I actually wrote my own bitcoin implentation entirely from scratch. but I don't recommend that. If everyone did that, No one would use bitcoin.

Another point that should probably be considered by the community - these conference people are generally not our friends. They're in a VC bubble that is committed to steering well-funded interests that are determined to subvert and take market share from the bitcoin community. The greed of these people (and the 16 year olds) make it difficult to analyze claims, and publish skepticism and analysis.

Submit code to where exactly? Is there a funnel through which a meritocracy judges? A vote sent to the public?  A maintainer that handles the submission? I think it's a coalition of humans no matter what no? Unless the non-human(s) vet code, I don't think it's possible for there not to be a committee involved. Obviously its a decentralized committee. But one comprised of the humans.
Isn't anyone also able to participate in the United States congressional or executive commitee? I think commitees generally are open to participation. I don't think a commitee is necessarily exclusive. Theres no mention of that in the definition.
I don't actually think bitcoin offers a reference client. I think Bitcoin Core offers a reference client. No? Where can I download a reference client, that's used for consensus, and that that's not a fork of bitcoin core, or tested against bitcoin core?
Obviously we're free to create our own america as well, and a number of people have done that. (Most notably the confederates during the civil war)
I don't think that bitcoin core is toothless, since they're the official committee. Force is exerted by the exchanges here. You can't buy a UTXO that's not fabricated by the bitcoin core client, on a US exchange. No?

I don't know what morality is. I don't have any inputs into my equations that have to do with that concept, so I can't really evaluate this question.
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:58:26
It's not about thinking something is cool or not. I'm here to do science. And there's no science that I have comprehension of that objectively accommodates views of morality. You may have that science, but I do not.
As for slaves - they happen. We even have that today in varying forms. Of course I find that repugnant, but at times they are an efficiency, so the market has responded with a framework for it. If anti-slavery is something you want to fight for, that's a noble goal, and I think it's great. It's not really my cause at the moment, nor is it something I have a specialty in understanding. Maybe you could get into robotics development and take up that cause. It's possible that you solve that problem. However, the solution may end up cutting the gdp of india in half, and cause the starvation of a huge swath of unemployable unskilled workers in the process. Morality is generally just a veil over your own cultural preferences. It's complicated, and rarely actionable.

I didn't objectively accommodate that statement. It was a cultural, and subjective opinion. Certainly there have been times when the culture permitted slavery.

No one received that XCP. IMO, that's a distinction that matters. Otherwise, sure, I won't argue that. Again, i'm not crazy about that process. It shouldn't have been done. At the time, it was an attempt at an egalitarian one way peg. Probably it remains one of the best attempts at doing so. And to be fair - those burners lost their ass, so it's not like they made out particularly well. 


Fortunately miners are fungible, and you can buy your space on the blockchain from anyone who's not in the proposed cartel. Once you're sufficiently confirmed - you're not moving anywhere. That data is now censorship resistant.


Most of these miners have a fiduciary duty to exit their hodl and earn their profit on seniorage alone. Their investors can decide whether to hodl , but successful miners should not hold for any longer than their fixed costs can be amortized. (Sure they reinvest fixed costs, but that's a longer topic) You know this is a concern because you (rationally) fear that chinese miners will embrace big blocks even though it's not in their long term interest to do so.


I get that. Though It'll be a cat and mouse game for at least the medium term future.

Ethreum is a centralized ponzi. Counterparty and litecoin are (Probably) decentralized as there was no pre-mine.
Bitcoin has intrinsic value. You should always store all your data on bitcoin, if the storage fees are cheap enough to support your use of the medium (which rarely happens). You can decry that people do this - but it's a reflection of the value proposition of censorship resistant storage. (Which is what blockchain does) 
In an alternate universe, bitcoin isn't used for this purpose - because it was a failed project. You don't want that. The reason we want bitcoin is because it's the only blockchain that works.
ICOs are ponzi's. Bitcoin was a ponzi once too, until the DNM and gambling guys came and the federal government subsidized its utilitarian capital inflow. Probably that won't happen much for anything built on bitcoin. Drop Zone is betting that it will.

Factom is just a retarded idea. Their proposition would appear to be that op_returns are too expensive. So, they created a gift-certificate/token that would theoretically represent the entirety of that company's earnings, and sold the whole company's earnings on day one - to people who believe checksums aren't cheap or uninteresting. Meanwhile, solutions like tierion (and perhaps to a greater degree archive.is) do the same thing for completely free.
The only reason to care about factom is if you think you can sell your gift certificates to a greater fool. 
Counterparty never collected money from anyone for its XCP, and yes, is completely built on bitcoin - there is no functionality communicated outside the bitcoin blockchain.  
Also, 'blockchain agnostic' only means that the claimant has no ability to understand what makes one blockchain different than any other (and is therefore an idiot)

They're not so easily censored, you can make them expensive, but you can't filter them out entirely. The question is whether the economics of persisting that data offset the expense of relaying. And, IMO the dex is very interesting.

My assumption is that either you'd start with burn addresses and trace them down, or look for crazy bare multisig's and flag those.


This is bitcoin. There's always a pumper motive somewhere, I don't think there's anything unique about metaprotocol pumping except that you know that they're expensive externality costs by fairly educated actors. Whereas most pumps don't stick around forever.  bitcoin has intrinsic value, not that many people know that yet.

@_date: 2016-12-27 03:46:03
You're describing a world where either counterparty-awareness is part of a mainline relay distribution, or addresses are blacklisted. The former is a pretty significant piece of engineering to include either in bitcoind, or in some kind of relay-distribution package. The latter is probably a DAO-esque hardfork risk, or at least, something fairly dao-blacklisted ethereum release-ish. I don't see either happening.
Also, we could just bribe miners with higher fees. What compensation would bitcoin be offering them to run the blacklist?
Worst case - we could just string a bunch of transactions together with ordered Op_Return data . Worster case - we could encode our transactions in a way that ensures UTXOs are forever in the mempool. No one wants that. 
Meta-protocols rape the blockchain. That's just the way it will forever be, your best bet is to make bitcoin fees higher than the rape utility.

I'm trying to understand why a government would use factom, when the value proposition is that it won't let them 'cheat'. If they were inclined to cheat in the first place, why would they use the system? If they weren't inclined to cheat, why would this convince them to use the system?

Mining is the process of converting non-fungible value to fungible value. It's is as efficient as the (amount converted - seniorage cost) . So, say 85% efficient. What people mean when they say mining isn't efficient is that "co2 is being emitted. Which, may or may not be true - but which is an externality that governments typically regulate. If they want that externality regulated " better" then they can petition the government to reduce the premium on fungible value, or they can petition the government to offer digital currency that's fungible. Complaining to bitcoin about mining efficiency is as stupid as complaining to hefty about producing too many garbage bags.

Git's model of transaction management is needed because source code *isn't* generally expressed in transactional terms. When you change a file, and save it, you overwrite the entire contents of the file in the filesyset. git goes through that code and identify's the delta's (not an easy process btw, and one of the reasons it succeeded over mercurial/svn/cvs), which then allow it to provide transaction-level optimizations to the process. 
When you're dealing with financial data, it's already transactional, there's no need to identify the delta's, since finance software is comparitively simpler, and already has that data at the time state of a ledger is mutated. (Ie, debit this account by $5)


That's bogus - there's many competing competing standards of private blockchain. Probably more standards then there are for value transfers in the legacy systems. *But* if this is an efficiency, then the way to benefit from it is via a standard http over json (or xml) request/response format.


I don't even know what to say to this. You've clearly never worked with database software to any degree if you believe this. Similarly *if this is an efficiency*, then it would have been added to relational databases a long time ago.


All of these benefits have nothing to do with a blockchain. The Bitcoin DSL is *terrible*.  Again, you've clearly never worked with DSL's before. Check out some of ruby's for some beautiful examples of how dsl's can work (and these are used already in many finance applications)

Correct. I deflect because I don't understand how blockchains work, and I wasn't one of the earliest proponents of the regulatory arbitrage theory of bitcoin utility.
You care a lot about whether you use bitcoin, vs Ethereum or waves for the same reason you care about whether you drive a motorcycle, a van, or a semi truck. You want the cheapest implementation that solves your requirement.  That's why bitcoin services nearly 100% of retail transactions - it responds to the needs of users, and not speculators. Speculators believe users want blockchains that can cure whatever ails you. Users want the lowest barrier to entry, highest fungibility, highest liquidity blockchain that most closely abuts the us dollar.
I agree that at any time, bitcoin can be displaced by a better alternative. Just like gold can.

Bitcoin miners burn 25 * 6 * 24 * $400 (whatever the last price was) dollars per day to keep the blockchain from being altered.

IBM has know of source code management for a very long time. These features have been in their products for years, and is typically called "journaling". (Though IBM certainly used CVS and svn prior, if you're stuck on scm software)
Signing data offers no efficiency, as the person's who store the data trust them selves, and if they didn't trust them selves, they they would just double-sign anyways. 
In the case that you're describing message passing between banks, PKI has been providing signing service since the 90s, and is common in all interbank message passing systems

If the block subsidies are (say) 12.5 * 6 * 24 * 365 bitcoin in a year at $1000 per bitcoin, that's around $700 million USD per year in bitcoin produced. Seeing that : Alphabay, nitrogensports, backpage, [randsomware]( users are buying billions in USD annually, bitcoin speculation is dead. The old time hodlr's are selling in droves to spend on ponzis, while the government mandated users are happy to buy up the block subsidy and specutator inventory .

The question had more to do with the intent of taxing income, as opposed to the efficacy of the USG in doing so.

Because I'd bet that at the time you decided this was bad, you hadn't considered that taxes are probably (as I would allege) unavoidable no matter what.

You don't need to escrow value on an exchange to service this efficiency. You can use Multisig +nlocktime and nitrogen will never hold the value in escrow
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:19:50
I've written an article on this, you can look it up. But, tldr: Bitcoin Multisig + nlocks don't allow for bribers to place a provable bounty on an outcome. With Turing complete smart contracts, Oracles can risklessly exit scam if a bounty is created on an outcome. In fact, if you have a bet on "left", ask you begin to perceive that the chance of "right" is growing, your incentive is to bounty something just under your perceived loss as the execution date gets closer.

If you're not willing to use a technology because someone buys drugs with it, that's fine by me.

Ok so for those who haven't seen anything about the drama until now - and I are here at the roundtable. We happen to be members of this beach club, and received permission from the club to shoot video, and have been interviewing and discussing Bitcoin with attendees. 
Most/all of the attendees here are of the belief that Bruce Fenton is buying friends, and that this conference is mostly Bruce at the front of the room acting like a self-help speaker, telling highly competent devs that "We can do it" and that Bruce is highly patronizing.
Bruce Fenton wants to censor the community from receiving actual content about a permisionless currency, and is trying to convice (you) that somehow his backdoor discussions are in your interest. My guess is that you arrived here at Bitcoin for the very reason that you were tired of such antics.
Fenton had security escort us from the lunch room, and in a weirdly confrontational talk with management, we had to relinquish a camera card in order to remain at the facility. Nonetheless, we are dedicated to providing transparency to you, the bitcoin community.
Don't let Bruce keep *you* out of the debate. Help us get attention to what's going on today,  tune in tonight, and let's get the message out about this weekend's discussion (assuming bruce doesn't succeed in getting us kicked out of the property)

Bitcoin's problems are blockchain's problems. There is no problem that bitcoin has, which won't be just as bad (if not worse) on competing blockchains. The only reason bitcoin is the blockchain to experience these problems first, is because it's at the forefront.
High fees and long transaction times are a feature. You want that. Bad press is irrelevant - no one wants to use bitcoin, they have to.
The crypto currency bubble does not have to go mainstream, and the SEC will prevent that from happening. You sound like an r/btc refugee, prepare for a re-education from the craziness of r/btc.

Machines acting autonomously simply isn't a real idea. There is always an owner who assumes responsibility for the machines decisions. The rare exception might be a 'bacteria' or a dog, and any non-trivial examples of these machines are almost always externalities.


An administrator in this context is the service that connects your machine to a supplier. If your printer wants ink, you want amazon to find the cheapest ink supplier to connect you to that ink.


Netting is an efficiency. And in the case of bitcoin, this transaction would occur via a payment channel, which is a netting operation whose settlement is cleared when the transaction is complete. It's very similar to what we use now, albeit with fewer features

Then you're just not a competent developer. There is a large consensus in the software development community on this. You can compare any modern project management book to the classics, and see that iterative development is the only model for building user facing applications that is still being espoused. Github itself is entirely predicated on iterative development.
I'm not advocating that the government make it illegal, but I will go so far as to predict that government action is certain at some point. Additionally, the non-participating community should be taking leadership in self regulation by outing these pump and dump marketers and reviewing pitches with skepticism.
I take no pretense that I know what should or shouldn't be illegal, but I do suspect that our society is far more efficient than it would be otherwise by requiring investor qualification. OneCoin is a perfect example of the externality cost of not enforcing such requirements.

Blockchains increase efficiency by reducing value transfer risk.

@_date: 2015-04-16 18:25:44


To be clear, I said 'decent'. It's been holding value for six years now, and it's up 300x since its first year :) So I think you criticism of the store of value is more accurately directed at the unit of account. The S&amp;P 500 is an excellent store of value, and while it's 30 year returns average a little over 9% per year, there are many segments in it's price history where you can see it perform comparatively poor.


I don't think merchants give a crap about accepting Bitcoin. It's the same thing as accepting a credit card, except the rates are way cheaper, and the money is available sooner. I think adoption has been really damn impressive considering there's no company behind the protocol and how exotic the programming is. As POS' continue to add support for BTC, merchants will be there with them. Bitcoin will succeed as a payment mechanism if for no other reason that there is no other meaningful open source platform for value transfer. Bonus that it happens to be the most efficient settlement platform as measured by transaction costs. Additional Bonus that it's agnostic to the token being transferred.


To be clear - I don't think it's a currency. You're probably a moron if you think it's a currency. It's obviously a commodity. The only reason I hold it, is that I need to burn it to run my fintech programs.

To be clear: My SQL is always more efficient than a Blockchain for all computer science and persistence purposes. The exception is when centralization incurs economic inefficiency , which is usually through regularly encumbrance. At this time, a Blockchain reduces financial risk, and thus poses an economic efficiency. (Not a computer science efficiency) note that even in this case, there are many exceptions

hashPrevBlock is a hash of the previous block. It's there to prevent miners from solving a blocks into the future. hashPrevBlock doesn't reference the previous block, what references the previous block is its block height. Which btw, is one way you know blocks aren't linked lists, they're arranged by their offset from the origin. Typically linked lists are for variably sized memory allocations which are not ordered sequentially.
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:41:52
There's a lot in there that you're very wrong about, but I'm going to focus on the basics. You are clearly a competent enough programmer to be exploring the issue, but you believe that a blockchain is a computer science problem, and not an economic problem, which is leading you astray. 
The core thing you're wrong about is that miners can secure a chain absent payment. This is impossible in the long term, though PHB's will blow a lot of money in the short term learning this lesson. In an environment where trust amongst actors is low, absent a center of authority, 'stake' (external to the history of the data) simply must be burned. A lot of it. That's what keeps the 'truth' in check. If you're in an environment where actors cannot trust a central clearinghouse, then a Blockchain *may* be useful. However, the only way security can be maintained is if either : 
1. Each of those offices/participants are perpetually engaged in a war of attrition, thus anchoring 'state' to 'stake' at regular intervals. (10 minutes in the case of Bitcoin) 
2. You leverage the Bitcoin blockchain as your transit, and in turn you leverage the Bitcoin blockchain's war of attrition for the reasons in 1.
It seems that you believe compensation is not necessary for stake burners. Maybe you're correct, but I doubt it. When a PHB looks at his energy bill every month, and someone tells him he can cut that down to nearly '0' by just using the Bitcoin blockchain, that PHB will choose the path of '0'. If you suggest that no stake is required to be burned, you have all of the nothing at stake problems, and the Blockchain can be forked by a bad actor for a very low fee, at any time.
Further, you seem to believe that pubilc key cryptography somehow requires a blockchain... it does not. There are many ways to sign-off on provable updates to a persistence layer using centralized databases. It's not a terribly popular thing to do, because people typically trust their own infrastructure, but you see it used in projects like git. (and package management systems)
IMO, The big problem we have in this Blockchain-all-the-things dialog is that there's a new generation of programmers who haven't heard of journaling or quorum-based replication, and believe these are innovations provided by a Blockchain. They are not, these innovations have been around since the 80's. (maybe 70's even). Quorum-based replication is generally not popular because it's inefficient, but plenty of systems use it. Journaling is massively popular, and it's a mystery to me why anyone would claim that a traditional DBMS doesn't offer this functionality, other than it's so automatic that they probably don't realize it's happening.
The last thing people need to realize about Blockchains, is that they probably won't work for most database functions for the simple reason that state is maintained by all parties. If security is a goal....why store your data on all your enemies' computers? If your answer is 'Well that state would be encrypted' it still begs the question 'Why give attackers the ability to read all your data just by grabbing a single participant's 8 byte key? Wouldn't it be more useful to have logins that can be audited and disabled?'

No, you couldn't. And it's not just semantics, this is a technical subject, not a linguistic nuance. prevBlockHash isn't a linked list for reasons just as banal and important (well, in the context of Blockchains) as 1+1 equaling two. You'd need a 'lookup table' to perform the operation you've proposed. In fact, after you've computed the hashes of each block, you'd need to store (you know) their addresses somewhere. You'd literally be making a linked list of some kind (associative arrays are often linked lists) to be able to perform the operation you're proposing. That operation cannot be done with the native data structures *because prevBlockHash isn't an address*, and thus because blocks aren't linked lists.

So then why attach a energy burner to the device, when you can simply buy energy from the cheapest sources on the planet over a bitcoin exchange? You'd be far better served by taking a credit card and automatically billing $5 a month to it (and being able to scale that purchase to meet a user's demand)

"Not working" is the null hypothesis, it is not a claim for the reason that saying "perpetual motion won't work" is not a claim. (At least, in scientific terms). 3 billion dollars is indeed puny, but it's also the largest blockchain ever created by many orders of magnitude.

Yes it is. Rather than encumber the device with however many dollars worth of hardware, and reducing the battery charge time - the factory can simply add 50 cents to the price of the good and charge it with enough satoshis to cover the life of the mining hardware that would have gone on the device in the first place. 
Bitocoin enabled IoT is a pretty dubious proposition in the first place, I fail to see why this is more efficient than having an amazon Dash account.

I said they're "typically" relevant in c-like languages. But they're used in all computer languages in some form. The very specific reason a Blockchain isn't a linked list is that there is no pointer linking one block to the next in the block data structure. Blocks are ordered, so linking them isn't necessary. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:12:13
Cisco hasn't realized that mining is the process of burning energy. Seemingly, neither has Balaji Srinivasan. As such, Cisco has come to understand that 21, inc. is promising them free money - which is a dubious, albeit desirable pitch.

In science, proof is up to the claimants not the skeptics. Nonetheless, it's certain that a blockchain will 'work',  point is that it's not an economic efficiency. I suppose if you want to "prove it" the easiest example of why network effect matters could be substantiated by looking at the successes of the private Internets back in the 90s (Prodigy, AOL, compuserve, etc). Nontheless, analogies are stupid, and so are private blockchains.
@_date: 2015-04-06 01:28:58
Pointers are typically relevant in the context of c and c-like languages. They're unsigned integers which reference the offset of an  address from an origin, for a useful segment of data, in a contiguous memory stream. Colloquially, a pointer is an 'address' for a larger block of data. Bitcoin does use hashes to identify work and identity. But the validation of identity is not the same as an address for this data. "Block Height" is a more apt colloquial use of the word pointer, than "Block Hash"

@_date: 2015-04-07 16:10:12
That's close enough. The other reason the Blockchain isn't a linked list is because blocks are implicitly ordered, which is typically uncharacteristic of a linked list.
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:02:12
You're pumping shit coins to sixteen year olds. And marketing them aggressively in online channels. That makes you a scammer.

Blockchains are principally for regulatory arbitrage. You can't sell crack on a permission ledger, nor can you gamble on a presidential election. If you're performing a deed transfer or escrowing value for a financial derivative, centralized databases are always more efficient than blockchains, and require no inordinate precautions that require disintermediation of the parties from the value routing network.

I'll try my best here to tackle this quickly. Let's go:
RE: 1. Bitcoin is a shitty unit of account, A decent store of value, and an amazing payment mechanism. As such, it's highly likely that Bitcoin's payment success will come in the form of displacing Apple Pay with an open, riskless, and cheap standard for value transfer.
RE: 2. Blockchains have little/no micro-economic efficiency, and an inordinate macro efficiency. If you consider that the rates for value transfer are between 2-10% (depending on whether you're doing CC-cards or remittance) the efficiency gained by Bitcoin is enormous. Bitcoin only makes sense for interbank settlement, and settlement amongst underserved banking customers.
RE: 3. Bitcoin doesn't use much in terms of resources. What's your metric, the energy consumed? This is inordinately fewer resources than is in use by the current system, which requires energy in the form of compliance, regulation, risk, etc - and all the people and energy that run that process.
There. How's that? All better? :)
@_date: 2015-09-17 03:03:37
You are clearly not a computer programmer. Permission ledgers do little to nothing about increasing security. Nearly all of their features can be accomplished by signed emails.

You verify that it doesn't run over tor?  - I like the idea of decentralization as much as you, but this project has been completely neutered from what you were promised. It now has as much to do with Bitcoin as does shopify or wucommerce. If you want a decentralized bitcoin market - wait for drop zone
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:26:59
It's trivial to ban an OpenBazaar store, because they run like any other website. There are absolutely no features designed to prevent this. wucommerce is just as decentralized as OpenBazaar. (And has more features. You know, like tor support)

Look through the soundcloud. The vast majority of these posts have 4k listens as a baseline, *with less than two comments*. Compare that to Bitcoin Uncensored, where our comment counts are roughly 2% of listens. We have 20x the comments on half the listens. In addition, when I post on youtube, I have a comparable number of views (1k-4k) as I get on the soundcloud. But when LTB posts on youtube, they get about 100 views. (Because it's harder to buy views on youtube)
Just to see how easy it was to buy views, I went ahead and bought 50,000 views on Unconfirmed Transactions episode 2 for $20. I think LTB used to get a lot of views, but when the audience count started dropping, adam resorted to buying views to keep his network appearing relevant. 
Bitcointalk has user engagement. I don't see that on LTB, because I don't think the users are actually there.
@_date: 2015-09-17 03:02:00


Take a deep breath and think about that a bit. 


If this were true, we wouldn't have courts. Similarly, ripple wouldn't have to worry about their permission users front running each others orders: 


Correct. If trust secures your blockchain, a mysql database is always more efficient.

What's preventing a central agency from collecting bonds from signers, and not reporting them to the network. And When that threshold of participating signers hits a threshold - releasing those bonds?


This means that your network is going to be ridiculously dependent on a strong network of relays. And DoS' will be trivial when relay networks are small. 
Additionally, Reorgs get super weird in a PoS network in ways that I don't understand, and neither do you.

So eris is a dht with code execution? Code execution Han been dying since the 90s as its typically a bad way to include model and domain specific logic. Nonethess, there are dhts which have this feature. Couchdb comes to mind. Eris doesn't execute smart contracts, because eris doesn't escrow value. Eris does execute code, but again, there's nothing novel there. Adding v8 support to Cassandra is probably a weeks project. No one has done it, because no one wants that.

Peter, what does eris offer that isn't better offered by a physically secured central server, or SaaS? If journaling is the feature they're pitching, what's wrong with journaling? If the fraud is a risk at your organization, how can a really, really, weak mining infrastructure protect against this? If instead they're using proof of stake, how does this differ from Quorum-based replication? Those protocols were around as long ago as the 80s. IMO - Eris has as much to do with Blockchains as does my cat. His name is Pickles.

They needed permission to innovate, and push for regulatory changes. They couldn't use mysql, because the regulatory environment wouldn't allow for it.

Sure there is. Settlement latency is a feature at most institutions, and not a bug. The ability to encumber the transmission of value enables many forms of insurance and fraud remediation that are, on aggregate, efficiencies in the incumbent systems. 
riak performs *all* of the functions in this project. The reason settlement is being performed with a blockchain here is for marketing purposes (both to investors, and regulators)
Have you ever wondered why western union has buildings to check ids? It's because of regulatory requirements (not because they need a blockchain to store image data) Similar restrictions are at work with security settlement.

The biggest reason banks aren't using bitcoin is because transactions aren't reverse-able in Bitcoin. Similarly, this is one of the first features that is added to their non-bitcoin solutions.


I didn't know that was the criterion for knowing how blockchains work. These people are the last ones to have shown up to this space, and have proven to be laggards and incompetent at every turn thus far. If bankers were innovating in blockchains, we'd have seen them here prior to the five years it took them to stop laughing at us.


This is a certainty. If you don't understand this, you're clearly new to blockchains. I'd imagine you believe blockchains are just a database, and that mining isn't a process of burning energy.


Blockchains are an economic solution. Burning value is required to assert truth. The one who burns the most value wins. This is why a bank's profit is relevant - burning that profit asserts who's ledger is correct.


Verifying isn't mining. *Mining is burning energy*. I think you're confusing relaying with mining. You have a good bit of learning ahead of you...


So... citibank is your measure of blockchain competancy? These are the same guys who laughed at bitcoin until their ex-ceo started investing in the space and buying Bitcoin. You're certainly new here.


This is what you're proposing. You're new, and it's an old argument. Namely - that blockchains will run on compassion. It's the butt of a joke. It demonstrates that you don't know that mining is war.


Deep Markets are efficient - I'll definitely agree with that. However, the market for blockchain programmers is very, very shallow. Too, they''re researching. They will come to the conclusions that blockchains have no use if not as a public utility. 
Once you learn how mining works, the next lesson to work on is: There is no such thing as oracles. Once you get that, you'll have graduated from the "16 year old of bitcoin" club and will be ready to begin your work as a 17-year old.
@_date: 2016-05-15 02:10:21
Nothing Bruce. There is absolutely nothing to blockchains, if those blockchains have no work. Further, Bitcoin is the only one that has any work. I know your massive head trauma gets in the way of your executive function these days, and that you'll ignore this message.

There is no difference between http and a private blockchain for the purposes of publishing data. (Except that the latter is grossly inefficient). If you believe "cryptographic security" is an efficiency (and I would agree) then you should look at the long history of code and data-signing that's existed in the open source world, for these purposes. It doesn't appear to offer much utility in the commercial sense, save for PKI on SSL.


how old are you? I can't tell if this is a joke....

Bitcoin is actually decentralized. None of these ICOs are. There would be a short term dip in the bitcoin price, and then eth would dwindle into nothingnes like Bitshares did before it.
I agree that Ethereum's days are numbered, but this remains a good question for the next shitcoin pump cycle..

@_date: 2015-03-23 19:00:25
No they don't. Here's a guide to miner centralization, it's a non-problem invented by Vitalik to sell Ether:  . Further, if you believe that bitcoin's centralization is a problem, how can you possibly value an Eris Blockchain, which will have many, many orders of magnitude fewer actors involved in securing the chain?
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:54:13
You are correct. I cannot fathom why people would use this. But when I asked you, the best reason you could offer was time stamping. Now, its smart contracts. But a smart contract isn't smart unless it escrows value, which eris does not do. Further, code execution has been available in central databases since the 80s. So since you have the imagination, I'll ask a third time, what does a Blockchain offer a company internally, that is not better achieved by non-blockchain solutions?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:03:32
Counterparty risk. Aka "censorship"
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:56:49


So, I'm definately the stupid one here. I get that. But, if you don't understand how blockchains escrow value, then you are very, very new to Bitcoin, or even more dense than I am. The bonds do require a store of value be defined in Ethereum, though agreed, not in Eris. It is not only a weaker form of smart contract, it's a useless one.

Preston, you have no comprehension of computer science. You point at things out of context, that use the words you searched for in google, that often mean the exact opposite point you're trying to make.
In this case, you pointed at a paper which discusses how a protocol is designed in an egalitarian and distributed capacity. The coders propose a codebase, and the miners choose to ratify it. If this is "a big problem with Bitcoin", you are very, very new here. There's actually much bigger forking concerns than the block size in bitcoin's future, but if you're hanging your hat on this issue being the crux of your problem with Bitcoin's chain, I'll be very happy to remind you of this prediction a year from now. 
Your solution? Require trust. Do you really think you're the first person this occurred to? In the six years we've had Bitcoin? The reason no-one cared to solve that problem before you showed up, is because it's been solved for thirty years. The only reason you choose to solve it is because you're not a programmer. 
You continue to assert that I have not RTFM'd, when in fact, I've read pretty much all of your documentation. My opinion wasn't something I chose to levy because I was uniformed, but because I was. I take great care in understanding the subject matter, before I make any public predictions. Your subject matter, I understand really well.
I stopped asking people when they first heard of Bitcoin, since people are rarely honest in their answer. Judging by the problems you've identified, I'm guessing you arrived in late 2013. That means you've probably yet to be humbled by your first Bitcoin scam. That means you're due some humility in this space. That humility will come, when you try to present this software to a competent programmer at a large-scale institution, as a replacement for their existing DHT or centralized persistence store.

So you're telling me that a coalition of banks will engage in the practice of burning energy to secure their records against each other? How much will they burn to secure this? What happens when bank A burns more than B, does bank B then buy more miners? How much energy is required to be burned by these banks in order to keep this private chain secure - all of their profit? What if bank A makes less than bank B - does that mean that bank A will then fork the chain and destroy bank A? Or, does it run on empathy?

Because a versioning database is a non-sequiter. Not only for all the reasons already delineated at length, but also because, you know, a center of authority is present on both git and svn. Even though git supports branches of authority, and the ability to chose where you store data, it's a centralized repository somewhere. The fact that it doesn't use a blockchain to do this supports the claim that a traditional database provides all the utility we need for the persistance of records that dont require the removal of counterparty risk.

Bitcoin is (amongst other things) a settlement engine. Principly between banks and individuals. So, when you see coinbase's exchange and and bitstamp's exchange performing hundreds of trades per second, this will be akin to what counterparty 'banks' will be doing. At the time that value is checked out of the bank, that's when that transaction is published on the blockchain for settlement.

I don't know anything about fair. I know it's good, because here we are. The libertarians also know that at some level, because none of them want to give their land back to the native americans.


I'm sorry but you have no background in economics. Now I'm definately certain you're a teenager.


Ummm. Well, I suppose we could use slavery as defined from the roman times? But if your definition of slavery includes 'paying taxes' that's ok - it just means that slavery isn't a big issue then.


Are.. you arguing my point now? I certainly don't have many good examples of companies using violence against me. I don't know why this point is so interesting to you, nor did I intend to confuse that.


No, no one sees this but libertarians. You can choose not to engage in commerce. It's very simple to do. 


First off, employees don't pay income tax. Companies do. Second, you don't **know** this.  You made this up. In this imaginary world, it's just as likely that you'd make almost nothing. That's often been the case in environments with little government presence, such as indigenous tribes and war zones. Do we have a military in your proposed environment? If not - what happens when we're invaded? Do we steal get to work half as much, or do we just have to pay for that country's army with taxes now?

So their current energy expenditure is negligible. In order to secure a blockchain, you need to spend roughly the same or more than your competitors. Blockchains are a war of attrition, if you're not engaging in that war it's because there's no counterparty risk. There is nothing that a blockchain does that is more efficient than a traditional database - save for being decentralized and immutable. (Both are features that banks have made very clear they don't want)


The answer is: Bank B buys more miners. Thus continuing the cycle, wherein A buys more miners than B, until both institutions are either flat broke, or realize that a private blockchain is the dumbest thing they've ever attempted.


Less profit. So, if a small community bank wants to be on a private ledger with citibank - that means citibank can outmine that community bank at any time (thus providing no security or features). 


If that blockchain doesn't run on empathy, then it will certainly fork and **be less secure than a database**

1776 for most of it. We've been accumulating more land since then.


I'm sorry, I just don't understand this point you're making. You invented this weird dichotomy, or copied it from the libertarian playbook. There's no science here.


Ugh, yes I can. Slavery in the us is when we shipped illiterate natives from the coastal regions of africa to work in southern industry in the US, and to be bought and sold like cattle.
Taxes are when you pay the government money it asks you to pay.
This conversation is quickly becoming inane. If you can't see the difference, that's fine, but you're a crazy. I think I touched on this, but slaves asked to have what you have as a tax paying citizen. So if I had to draw a ven diagram, I'd probably start from that vantage.


Well, I buy heroin weekly. And that's from a street level dealer, who's part of a local gang. I thought that was a bonafied company, so that would be my example. my guess is that you won't accept that. But your definition of a company is something you made up.


Well you don't get a house if you don't pay taxes. If you don't want to pay taxes, you can live on the streets with all the other people who don't pay taxes. It's very simple - they don't go jail for that. They also own nothing. So, you get to choose. Is there any opportunity costs in your life? (Are you old enough to have raised kids? Do you raise them with opportunity costs?)


No,its not. There are lots and lots of people who study this. And it would be very obvious if this were true.


The dollar is inflated so that people invest in the economy. That's why no one invests in the dollar. If you want to invest in an asset that is guaranteed to not inflate - buy TIPS. You won't do that , because no one wants that.

Yes you do. You should know this better than most. In Latin america its common for people to spend their excess paper on assets such as cars. When they buy these cars, they release more paper onto the market, thus compounding an already bad inflation problem.

Same with the yacht, that's value that transferred out of USD, and into the Yacht, thus putting more USD on the market. You know this, because the financial crises was based on this problem to some degree (and at a larger scale) Value was being spent on homes, and personal savings rates were down.

Your humility here is wise. Don't go telling people that you've figured it out, and that the sky is falling. Particularly when the fed has maintained 30 year running average growth at 9.2%+ for the last (almost) 100 years.

Sort of. If it's not , you would have lost your ass anyways.


It has. That's why so many people immigrate to america. And, why so many businesses are located in America. Additionally, you'll see that nearly all businesses compare their performance to this metric, and throttle their investments to this metric. Insurance policies, annuities, credit card rates, bonds, etc, etc are based on the performance of this asset, plus the added risk of the borrower/creditor.

You can leave the US. It's not hard, Roger Ver did it. Where's the violent force exactly? Governments compete just like businesses do.
As for debt - that doesnt matter. It's issued in USD (shhh!) we can print as much repayment as we want. I think that was also fairly evident from the QE strategy of buying back our own government bonds. Don't confuse microeconomic theory with macroeconomic theory - they're completely different strategy.

It's their land. They mowed it fair and square. Are you asking for the universe to give you free things? Or are you interested in studying what happens in a world of limited resources and unlimited wants. Because if we want free things - why stop at free border crossings. Think big! Like, flying unicorns with machine gun turrents big.


No, not at all like that. You're again, reaching into the bag of libertarian canon. Ask a black person to explain the difference, you'll be shocked at how different it is. In fact, the abortionist movement was dedicated to giving slaves the freedom you enjoy.


I see. So companies are groups of people that engage in a business collective - and that don't use force? If that's your definition then I'd imagine there are no such things as black market companies. That's fine, but your ability to understand the economy will be greatly inhibited.


Your wages get garnished. You don't get shot. Also, you don't have to have a job - you can barter your way around that. I think even the amish do this to a great degree. (Might be wrong there)


Money creation is the smallest part of inflation, and as we're seeing - rampant inflation is simply not occurring.
The libertarian platform is based on a message that the sky is falling. That's a weird view in light of the fact that you're typing this message to me on the internet, in a time when technology is at it's pinnacle apex, and shows no signs of stopping. You can bet against technology improving, but I see nothing but huge swaths of new improvement on the horizon: self driving cars, privatized space flight, artificial intelligence apps, etc.  So, feel free to bet against that working. In the meantime, I'm going to bet that the economy will continue to grow at a rate of 9.2%+ per year.

No, inflation is the rise in price of goods and services. It has very little to do with the issuance rate. That's why when, in times of war or disease,when half the population dies, you have inflation (depending on the circumstances)

I'm sure you don't. Of the 25 * 6 * 24 bitcoin produced by miners everyday (prior to halving), about half of that production would appear to be consumed by DNM'rs.
As for extraordinary claim - you clearly don't know what that word means. It's not at all extrodinary to suggest that bitcoin is used by the under-served, and it's an assertion that has been studied to great length, and has a good amount of empirical evidence to support.
If you still believe that this is an extraordinary claim - You should check out alphabay, it's amazing.
I think it's more obvious to me that you're using a scientific appeal (one that I taught you) to refute an inconvenient truth about your belief.

I don't know. You could be 100% right. But guess what - that doesn't matter. Because if we go down - everything goes down. Gold goes down. Bitcoin goes down. Etc. Canned food goes up, and so does ammo. So you can invest there I guess.
I see so much improvement ahead: self driving cars, privatized space flight, artificial intelligence apps, gene therapy, etc
And just today (yeah this is anecdotal, but it's not an extrodinary claim) this hiring report suggests that nearly all of it is coming out of the US: 
BUT WAIT! If you still think that the US is going to give that innovation up to international companies, there are plenty of international indexes you can invest in. (Betterment does a bit of this in fact)

Thank-you. Bitcoin serves the underserved. Most of its subsidy right now would appear to be the dnm's. But malware, gambling, backpage, and maybe capital flight are still core industries here. So, you could pick apart how much energy will fall if you studied what component the dnm's are. Last study suggested it was 50%. There's a new study that is starting to suggest less.

Well, there's more people on the market with the same amount of currency issued. So, that's kind of the bigger point, I probably distracted it a bit in my wording here (I'm running around town using my cell phone). The point I was making is that there are a lot more concerns to inflation than just what's printed, and negative-inflation/positive inflation fluctuates all the time based on general market pressures.

To be more clear "Deep Markets" are efficient. For many contexts, bitcoin isn't terribly deep. You see this same lack of information in penny stocks. Once a market's depth growth, more and more information hits that market, and price discovery becomes increasingly efficient. 
The easiest way to measure depth is the bid/ask spread. So when you see markets like forex that are enormous, the information in that price is hyper efficient.
The S&amp;P is kind of a crazy thing, because it reflects all the information in (nearly) all publicly traded securities. So, it will track macro-economic trends that affect the US economy, for which there are a bajillion inputs. If you live and work in the United States, then you believe that the US economy is growing. Putting money in the S&amp;P500 ensures you only 'bet' on the economies' 500 largest, well capitalized winners.
