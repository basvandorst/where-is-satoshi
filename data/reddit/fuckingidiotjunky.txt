Add every distro's budget together and I would bet the CIA budget dwarfs it.  For anyone else reading this, do not assume that you are secure just because you use Linux.

You'd be surprised man. If you check some distros changelogs you'll see bug and exploit fixes that are solving problems from releases years ago. Open source obviously has the ability to be more secure, but it's 100% vulnerable. Most distros don't have the resources to be as secure as they need to be.

Try looking at its price relative to gold over that period

Theres a giant sell order pushing the price down right now, I'm betting it's Coinbase buying cheap because on their mobile app the price isn't budging below 598

It's definitely deducted from my paycheck automatically.

So, if this happened with bitcoin. Aka, someone stole her password rather than credit card information you would be shit out of luck. No consumer protection, no chargeback, no bank to insure you.
I'm a big believer in btc, but at this stage why would anyone use btc over CCs to pay for anything?
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:10:17
But I mean, there's Man in the middle attacks, keyloggers, someone seeing you type in your password over your shoulder (wife, husband, bf, gf, roommate). To use this day-to-day, most people use the blockchain app on their phone, or another app, doesn't matter, and even though it may be difficult to gain access to the phone, it's definitely not impossible.  At least if they steal it from your debit or credit card you can call your bank and, even with the annoyance of waiting 2 weeks to verify and send a new card out, you will still get your money back.
Is there any such protection for btc? I'm not trolling, I seriously don't know. It looks like it's alright for merchants, but it is slightly disadvantaged compared to Visa for customers as of now.

But they can print more to replace cash
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:52:47
Because there's fees buying btc.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:27:41
This isn't true. Square does this for the same fee, and Venmo does it for free.
Bitcoin is expensive and unusable for micro transactions at the moment and needs to be fixed for it to have wide spread real world adoption.

No do the cash deposit option.  Just lock in an escrow and bring cash to your nearest Bank of America.

Fuck coinbase, don't set up an account there right now. They're backed up releasing money and sending coin. I'd wait a week to see if they're not insolvent or go with bitstamp

I'm not a crazy bull like many here, but if I'm not mistaken... We don't want it to be classified as a financial instrument
 because then it would be subject to capital gains tax. We want it to be classified as a currency , which I believe is only taxed as a sales tax when you exchange. Correct me if I'm wrong.
