Yes. No, wait no. Maybe? Go for it! Definitely, or not. Pork Chops.

This was a tough week for BTC, but it finally looks like things are on the rise again. However, the drop occurred very quickly and you don't know if another drop or an even worse drop is right around the corner. But since this is still around 7K less than ATH I think it's a good time to buy.

You mean they don't make the bubble argument?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:18:22
I don't deny that it is a bubble and can pop but I also can't deny it may also reach 100k +.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:22:59
It's not funny at all.

I hate when people call Bitcoin a ponzi. Any investor at any given time can take their earnings and exit. Wouldn't be possible for those on the bottom rung of a ponzi..
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:46:37
 Thanks ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:40:49
LOL I thought this was like a meetup/drinks thing.

Price is going down during the episode.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:40:19
Yes but he also wants to erase it before he sells it. Bitcoin gone forever.

I wish I was invited to a Bitcoin 10K party!
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:29:48
I wouldn't want anyone of my friends or co-workers to lose $$ because of my suggestion. Kinda why I'm keeping mum about it..
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:11
I think I'll read Outlander. Maybe I'll stop checking Blockfolio that way...
I don't drink craft beers.

I was sent a YouTube video about how the whole thing is manipulated. It just made me feel dumb and vulnerable I guess.

I have a savings account linked up on coinbase and have been buying since June. I'm not going to test it out at the moment.. This is going to cause another dip if BOA and other big banks do the same!
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:46:47
Was the one in Brooklyn already sold?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:05:55
After getting my feelings hurt I don't prothestlytize BTC/Crypto anymore. Not that I did much in the first place.  I don't have shirts that say HODL or stickers all over my desk or anything. 
I only tell some people about it if they ask what I've been up to lately or what I do in my spare time because I do spend time outside work reading about and buying/trading crypto.

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:46:26
What rumor?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:03:57
 In relation to what?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:16:51
I thought that was only for $5000
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:03:45
I wasn't even aware you could buy it!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:48:35
If there are any 10K BTC parties in NYC please invite me!
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:10:10
Me too. It's like talking about an MLM.

Those comments are so full of ponzi! scam! tulips! beanie babies! bubble! it has me questioning as a BTC/Crypto hodler if *I AM* the brainwashed one!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:59:42
I feel like I'll remember the 10K moment for a long time lol. I don't know anyone at work with BTC so I'll be celebrating on the inside by myself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:53:30
Hehe me too Sarah.

I told a co-worker and he gave me a crazy look and told me to "be careful".
His look was like this
If BTC crashes one day soon I guess he's right but if it goes to $20K + he'll wish he got in!

Have you seen this classic Bitcoin crashed video?

I'd like something like this at my desk but I don't think my manager would like it so much....
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:29:04
I feel the same way. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:12:47
Can't stop watching this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:03:49
If I ever hit rock bottom I would max out multiple CC's, take as many loans as possible, beg for change on the street..but wont stop hodling crypto unless things are reaallly good. Like I could get away with never working again good. Time will tell..

Co-worker who snarkily said to me, "Hey, how's your BITCOIN doing today " the other week when it "crashed" has been awfully quiet today.... Of course he asked only becuse he read an article that it crashed.
I got in @ $2600. Still up!
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:31:48
Me too.

You make models just for the bg elements and effects or for the dragons and people too?

I don't have a lot of BTC so Casio maybe?
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:15:05
I think the fork is going to drive it way down again below $4000 or less based upon what happened with the July/August fork. Then once the fork panic is over it'll recover. $10K by the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:52:17
No. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 03:33:10
