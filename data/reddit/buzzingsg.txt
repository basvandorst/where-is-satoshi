Electrum 3.0.1?
Shut it down immediately. Download the latest version from the official page, use that version to create a segwit wallet....then transfer your funds to it.
But make sure your not opening or surfing any websites when doing so.
Anything below electrum 3.0.5 has a critical bug that allows shady websites to read or steal your seed via javascript or something....didn't you heard that?

From what I've read, bigger blocks results in
* higher bandwidth requirement (you need a faster internet connection to download/upload the blocks)
* higher storage capacity requirement (as time passes, you need more harddisk storage space to store all those blocks of transactions from genesis to now)
Therefore, the larger the blocks, the less the number of people that have the resources to serve as nodes.
This results in centralisation of nodes and increases the risk of the nodes (which are fewer in numbers) from suffering ddos attacks. And when that happens, it becomes increasingly difficult to validate a "falsified block" of transactions....until it becomes "too late".
So to encourage decentralisation and increase the number of nodes, blocks have to be small so that the bandwidth requirements aren't too high. Additionally, pruning of data might eventually need to be implemented so that the storage requirement hurdle is low as well.
As for "miner centralisation", it has less to do with block size. Rather, its gotta do with someone or some group controlling the majority of hash rate doing a "majority attack" (google 51% attack).
