He does see the irony, he just knows that the sheeple will believe him without question.

WTF are you talking about? In fiat, we talk about the 1 person, in this case Jane Yellen.

The Federal Reserve is the world banking system. Maybe not for much longer, but pretty much all international transactions go through a U.S. dollar settlement in U.S. territory.

You can identify a correction when the decrease in value of your Bitcoin gets large enough that you start to panic and you wonder why you allowed yourself to be fooled into buying this stupid fake Ponzi-coin. When you start thinking about what you could have bought with all the value you lost and you just wished you could get a break, and you wonder why nothing goes your way and why can't you be successful. That's when you know it's in a correction. That's when you know you actually DID catch your break, because that's when it's time to buy.
You buy when there is blood on the streets. Even if it's your own blood.

Pretty good, except for your definition of FORK. You defined a split. A fork is a change in the project's code. You have either a soft fork which is "backwards compatible" or a hard fork which works only for those who switch to the new, hard forked, code. Even with a hard fork you don't necessarily have a chain split.

Damn, I should have read through the comments first. I upvoted yours because it's almost the same as mine. One thing though, a chain split requires a hard fork of the code always, simply because you don't want your new network to interact with the old network (which would likely result in your network being killed off right away). So, what I'm saying is, a split in the chain doesn't necessarily mean a fork has failed.

Why not cash transactions as well?
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:48:31

I completely agree. I believe in the Bitcoin protocol and think we can have two or three slightly different implementations as a way of dealing with the opposing needs of scalability and a secure chain.

Yeah, I was thinking though that fees would prevent gaming. I don't know enough though.

I use Jaxx, Blockchain.info, and BreadWallet as well. 
Blockchain: I originally used this wallet to only track my paper bitcoin wallets. Paper wallets are literally just that, your bitcoin public &amp; private key printed on a piece of paper and stored away (redundantly). I'm able to watch the value of these paper wallets because I imported the public key of each paper wallet before storing them away.  As far as using Blockchain as a day to day wallet for sending/receiving bitcoin, I don't use it for that, though I do have some "live" funds in this wallet as well. Anyway, the overall user interface is pretty basic, but it has direct links to the blockchain for each transaction, which I think is pretty cool.
BreadWallet: This wallet is really cool (to me) because it allows you to hook up your bank account to purchase bitcoin directly within the wallet. For people sick of Coinbase this is a great way to buy bitcoin (in the U.S.) Not sure about outside the U.S. Also, the wallet is easy to use, runs smoothly, and has detailed transaction information (as do blockchain and jaxx wallets).
Jaxx: I use Jaxx wallet for holding more than just Bitcoin. This wallet and the company behind it or leaders in pushing the crypto space forward. The Jaxx wallet has a ShapeShift.io API built into it so that you can easily "trade" your bitcoin for Ether, or Ether for Litecoin, or (whatever coins you want to trade that they support in the wallet). Jaxx also has wallets for your regular computer, so you can actually import your private key words and sync the same "account" on your computer as you have on your phone. Like I said, Jaxx is really pushing things forward and I have a lot of respect for what they are doing.
So overall, if you want a simple, clean, smooth wallet that only does Bitcoin and gives you the ability to buy Bitcoin, then go with BreadWallet.
If you want the crazy advanced features of Jaxx and you already have a way to purchase Bitcoin that you are happy with, then go with Jaxx.
The Blockchain wallet, while also a solid choice, would be my third choice out of these three.
I hope this helps!

Not on Coinbase. Coinbase keeps the private keys.

That doesn't work, because he could have used the cash to simply buy bitcoin instead of the miner.
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:23:58
This. What I do is use bitcoin for purchases where possible, but replace what I spend right away.

$750,000 worth of bitcoin is worth spending $10k to recover.
