This is a *joke*.

Fucking *thank* you.

*Shut the fuck up*, you stupid fucking ancap clowns. Jury nullification is completely and obviously irrelevant here. I can't even wrap my head around how fucking ignorant and delusional you have to be to think that *if only* Ulbricht is permitted to prattle on about the non-aggression principle in court, suddenly a jury of 12 normal people who don't masturbate to Ayn Rand novels is going to be eager to set him free.
No. For fuck's sake. The vast majority of Americans, and &gt;99% of Americans who end up serving on juries, really do think that people who enable &amp; profit from the sale of meth and heroin are bad and should be punished.
Yeah, I get that *you think* your personal political beliefs are like, obvious and natural and how could anyone disagree. But the fact is people *do* disagree. There's no evil illegitimate force standing between your beliefs and the public, blinding them from the truth. The fact is that people don't fucking agree with you. Jurors don't fucking agree with you. Jurors aren't going to fucking set drug dealers free because they make speeches about liberty. Fuck off, how stupid do you have to be to believe that. Seriously what is wrong with you.
Shut the fuck up and accept that Ross Ulbricht is going to jail through the normal operation of the legal process. Yeah, we get it, you don't think there should be drug laws. Fine, make *that* case instead of inventing this endless series of incredibly tendentious arguments about how he's being railroaded.
And, come to think of it, make those arguments somewhere other than because for fuck's sake it has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.

In fairness, it's difficult to believe that there's a workable underlying technology when the thing is surrounded by layers of noisy, ignorant ideologues. Bitcoin's most passionate advocates tend to also believe that laws against ownership of heavy machine guns are an intolerable imposition on human freedom, and that replacing police departments and courts with competing networks of for-profit security companies is not only viable but obviously preferable. Many of them explicitly claim that Bitcoin is some kind of magic key that will overpower evil governments and unlock a new paradise of freedom and super-prosperity.

The so-called "snowballing turmoil" in the world economy in general is nowhere near as severe as these cases.

I suppose what you're saying is narrowly accurate but the word "directly" is doing all the work.
Coinbase presumably has a determined amount of BTC that they feel is optimal for them to hold; if their holdings start to drop much below that optimal level, they'll try to refill their coffers, and vice versa. So the literal effect on the BTC price of buying some smallish amount of BTC from Coinbase may well be nothing, but the overall effect of lots of people buying smallish amounts will be closely approximated by a model that ignores this little bit of friction.
This kind of thing is pretty common in economics. It reminds me of people who say "I don't want to give any money to Micro$oft so I bought an XBox used." Okay, but used XBoxes are close substitutes for new ones, so the effect is ultimately almost the same.

No, Yishan Wong was the CEO. The nature of being a CEO is that there are no "higher ups" in terms of the week-to-week details of the running of the company.
If you pay attention to the timeline of who was hired and fire when, it really does seem that just before his fall from CEO status, Yishan hired Ryan for a poorly conceived pie-in-the-sky project that ended up in practice being "make a weird announcement about Reddit internet money for the users, then hire one guy to go off and write something highly complicated and completely irrelevant to our business."
And then Yishan left (this is its own story, but TLDR his scheme to relocate the company was a fiasco, the board eventually refused to back him further on it, and his resignation was accepted.) New management team got brought in and took command; pretty much as soon as they found out about the Reddit Bux project (or whatever it was called) they terminated it, and Ryan with it.
Is it *possible* that both Yishan and Ryan thought this was a legitimate project that would serve Reddit well? Yeah, I guess. But don't act like it's absurd and scandalous to suggest there could be some cynicism here. I mean, it's just featherbedding (potentially.) It's not like that never happens at work...!

I admit to being naive and gullible enough to side with the overwhelming majority of economists and practical consumers of economics data in seeing e.g. the Bureau of Labour Statistics as both highly competent and rigorously honest.
Now, back to the main point: your claim here is that USD are worthless, or soon to become worthless, and that this fact is easily discernible with simple math and basic critical thinking skills.
This immediately runs into the problem of why a huge, diverse array of institutions and groups around the world &amp;ndash; amounting to the consensus of world markets &amp;ndash; nonetheless highly value USD and USD-denominated assets. None of these agents are obviously incapable of simple math and basic critical thinking &amp;ndash; very much the contrary &amp;ndash; and many of these groups, like the Chinese Communist Party, seem clearly outside the reach of any kind of US-driven coercion.
You addressed this problem in a few ways, but none of them were convincing at all. You said that stock market analysts are effectively "paid off" with their big salaries. Why would rich investors scour MIT and Harvard for the smartest people they can find and then "pay off" these people with large sums of money *to deliberately malinvest even more of their own money??* Who would benefit from this behavior? Who is co-coordinating it, and how?
Same thing with the Chinese. You say they're only "gambling," but why would they knowingly make a very large, almost hopeless bet? You're saying the entire national leadership of a country has gone insane? And they *just happen* to be insane in exactly the same way that huge numbers of other institutions and groups are insane?
You say they stand to gain if the USD collapses &amp;ndash; even laying aside the question of why a profound economic crisis in their largest trading partner would be helpful to them, what about this requires them to *buy* USD assets? Couldn't they just stand aside and benefit from the collapse of their rival *without* buying huge amounts of their rival's assets first?
I'm not sure why you think that name-checking multinational organizations &amp;ndash; one of which [does not actually exist]( and another of which [is explicitly intended as a bulwark against American influence]( &amp;ndash; somehow demonstrates that the U.S. can manipulate world markets to exclude simple math and critical thinking, either.
Let me recapitulate this and make it as simple as possible: If you believe that US economic collapse is unavoidable and obvious, you run immediately into the problem of explaining why world markets clearly appear to disagree. You're going to need to somehow deny the relevance of markets altogether, or resort to highly implausible conspiracy theories about market manipulation.
Maybe the sensible thing to do would be to re-evaluate your belief in the obvious impending US collapse.
Perhaps it's something you *want* to be true, or perhaps it springs from emotional, moral, or philosophical reasons, rather than from a strictly dispassionate analysis of the facts.

Austrians reject the use of evidence to form or test their theories, which means they're clearly not doing science.


All you're doing here is pointing out that mainstream economists don't adhere to some kind of extreme strawman version of empiricism where all we can do is take apparent evidence at face value and leave it at that. Austrians don't merely believe that sometimes you can be led astray by evidence and you have to weigh it against the prior plausibility of the claim in question; they believe (and assert loudly) that evidence is *of literally no value* in evaluating the merit of their ideas, which are undeniable logical certainties.

This has nothing to do with the scenario mentioned in the Mempool article.
A legislative aide getting a job as an industry lobbyist is not becoming a "covert saboteur," "quietly" committing "treachery." (And is about as newsworthy as the sun rising in the East.)
The Mempool article's argument is:
1. Buying Bitcoin will automatically make you rich.
2. Everyone knows that, or at least everyone who looks into Bitcoin knows that.
3. (From 1. and 2.) Government agents who, if acting in the government's interest, would work to destroy Bitcoin, will therefore instead silently buy Bitcoin while working assiduously to prevent it from being destroyed.
4. (Additonal.) This represents a Prisoner's Dilemma somehow, because the author doesn't really understand the concept of a Prisoner's Dilemma but knows it's cool.
Among all the other problems, consider: This argument breaks down if Bitcoin *ever* stops increasing a rate substantially greater than other investments. It requires that the market *eternally* underprices Bitcoin, even as Bitcoin's market cap climbs to exceed 10, 100, 1000, 1,000,000 times world GDP. Remember; the moment Bitcoin stops being an amazing can't-lose guaranteed megabucks investment, the whole supposed incentive to defect instead of enforce goes away.

None of this is true, but let's pretend it were.
It still provides *no explanation at all* of why *world markets* seem utterly unaware of the looming, mathematically certain collapse. Stock market quants are absurdly smart people who are paid absurdly large amounts of money to analyze this stuff in rigorous, obsessive detail; they're not your stereotype of mindless squares slack-jawedly absorbing whatever is on the nightly news.
And no, you can't get out of this problem by asserting that the Fed is manipulating it all; besides the inherent implausibility of the claim, *even if* the Fed were manipulating U.S. markets, the impending collapse would still show up in behavior of market actors outside the Fed's control.
I mean, how is the Fed manipulating *the Chinese Communist Party* into stockpiling USD, if it's obvious that those worthless IOUs will soon be best used for kindling and wallpaper? If you have to posit a gigantic unified world-spanning conspiracy just to save your pet theory, it's a really shitty theory.

The evidence for the parallel construction theory is sketchy, essentially negative in character &amp;ndash; I think I found an inconsistency in the FBI's account of how they cracked Silk Road, therefore, parallel construction.
There are any number of other explanations, not least some simple miscommunication between whatever FBI technicians cracked SR and the prosecutors who eventually wrote up the account of how it was done &amp;ndash; who are of course not hackers and could easily mis-state the details in a way that would confuse an attentive security expert.
Anyway, Silk Road had pretty lousy security and it's certainly not *necessary* to invoke NSA juju to explain how Ross could have been found out.
In any case, this doesn't reflect on your original, completely absurd contention that the evidence listed in the article is some kind of grab-bag of irrelevancies and illegalities that needs to be thrown out. To me it looks like comprehensive, well-crafted case, as you would expect federal prosecutors to bring to a high-profile prosecution.
My impression is that you're labeling this evidence as illegal and abusive because you believe that what Ross did ought to be legal and you're letting those beliefs cloud your objective judgment of just how strong the case against him is.
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:47:09

Discrimination is inherently difficult to prove and people in positions of power may be able to discriminate without leaving any record. At the same time, discrimination is highly illegal, so those who engage in it will publicly deny doing so.
Someone who makes statements that expose entire groups of people to extreme contempt is much more likely to discriminate against them, given the chance, than someone who does not. Aside from if someone actually has a past record of being caught discriminating in a professional capacity, this is really the only way you're going to be able to filter them out before they get a chance to do damage.
Moreover, part of the job of a board member is to be an acceptable public face for the organization. Board members are more like politicians than technicians. It's reasonable to ask that such people be broadly acceptable to the public, and not compromised by extreme, offensive statements such as Janssens has apparently made.

An increase in *real* economic wealth doesn't do anything to address a shortage of *nominal* dollars needed to pay off the face value of debts.

Productive borrowers would find themselves bidding against each other to obtain dollars to extinguish their debts, and not all of them would be able to do so.

Bitcoin is specifically promoted for its supposed ability to undermine laws and regulations passed by representative governments that are more or less accountable to popular will.
It's not clear why Bitcoin advocates feel they can claim this constantly, and then turn around and whine and invent conspiracy theories when the people whose job is to maintain that system of laws and regulations decide to prevent Bitcoin from destroying it.
Why *shouldn't* banks which spend inordinate amounts of time and money complying with laws meant to impair criminals' and tax evaders' access to the financial system be protected against a fly-by-night operation designed to circumvent those rules?

I'm obviously not disagreeing with the *logic* that if Bitcoin really takes off and huge numbers of people are using it to buy and sell things for practical reasons, more companies will accept Bitcoin.
I'm disagreeing with the *premise* that we have any good reason to be confident that Bitcoin will take off in this way. I think it's highly unlikely to happen, but even if someone thinks there's a chance, it's still pure speculation and they can't really have a firm basis for it.
