so, some people actually believe this? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:21:08
who is this 'we' you keep talking about? 
(I do want customer protection.) 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:36:14
yeah, every american gets a trophy...
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:22:43
no, that is only a very very small part and is only a solution is special situations. And still, this third party can not be trusted either, and that is exactly where SEC (and other organizations) come in: to prevent fraud and stop scammers. 
Currently the gov. keeps an eye on exchanges in the US and EU, and only for that reason they are now stable and we dont see mtgox stuff happening anymore. That is good for trust, and therefore good for btc-economy. 
But anyway, i think you believe in some utopian fairy tale and will never get it..

I heard a similar story on IRC, was that you? 
if so, i'm glad that I've not given a wrong advise and said something along the lines of 'no one knows, you'll have to figure this one out yourself...' 
I almost sold all last year, mostly because I didnt see much online payments going on. I'm glad I didn't. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:18:02
the best time to buy bitcoin was in the past.
But that was true on almost every day last year... 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:15:56
ehm no, that is not what it means.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:38:28
new ETF changes in 2 months. 
But then, I didnt really care about ETF in 2011-2017, so what is all this stuff about anyway.  I just want to keep my BTC.

most interesting things happen on the edge of chaos
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:17:05
by 'we' you mean 'you', right?
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:05:03
there is no day/night cycle. bitcoin continues 24/7
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:00:23
because Antpool does not want to process your transactions. they want to see the transaction-pool grow, so they can cry about large blocks again...
Therefore, miners should stop using Antpool.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:30:07
nonsense. 
We know why it happens. the average is just taken over a way to long period. The same issue is going on for months, when the fees should have been low on the weekends because the mempool had cleared up. instead it only suggested a low fee on mondays. 
The fix is easy: don't average over many days. A few hours should be enough. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:25:38
that is a lot of assumptions and wild guessing. 
totally useless.
 
@_date: 2016-12-31 10:28:31
yes, perfectly legal. 
Just install Electrum or another wallet and you're ready to start.
(do not use a remote/online wallet! )
Using a exchange (like bitcoin.de or Kraken) micht be different and they ask for verification to open a account.  they might have an age restriction.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:24:30
you've not telling the truth. I've had the opposite experience: never met a developer who thinks large blocks is a good solution. At best it is a temporary fix, with unknown consequences.  
Although slightly larger blocks wont cause any problems, it also wont solve anything.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:18:55
great. I'll be ready to scoop up some cheap bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:36:05
actually it is incorrect. 
Bitcoin has not been proven to be insecure, but Exchanges are, and some wallets too. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:34:53
because ASICSboost is more effective at empty blocks.
f you, Jihan!
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:43:44
imagine paying per second or per downloaded Mb for some service.  
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:19:08
nonsense;  then the coins are still yours if the transactions were not confirmed.  
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:03:34
I appreciate you reaching out here. But pls do not ever start a exchange again... :)
Anyway, if you want to return some, there's still 5BTC that I can't claim. 
(something went wrong when applying years ago, and at some point I gave up since it seemed that all was lost anyway. I have proof).
But what I really lost was lot of time. I spend many months chatting about BTC, trades and the validity of mtgox when it was still operating. And I probably gave some user wrong advice when I still believed it would end well... 
So, get in touch if you want to help me get the 5btc. It will be used to support my BTC/LN projects.

perhaps it was lab experiment that somehow escaped out through some subcontractor. They seem to leak stuff that way all the time
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:02:57
Thanks to Wright, we now have empirical evidence that  social engineering is not enough to forge the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-10-30 22:02:04
why are you asking? do you expect us to know? 
@_date: 2016-07-04 08:50:29
solution would be for them to make products, and sell them for BTC. 
...just like in a real economy.
