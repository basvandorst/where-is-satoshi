Reminder: All of this doesn't matter if your computer is compromised. Keep your software up to date. Reduce your attack surface by removing unneeded software (especially Java and Flash browser plugins). Further reduce it by using a non-Windows (e.g. Linux based) operating system.

Post your slides, your text or an overview of what you will be talking about. We can then tell you if there's something wrong or missing.

I can't vouch for the security of that application though. If you don't have hundreds of passwords stored, the safest way is probably manually copying the entries to Keepass (assuming no keylogger is present). For maximum security/paranoia, do the conversion using a live CD that isn't connected to the internet.

Looks suspiciously like a compromised website. I wouldn't be surprised if it served malware. Proceed with caution.

497.77 is LiteKoin's price per BTC. 850 is the current exchange rate at MtGox. That's close to half the value.
That's beside the point anyway. This screams scam. If it doesn't arouse any suspicion with you, I suggest you find someone to babysit you with regards to Bitcoin-related matters.

Step 1. Buy a Bitcoin ATM machine. Several companies produce them. For example,   and  I think the Lamassu one is neat.
Step 2. Add a bunch of Bitcoins.

Wow. Epic. Upvoted twice.

Terrible mistake indeed. Here are two things OP can do to reach out to the P2Pool miners:
Post a thread explaining what you did and ask, kindly, for people to "refund" you [here]( If possible, it might be a good idea to have an established user of Bitcointalk make a post on your behalf. Any volunteers here?
Join  on the Freenode IRC network and do the same.

They're selling at almost half the market value. If your scam sensors aren't screaming, you're a special breed of gullible dimwit.

How about not spamming this in a dozen threads?

1. Upload picture to 
2. Post the link.

There is an IRC chatroom by the name of  on the Freenode IRC network. Perhaps you can work something out there.

I would be rightfully laughed at if I printed my bank account number on my t-shirt with a "Send me money!" caption. Bitcoin isn't any different in my opinion.

Are you 12? It's terrible.
