I had the same problem with Multibit HD + Trezor. Had to re-synch with the block chain, this is an option in the wallet. The problem happened again and so now I only use the mytrezor via Chrome, which has worked flawlessly.
In case it was not clear, if you use the Trezor with the mytrezor web wallet and the Chrome browser + extension, the transaction will show up.

Let me be more specific. 
1) I believe that Bitcoin is in a bull market.
2) In a bull market, when things get quiet it is often a signal that the next move up is about to begin.
3) The exception to 2) is when there is a quick move down to kill off the speculators prior to the next big leg up.
I've see this play out in other markets. The bull market likes to buck off speculators, only dedicated longer term investors reap the benefit.

Given my recent experience with Coinbase and with buying gold and silver. I think that the plan is to deny average people access to Bitcoin and other wealth preserving technologies.
The problem is that you can't mine it any longer unless you have a lot of money. You can't buy much of it easily unless the banks approve.
The banks may let Bitcoin thrive, so long as the door is slammed shut, open only to politically connected insiders, when the public wants to get it.
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:43:56
Bitcoin has distinct advantages over all other forms of money. As a store of value it SHOULD replace, gold, cash and money markets (broad money). Of course, side chains or other mechanisms to multiply the transaction throughput need to be put in place for this to be realized.
Derivatives are not a store of wealth, so should be ignored for our purposes.
@_date: 2015-12-18 05:33:19
It's not possible for half of the derivatives to be paid off unless interlocking derivatives offset to zero. Otherwise there is simply not enough money in the world. Some people who know a lot more about this than I do claim that after Lehman Bros was imploded in 2008, there are a lot of one sided derivatives that have been buried under a mountain of fraud. Going to have to blow the whole damn system up to fix it.
This is a very good argument for owning Bitcoin and gold.
@_date: 2015-12-25 07:13:35
I don't base my decisions on advice from people. I do my own research. After looking into the state of the financial system in 2003/4 I developed a deep distrust for "trusted third parties". 
If you buy stocks, you don't own them, the broker does. If you keep money in a bank, you are giving an unsecured loan to the bank. If you buy an index fund or etf you are two steps removed from actually owning "something". 
What happened in 2008 confirmed and deepened many of my concerns. 
So you can see, I was drawn to Bitcoin, because like gold and silver I could take possession.

They obviously want to do a fractional reserve hatchet job on Bitcoin, just like what happened to Gold after 1980. The gold market is full of fraud, people paying storage fees for non existent gold. There are about 100 ounces worth of claims on gold for every real ounce in the vault of the COMEX exchange. People with allocated gold accounts are being refused delivery of their gold.
Such a system will allow the banks to make a huge profit by manipulating the price of Bitcoin.
The only solution is to take delivery, hold your keys. The community has been well trained in this, with many exchanges blowing up along the way. We need to make sure all the newbies know. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-08-24 20:47:21
Hash rate follows price, price expectation and technological innovation.
It can be no other way. 
The difficulty (hash rate) is adjusted periodically so that we get one block every 10 minutes on average. 
The miners have no mechanism to increase or decrease the price of Bitcoin, except by selling their coins into the market or holding their coins. But what makes them hold or sell? Maybe they owe money for electricity, for equipment. Maybe they are afraid that the price will go down or up. The relationship between this at hash rate is tenuous at best. However, if the price goes down, you can be sure that they will turn off miners to save money on electricity... so hash rate follows price.
Everyone should have a node. Having a miner makes no sense for most people and even if you have one, you would be part of a pool and would not get to decide which transactions are in and which are out of any block.
I'm here to learn and help others learn. I never attack the other person, just their position, if I don't agree with it. That's how we learn. Have you seen how some people around here condescend and insult one another?

The fundamentals for Bitcoin are better now than ever. Market cap of 100B USD is still a drop in the bucket. So there is plenty of room for past trends to continue.
As a long time observer and participant in this market I think that the calls for 3900 and below are wrong and a disservice to new investors, who tend to jump in on runaway FOMO and puke at the lows.

I'm referring to the USD world reserve currency situation. This started in 1944 with the Bretton Woods agreement which tied the USD to gold at 35 USD per ounce. Then after Nixon abandoned the gold link in Aug '71 and after the '73/'74 oil shocks which were a direct result of breaking that link a new OIL / USD link was established via a relationship with Saudia Arabia and the US whereby Saudia Arabia would buy US Treasuries with excess oil revenue. This situation was enforced around the world by the US government up until the present time. Recently countries such as Libya and Iraq have been invaded / destroyed because they planned to sell oil for gold or euros. But now this is falling apart. See what is happening between the US and Iran / China / Russia.

Bitcoin still trades like a natural market, unlike so many other markets that have been corrupted by AI dirty tricks, and overt manipulation.
Natural markets exhibit fractal patterns similar to those pointed out in the image.
We are in the later stages of the same pattern which immediately preceded the launch from ~200 to ~1150 in late 2013.
Assuming that this plays out, we can expect another launch in the coming weeks. Since the time has been so long for this pattern to develop, the gain is likely to be relatively higher than last time. Last time the gain was 1150/200 = 5.75.
Given such a gain this time we are looking at a peak price for the next run up of 5.75 x 400 =  2300. However I expect that the gain will be greater because of the long consolidation and raging fundamentals, both for bitcoin and against holding any fiat currency.
At 4000 USD the market cap of of Bitcoin is ~ 60 Billion. This is the current market cap of Colgate-Palmolive which is  in the SP500 list by market cap. Shows you just how far we have to go.

Market cap applies to any entity that trades on a market.
However I can understand some confusion on this point. After all the USD has no market cap as such, because there are no transparent rules governing its supply.

If you can prove that you are running a full node and you are holding at least X BTC then you get a share of the reward. Everyone would get the same share of the reward.
Of course you could multiply the number of shares that you get, by spreading your wealth among many wallets, however, you would have to run an independent full node for each share that you get.

The program syncs to the Bitcoin blockchain in the same way that lite wallets like BreadWallet sync, using blockchain headers. This blockchain sync is required in order to obtain an immutable timestamp, from the last block in the chain, from several peers. 
An internet connection is required for that.
However, your data file is encrypted into the LockBox and at no time does TimeLock upload your data file or the LockBox.

@_date: 2016-06-11 00:16:21
The reason for bitcoin to go up to 6 to 10 K USD this time is simply because the financial system is imploding and bitcoin can not absorb much buying without a price explosion. For instance at 10,000 USD the market cap for Bitcoin would only be 160 B USD, that's between Pepsico and Intel.

Now you are superstitious. 
This is my chart. 
I bought before the last run up years ago, stopped buying at about 330, sold 20% on the bounce after the top ~ 1000 USD. 
I bought a little on the way down from that, but really started accumulating in the low 200s this time.
I've already stopped accumulating, just holding, plan to sell 20% again after the next bubble pops.
Bottom line... this has worked for me. Do what you will.

What you should look out for is bullish sentiment among a broader segment of the public along with tremendous new all time highs.

That is certainly how markets work, to some extent. But Bitcoin is a very small market, and the whole financial system is imploding. If a little excitement here ripples out, so much the better.

I agree with your sentiment. Something like Lightning Network can unleash Bitcoin so that everyone can be paid in real money, not in promises. 
However, there as always been credit. An economy needs credit to run efficiently.  Huge problems arise when government in collusion with private interests interferes with the credit markets. A promise to receive money is not the same thing as money in hand. The interest rate on a promise is supposed to make up the difference. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as there is a free market in promises to deliver money and/or goods.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:18:21
Gold and Bitcoin are a better place your your savings than any account that the government can get its hands on.
The way that you can really get in trouble is if you borrow money to buy gold or Bitcoin, don't do that. 
Don't buy Bitcoin when it is running away from its previous all time highs, we are not there yet. Buy what you can afford now. After the next bubble tops and the price stabilizes, you can start accumulating again. You've been paying attention, so you will know when the next stable low period occurs (like the 200's this time). By the way, that new low level is likely to be above 1000 next time.
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:43:21

@_date: 2016-06-13 00:13:37
I agree. To me one of the most important elements in the Bitcoin ecosystem is the recurring failure of exchanges. Exchanges are dealing in promises, until proven otherwise when people withdraw their crypto currencies.

More than that I realize that the ability to hold and spend without any third party involvement is what gives Bitcoin value.

I've been using Trezor for a while now. Very pleased with it. If you don't want to spend one hundred dollars to buy a trezor,  I would recommend MultiBit. I've been using that software for years without incident. 
The problem with Bitcoin core is that you have to download the whole blockchain and keep it up to date.
Unless you are using something like Trezor, you have to be careful that your system is clean and that your passwords are good.
The beauty of Trezor and other hardware wallets is that you don't have to worry about anyone hacking your system, now or in the future. That is important piece of mind.

I believe that you are correct in your concerns about LN. Perversely, the natural attraction of LN to rent seekers may grow that network, and the Bitcoin ecosystem very quickly over the next few years. 
However, seems to me that there will be competition which may limit the power of the rent seekers.
Your description of a credit system sounds a lot like the gold standard as envisioned by Antal Fekete. I think that this can be realized much more efficiently via crypto currencies than via gold.
I actually have no problem with promises of promises of promises of money being passed around as money, as long as they are properly discounted by a free market in interest rates. 
As it stands in our world today, no financial instrument in any form is worth a damn except with respect to its relationship to a political entity which stands behind it. So the whole thing can go up in smoke when there is a loss  in faith in said political entities.

@_date: 2019-10-25 22:29:38
In order to connect the blockchain to anything outside of it there is always an element of trust. Note that Lightning Network is not really outside of the blockchain, since it passes around BTC transactions.
An open source program can not do what TimeLock does, so yes there is an element of trust, as there is with any program that you use, unless you actually wrote it or reviewed all of it in detail.
Of course as the author of TimeLock, I know that it is trust worthy, and I also know that it must be as unhackable as possible in order to be useful.
Turns out that the hacking reports give you a lot of insight into what is going on under the hood. Over time people will trust timelock, or not. I can not control this, except by being honest.

Hi u/security_researcher,
Since the timestamp is included in the block hash and since there are constraints on the variability of the timestamp and on the variability of difficulty, even if you get TimeLock talking to your own network of fake nodes, I believe that all you can do is disrupt the timelock by a few hours, not annihilate it. Unless of course you can generate a bunch of fake blocks with sufficient POW.

Yes, increasing hash rate causes this slippage. With TimeLock I use peer Bitcoin network time which is quite accurate. I use block header timestamp as a reference. My question is how reliable is block header timestamp.
So now I have a pretty good idea.

In my ongoing efforts to improve TimeLock I've been studying variation of the embedded timestamp in the Bitcoin block header. The upper plot is the distribution of delta time between adjacent block header timestamps for blocks 500,000 to 591,689. The max time between adjacent block timestamps is 6377 seconds, the minimum time is -748 seconds. The average time is 579.3 seconds, which is considerably less than the targeted average time of 600 seconds.
The bottom plot shows ongoing time slippage, assuming that 600s time between block headers is expected.

I got involved in crypto currencies by reading the Bitcoin white paper. If you have not done so already, that is the best place to start.
Also, here is a very good video that you should watch:
Bitcoin faces two challenges:
1) Scaling to a higher transaction rate - limited to about 7 transactions per second right now.
My opinion - this problem will be solved with side chains.
2) Fungibility - bitcoins have a traceable transaction history and so an exchange may choose to deny service to you if they don't like what you have been doing with your funds or a merchant may choose to refuse your funds if they don't think that they come for a "clean" source.
Even now on this subredit there are people talking about being kicked out of Circle ... this is all about fungibility.
Fungibility is going to have a profound long term impact on bitcoin and crypto currencies in general. The current banking powers will permit Bitcoin to thrive as long as they see an opportunity to get back in control via the fungibility problem. However, there are other crypto currencies which do not have this problem, and there are potential solutions to this problem for Bitcoin.
I am paying close attention to this battle over Bitcoin fungibility. I think that this will be the key to understand where we are headed.

Crypto currencies are very easy to "take delivery of". And we have a community which encourages and understands this. This alone is revolutionary. All of the fraud in the financial system is predicated on the fact that people do not take delivery of or take account of what they own. 
Now the corrupt system is setting up everyone for bank bail ins while at the same time making it impossible to take delivery of their fiat currency. 
The value / utility of Bitcoin is very high in such a system. The current price of Bitcoin simply reflects the fact that most people have not figured this out, yet.

Gold gets hit when the stock market crashes because Gold is a big liquid market, a last ditch source of capital to cover margin calls.

Imagine that you live in the US and you want to import some machine parts from China, but the banks in China and the US don't trust one another. However, someone in the US will loan you 100 BTC using 50 ounces of gold as collateral. You only have to trust this local person, who holds the BTC. With the 100 BTC in hand, you send half of it to the address of the vendor in China, who initiates the shipment of the machine parts. At the same time you set up a transaction with the port authority in the US so that in order to take possession of the cargo, you need to release the other 50 BTC to the same address.
When the parts arrive, you sell them / use them to make a product. Now you can pay back the 100 BTC loan, plus interest and release your gold collateral.
Now you may ask, why do we need the gold? Good question. I've answered that above. People trust gold, but when people start doing this sort of thing, the need for gold will come into question. So I think that gold will become obsolete over time.

The presumption here is that Bitcoin can still change since it is in its "infancy". 
It's not clear at all to me that Bitcoin can continue to change. 
Don't be so dismissive of the alts. One of them seems to have learned a lot from Bitcoin's problems and has a demonstrated ability to change.
I agree that Bitcoin has a piddling market cap and user base in this wide world, so bitcoin MUST be able to change.

Fractional reserve BTC is only good for speculation. When people pay for something with BTC, the payee will expect the real thing.
Also, unlike gold, BTC are easy to take delivery of.
Finally, Bitcoin has people thinking about money and fraud, this post is a good example.

I'm assuming that you understand what a horror show the current monetary system is. Otherwise this is not going to make much sense to you.
The people who matter right now are smart individuals sitting on a lot of wealth. They understand that BTC is a bearer instrument and will demand to be paid in it.
The second layer systems which are being developed for BTC, like Lightning Network and Liquid Network pass around real Bitcoin transactions.  So when the general public starts using BTC, there will be very little friction, very little need to use a proxy, moreover, merchants will want to be paid in BTC, not someone's promise to pay BTC. They may well give discounts for payment in BTC over other forms.
@_date: 2018-11-30 07:26:52
I have followed the gold markets closely since about 2003, traded futures for a while until I could see that I was the sucker at the table. I'm still invested, gold, silver, miners. The last six years have been very painful for those investments.
In 2013 I stopped putting money in the PM market and switched over to crypto currency.
I think that you are too pessimistic. The appeal of owning a bearer instrument which is un-censorable (private and fungible) is extremely strong.
Smart individuals with capital will be inexorably drawn to crypto currencies, especially private and fungible crypto currencies. It does not matter if the broke public understands crypto currency or not. 
With incentives properly aligned, it will be game over for the fraudulent fiat currencies as a means of settlement and as a store of wealth.
This will ultimately benefit gold and silver. All markets will become much more fair when they are settled in crypto currency, rather than in debt based / political fiat money.

I can believe that CME may have had something to do with the crash below 6000 and something to do with the weird flat line at 6000 for months. But it is absurd to think that CME caused the crash from 20000, unless you also assume that Coinbase and other exchanges suddenly stopped plowing new money into BTC and started plowing it into fake CME Bitcoin, and the numbers in your graph do not support that.
Also, as more and more smart people with a lot of money to lose want to own BTC and not political fiat garbage, they will trade on exchanges which deliver actual BTC for settlement. I don't think that this is going to play out the way you imagine.

This can't be cracked by stepping over some logic. The data file is encrypted with the time lock data, not just the password and answer.
The following data are required in order to crack the LockBox:  Password, Answers, Available time range. However, none of these items are stored in the LockBox. (BTW I'm giving you all of this data for Challenge2.x)
The only way that the program knows that you have entered the right password and answers is if decrypted data is validated. The only way that the program knows if the BTC network time is inside of the required interval is if the data file decryption (using current BTC network time) is validated.
Data file decryption workload is programmable, can be made quite costly. Even if you have the source code for the program, the password and the answers, choosing a very high encryption cycle count for your lock box (and a narrow available time interval) can make cracking a lock box very costly.
Encryption cycle count of 10 for Challenge2.x means that about 20 seconds of CPU time will be required to decrypt.

I look forward to your write-up and to creating version 1.3. 
Although I made no attempt here to obscure the time lock decoding, reverse engineering this must have been a difficult task.
For others who are seeing this, please note, without the password and answers, cracking the timelock is not possible. Even if you have the answers and password, without the time lock information (which was provided for this challenge) cracking the timelock is very difficult. 
My goal is to make this as un-crackable as possible even if someone has the password, answers and timelock information. I appreciate the help from u/security_researcher!
@_date: 2019-01-17 05:46:55
I agree, however, if I open the source, someone can create a version of the tool which will obviate the time lock, not the password or answer protection, but yes the time lock. 
I'm thinking about a way to fix this, but it is a hard problem to solve.

1. There is a well defined tail emission of Monero, 0.6 XMR per block: 
 
 This results in a low and decreasing inflation rate. Bitcoin, which does not have a tail emission will become    increasingly vulnerable to games played by miners.
 
2. Point taken, but why not just keep your funds in XMR. This strikes me as a profoundly BTC centric perspective.

Don't wait for 10K, having a pre-determined price will be what kills you. Instead look for the hallmarks of a top.
You'll know that we are at the top when the price gets whipsawed by 20 percent or more a day after a huge run. Study previous tops carefully and you will recognize the characteristics of a top.
If you miss the top, you can catch the rebound top. There has always been one, but you have to be quick and you have to recognize the top as described above. The rebound top is usually about top minus 10 percent, but it does not last long.

Can't fault anyone for wanting to make a buck. When crypto currency goes more mainstream, there will be a market for credentialed experts. 
So maybe it will work out. But if I were you, I'd think about what you can do to reliably credential needed skills and ditch the old school "educational" mindset. Assess to education is nothing more than access to information. Except for a very few exceptions (private keys / insider access) information is becoming a zero margin business.
Anyone worth hiring already knows that they are not paying for education. They are paying for the access that the credential will give them, or in some cases they are paying for connections.

Side chains are a big area of activity around Bitcoin. All that effort will ultimately help Peercoin as well. If side chains are successful, then Bitcoin will probably move to a mandatory transaction fee like Peercoin (assuming that the political will to make that kind of change is there - maybe not). Meanwhile Peercoin has a blockchain size of 474 MB - just checked in on my computer here.

Markets are not efficient. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 07:30:46
The electrical power that you refer to is used to secure the blockchain. This has little to do with the transaction rate. Scaling proposals currently in the works will require about the same amount of power (per transaction) as is required to run transaction services like Visa. In fact, there will probably be a very competitive ecosystem of transaction service providers, and so the energy cost per transaction is likely to go way down over time.
On the other hand, as the value stored in the BTC network and as the value collected in transaction fees goes up, the market to mine blocks will become more competitive, the hash rate will continue to go up as will the power consumed. Ultimately it would be wonderful if something less resource intensive could be used to secure the blockchain. On the other hand, the amount of waste associated with the current banking system is enormous.
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:24:30
The next price revolution will happen because BTC is seen as a better gold. It will happen in conjunction with the price of gold going up.

Withholding supply when the price is going up is a form of speculation. Hedging (buying puts) when the price is "high" is speculation.

Gold will be a big deal during the unfolding worldwide currency crisis, so will Bitcoin. Then gold will slowly fade relative to Bitcoin.
1) Takes time for these things to change, especially something with as long a track record as gold.

3) Gold is hard to transport and easy to confiscate. Bitcoin is easy to transport and hard to confiscate.

Bitcoin is the most portable hard asset that has ever existed. During a currency crisis, the most portable reliable asset wins. Usually that is the dollar or euro or earlier, gold. This time, the most portable reliable asset will probably be Bitcoin. 
I expect that Bitcoin will go up far more than most people imagine possible during the inevitable worldwide currency crisis.

I agree that LN is probably seen as an opportunity for the rent seekers to move in and centralize things.

Counterparty, like Ethereum, deals in digital tokens. What is missing is the connection between digital tokens and the analog world. A lot of work needs to be done in that space, but only a vastly deeper Bitcoin market cap will facilitate that work.
Also, any contracts are only as indelible as the blockchain upon which they are validated, so ultimately, I expect that everyone will want to validate their smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain or its various offshoots.
None of this is a knock on Counterparty, given the troubles with Ethereum, it may be a good speculative investment right now.

Technical analysis does not work in manipulated markets and markets dominated by algorithm trading. 
I've seen plenty of that in gold/silver/shares. But so far at least, Bitcoin is a natural market. 
I'm a hodler since I've used these techniques to acquire as much BTC as I care to hodl. However, these same techniques continue to work for Bitcoin.
Some of the alts are much more interesting for speculating.

The most important lesson from Ethereum so far is that crypto currencies that become political, lose their value.

You can take some solace, I posted the same thing on r/BTC and it went straight to zero.

My understanding : what gets passed around are unconfirmed, valid BTC transaction. The whole system works because at any point any node could in theory submit a transaction to the BTC blockchain to redeam their balance. Of course their balance may be smaller than the BTC tx fee, so only in theory.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:10:22
I assume that by "partner" you mean a connected node.
I assume that by "part of your channel" you mean an unconfirmed BTC transaction representing a fraction of the BTC held by your node.

You may be right, but I'm not claiming anything (certainly not universal laws), just drawing boxes.

Covert ASIC Boost generates empty blocks. It is parasitical to the network. Games have already been played, short term interests pursued at the expense of the network. This is about fixing that.

Passing around Rare Pepe cards are a second layer solution already. People find a way. 
LN would give many more options. People would find ways to not open and close too many channels.
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:42:43
At seven transactions per second, the door is way too small. We need second layer scaling before this will be an option.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:34:07
When Bitcoin can support hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, then everything that the oligarchs do to lock people down will simply push them into using Bitcoin instead of political money. But we are not there yet.

The people that I know who are interested in Bitcoin are very uncomfortable maintaining their own wallet and actually taking possession of their private keys. They want an ETF or a Coinbase account where they let Coinbase handle their private keys.
I think that the average person, even if they know that they should own Bitcoin, don't understand what it really means take delivery or why it is important. The average person just flat does not want to take on that responsibility. That is the huge gulf between the average person and people like us.
In other words, they are all going to get burned. I don't think that you can save them.  The best that you can ever hope for, for the average person, is a competitive market place in Bitcoin banking.
I think that we are headed in that direction.

Coverter ASIC Boost only works when empty blocks are produced. It's a bug. Should have been fixed a long time ago.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:56:40
Bitcoin is still pretty transparent. I'm sure that that is viewed as a good thing. The major proposals for for scaling do provide opportunities for rent seeking, although I don't see how that could be sustained for very long.
I suppose that since the Chinese seem to have all the gold, Bitcoin could be viewed as a way to subvert gold as a desperately needed reserve asset when the time comes, but that does not make much sense unless you can control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:46:30
I thought that LN passed around unconfirmed BTC transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:37:34
Unless the code is open for inspection, these are merely words. Those presenting this option have benefited from covert ASIC Boost and have held up Segwit and lied about covert ASIC Boost.
The burden of proof is on Setwit2X.

Is it no longer enough to talk about backing a .gov currency with gold, must one now talk about making that currency a blockchain? 
We have come a long way if this is already the case.

Where is your evidence, the only link posted here on this matter corroborates what I am saying.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:51:26
From the link, here is the crux of the matter, with SegWit2X a miner using covert ASIC Boost can still create empty blocks for their own benefit and at the expense of the network. There is a way to close this loophole, SegWit2X does not do that:
 cdelargy commented 24 days ago • edited
Blocks which contain witness commitments effectively disable covert (but not overt) ASICBOOST, however **blocks which do not contain witness data can be constructed with an advantage using covert and overt ASICBOOST**.
 describes a mechanism (not present in Bitcoin 0.14+) to require blocks to contain a witness commitment that would inhibit covert ASICBOOST use as well as a change to nVersion validation that would also disable overt ASICBOOST at

The best time to buy is when crytpo is not getting much attention and the price has been low and stable for a few weeks or months..

The interesting smart contracts will have a solid connection to the real (non crypto currency) world. That connection has not been created yet. When the amount of capital that Bitcoin brings to the table justifies creating the appropriate infrastructure, it will be created.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:54:04
The reason that covert ASIC Boost is so damaging is because it promotes mining centralization which gives the miner in control a choke hold on innovation. We've see this for a long time now. This is why Bitcoin has stagnated.

Please make up your own mind and don't blame anyone for what happens as a result of your own decisions. I'm just providing information. 
Because I have been right in the past, I already own as much BTC as I care to own and I am a hodler.

Not mining the high and low grades during times when the price of gold is high is a form of speculation in itself.
@_date: 2016-07-31 05:27:56
Yes, well I'm hoping that LN and other scaling options are in place by they time we need them.

SetWit2X does not block covert ASICBoost - and covert ASICBoost creates empty blocks.

When the price of gold goes up, the value of the ore in the ground, essentially the value of the enterprise, goes up. Miners are inclined to protect and nurture that value. When the price of gold goes down, miners are just trying to survive.
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:21:32
There is a simple way to block covert ASIC boost which would affect no one except those who are currently generating covert ASIC boost empty blocks. Unfortunately, the 30% hash rate advantage of covert ASIC boost has lead to hash rate dominance by the parasitic miners who use it.
If you change the PoW algo, you hurt all the other miners as well. Such a hard fork would produce an alt coin whose market cap would be much less than the market cap of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-16 01:02:09
When the gold price is low, the miners are forced to mine high grade ore which may be still be mined profitably. When gold prices are high, miners mine low grade ore, extending the life of their mine and reducing total output. I suppose that in an extreme mania, miners might start mining the high grade so that they could unload more gold more quickly, but I've never heard of a miner doing that.

Good points. All of this will get a huge push when/if the bankers try to shut down access to Bitcoin via the channels that they control.

* Bitcoin is a demonstrably and increasingly more reliable store of value than most fiat currencies over the last several years.
* The messy ETH/ETC is some rather profound evidence (along several trajectories) that Bitcoin has and will retain market dominance. 
* The most important utility of crypto currency right now is to subvert capital controls, outright theft of wealth etc. 
* The second most important utility of CC right now is to facilitate transactions which are impractical or impossible using political money.
* The general public in the west will be late to the party.

Yes, and they may be denominated in milli satoshi, which are rounded down to whole satoshi when submitted to the BTC network.
And so all currency kept and used by LN nodes is inherently BTC, originally derived from a transaction on the BTC blockchain which opened the channel.

So that someone else can re-hypothecate your BTC.
