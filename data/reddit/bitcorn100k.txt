Yes i agree. But thats like saying YEAH, BITCOIN NEEDS TO BE AT 1 MILLION DOLLARS IN SIX MONTHS!!! What do you suggest? How can bitcoin become resistant? Honestly I'm tired of all of the hollow positive cheerleading in this sub. and the memes. the fucking memes. This is serious, i have real money invested. I'm over the silly euphoria phase, and all of the members of this sub slapping eachother on the ass constantly, people here are only worried about making it to 10K, we should be worried about making the tech faster and easier to use, undoubtedly the price will follow. Elon Musk is worried about making a better future, making a better car, not making bags of money. You will be your own demise if you think you can simply "cheer" the price up to 10K 20K 50K GOOOOOO BITCOIN!!!
