The tulip shares had an underlying asset, the tulip.  So once everyone realized the shares were overvalued compared to what the asset was worth, they began selling.  Same happens with most other bubbles, Dot Com, Housing Market etc.  Bitcoin is a currency and has no underlining asset.  It's better than most fiat because the supply is fixed, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.  It's value is in it's liquidity and demand instead of an underlying asset.  Liquidity means that it is easy to trade and spend.  Demand is what others are willing to pay for it.  This means that it could go to zero, or to the moon.  No one can put a value on it because there is no intrinsic value.  Every currency is volatile in the beginning, but if they catch on they eventually stabilize.  Only time will tell if it is adopted by the masses as a long term store of wealth, but so far it has recovered from every crash to pass its all time highs.

I like to say "If you install Coinbase on your phone right now, I'll give you $10 worth of Bitcoin no strings attached."  $10 is a good amount because they'll remember they started with $10.  Then when they look at their wallet and see that it's now worth $11 they'll be hooked and want to buy more!  But if you just show them a chart they'll be like "so what".  If you give them a small amount, that's the best way to hook em in from my experience.

I don't think it has enough momentum to break $5,000 yet, I think there will be a selloff to about $3,600 over the next week, then we will break $5,000 right before the fork.  I'm holding about half BTC and half USDT right now so that I'll be able to buy the dip.

I knew about the fraudulent banking system before I got into bitcoin.  When I first learned about bitcoin, I instantly knew how powerful it could be against the big banks.  I pretty much went all in right away, that was back in January.  Since then I've been obsessed with learning about the history of money and banking, trying to understand the past so that I will be able to better predict the future.
