The way bitcoin works is simple. Once you understand how it works and how simple it is you will realize a blockchain is really just a basic application of the merkle tree data structure shared over a peer-to-peer network.
What is not able to be understood is why anyone puts value behind bitcoin. It's probably mostly the result of core human behavioral psychology and the need to collect and hoard useless things in the potential event that they may find use or value for them later. Bitcoin creates a digital version of exactly that.
Human behavioral psychology is one of the least understood fields of study.

BCH is just as bad as a hack solution. The blockchain size is already prohibitively too large for people to house their own wallets, further causing more people to rely on centralized services to handle their wallets, reducing the security and reliability of the network. The reliance on centralized wallet providers also make it no better than PayPal or banking institutions, which undermines the original purpose of Bitcoin. BCH makes that even worse. It isn't sustainable in the long run just to have bigger blocks. And it will still run into the same scaling problems when usage goes up.

The purpose of lightning was to scale Bitcoin so that it *can* be consumed by the masses without grinding the whole network to a halt with prohibitively high transaction fees. If it is only used by a small niche, it doesn't help at all what it was intended to so.

Cryptocurrency as a whole is still in its early days. However Bitcoin is pretty antiquated and old. It was more of a proof of concept that hit it off, but doesn't scale and was never intended for mass adoption.
Some who are still heavily invested in it believe it can be fixed or patched, but the fixes all require migrating into new systems and using new software that adds additional confusion and complexity. One can just as easily move onto one of the 1000s of other altcoins that were built to scale and for mass adoption. 
But if you, like others rushing to buy in on a speculative bubble hoping cash out as a millionaire from the ["greater fool"]( be aware it's gamble at this point. Those who win such gambled tend to be those bet on the system before the masses start to. And that the masses are all trying to get in on crypto bets, the risks are higher than ever.

People believe it is a ponzi scheme because those who invest in it early on it early can profit off of those who invest in on it late, while no product or service of actual value is produced. Unlike actual business shares/stocks which turns investment into dividends over time to back the value of stocks of an actual business that has revenue streams and a product/service, a ponzi scheme has no product or service or revenue other than that generated by the investment revenue itself.
Bitcoin however, in theory is supposed to work as a decentralized peer-to-peer currency system, like a replacement for digital cash. This gives it a service of value outside of investment into the system. Its revenue stream comes from miners who collect transaction fees in exchange for securing the network.
However, since the ability to function like cash or a currency is removed from bitcoin or rendered useless, and the majority of transactions and value of bitcoin comes from trading/investment/speculation. The majority of bitcoin wallets have been frozen due to the cost of transaction fees inhibiting the use as a currency/peer-to-peer cash. Until these issues with bitcoin is fixed to actually function as it is intended, it will essentially be the same as a ponzi scheme, even if this was not the intention of bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:08:00
It *should* be able to be used as a currency, but it can't because of how hard and costly it is to move it around, rendering it effectively useless as a currency.
Imagine yourself at Starbucks and you are trying to buy a cup of coffee that costs $5. However, it costs $30 to take $5 out of your wallet to pay for a cup of coffee, and you had to wait 2-3 hours before you can receive your coffee. How can such a system be considered valuable or even usable currency?

Thats a circular arguement. It has value and you can buy things with it because people gave it value. What isn't understood is *why* people choose to give it the value it has in the first place when it had zero value to start with.


There have been thousands of attempts for people to go off and create their own crypto. New cryptocurrencies are being created nearly every day now because of how easy and trivial it is to implement a simple block chain or fork an existing one. It then just becomes a challenge of getting other people to use or buy into it since it has zero value to begin with. It only gets any value once you convince enough other people to give it value.
You can basically go create your own bitcoin derivative/fork, assign yourself a few million coins, and convince other people to buy into your ICO and you have quite literally generated your own money.

What idiots here don't realize is that increasing the block size makes Bitcoin less decentralized as it also increases the size of the block chain along with it, along with the bandwidth used by the network.
Thus it increases the power and authority of centralized online wallets, as offline or self hosted wallets become unaffordable to the common user. This turns online wallet providers into powerful institutions just as powerful as current banking systems, thus undermining the whole purpose of Bitcoin.

As long as transaction fees remain so high to make it unusable as a legitimate currency and renders the majority of wallets frozen due to lack of enough funds to cover transaction fees. And those invested in bitcoin are constantly parading "BUY BUY BUY HODL HODL HODL" to keep up pumping its value up, it will look the  same as a ponzi scheme to anyone who asks.

You gained what someone else lost. That is what zero sum means. The total amount of spends vs gain will also sum to zero. Who ever has not cashed out yet are still at a loss until they cash out as they have only spent and made no gains. The speculative value of your current holdings does not count as gains. You can have the last Bitcoin left in the world, price it at a billion dollars, but you don't have a billion dollars until someone actually spends that amount to buy.

Maybe you misread my point. I'm not saying its intended or supposed to be a ponzi scheme.

This assumes bitcoin's market cap isn't capped by the world economy market cap. The world economy market cap is valued at $80-100 trillion. if 10% of the world economy is transferred into bitcoin, that means the the maximum market cap for bitcoin could be 8 trillion. There is a cap of 21 million bitcoins that will ever be available. That means the value of 1 Bitcoin would be capped at a max of $380,952 assuming 10% of the world economy is Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's value is also speculative. Its current trade value is based on the assumption that the value will rise in the future minus the risk it will drop in the future. This means people buying overpriced bitcoins on trades are appreciating the value up to 2x because people thing they will get 2x gains within the next few months to profit.

Well you could transfer some more coins to that wallet, which will give it enough of a balance to make an outgoing transfer.

Any investment *can* be a ponzi scheme if the investment itself is mostly yields returns off of other later investors. The difference with a legitimate investment is that a legitimate investment yields returns from an actual business's product or service, not the investment deals themselves.
Some ponzi schemes can be pyramid like, but those are known as "pyramid schemes". Ponzi is a more general blanket term around many types of investment schemes that have little to do with investing in an actual product or service, but revolve around the investment scheme itself. 


Many ponzi schemes also claim you can withdraw or cash out your investment at any time, but have systems in place to heavily discourage doing so, or impose heavy fees or penalties for doing so. Most exchanges have high withdrawal fees, and bitcoin itself imposes very high transaction fees making it a very hefty loss to immediately withdraw after a deposit.
In in regards to the comparison to Gold, like other precious metals and materials have actual value outside of their use as a store of value. It is highly conductive and doesn't corrode. They can be used for electronics, semiconductors, jewelry, dentistry, cables, etc. This gives it real value and demand. Bitcoin however doesn't offer real value outside of its use of being a cryptocurrency. It could be comparable to gold if bitcoin could actually be used as an actual cryptocurrency and didn't suffer the issues preventing it from being used as one.

If an exchange gets shut down, it won't be because Bitcoin is banned, it would be because they didn't properly file the required paperwork nor received the required approvals to do business.

A ponzi scheme necessitates that the scheme is set up such that buying into the scheme *now* intends or hopes to cash out on people who buy into it *later*. 
I'm not saying bitcoin is a intended or designed as a ponzi scheme, I'm saying it is increasing looking more and more like one based on how it is currently being used/exploited by the majority of it's stake holders. There is no single ringleader or operator, just a noncentralized collective whole participating in activities that very strongly resembles a ponzi scheme. hodl, moon, lambo anyone?

Yes. This is my point. The issues that Bitcoin is currently facing is what is turning it into a ponzi-like system ripe for exploitation of investment fraud. I don't want to be pessimistic, but the issues it is currently facing and the situation it is currently in is causing many to turn a blind eye to its problems simply to keep up the bubble pumping hype.
I'm very optimistic for the future of cryptocurrencies and their applications. There is immense value in secure p2p currency systems. But there is little value to gain from exploiting the systems as if they are ponzi schemes and that will only further hinder progress for crypto currencies as a whole.

That is exactly they are very similar. Bitcoin never had any value outside of being a currency. But it's value was pumped by speculation due to it's limited run supply, just like Beanie Babies.
The only reason why people are valuing a bitcoin at $10k that someone else may have picked up for $10 a few years ago is because they speculate they they can sell it for $100k in a few more years down the line.
They aren't valuing it at $10k because they believe bitcoins are the second coming of christ. Bitcoins are here and now. There was a time when you could order pizzas and buy games on steam with bitcoins but not anymore. The revolution already came and gone and not much became of it other than offering revolutionary platforms for scams, ransomeware, money laundering, and tax evasion.

A business account sending money directly to or from a crypto-currency exchange would look an awful lot like a form of money laundering or investment fraud if you don't file the proper legal paperwork first and clear it with the bank before issuing the transfers. It would make better sense to use a trade or investment bank to manage your funds as they handle these sort of things better.

You have to learn to live with the fact that bitcoin is in fact the hot tech bubble of the century. No one ones if or when it will bust (it could bust next week, next month even maybe 10-30 years from now, who knows), but one thing is certain that many will stand to lose out a lot in the end. 
The best thing you can do for yourself, especially if you are a HODLer, just keep to yourself. Don't shill. Don't brag. Not even to close friends. Especially don't try and convince others/friends/family/coworkers to buy in as well otherwise they will assume your life is already destroyed like those who get heavily bought into MLM schemes.
You can talk/brag *after* you cash out your gains if you even do manage to cash out before the inevitable bust. But if you get caught holding the bag after the bust, be prepared to live with that fact. The fact you chose to buy into an obvious bubble is the risk you must be willing to take, along with the same and ridicule that comes with it.

Wait for it to hit rock bottom before you buy in. It is either still too late to buy in now and you don't want be regretting buying in so late like those who bought in at the post 20k dip. Wait for the price to drop sub $1000.

It wont crash. It will just deadlock and no one would be able to cash out while the speculative "value" continues to rise to absurdly. The actual value will drop to zero because the network is too big and it just becomes a write off for all those who invested in it only to realize the system could never scale and all the current value has been based purely off of speculation due to the lack of its liquidity as a such as large scale due to transactions taking years, even decades to complete without transaction fees that exceed the value of the transaction.
Eventually at some point, 1 BTC could be valued at 1 million dollars, but a transactions takes a longer than the lifespan of a human's lifespan thus you would need to spend more than 1 million dollars to cover the transaction fees to get a transaction that would be completed in your lifetime so in the end, its basically worthless.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:13:55
The problem with deflationary assets is that you will always end up with a situation where more people will buy up that asset than they will ever need to use and such cause the value of the asset to rise based on the speculation it will continue to rise in the future and will always lead to bubble economies. 
This happens with land and real-estate as it is a deflationary asset. You end up with many people investing in buying land and real-estate, more than they could ever use or need for themselves, purchasing it simply for the speculation they will be able to profit off of it in the future. Eventually as properties are a limited resource, you will end up in a situation where property values are priced so high that people stop buying and everyone is sitting on over valued properties that no one wants to buy anymore. The moment people actually tried to liquidate their properties, the property values will drop so fast that very few will be able to actually profit while most will lose out.
Bitcoin is in a similar situation. More people are buying bitcoins off of the prospect of profiting off of them instead of actually using them as a currency.

What bitcoin needs is a long term stable value. This up 10% one day, down 20% the next day does more harm than good. People buying and hoarding bitcoins just for the prospect of selling at a higher value in the future is also as harmful and only contributes to the pricing instability. 
Bitcoin has little long term value being collected hoarded, but has most value when used as a currency to trade for goods and services. Instead it just has imaginary value that carries no weight or stability because it isn't grounded on anything to spend on like land/property, wages etc. It's imaginary value can double when anyone pumps millions on an exchange, and drop by half when someone dumps millions of coins for sale. That needs to change else less people will stop believing in the imaginary value and it will fizzle away like it never existed.
 I feel like this sub has lost sight of what the original intent of what Bitcoin was invented for as everyone just treats it as some sort of investment scheme to profit off of instead of actually use.

If people stopped spending bitcoin, the less demand it will have for people to buy bitcoins. The less demand, the less value. It basically just turns into those special minted collector's coins.
Currently, bitcoin is mostly valued in speculation - that is value is based on the speculation that it *might* be more valuable later *if* it becomes more widely adopted. Unfortunately that adoption won't happen if people don't use it as a currency.
Basically, if the majority of bitcoin adopters only hodl, the less bitcoin has in value. Hodling only becomes profitable if done in the minority while the majority spends and uses it as a currency increasing adoption of it as a currency and deflating it's value.
