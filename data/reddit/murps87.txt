Wasn't this year supposed to be good for cryptos? What a joke 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:16:54
Looks like a bitcoin graph atm
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:25:28
I like how everyone thinks shops accepting bitcoin will work. Once the shopkeeper recieves your bitcoin he or she is going to hold it indefinitely and just keep using cash as currency
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:20:31
Cool story man 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:20:28
That's what people want. Why is that wrong? You don't want to profit? 
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:44:57
Thank you. Internet has killed humour.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:17:41
I've never had a problem with coinbase. Store buy and sell in one spot.

The bitcoin ship is hodling steady whilst the shitcoin ships are taking water arrrgh! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:02:28
We could try it for lols 
@_date: 2018-09-25 04:23:45
Phew guys it’s recovering quickly! Onward and upwards! Tis but a scratch!
Edit: burn everything!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:30:11
So he holds half and converts the other half for cash? So where in that does he use bitcoin as a currency? How am I wrong? kinda supports my point doesn't it? +
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:54:31
What a mental image that is
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:42:48
I’m like Bob Ross at this point. Waiting on those good times now.
@_date: 2018-09-07 03:00:37
I’ve come to give away pumps and dumps... and I’m all outta dumps.
@_date: 2018-09-07 03:01:41
Everything is going to be ok
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:50:39
When pump?
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:10:00
The bitcoin said to the other "have you been working out? Look at your gains"
@_date: 2018-09-27 23:08:17
I can smell that leather interior of lambo now..
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:26:16
Getting ready to cut my life from this crypto bs. Hardly worth the headache. Keep lying to yourselves and say it’ll get better one day blah blah blah. It’s all a scam and we are the suckers.
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:12:06
That spike reminded me of times past. I felt alive if not for a brief moment...
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:10:00
Gains, you lust
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:17:31
Ok pump time 
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:26:08
Bitcoin had a good day today.
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:54:04
Is this it? The new norm of price will be what it’s hovering around or below. I feel this bitcoin fad is dying and we’ll all be left in the red. Sad, wanted my lambo.
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:20:24
The poor fools..

God this is ugly 
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:15:21
Checkout litecoin at the moment, lucky I got a hand in both this and that. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:48:29
So many banners it looks scammy
@_date: 2018-10-01 21:34:11
I wholeheartedly agree. Hope this scheme makes me rich. I don’t care for much else.
@_date: 2018-10-18 10:20:35
Someone poke it with a stick and make it wiggle up
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:20:28
“I’m just in it for the technology”
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:09:53
I’m getting excited..... again!
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:44:20
Is it the 6th of June yet?
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:39:14
Tis but a scratch
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:23:16
So glad I didn’t sell, back up we go! Being patient will pay off :)
@_date: 2019-02-28 09:45:42
Little pump 
Hope no dump
Don’t sell it chump 
It’s just a slump 
Soon be plump
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:15:09
The slow climb begins again ....
@_date: 2019-02-27 09:52:55
I just bought more. Could go up or down but if up it’s all profit. If down then hodl for long term. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 09:48:03
I’ll give you 2.5 bitcoin for it now 
@_date: 2019-12-29 11:06:37
*rolling tumbleweed*
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:38:36
Don’t dip down, keep going up 
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:14:20
It is all going to be ok 
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:18:11
Lambos, every colour you can imagine 
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:28:53
I’m moistened 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:35:53
We mooning now boys get your bitcoin before the discounts finish.
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:40:39
Can we just go up already?
@_date: 2018-03-21 05:15:55
This is the big pump boys, it's in the air, can you feel it? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:22:20
May the crypto gods look down in favour today boys! Can I get an amen!
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:07:25
Im in Australia and its sitting on 11,200
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:47:50
This discussion turns on a dime. When it dips everybody freaks and sells then when it's on the climb people are so happy and optimistic hodling and loving life.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:00:58
Looks tacky. Sad 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:36:45
I’m actually excited to buy a lot more bitcoin, I’m not going to get negative about it, I’m going to use this time as a positive and accumulate. 
There is only up and down. That’s your only 2 options how bitcoin behaves. I’m going to gather more and sit on it like an egg and see how it reacts in a few years. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:05:41
I think nostradamus mentioned bitcoin in his prophecies 
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:38:34
Bitcoin is like a mother to us all, fight for her! 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:04:59
