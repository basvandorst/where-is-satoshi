Hi, I'm one of the top bitcoin traders in the Philippines trading using this account: 
We've definitely observed a huge growth this year compared to last year.
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:05:51
Hi, we're currently processing all the bitcoin rewards and another round will start soon! Let me know if you need any help. :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:52:32
To put it simply, the Philippines is a former US colony and English is still an official language.  :)

Hi Eric, I'm the CEO of the company that built this game, Loud Panda Inc. One product we're developing is Paylance.ph.
At Paylance.ph, we're thinking exactly the same thinking. We're going to continue building softwares that tip players/visitors with bitcoin and use Paylance as the platform on top.

Austerity happens when Govt needs to pay interest to banks.

Hi, this is not a bug. We definitely see this kind of volume in my Localbitcoin account: 
I also own and manage a site:  which is also experiencing a big growth.

I agree with HaplessFool. sqig is practically saying that in the current banking system, Bitcoin is bad because, well, the current banking system is developed with an inflationary economy in mind.
But that doesn't mean there won't be lending/borrowing that will happen in a deflationary economy... the normal terms/conditions for loans will be vastly different.

because the banks are controlled by the elites and they don't like deflation.

Hi, right now the game rewards just the top 15 players every week and the reward decreases as the players' rank decreases. But we're working on tipping all players with bitcoins. This one is coming soon!
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:54:19
Sure! :)
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:08:27
Bitcoin Rewards system is powered by Paylance.ph.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:38:14
Hi, Paylance.ph is a sister company of Loud Panda Games. The reward is fixed every week. But we increase or lower it depending on the ad revenues.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:40:28
Thanks! I agree!
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:27:27
Hi, Paylance.ph gets a lot of bitcoins everyday. It's not a problem for us. :)
EDIT: Please read this article: 
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:27:21
We did take a look and we'll look at it again. Thanks for reporting.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:03:51
Yes. We'll launch an iOS version soon!
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:04:36
Due to popular demand, Facebook Login is no longer required in the latest update.
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:54:49
Thanks man! :)
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:49:47
We didn't have a promo that gave away 25 bitcoins. Pretty sure there was a misunderstanding. We also gave away coins (in-game coins) aside from bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-04-15 07:11:16
Hi Sir,
1. Yes, we're facilitating people to spend BTC directly through our PocketMarket merchants.
2. Yes, we can give a referral fee but it's not yet integrated within the system so we have to do this manually. I will send you a PM.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:26:54
nice thanks
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:10:02
Thanks for the suggestion. We'll definitely look into this. :) Thanks man!
