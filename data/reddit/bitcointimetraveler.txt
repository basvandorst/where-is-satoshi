No one will believe it, allowing us to work back here without causing dramatic changes. As long as I don't provide too much detail we will be fine. But the post are necessary for a select few who will invest, and other who will hold because of the curiosity of post like these, some of those few are very important figures in my time who would not get to where they go should they not come accross posts like this keeping them in the field instead of falling out to the fud

Fiat never goes away, but instead becomes another version of a so called stable coin. The predominant one of my time is the IDMT created by the central banks to combat libra and other stable coins. While unsuccessful at stomping them out, it is the most commonly used coin in public for those too afraid to use their Bitcoin and other deflation-airy coins should they lose their positions.

Non ever become as successful in size and market dominance, but plenty do make way higher returns because of their smaller market size leading to more room for growth. But if your asking by market cap size, here's the previous list from the time I answered this question in my last AMA:

Through a currently unstable isotope that gets perfected which generates enough energy to make it possible to generate gravity fields, that allows us to disengage from out current timeline and travel freely amongst others. The isotope is famously known from a man named Bob Lazar who worked at area 51 and mentioned it as proof to what he worked on there. The unstable version of the isotope he mentioned wasn't confirmed decades later till the 2000's adding validity to his claims everyone thought to be a fars. There are also digital forms of time travel we sometimes use to not physically have to travel by quantumly entangled Quebits. Those can only go as far back as the first time a quantum connection was established, which was around back in 2010, but not publicly made known till 2016. Scientist holding those connections live today have no idea the static they see coming out of those connections are actually encrypted communications that go out into the real world and translate into social media interactions like this amongst other things. For this trip I'm here physically, but there have been other times where I've visited back digitally. The famous post from 2013 from the bitcoin terrorist were done through these means too, so the Luke Magana person never actually traveled back to this time but transmitted his post instead.

Ask u/muchi21muchi21 he interacted with me in my u/old_negotiations account I used 30+ years ago for me the last time I was in 2019. He can verify through direct messages we had that I am the same traveler who was here in January. I'd make a post with my old account, but as you'll see it was destroyed.

In my time it gets exposed and widely known that institutions caused FUD on bitcoin then started buying the dips their fud propaganda caused. Documentaries get made showing how they did this with the tech stock boom and crash, and housing stock boom and crash in order for them to grab majority share hold of the markets. Except this doesn't work for them with crypto, they never grab majority share, and soon all the majority shares they grabbed in housing and tech; they get bought up by early crypto adopters slowly breaking their chains and economic control of those markets. In my time they hold no power, and the fud they attempt to cause becomes buy signals for the majority. Because the masses soon realize that true shitty investments they ignore, but good investments that are bound to make returns they shit talk, all so they can buy more

Lightning is implemented and makes transactions instant as well as making Bitcoin even more divisible. The 3 and 4 layers are apps that integrate the lightning network. Layer 4 would be the equivalent of an app using your facebook account to make an account for you on their app requiring no further input from yourself.

We have fake identities we procure to get passed these walls. It's relatively easy for our tech to inject an identity into your modern day government infrastructures servers and manufacture out own ID's and socials. If it was my day, this would be much harder as everything is done through blockchain making it next to impossible to alter.

It gets turned into a yearly convention where people gather at the area 51 UFO hotel for lectures, and other things UFO related. Funny enough, the man Bob Lazar who is the reason behind it all is one of the catalyst that leads to a stable version of an isotope called element 115 he mentioned in the 1970's and wasn't confirmed to exist till the 2000's. That allows us to create enough energy to generate our own gravity fields, that gives us the ability to physically travel through timelines. Few attempt to go into the actual base, but they have no success. Later the government throws a PR stunt allowing media into the facility after it has been staged to look like a normal military base in attempts to discredit Bobs words of having worked on UFO's for the government. But that fails and only helps further validate his story.
One more piece of future evidence, soon Epstein is announced dead of suicide before his trial ends. Trump the same day of announcement retweets to tweets pointing towards Bill Clinton being behind it to deflect the fact that it was himself who killed him. It is eventually tied back to Trump and a whole slew of powerful people go down with him.
Edit: It appears my last prediction has come to pass. I must go now as things get too intense when things like this this happen. If I communicate with you again it will be from the future through a D-wave Qbit quantum communication from my time to yours. It will be too intense now for me to come back physically with the current world government researching this and not just my own future installments in this time. Hodl tight ancestors, and stack sats as your time says. I'll see you and your kin in the citidales
Edit 2: responding to the hash rate worry- Computing power continues to get exponentially faster, accommodating for the hash rate increase. Power generation eventually becomes self sufficient with solar panel draw and battery capacity improvements with graphene too.

Your lambo is still possible. Litecoin will be a good buy too for more money per your investment, but I'd still recommend trying to grab .01 of a bitcoin. In the future Bitcoin is used as a strong indicator for approval on buying things like houses cars ect. Can be used to leverage a loan and use someone else's money for a purchase instead of using your bitcoin and losing your market position like say you try and buy an apartment complex but you don't want to lose all your bags/positions doing so.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:56:51
People are still searching for this thing in my time. Someone actually bought it too for that exact reason and turns it into a tourist attraction where people pay to come dig through the trash field. They hide paper wallets for the events as a lottery type deal to incentivize the tourism

We have a little more downslope on the neck before the next run up. Trump's FUD last a little while. Rejoice though, because it's the last time you get to buy under 10k. After this, people wish they could go back to take advantage of it. Shit people in my time would kill to be able to come back to now.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:16:45
Because no one will believe it, except for a very few who are supposed too. The majority will think it a troll or larp leaving the timeline in tact. If I ever provided too accurate proof then I'd be in trouble.

All who hodl here are neighbors in my time. Some even multi neighbors in multiple citidales, from multiple homes and rental properties. The ones who don't hodl in the long run like u/thredhead; they sell from the 100k to 30k dip and come back in too late to buy enough for the citidale
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:11:45
It is not. There seems to have been a deviation as in my timeline the Trump tweet wasn't supposed to happen till much later in the year. I wasn't supposed to come back till 2020 originally. Last time I was here with you all in January was 30 years ago for me. I was from 2028 back then; I'm from the 2050's now. This dip however will be the last time anyone gets to grab bitcoin for sub 10k
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:24:15

We don't know if it's our travels causing these changes. We manage to make these posts as small and unbelievable as possible. Our scientist suspect something or someone else is causing these changes. If it is determined that it is my doing, you can expect I won't be heard from again if my time's government finds out we have been traveling back here without their knowledge and causing changes.

@_date: 2019-07-16 22:05:36
If you look at the link I added to my last AMA you'll see that as the first answer. But in short, I did. I come back for every dip because you can only buy certain amounts without effecting the timeline. Buying too much at any given point can be dangerous to crypto taking away funds from those who would need it to continue to push the project as far as it has come and will go.

@_date: 2019-07-22 03:56:41
This is a good strategy, but it's a lot more complicated than just going back and buying stocks that will succeed. You need to calculate the largest amount you could take without drastically altering the future by taking too big a portion of the winnings. There was one guy who did it back in the early 1900's with stocks. Took too much and got lost forever not being able to return to his own time. Altering the alternate timeline your on can shift reality too drastically making it impossible to locate the one you came from to travel back towards it. This is why we developed rescue teams and quantum mores code training to send rescue signals should someone blow a mission and unalighn themselves.

Look at my ama, I explained this there. But in short I did go back to the pre 1 dollar days. You can only grab a certain amount at any given time to keep the timelines intact. Grabbing too much will take away amounts others are meant to have to push the project forward risking killing it all together. Hence coming back to all the dips to grab more coins each time while keeping the project safe. You'll see me return from the 100k to 30k dip as well, though it will be a me from 30 years ago who visits you then.

By creating our own gravitational field, you free yourself from the constraints of this timeline/ reality. All you need after having your own gravitational field that turns you into your own little bubble universe in essence, all that is needed after that is a little speed and you can punch right through to a parallel one. If you angle it right, you can jump to the past or the future of parallel realities, and since the whole simulation is intertwined, you doing that going from your reality into an alternate one will have an effect of another you going into your timelines to do the same. I may not be explaining it right. Like I said, I'm not the scientist on the team so I'm just spitting out the basic information they told me when I asked about it before I started traveling for this work.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:29:08
Yes, after we finally make our own simulations scientist no longer can ignore the odds. Less than 1% after that believe the .0000000000001 percent chance we live in base reality. It leads to huge break throughs in science too; once we understand what we exist in, we realize the true possibilities of this thing we are in. In my time we just redefine reality as existing in a simulation instead of the false idea we had through most of human history. It's looked at in our time in similar fashion as your time looks at the world being discovered round instead of flat. Funny enough we have some real worlders in our time that would be the equivalent of your flat earthers today.
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:23:22
In my previous ama's I mentioned the dangers of this. The pools in sporting events are too small. Even taking something as small as 10k in winnings could be to dramatic to the timeline and winnings everyone else receives. That could change the timelines to far making it dangerous for me to try and find a way back to my timeline. With crypto, the pools are so large we can take large amounts in our time in the future without effecting the price, and just let the funds mature for us to collect for our employers back in our time. As well as our pay/cut of the spoils for our work.

This time is way too barbaric, in my history books it is known as the concentration camp days of america, a time that tortured kids, separating them from their families, leading to riots and turmoil in the 2020's when those kids grew up and rebelled against the country who separated them from their parents and kept them drugged in cages just for coming from a non Caucasian country.

Because time is not set in stone. I'm no scientist, but the way they described it to me when I started this job is we go into parallel timelines, this assures another version of me goes back into my timeline and buys for my organization to collect when I return with the keys. Because of this we deal in variations of possibilities since the timelines are parallel and not exact copies of each other. For example, in my timeline "Berenst**a**in Bears" is spelled "Berenst**e**in"

Think of everything you have now, except payments are integrated into everything without having to add payment information. Direct crypto deposits as payment for being advertised too, payments for the value of your information, just hop into a tesla and have it take you to where you want to go automatically charging you for the trip. Shit social media sites even pay you to be on their sites depending on the value of you being marketed to by their advertisers. The distribution of wealth gets completely reorganized where it is paid to those with the value and not taken by greedy companies exploiting their users and costumers like it is today. Just be prepared, because with an open ledger in my time, digging through someones social media history is digging through someones purchase history. Bought a porn without using a privacy coin? Well now the whole world will know what your into. Paid for your mistresses hotel without a privacy coin? Well now not only your wife will see it but the whole world.

It gets ugly for a while, but eventually they start reserving the dollar and cryptocurrency that follows is with deflationairy coins like bitcoin. This slows down the inflation rate increase we see the dollar go through in a couple years, and eventually saves it from having a complete melt down like Venezuela.

Cold storage is the best way to store your coins even in my time. If you want to go all out you pay to have it stored in a cave highly guarded. Only the really early investors go to that length though, and even then they don't store all their coins in those places but rather a plethora of places like this as well as vaults in their own home.

Statistics in my time show the best way to get people to adopt early is to buy them some coins and gift it to them. After they see the amount given to them grow, generally they throw more in and grow to trust it as time passes on. This is the highest likely chance of success to getting those you care about to adopt early

2035 we get our first flying car. 2020 elon adds a novel hover feature to a roadster prototype but can't really consider it flying at that point. Before then you have planes that can function as a car that you see prototypes and on preorder today. 2022 you have taxi drones that fly you around but not what you'd call a flying car.

O'Leary owns 1 of the citidales in my time. He spends this whole time accumulating while talking Bitcoin down to buy cheaper. Same thing he does on the show, talk down a good company while trying to get a cheaper price, aka negging. Same thing the bankers and governments have been doing, teasing bans to bring the price down while accumulating otc and through mining. Those talking loudest against it are those buying the hardest. Do what they do, not what they say.
