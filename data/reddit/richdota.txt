Hey I only started crypto a couple weeks ago. Can I ask why Charlie/litecion seem to have good relations with bitcoin? Litecoin subreddit people always say bitcion slow blah blah. Yet I come to this subreddit people are chill about litecoin.
Just curious because I see a lot of hard feelings between Ethereum and Ethereum classic too.

Thanks. I think it's going back up again.

Lol what is the donation worth now?

It's either bad journalism (not well researched), or intentionally done to spread FUD (which is also bad journalism).

Well the part where they claim tether is backed by USD make it a US Security so I grues they can't claim it anymore would be the most I can see.

Reason is probably buyers and sellers don't have enough confidence in it going up too much. How price is determined is pretty much 99% based on sellers and buyers. 
But I think stable is good, and will build that confidence.

There is definitely snowball effect, regardless of where it came from. And other factors I'm sure. The thing is with a free fall now, I really don't know where the bottom is before it bounces to a stable point.
I'll set a fairly low buy order and wait and see.

If one of you post the Vegeta meme again....
I swear....
I'll probably still smile.

I saw it too but not this bad. Was thinking 8-9000 range was the stability point (dip to 7500 then go up).
