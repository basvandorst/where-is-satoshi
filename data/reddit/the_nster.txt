Very interesting, thank you for using a very clever analogy to put this into perspective.   
To phrase a question using your analogy, how would one know that Josh was in fact the victim of an attack and not the perpetrator (i.e how can one be sure that Josh did not steal the funds himself, and use this story to cover his actions)? I ask because many opinionated individuals have claimed Mt.Gox is a "criminal organization". 
Thank you again for your answer, it was very clear.

What caused them to freeze transactions, and how are they able to [legally] do this?

Wow; that pretty much answers all my questions. This is a very unfortunate situation, and lets hope that it does not make a significant long term impact on the value of bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies in general) or society's view about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 
Thank you for your answer and the effort you put into helping me understand this issue. Please know that I really do appreciate it.

These are wordclouds include the most used words from each respective subreddit from the past month. 
I have not made this with the intention of showing which coin/community is superior, but rather because *I strongly believe that we can all learn something for one another*. Whether that is having more fun, being more serious, taking more action, being more generous etc. I will leave for you to decide. 
If we want cryptocurrency to become accepted by the mainstream public, we have to work together, not against one another; there is little point in hateful competition as we are all striving to achieve the same goal. 
Let this represent a celebration of our diversity.
