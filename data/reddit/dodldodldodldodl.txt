This happened to me yesterday, they say that your BTC will be available after 3 confirmations, but my transaction had 10 before the BTC was made available to me. 
It could just be the incredible load they are under. Pretty shit tho.

I am [DODLING]( 
The last time the futures dropped, it peaked at around the price it's at now in the lead up to it and then it fell pretty hard. It recovered but every time a new ATH has been reached there's been a dip after it...

Where the dip at? 
Last week when the futures came out shit dipped hard but today we be just rallying up in here.
Y u do dis?

Cool story brah, the truth is that you're probably too dumb to understand why cryptocurrency is important so no one is going to waste their time trying to explain it to you. Just keep holding onto your fiat and your infinite inflation and just move on  ok?

I DODL'd myself badly man. I been analysing the curves and I've seen a dip after every ATH, the last one happened last week and from the 7th through to the 10th, BTC lost around 4K of value.
But it gained 7K of value the week before that. 
I think we will see another dip, maybe back to around 17k.

It's my thing. I made it up. It works like this
* Transfer fiat to exchange
* DODL
* HODL
* Profit
You heard it here first. DODL ON. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:15:22
Welp I shoulda DODL'd more. Now I can only HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:05:25
For reals? 
And then dip after that? What back to 20k? Might as well just buy now then I guess. FML.
