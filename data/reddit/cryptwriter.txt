if people fomo at $30k it would allow bitcoin to stabilize at that price do to incoming fomo buyers instead of moving back down

This is clearly a bot or bots running the show on the weekends now. You see the same pattern every weekend we're it pumps 200-300 for a few hours and dumps and repeate trough out the day. Today since it was a larger pump of 400+ it stayed there at a longer time. But yesterday was little pump and dumps troughtout the day. Clearly manipulated prices. Wouldn't be surprised if it goes back to the lower 7k or higher 6k tomorrow. Volume has dropped 60% since people fomod in after that 1k pump to demolish the shorts by these whales running the show.

I'm thinking Bitcoin might not go lower then 6k mainly these manuapulators won't allow it. If they do then it's after they run up the price and get people to fomo and then they drop it, which is possible as you said. My theory on why they won't let it fall bellow mainly the plain fact that there are hundreds of winklevosses like waiting for Bitcoin to hit under 3k. These manuapulators like any manupilator love full control and would in my opinion hate others to come in and scoop up Bitcoin at such low prices. It's obvious that it's not organic and has not been for a while. Clearly they are in it to wipe the floor and a clear example we're those shorts getting liquidated a week ago or so.
