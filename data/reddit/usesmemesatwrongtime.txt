If a newer coin came out with significant improvements that bitcoin could not be patched to include, then I'd call bitcoin users dumb for not using it as well.
As it stands, there are no meaningful improvements to doge over bitcoin or even litecoin. And when that's the case, I want to own the coins with the best developers and largest userbase.
I could see doge overtaking litecoin in the future since I personally think the advantages of "scrypt" coins are overblown and all current coins don't have any significant improvements.over bitcoin that couldn't be patched in.
In the end, these doge are converted to bitcoin then to USD. There are no added crypto benefits to using dog since it's converted to bitcoin anyways.
Having a meme-based currency isn't a big deal if people treat it as a joke. But the fundamentals of it will get some people burned if they think it's a long investment. Most people at r/dogecoin seem to understand that it's a joke. But to a newcomer it isn't as obvious. Especially with the bobsled story, people are going to think of doge as having real value with room to grow in the long term.
But think about all the memes that have come and gone. What's the oldest a meme could be that people still talk about today regularly? I'd guess 2 years. Just look at "touchdown seahawks!". That happened over a year ago and this comment was upvoted constantly on r/nfl. Today, that comment is usually buried in downvotes for being trite and overused.
I honestly hope doge doesn't crash since I know someone who's spent thousands mining it. But at the same time, I don't see it having long term value over other cryptos.

You're a moron if you think btcrobinhood was the same as Mark Karpeles.
What btcrobinhood did was great. There are hundreds of common brain wallet phrase scanners fighting to obtain insecure bitcoins milliseconds after they're deposited.
He actually has RSS feeds and monitors common Bitcoin forums to find the rightful owners.
To use an analogy, imagine you have $100,000 in a bad area of town with lots of foot traffic just sitting out on your driveway. BTCrobinhood is roaming the neighborhood picking up your cash that would been stolen very shortly and then monitoring for requests to have the money returned.
Taking a small amount to show your driveway/wallet is insecure would be fruitless due to high foot traffic/wallet crackers. The rest would be taken shortly after before you noticed a small amount missing.

Defining bitcoins as a float or integer is functionally the same. All wallets I've seen represent the Satoshi units as decimals. If you "add" an extra decimal place, the base unit changes in the code but that doesn't make you 10x richer or poorer in reality. Hence it's not monetary inflation. I don't know why this is such a difficult concept.

If you read the bitcoin deposit page, it tells you that deposits are instant if you include the default transaction fee (they reimburse you up to 0.001 BTC no matter what fee you include). I've done this multiple times and it's always been instant for me.
So no, you don't have to wait for a confirmation. What wallet were you using to send BTC to foodler? I hear Coinbase's wallet has a delay in sending.
The only legitimate complaint you have is that you have to go BTC -&gt; FoodlerBucks -&gt; order instead of BTC -&gt; order. The reason they do this is kind of obvious though. It's psychology. If you leave some points on there, then you're inclined to order again from them.

You can already do this assuming the address is valid (no typos or an address that is impossible to exist). This is the best way to "delete" bitcoins BTW.


By interacting with the present world, the time traveler would change the bitcoin transactions and any blocks mined after the first one he gives as proof for the block reward would become invalid since blocks include a hash of the previous transactions.

Thanks but I think this method can be improved a bit since I plan to use this as a will of sorts and the people would not be as Bitcoin-experienced as I. I will number issues as I run into time.
I copy both sites to an offline computer. I run bitaddress and with my 1st (of 4) phrases, I create a brainwallet on the "brainwallet tab". It only gives me the Address and Private key.
1. I have to copy the Private Key over to the "wallet details" tab to get the Public Key. Why couldn't they display the Public Key on the Brain Wallet tab?
I then take the Public Key and paste it as the first Public Key of a new multisig transaction on the offline multisig site.
Repeat all previous steps for phrases 2-4 for the same multisig transaction.
Set multisig transaction to 2 (of 4 obviously) on multisig site.
2. It gives me a Bitcoin address to send to (good) and a loooong redeem script. The whole point of the m-of-n brainwallet is so participants don't foolishly upload or save the data somewhere. Is it really necessary to share this redeem script if participants know the value of "m"? Do they also need to know "n" and/or the multisig address? Do they need the pubkey of the users that arent' part of "m"?
Basically, what's the minimum amount of info I need to disperse?

Short term capital gains is **not the same** as short term capital gains **tax**....
And assuming your short term capital gains are $78.94 for a $100 purchase, then you bought in when BTC was $175 each (assuming you sold when BTC was worth $832 as of today; math is as follows: $100-$78.94=$21.06; $21.06 is your initial investment which appreciated to $100 before you bought the gift card;  21.06=X\*100/832;solve for x; **x=$175.22**).
Anyways, assuming you are in top marginal tax bracket (39.6% for $400,000+ single filer), then your **short term capital gains tax** would 0.396\*78.94=**$31.26** for your $100 purchase.

Why are all the analogies given for why bitcoin won't last that long in reference to outdated hardware?
Hardware is a sunk cost. You can't just place your VCR into a recycle bin and get a brand new blu-ray player next week for little to no cost.
On the other hand, software (like linux, windows, office, bitcoin, etc.) can be continually updated. Sure, if bitcoin doesn't keep up-to-date with latest technology trends then it could die out in a while. But people are acting as if Satoshi had to be prescient enough at the beginning to know about every single development in the cryptocurrency sphere to not have bitcoin fail.
Inflation is an easy one to answer though. Take a look at dogecoin, one of the few well-known coins that will inflate perpetually. They ended up losing a ton of hashing power to the point that they are merge-mining it now to prevent ridiculously cheap 51% attacks. There could be many reasons why dogecoin lost hashing power beside inflation, but I think it proves a point about marginal utility. The perceived marginal utility of having perpetual inflation by some was clearly not enough to get them to keep using dogecoin over alternatives. Network effect is a real phenomenon and is a big reason why Facebook is still the  social network.

Let's do the math here and try to be as generous as possible to and see what Bitcoin's market cap would have been if 20% of narcotics trade went through Bitcoin.
$350 Billion in Annual narcotics sales worldwide. 20% of that going through SR would be $70 Billion annually. That would be $191.8 million going through SR daily. Let's assume during this period that Bitcoin's sole use was on SR. Let's assume nobody used SR escrow and finalized first; that would mean people would only need to hold BTC for around a day at most. Let's assume nobody held BTC for more than a day. Let's use the average number of BTC already mined throughout 2012 by using the Jul 2011 BTC mined [value of 9,353,500](
So $191.8 million flowing through 9.35 million BTC would give an ** expected BTC valuation of $20.51**. The market cap was already defined as $191.8 million with the assumption that BTC's sole use was to facilitate non-escrow purchases on SR without holding in BTC for more than a day.
Even with all these ridiculous assumptions, the **actual** average [Mt. Gox $ value of BTC for 2012 was not orders of magnitude off; it was **$8.47**]( (done with Excel).
If we just **change the no-escrow assumption** to only-escrow and an expected period of 7 days in escrow (to account for shipping time), then the expected BTC valuation would be 7 times the previous estimate. In this scenario, the **expected BTC valuation would be $143.54.** And the expected market cap of BTC for 2012 would similarly be $1.34 billion.

It's because of your attitude that scam companies like butterflylabs continue to make money.

Ok, I'll do a few criticisms.


Free money? It requires significant capital in the form of hardware and electricity (even in bitcoin's infancy) to mine bitcoin. These are risks people take that could have gone to zero. Are people who bought [Crumbs stock]( at its low of $0.03 considered scammers since they anticipated people demanding it to the tune of $0.63 just a day later?
There is no such thing as a free lunch, and to say that mining bitcoin was that is a lie. In the early days, setting up mining was way more tedious and less user-friendly than it is now. So even then, it cost human capital (labor+time) to set it up properly.
Also, Mr. Cohen glances over the fact that securing a distributed ledger is not "nonsensical". The fact that he never mentions the word "ledger" in this entire essay just shows how little his understanding of the Bitcoin protocol is.




This analysis is very simplistic and completely disregards the very real possibility of debasing a currency. Hyperinflation isn't an "edifice". The average fiat currency lasts 27 years. Regime changes can be bloody, long, and ruinous. Software changes are comparatively not. Not to mention, I think he gets his analysis ass backwards. Paper isn't valuable to people because it is exchangeable with low volatility against other paper. Paper is valuable for its exchange for goods and services. There's a reason that the major indices of inflation measure the USD against a basket of goods rather than a basket of currencies.


Wow, do I even need to get into how presumptuous and elite this statement is? If you weren't convinced that the bank bailouts were a huge mistake now, then I doubt this short rebuttal would convince you.




Why must there be a central authority to ensure this? There have already been many flash crashes in bitcoin history, yet the currency still grows with adoption. If there's an exploit in the Bitcoin protocol cryptography, then hacking it is small potatoes relative to hacking banks which use similar cryptography and have way more money.


How can you prove that the FDIC is what is preventing a financial meltdown? And why are the costs of preventing such a meltdown only the cost of FDIC insurance as related to inflation? What about the bank bailouts? What about the long-term incentivization of taking extreme systemic risks in the banking system for some short-term profits? This country's banking system is not as robust as economists would have you believe. If you're interested in this subject and have time, read some essays by Nassim Taleb.
At the end of the day, I find it quite ironic how Mr. Cohen criticizes the systemic risk of bitcoin without a mention of how it relates to the systemic risk present in the current financial system.

No, I never said that. It's a matter of degree. Just like cutting someone is a degree of violence. Murdering them is at the opposite end.


You mistake a lack of government for lack of governance. People can feel free to form their own voluntary organizations that provide the services you described. People always argue against monopolies, when the true monopoly of government protects, judges, and holds accountable itself. It's hypocritical to argue for governments as a case for breaking up monopolies.
People can also form voluntary organizations to certify products. UL is private and already does this for electronics. It's not a stretch to imagine something similar in other areas.


Again, this is argument from monopoly abd makes no sense if you just look at it beyond the surface.
Here we have an entity that owns millions of acres and you argue that this is inevitable? How can the government grant other power over labs it's never directly been to much less seen? Rulers lose their power when the subjects cease to attack each other for disobeying.
If some mafia came to a landmass the size of America and declared it theirs by planting a flag at one spot, then we'd rightly laugh in their face. With a few aesthetic changes however, people call these same people politicians and revere them. These changes are irrelevant to the indecency of the state, and thus I posted the tale of the slave by Nozick to address this.

I'm not a tax expert but I thought short term capital gains is treated like income. So let's say you're already in the highest income bracket (400,000+ for single filer) at a 39.6% marginal rate. If you bought bitcoin when it was at $12 and bought $100 of something with it now (at $832/BTC), then your gains would be $100-$1.44=$98.56 (I got $1.44 from 12\*100/832). A capital gains of $98.56 at 39.6% tax rate gives **short term capital gains tax of $39.03 for a $100 purchase.**

Sure, but the analogy of driveways:lawn as roads:entire US doesn't work. There are 61,000 square miles (16 million hectares) of paved surfaces in the US. That's between the area of Georgia and Wisconsin. If someone built something the size of Wisconsin in something the size of the US, their claim to the whole mass would be laughable. And if you scale it down proportionally to a house lot, that claim would be laughable too.

I've PM'd the mod team that I'd be willing to act as a mod solely to moderate /new for spammers and instigators (both bull and bear bullshitters). Unfortunately, one of the mods replied back saying that I haven't contributed much in terms of content here to be considered for a mod position.
Before I received that PM, I was constantly in the /new portion reporting posts, replying to call out BS, and also answering the common questions that pop every few minutes (like why is the price X?). Most of my dislikes and reports on this reddit account are for the scammers that post in (1 BTC for $50!!!). I got pretty discouraged as a result of that PM and haven't kept up since.
It's up to your mod team to discuss, but I think /new needs a lot more people moderating. It doesn't have to be me, but I think the exponential growth has seen in these last few months has really changed the quality of content here.

That's a separate criticism to be made that people bring up. And it's one of the few legitimate concerns people make. Bitcoin scalability is the biggest concern of mine as well. And that's one area that the ingenuity of developers is desperately needed.

It's not that people got what they deserved. It's actually the opposite. Banks reap rewards in times of booms and there's nobody liable for catastrophic failures. It's an inherent problem with many complex systems called "fragility" when they can't learn from previous mistakes (so your immune system would be antifragile since it gets stronger after fighting off an infection).

Majority of people in the US obtain bitcoin via coinbase.com, a reputable exchange site with tens of millions in venture funding. Hardly an unknown entity.
I wouldn't buy anything online from a shady merchant to begin with (credit card or bitcoin) unless there were some escrow (paypal or 2-factor escrow, etc.). But even if I did happen to buy at the exact moment their reputable business decided to just keep the bitcoin and run, then that's all I lose. I don't get fradulent charges in the future and my credit history ruined. And good credit in today's economy is worth a lot.
And you fail to look at the fact that the banks can and will freeze your accounts with a warrant or if it's suspicious activity. Nobody can freeze your bitcoin wallet.


If Bitcoin encryption can be broken, then Bitcoin would be small fish in relation to all the other mainstream financial instruments which can be hacked for more profit. After all, they use many of the same (and weaker) encryption protocols.

Many bipolar patients feel amazing when they're in the manic phase so they don't seek the help they need. What they don't realize is that by talking so quickly and having so many ideas, they can't really focus their attention to one or two things and fleshing them out. As a result, many bipolar patients suffer greatly with relationships and/or work at some point in their lives.

Here's the issue. In a retail setting, I want to stick to one currency based unit and symbol. Not only does it save a step in thinking, but it also makes adding up receipts easy.
So if we started using Milli and micro, there would be confusion. And forget making sense of receipts.
But you may retort by saying " one thousand millibitcoin". Well now you're basing your unit off of something that most people hardly ever refer to (a Bitcoin is with too much now to be useful for most transactions).
Finally, bits can be written as bit or bt making it faster and less ambiguous than mBTC (is it Milli or micro?!?!). And this allows for satoshi, an established unit, to serve as "pennies" should Bitcoin go to the moon. How much is that coffee? "3 bits 5 sats" (written as "3.05 bt or bits or bts or b with a horizontal dash like doge d).
TL;DR Bits avoids the ambiguity of mBTC and uBTC. mBTC is usually milli but could misunderstood as micro.

In that case, using [1BitcoinOrBust's method]( is much better. The only problem is it only works for "2 of n" transactions. Here's an example of paper slips you would give to each person for "2 of 4":
**person 1:** _____ _____ _____ word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12  
**person 2:** word1 word2 word3 _____ _____ _____ word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12  
**person 3:** word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 _____ _____ _____ word10 word11 word12  
**person 4:** word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 _____ _____ _____  
You can simply use the 12-word seed from Electrum come up with the 12 words. For completeness, here's a "2 of 3" scheme:
**person 1:** _____ _____ _____ _____ word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12  
**person 2:** word1 word2 word3 word4 _____ _____ _____ _____ word9 word10 word11 word12  
**person 3:** word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 _____ _____ _____ _____ 
If you can trust 2 people to not collude, then this is a good scheme. It's a "2 of 2 or master" scheme where you give half the 12-word seed to one person and the other half to another person. You keep knowledge of the entire 12-word seed so you can use the BTC while you're still alive.
**person 1:** _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12    
**person 2:** word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____    
**person 3 (master; usually yourself):** word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12
Lastly, here's a good way to prevent conspiracy of the 2 to steal your BTC while you're alive and also prevent conspiracy of 1 person to take your entire will if they found your share in the "2 of 3" scheme. I would call this a "2 of 2 and death or master".
**person 1:** word1 word2 word3 word4 _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____   
**person 2:** _____ _____ _____ _____ word5 word6 word7 word8 _____ _____ _____ _____    
**left in safety deposit or some place others can only access after you die** _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ word9 word10 word11 word12  
**person 3 (master; usually yourself):** word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12

Doublespend attacks cost money to do. If the cost of a doublespend 0 confirmation attack is $X, then don't accept 0 confirmation $X transactions.


But even that is a bit paranoid. After all, technically every single credit card transaction can be "doublespent"; it's called the "chargeback" attack. Yet, people don't bother doing a background check on everyone who uses a credit card because the positive predictive value of such extreme measures outweighs the costs. Same thing here, doublespends cost money, checking for them costs money, and the few cases of doublespending means the more extreme measures to fight it are often wasted. Monitoring the network for a few seconds after a transaction is signed is enough.
I must mention that if you use a payment processor, they take this risk for you. Their doublespend detection capabilities make it such that it's a a very minute probability of having a successful doublespend that these companies are willing to reimburse merchants if they're defrauded.
30 TB per year will be nothing in the next decade. I have no delusions of Bitcoin replacing credit cards in the next year. Same with 100 mbit internet; that will be a basic package in a few years time.
I think mining is getting centralized due to ASIC fabrication rather than disk space or bandwidth limits. Only a few companies can make the newest ASICs. And many ASIC fabs have gone the route of scam/terrible offers (see cloud mining and pre-orders). There are a few decent ASIC fabs around, but who knows which ones will last another 5 years? This area is a bit uncertain, but I feel some other fabs will join the fray, especially if bitcoin increases in price.

You must have never taken a basic psychology course. I don't think it's taught in 8th grade. :P
Nobody but science people use long decimals and prefixes lower than milli. So if Millibitcoin becomes the new base unit, then you'll have a problem if BTC gets to 4 figures again. For example, how many millibitcoin is a $1.28 item when Bitcoin is $5000? It would be 0.256 millibitcoin. Having more than 2 decimal places is ugly: even scientists agreed and they made scientific notation.
So make microbitcoin or ubtc the base unit you may say. Well, now you run into using micro (only science people use it regularly) and the ambiguity of the abbreviations. Some poor person is going to mistake mBTC for microbitcoin.
I used to be fervently anti-bits due to my science background, but I have considered the alternatives and bit is best.

Literally everything I've seen you post in this thread has some error in it according to my understanding. It'd be nice if you cited something.

And blanket discounts on payments exist. Most gas stations near me advertise a discount for paying cash relative to credit cards. Their merchant agreement with credit cards usually just says they can't advertise a service charge for credit cards (but they can offer a discount for other methods which makes it functionally the same).

Actually, purse.io limits discounts to 33%. Considering that the average discount is 15% and this is the only semi-anonymous way to purchase bitcoin with a credit card (and often the only way in certain locations), it's not hard to see why bitcoin goes for a premium there.
If we follow along with your theory, then at what point is your liability for theft gone when receiving stolen goods? Do you ask everyone who gives you a $100 bill where they got it from?

Here is a quote of his:


Regardless, something almost no one heard of caused the value to drop by a third in less than a day. This is not a stable currency. Btc is already obsolete, it's been mined to the point of volatility. It's not even secure, remember mt gox? Really, the only cryprocurrency that seems like it will be feasible is dogecoin, with over a billion coins. The more coins, the harder it is to manipulate the market, and the more stable it becomes.
I have no idea how he was able to get so much wrong in one comment. 


First, BTC hasn't been banned in China for private exchange. Sue can still sell Eric Bitcoin for cash. The exchange services can no longer use banks or other third party payment processors. That's different from outlawing "private exchange".
Not to mention, China did put a lot more money into Bitcoin than other countries with the available data. If you ever visited fiatleak, you would see that. However, this data could be inflated due to misreporting by exchanges or due to low-to-zero transaction fees on some Chinese exchanges.


How can something be mined to the point of volatility? No explanation given here cause I bet he doesn't even what he's trying to say.


What? You mean leaving your private keys with someone else means they can take it? I guess my car security system is not secure since any robber can just take my keys and then my car.


All the "concerns" he had about bitcoin don't magically disappear with dogecoin. And what does having a billion coins have to do with anything?


Wow, this is some serious ignorance here. Higher volume makes it harder to manipulate markets. Measuring the value of volume in terms of volatile cryptocurrencies is dumb or else some Altcoin with 10 trillion coins would be hard to manipulate. That's clearly not the case. Not to mention, both BTC and Doge are highly divisible so you could compare microBTC to a Dogecoin.
**TL;DR** has no fucking clue what he's talking about.

If you're implying that the land was illegitimately obtained at some point., that may be true. If you can show definite proof that the specific land I live on was homesteaded by X's direct ancestor, then X can make a legitimate claim to the land.
And like I said homesteading lies in between the extremes of no labor (e.g. a sign and nothing else) and continuous labor (e.g. always staying at home). If we take your absurd scenario of mowing the whole country, abandonment comes up. There's no way some one can use every square inch of the US in their lifetime, much less on a single expedition. Even if they could mow all of it, they wouldn't get another chance to visit all of that land. And all that land would fall into abandonment. Someone to make use of that land would have a better claim since it would reasonably be assumed by the rest that nobody is coming back to that mowed patch of land.

Stopping multiple duplicate stories isn't an easy task. Reddit doesn't really let you alter the mechanism for front paging a thread. Downvoting duplicate stories and linking to the original comment thread is the best you can do realistically.
And off-topic is always going to have some subjectivity. What's your point? There's no such thing as 100% objective person. If a story doesn't mention Bitcoin, then it's more than likely off-topic. And there's been a lot of those stories (like the gold price fixing).

And most of the time it goes in the favor of the buyer. It's not as specific and fair as you would imply. All you have to do most cases is say that you already contacted the seller but didn't like his/her solution. Credit cards have significant counterparty risk. You are contractually not allowed to ask for too much identification, but if you just so happen to sell to someone using a stolen credit card, then good luck. The fact that you gloss over this fact tells me you never worked in retail.


It's 10 minutes on average. No idea where you got 15 minutes from.


No it's not. Firstly, not everyone can do it. Second, most require some collusion with a dishonest mining pool. Thirdly, these attacks are easily detectable. Fourth, these attacks are really only applicable in 0 confirm situations (physical purchases, not online) so you'll likely be on camera.
A few seconds is how long it takes to send credit card or bitcoin transactions. You have to wait for 1 confirmation (~10 minutes) before the seller can respend the bitcoins; you have to wait a day usually before the seller can respend the $ from the credit card purchase. You have to wait for 1 confirmation (~10 minutes) for safety from all but a 51% attack on bitcoin (waiting for 6 confirmations will protected you from a 51% attack). You have to wait 60 days for safety from the buyer doing chargeback; you are never safe as a seller from your credit card processor freezing your funds for whatever reason however.

Let's recap a bit. You claimed that you *attempted to sell off* ~~sold~~ your shares because of death threats to your precious daughter (who is currently in Cyprus).
You are out of the country supposedly courting investors. And now, a family funeral came up? Where is the proof and why is this coming up now? This sounds a lot like typical stalling bullshit tactics. The kind that compulsive liars or drug addicts use ("no man, I swear I was gonna pay you back but my dog got sick again!"). If your daughter was actually threatened seriously, you would have her with you.
So show some proof or it's all hearsay at this point. Also, where's the police report about the supposed death threats against your family?
I can't imagine how angry I would be if I were actually someone who invested in Neo &amp; Bee.

Difficulty is retargeted approximately every 2 weeks so that each block is discovered in 10 minutes on average. 1 block found=1 confirmation.
The risks of the various double spend attacks is greatly mitigated by monitoring for double spend attacks with a well-connected node.

A landlord can do that, but as I mentioned before, mowing land once doesn't make it your property to dictate how people use that land forever. Mowing it once at best gives you a very temporary stake in the land since leaving that land alone for a short while would make it indistinguishable from a virgin forest. As a possible inhabitant, I would just wait a short while until the grass regrew and then homestead the land myself. If your stake is indistinguishable from virgin land, then it's abandoned.
As for the paving thing, I was pre-answering a possible stipulation/objection you would have brought up. My point was that "assuming the entire US is mowed by one entity" was a big assumption to give you in the first place. Changing it to paving the entire US (since paving land changes it for much longer than mowing it does) wouldn't resolve anything since now the assumption is even more grandiose and impossible.

Lol, not only did very few people participate in the poll, this was over 3 years ago, way before any need to change base units. Necessity is the mother of invention which is why the talk of bits wasn't really popular until after Bitcoin went past $1000. Before that, it was roughly equal parts millibit, bits, and a small portion wanting standard SI prefixes.
And when those discussions happened, they eventually lead to widespread community adoption.
Your false narrative of " but millibits were so close! " is based on outdated information that never amounted to much. I was even on the millibit side for a while.

People are working on all those *MASSIVE* problems you've pointed out. The only one I'm not sure of being resolved easily is increased centralized mining.
Long confirmation times are negated by doublespend detection tools allowing for 0 confirmation purchases for relatively small amounts.
Low transaction rate is something that is being coded on right now. See Gavin's tweets for more info.
Massive disk space requirement is not a big deal. Not everyone needs to run a server to secure the network. Even if they did, there is work on chain pruning. Not to mention, storage space costs have been going down consistently. Your concern here reminds me of people complaining that digital videos would never took off because floppies were less than a few megabytes.
That isn't to say that people shouldn't worry about these things still. The golden rule of investing is still in place (don't invest more than you can afford to lose).
I don't care to make predictions about price. As far as I can tell, nobody has a great understanding of how bitcoin is valued. Saying bitcoin will go to $10 or $10,000 is just a belief. It's not a promise. And the fact that there are people saying both should make people research the matter more rather than join one of the hiveminds.

The millions invested in Bitcoin mining hardware is in ASICs. They can't switch to non-SHA256 hashing coins. So no, they can't switch to most coins. And switching to those few SHA-256 coins? Well game theory answers that question. None of them have enough hashing power behind them at the moment, and since Bitcoin dwarfs mining power of every coin by a lot, any SHA-256 coin is highly vulnerable to a 51% attack by ASIC farms. That's why you don't see many SHA-256 coins as compared with scrypt.

Very few systems are completely trustless. They do try to get incentives aligned to minimize conflict though. At this point with more centralized mining, you have to weigh the incentive for the big pools to not damage bitcoin's reputation versus incentive to do the 50+% attack.
You actually posted about it earlier that a lot of GHASH's mining power comes from people trading mining contracts (that are usually worth less than the BTC itself for the first buyer).
Possible solutions to this conundrum would be:
1. donate to P2Pool miners but that's not a great incentive as you run into tragedy of commons (people think other people will donate so they don't do it themselves to secure the network).
2. Have the other major pools sell mining contracts for less than GHASH. I'm not too well-versed in mining recently so I'm not sure if they do this already.
3. Have other major pools lower their fees to 0 and spend money to improve stability/user experience. Since ~50% of GHASH's mining power is owned by outside people, that represents a large portion that can be switch over. The most frequent reasons I've seen from people about why they mine on GHASH is their 0 fees, stability, and nice user controls.
4. This is a crazy idea but I think it's most feasible. Crowdfund bribes for major ASIC manufacturers (which ones are trustworthy though LOL?) to hardcode them to only mine on P2Pool.

Except currency more closely matches social networks than operating systems. The value of a currency is in its ability to be accepted by more people.
Social networks are a form of technology. There wasn't anything similar to them in their span just 20 years ago.
I did read your whole post the first time I replied. Your whole point about people being confused since there are so many cryptos is wrong. Your tech-illiterate parents can figure out that they should use Facebook as opposed to myspace, friendster, etc because everyone else they know is already using them. Nearly anybody can make their own social network site or cryptocurrency. But you don't see headlines about these obscure sites and coins, and you don't see people talk about them in real life or invest millions in them as much as they do Bitcoin or Facebook.

Some labor is mixed in with the front yard and therefore it is homesteaded by me. Obviously with principles there is some interpretation involved.

At the other extreme, people leave their houses all the time to go do other things and they expect nobody to enter it while they're gone.

I like science and Bitcoins; however, the science fair projects I saw were more like reviews rather than hypothesis-driven. There needs to be a testable question at the end of the day.
Maybe something like "can people learn to use Bitcoin faster than X?". And if they're feeling fancy (aka large sample size), do some subgroup analysis to see what demographic picked up Bitcoin faster. I haven't really even thought about what a control would be for this experiment. Maybe compare the speed of learning to use Bitcoin to the speed of learning the words to a short poem?

Not sure if you would know the answer, but is the transaction rate limit of Bitcoin a matter of block inclusion (i.e. 1 confirmation) or network propagation? Most transactions don't need a confirmation in my experience, so this isn't a big deal if the transaction limit is simply block confirmations (rather than network propagation limits).

This quote is pretty sparse on info, so it's kind of hard to tell how much Buffet knows about bitcoin.
Bitcoin itself doesn't neatly follow into any one financial group (currency, payment protocol, commodity, etc.). Semantic discussions about what is or is not a currency can go on for days. By most definitions, bitcoin is not at the stage yet where it can be called a currency. On the other hand, I don't think any of the early players in bitcoin believed bitcoin would stay steady at a $1 million market cap and have 0 volatility. The common argument made is that bitcoin's market cap needs to rise and volatility will go down with that (which has been the case historically).
As for the valuation of bitcoin, I agree with Buffet. Much of bitcoin's current value is speculative. Do you think even 5% of the people who hold bitcoin have read the whitepaper and understand all the political implications bitcoin has? No, so while I am long on bitcoin; the current values are speculative. Very few people understand the fundamentals of bitcoin which are necessary to explain all its future/current applications (smart contracts, trustless escrow, etc.).
Trying to predict when a whale like the Winklevoss Twins will invest in bitcoin is a nearly impossible task. From the Winklevoss Twins AMA it was apparent that they barely understand the details of bitcoin which really surprised me. These 2 people have invested millions in bitcoin and I doubt they even read the whitepaper. Some more people just like them and bitcoin's current value is highly speculative.
Day trading can wipe out your money really quickly so I advise buy and hold. If you understand bitcoin's details, then I think you'll agree that either bitcoin will continue growth or it will fall close to zero as a new cryptocurrency enters which cannot have its killer-app features implemented the bitcoin. So far, none of the current cryptos possess such a threat but that can change.

So instead of profiting $7 per widget, they profit $10 (an increase of 43%). With smaller profit margins, then bitpay makes even more sense.

Obviously you can't diagnose anyone over the internet, but seems like he has a classic case of bipolar disorder. Grandiosity (calling himself the anti-Satoshi despite little to no computer coding experience), flight of ideas (switching between all these "revolutionary" ideas), and irresponsibility (look at his extensive history of failed investments).
That's already 3 of 7 possible criteria for a manic episode. You only need 4 of 7 to be diagnosed as having a manic episode.
Talkativeness (very possible given how much he types; would need to see him physically speaking), distractibility (this means minimal stimuli can divert his attention; can't say it definitively for him but he responds to nearly every comment so I wouldn't be surprised if he is distractible in real life), decreased need for sleep (someone who analyzes his time of posting could determine this), and increased activity (associated with weight loss and/or increased libido).

Not everyone is mining with GPUs they already own. A friend of mine bought 6 amd cards and is mining them (over $1500 investment). Assuming doges price doesn't plummet, he's fine.
On the other hand, people like you are using their expensive laptop gpu which was never intended to be run 24/7 to mine. A laptop cooling system isn't going to be handle that constant heat production. So in the end you have $50 worth of cryptocoins and a $500 repair on your laptop. Not to mention electricity costs.

This is called a trade secret. If people want IP protection, then they should go this route. Contrary to your belief, this does not stifle innovation.
Referring back to Coca-Cola, there are several things to point out that contradict your hypothesis.
1.  Coca-cola is granted monopoly on coca leave importation into the US. Thus, any potential competitor has a serious barrier to competition if they aim to duplicate the recipe.
2. Coca-cola is not the only cola brand. There is Pepsi, RC Cola, and many more regional brands worldwide. Granted, none taste identical to Coca-Cola but this is largely more of a marketing effect ("Coca-cola is the one true cola!") than preventing innovation.
3. There are reports of the Coke formula (see wikipedia) already being found. Like I said before, marketing ensures whoever tries to duplicate it will not see as much success as Coca-Cola.
4. Reverse-engineering is real. And it takes time. During that time, first-mover advantage exists and will allow the company who spent $ on R&amp;D to get market share and recoup costs. Eventually their product will be reverse-engineered and innovation will continue.

Well, this person I met with on localbitcoins was a middle-aged black woman whose job was a HR type of position. All she had heard about bitcoins were from news articles here and there. She used a macbook too.
Pretty much none of the things typical of a normal bitcoin user.
And at almost every step of the way localbitcoins mentions escrow and its importance. You'd have to intentionally NOT want to use escrow to do a transaction without it. She insisted on using escrow despite not knowing how it worked exactly.
Keep in mind this was over a year ago so localbitcoins.com had an even simpler website back then too.
**TL;DR** Failing to use escrow on localbitcoins.com isn't a "noob vs tech-savvy" issue. It's a greed vs safety issue. It would not surprise me if some people who got scammed in escrow-less transactions were the same type of people falling for 419 scams.

If someone else can't prove a more legitimate claim to that specific piece of land, then whoever is currently using the land has the best stake to that land.
For instance, most land in the US was taken from native Americans. However, most specific lands have no specific claim to them due to poor documentation and/or just proof of hunting in those lands.
So most people living in their homes today in the US have a better right to that land than anyone else. If someone like a native American can prove they or their ancestors mixed their labor with the specific piece of land before, then they would a case.

Western union does the same thing. It is a hidden fee but nonetheless, making revenue off the spread is common in remittance.

Calling "0 fees" a lie is a bit much, but it would be fair to call it disingenuous. Godfreee is a terrible spokesperson and obviously does not understand the concept of a buy/sell spread.
I do wonder however perhaps Rebit's source to liquidate BTC above market price is solely available to their business? In which case, it would not really be a spread since nobody else can sell BTC for the same high price they do.

Who keeps repeating these factoids? First of all, PCR 2000 is 1 gram of flash powder. A quarter stick of dynamite is at least 35 g of pyrotechnic material (e.g. nitroglycerin) . To say it's like a fourth stick of dynamite is meaningless. They burn and explode much differently from each other. Flash powder is not as good as nitroglycerin pound for pound. The whole "quarter stick" thing is an urban myth that keeps getting propagated from generation to generation to entice people to buy their fireworks.
Source: 


Do you know what PCR stands for? Pest Control **REPORT**. Report means explosive NOISE. They were **LITERALLY** designed specifically to be **noisy** to *GASP* scare away pests. Their capacity for destruction is not that great. Dynamite is much better suited for that.


It was consumer grade 50 years ago before the "think of the children!" crowd gained influence. In the Czech Republic, you can even use a cannon that utilizes 45 grams of flash powder. And don't think that because it's illegal, nobody uses them anymore. There are still tons of people using illegal fireworks these days.

Funny coming from someone who thinks localbitcoins is filled with scams when (as far as I can tell) he hasn't used it and is extrapolating from a few stories. And based on intro psychology, people aren't going to post tons of stories about smooth transactions. The few bad experiences disproportionately represent the product/service.


Being tech-savvy has nothing to do with being smart. My mom has a doctorate but struggles to print things with no help.


Not the most typical bitcoiner though was my point. And she wasn't a programmer. Nothing wrong with a macbook. In fact their user experience is so smooth that its no surprise to see lots of computer noons use them.




I didn't say localbitcoins was easy to use. You've moved the goalposts. My point was that someone would have to intentionally forego escrow on localbitcoins knowing full well that it's standard practice to use it.
Even the link you gave earlier had the guy admit he knew about the standard use of escrow. It was his own greed that gave an opportunity for a scammer to exploit him. That's not an excuse for the scammer. Not using escrow is like not wearing a seatbelt; eventually you're going to wish you weren't so arrogant.

There's a lot of bills that are simply scanned and printed and passed on to cashiers. There are news programs about this. Not to mention superdollar counterfeits which many banks can't pick up. If paper money is that easy to forge, then you can't really claim BTC is easier to counterfeit than USD.
A good property of money/currency is that it be easy to verify as real by anyone. Besides tungsten-embedded bullion, gold is hard to counterfeit. In this respect, it goes BTC&gt;gold&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;USD in terms of ease of verifying authenticity.


Yes, I agree that current fraud protections in BTC are lacking. But those can be added later via services on top of the BTC service. But you're really comparing apples and oranges since credit cards and paypal are services built on top of fiat currency. It would be better to compare credit cards to mtgox since it reimbursed customers the funds it lost in a hack.

He loses the bet and claims that the bet terms say he only owes 20 BTC rather than 20,000 BTC, and that the 20 BTC goes to an address he owns himself. He is now labeled a scammer on bitcointalk forums and has resigned from being editor-in-chief of bitcoin magazine.

Shapeways from what I hear is a good business but it's not the future of 3D printing since it prints stuff for your rather than you printing stuff at home.
When people mention 3D printing and bitcoin together, they are referring to the decentralized nature of each. 3D printing allows you to print useful items from your home. Bitcoin lets you exchange money without a central bank.
What I'm saying is that the people who need to be convinced to accept bitcoin in 3D printing are other 3D printers and people who sell kits and 3D printers that are affordable for a consumer (under $5000).
I don't have the time to do this myself but here's a list of players in this business off the top of my head:

That was your first scenario though called "A". You just made it seem like you had 2 points to make (A and B) when they were really just the same. And in your A/B scenario, you fail to consider the opportunity cost of a hoarder. They had to wait and spend a lot of capital to hoard a significant amount; resources that could have been spent on consumption today or investing elsewhere. So while somebody hoards Bitcoins, that's less capital for the hoarder to buy stocks or a sandwich.
Also, I didn't ask you why you use fiat. I asked why you SUPPORT it. Everyone has to use fiat since that's the only way to pay taxes and people don't want to go to jail for tax evasion.
Any new currency is going to experience volatility. As more people use the currency and invest with it, this volatility is smoothed out. The difference between Bitcoin and any fiat currency is that you know exactly what the supply is whereas fiat currency supply is not predictable over a longer period.

Network security (by distributed mining/inflation) and a predictable supply are not valuable? As more miners join the network, there is less risk of electronic fraud by a 51% attack. On the other hand, a hacker/thief needs to only hack into 1 or 2 computer systems to seize control of dollars.
Also, you don't even know the meaning of value. People are trading Bitcoins for actual goods, so clearly there is value in them.


Yes, it has inconvenient attributes for now since it's a relatively new system. But paper currency has inconvenient attributes as well; it's easy to counterfeit (not so with Bitcoins if you wait for a few confirmations). It can be destroyed in a natural disaster (you can't make a backup of a physical dollar bill).
Also, many regulations pertain to the transfer of fiat currencies in and out of borders. Also, there are massive conversion and transaction fees along the way. Not so with Bitcoins (smaller conversion and transaction fees).




The Federal Reserve was made in 1913 BEFORE the great depression. A massive centralized bank equals government control over the economy.
Also, fiat allows for random unrecoverable effects like the 2008 Housing bubble by printing cheap money.

People who amassed many bitcoins through mining are few and are not a huge fraction of the total number of bitcoins.
To have any real long-term effect on bitcoins by price manipulations, you'd have to obtain bitcoins some way other than mining.
And besides, "hoarding" is a "problem" with any currency. Why aren't you calling out the rich people with stashes of USD? It's a pointless goal to stop hoarding.

Of course, it's not a substitute for individual security practices. But that's irrelevant to our discussion about breaking the entire currency.
"One single mathematical error will not send the whole thing into a tailspin."
Hack into a computer and sell off treasury bonds, making the US debt worthless and by extension the dollar. Making your dollars worthless. Sure, the greenbacks are still in your pocket but they won't buy anything.


What? Why do you need a government to stop fraud? Paypal does it all the time without Uncle Sam.


Bitcoin can transition to another hashing algorithm as OR before vulnerabilities are found. In the meantime though, there is no way to attack SHA-256 in a reasonable amount of time, so it's not like real dollars because you can still have your physical dollars stolen without a backup copy anywhere. Yes, the systems built upon Bitcoin can have vulnerabilities not related to a hashing algorithm, and in that sense it is similar to virtual dollars. But paper dollars are not.


You use SHA256 when you logon to your banking account. If SHA256 is cracked, then your banking account is just as vulnerable (if not moreso) than bitcoin.

Quite a bit of incorrect info in this post. Trading rials for usd isn't illegal in Iran.
Also, prices in Iran are typically quoted in Tomans, which equals 10 rials. More colloquially, people give prices in Toman while dripping the last 3 0s.
So a burger which cost 70000 rials, is 7000 Tomans, but someone will say it costs "7 Tomans".

It's kinda weird/annoying to lug a computer around to a public place to do a transaction if a phone will do.
I was asking about bitpay since I know they lock in their conversion rates (eliminating BTC volatility risks) in exchange for a transaction fee.


You can sell bitcoin instantaneously without providing info on mtgox and bitfloor (which is a BTC sellers' market). It's just at withdrawal and deposit that you need to provide the other info. Correct? So he can manage the volatility of BTC pretty swiftly, but he just has to wait to withdraw that money. Has anybody had experience with bitfloor in this regard? I don't think Steve would want to use MtGox after all the stories I've heard about their long verification queue. \

Because they never agreed to pay taxes. I don't know why you keep bringing up the Constitution, a document over 200 years old that I never consented to.


If the constituents are forced to follow them, then yes.




See above.


There has never been a year that the Fed's printing press has sat idle. Hence, constant monetary inflation. Sure, some years have less dollars printed than others but the fact remains.


There's still sales tax and other taxes which are recurring. Thus, you are  always in possession of USD.


Wonderful that they can claim this power with a piece of paper. Can I demand payment in peanuts with my own Constitution? Why or why not?


Gold isn't the only competing currency. There's silver, euros, pounds, yen, bitcoin, etc. Also, I addressed above the fact that you do in fact have to hold USD.


It devalues the USD you hold. Not only that, but the monetary inflation is unpredictable (changes with monetary policy).


Uh, you realize the US government is trillions of USD in debt right? It's to their benefit to devalue their debt.


I sorta alluded to this above when I talked about the Constitution. I can discuss this later.


No problem if people are aware of the inflation scheme and are not forced to use it. USD meets neither of these criteria. Bitcoin meets both.

Not recommending this to any super noobs but if you want to go full paranoia mode, a physical dictionary is much better. Use bitaddress.org or brainwallet (github) on an offline machine to create a brain wallet from 12 randomly picked words from a physical dictionary. Tons of entropy quickly with relatively error-free copying (as opposed to writing down meaningless digits).
Then write these words down multiple times on some paper and store safely in separate locations. You can choose to split it up into 2 pieces so having one location compromised does not result in loss of bitcoin.

Not when you're selling an item for bitcoin. Example:

I found the average daily increase in difficulty since June 5th (6 months) to be 2.53%. KnC Neptune shipping estimate is given currently as Q1/Q2 so let's be generous and say March 30; that's 114 days until you can start mining.
So current difficulty (707,408,283) will be multiplied by (1.0253)^114 (assuming difficulty trend continues) to give us a difficulty of 12,251,471,519. Plug this into the bitcoinx calculator along with $1000/BTC and $13,000 hardware cost. It would take you 121 days to break even. And I'm being really generous here with difficulty and shipping date.
More realistically, it would ship at the end of Q2 (June 30) and difficulty would be much higher.

It's the basis of government's supposed legitimacy that you agreed to a social contract. That's why consent matters. Otherwise it's no more of a contract than me extorting you on my terms.


Retribution and ethics are not synonymous with a monopoly on justice. In other words, justice can be provided in the absence of government through voluntarily-agreed to norms and enforced via polycentric systems.


Yes, I am so greedy and want all my income for myself. Makes perfect sense that you presume so much about me and get so much wrong.


So you've at least admitted that constituents are forced to follow laws. Great, we've already gotten past the whole social contract argument.


Medieval Iceland employed polycentric justice for actual claim seeking after a verdict. As for polycentric arbitration, that already exists with private arbitration. One emerging example for the future would be  (a website).


It'll take some time to smooth over conflicts between competing social norms. But our current system is just as bad if not worse in that regard. Laws vary greatly between adjacent cities, counties, states, and countries. Not to mention these laws change often and unpredictably and no person can realistically know all applicable laws.
As for an experiment, there is r/civcraft, seasteading, and (previously mentioned)  that are all ongoing experiments that incorporate polycentric ideas.


Look up the term "monetary inflation". That is the definition.


Civilization/society != government
Also, nice contradiction there saying that there's no way for taxes to not exist since civilization began and in the next sentence telling me to join an Inuit tribe.


Property taxes. Not to mention, I doubt you can go your whole life bartering and not pay a cent to the IRS without an audit coming your way.


We're finally getting somewhere. (I'm being completely serious here.)
Tomorrow I will form my own government called Peanutopia. With this new power, I will levy a peanut tax. Anybody who produces peanuts must pay a 1 bitcent tax per peanut to my account. In exchange, I will spend 80% of proceeds on food to disperse to my citizens. Oh, and I forgot to mention that if you live within 50 miles of me, then you are automatically a citizen of Peanutopia. You will receive bountiful food in exchange for paying your peanut tax.
Assuming you live nearby, you should have no qualms with this arrangement if you have no qualms with the current government since I operate on similar principles. What do you think?


So in essence I'm doomed to a life of constantly exchanging my currencies around to pay various taxes every few days. 


Can you know in advance what the monetary supply will become in the next 10 years much less 1 year? No.


Who's arguing for the gold standard? Allow competing currencies.


I was already completely aware of that. It in no way changes my point. It's in the governments own interest to have an inflationary monetary policy so as to decrease the value of their debt. For some governments, this results in hyperinflation due to debasement. That wasn't my point though.


There was no conclusion to my remarks. It was simply the last point I addressed in order. And I never said Bitcoin is the best currency ever. Just that 2 properties of it make it more democratic/voluntary/transparent than USD.


Again, never said that.


You misunderstand. I said I was forming my own GOVERNMENT (hypothetically of course; I detest the idea of forced rulers). Of course there's going to be taxation in my peanut fairy tale since I am a government.

2 different concepts that are often confused.
As for central banks stealing money, their monetary inflation policies can only be defined as stealing once you remove all the euphemisms. True, Bitcoin has monetary inflation as well until the 21 millionth BTC is mined. However, nobody is forced to use BTC. On the other hand, everybody is forced to use USDs in the US since its the only way to pay taxes, and creditors must legally accept them for all debts.

Basically what I got out of this post is you want to make a lot of money without taking much risk. If that's the case, you need to learn more about investing.

Then don't tip 20% for bad service? I haven't ever had monumentally bad service in the US so I tip between 15% and 20% usually. One inattentive waiter though I tipped something like 12% (he brought the wrong dish but I didn't realize it till after I ate most of it since it was sushi).
If the waiter made a guaranteed wage that was higher, then the price listed on the menu is higher. You're not paying extra relative to a system where tipping is not customary.
And if the server is a complete asshole, you can just leave them nothing as a tip, with the net result being more hospitable waiters getting more money and staying there to work longer. And the asshole waiters are out of a job soon enough. But I can hardly think of any experiences where the waiter truly deserved no tip.

You completely missed the point of the video. Here's a written version:
The point was to ask the viewer at which point in these 9 stages is there slavery and which point is it not slavery. You would still call a chattel slave that was never beaten or whipped a slave. Thus, we can conclude that being beaten and whipped is not necessary to be defined as a slave. These 9 stages attempts to show that the principle of chattel slavery (forced removal of production) still exists in a modern democracy with taxation.

It's a matter of degree, but the principles behind chattel slavery and taxation are not radically different. The major differences are the amount of your earnings kept are lower and you are allowed to pick your own profession rather than labor on a farm.
Debating the morality of a tax rate is moronic as such a number is clearly subjective. If you can justify a 40% tax rate, why not 60% or 70% or even 99.9%?

Never sell is just as dumb. Coincidentally, the bitcoin black friday weekend was near the all-time high. If you had spent some bitcoin then (or cashed out), you would have made out well. And you could have spent some of your fiat to purchase more bitcoin if you so inclined at the bottom of the crash.
I made my biggest purchases (valued in $) that used bitcoin over that weekend. And because of that, I was way less anxious about these the price drop as other people here. Did I cash out a lot of my stash? No, but I learned from the $260 to $80 crash that bubbles happen and you never go broke taking profits. Sure, I could've timed my purchases a little better to get an extra $80 per BTC. But, that's nothing compared to the pricedrop.
**TL;DR** You won't go broke taking a profit. If it looks like a bubble, sell/purchase using bitcoin as it climbs. You don't have to hold 100% or sell 100%.

So, why can't the government do the same? And if a private road owner decided to pay for the roads by showing up to your house with threats, you would call that extortion not the popular euphemism "taxation".


In the absence of government, economic trade occurs. Trade happens whether governments exist or not, thus we can conclude that governments are not essential to economic trade as your original comment suggested.


The better question to ask is why do so many people support governments when nobody can go a week (or perhaps even a day) without breaking a law. People are anarchists at heart already, but not in mind. Whenever you choose to interact with people in peaceful and voluntary manners, you're discounting the idea that force is required for social cooperation.
Also, this is dressed-up argument from majority. Not to mention, 500 years ago the monarchists would have said the same thing as you just did except they would replace the word "libertarian" with "democratists".


If they're so popular, then these programs should have no trouble being funded voluntarily. At the same time, you ignore the fact that 20%+ of your tax money funds defense which results in many innocent people dying. With all these people saying they're against these wars, it's a wonder how people associate anarchy with violence.

Try to withdraw or deposit a large amount of cash into an account. You will raise many red flags and most banks will freeze your account if it happens often.
Also, try crossing a border with more than $10,000. Yeah, you can declare it but if you don't give them a reason for it, then it can be seized. Give a bogus reason a few times and you're flagged. Nowadays, you even get flagged for withdrawing less than $10,000 from your bank too.


Bitcoin allows you to directly pay from person 2 person electronically with pseudonymity. It's not the fact that BTC isn't currently accepted for taxes that makes it hard to tax. It's the fact that a middleman can't intervene with your transactions or freeze your account for back taxes. And it's much easier to move BTC across borders than fiat to evade taxes.

Divide 0.7474 BTC by 24 hours and you get 0.03114 BTC (with some variance and assuming a 0 fee pool). Divide $596.44 by 24 hours and you get **$24.85 per hour.**

It depends what timespan you're operating within.

The reason a government endorsement is bad long-term is because that probably means governments have figured out a way to control Bitcoin to minimize its effect on disrupting monetary policy and other things.

Localbitcoins.org needs better tools to allow rates to float, because a buyer could string along a seller and not meet until the rate is in their favor. As providers of liquidity, bitcoin sellers should not be punished.

I explained it for you in my last sentence. Maybe a more thorough explanation would help.
Taxes are paid to avoid acts of violence by the government (imprisonment). Taxes (in the US) can only be paid in USD. Thus, all people in the US must possess USD in order to pay their taxes. If I am holding USD against my will and the Fed prints up more USD (monetary inflation), that is devaluing all holders of USD which is effectively stealing from everyone who owns USD.

Cash deposit directly into your bank account is also irreversible.

Correct me if I'm wrong but anonymously transferring bitcoin requires the mixing service to have a much larger volume than what you're transferring. Pirate's fortune seems too big to just put through a mixer

Interest rates are at an all-time low and subsidies for moderate income first home buyers are quite substantial. This is for the US.
