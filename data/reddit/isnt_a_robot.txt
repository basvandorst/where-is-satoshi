Idk who you're talking to, but 80% of people irl still think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.             
Besides, have you tried paying with gold at Microsoft or steam? I can't believe they don't accept it.  It must be dead, we should throw out gold as a store of value and move on to something better.  /s        
         
Also, if you think that ethereum will take  spot and NOT have drama, politics, contentious forks, spam attacks, FUD and all the other bullshit that bitcoin has then you obviously underestimate human greed.

So i just have to say that i gave away my bitcoin as a gift and then the other party gave me a gift in return. Boom no taxes?           
(Im being facesious by the way)
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:33:40
I paid income tax on the money I used to buy bitcoin. If I spend the bitcoin on goods and services I only pay sales tax. Tax only applies if you trade it back and forth.         
          
Accumulate and Hold, then one day spend as-is.        
        
Edit: im wrong, apparently the tax system is rigged to fuck crypto users.
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:24:53
So it boils down to that our supreme overlords get to decide what is and isn't money.
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:49:06
So if i spend .000001 btc 10 years from now ill have to pay .00000015 in capital gains *and*        
 .00000006 sales tax?
@_date: 2019-07-30 11:03:27
They want us to pay capital gains even when we spend btc as btc. They treat it the same as a commodity not money. Fuck the irs.         
          
For example, If I buy pesos and spend it as pesos then i shouldnt have to pay US capital gains. Regardless of the usd:peso exchange rate.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:48:05
Maybe they're both bad people? Why is it always one or the other? If they're both pedos then just arrest both of them.

Okay cool. I just have to survive the central banks collapse and the new governments backed by btc rising from the mad-max esque world that would come about from a major world wide black swan event. Easy peasy.
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:03:54
So basically, after a google search, I owe 15% on everything. Good to know. Im not too well informed on bitcoin tax law. Is there a threshold? For example, you dont have to report up to 600 dollars in income tax from self employment, if you go over 600 you have to report everything though. Is there anything similar here?           
          
Edit: Id have to pay capital gains on the btc i sell in order to pay my capital gains.. Seems like im getting double screwed in this case.
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:53:43
Even if it never touches or becomes U.S. currency and the buyer keeps it as bitcoin i still have to pay capital gains in fiat? What if i only have btc. Like if I literally dont have any other currency.

@_date: 2019-07-30 15:21:47
No, but you do have to pay capital gains taxes *and* sales tax if you spend btc. If you use btc to buy a cup of coffee then you have to pay the IRS capital gains on that $3.74 in us dollars since the IRS doesnt accept btc.       
          
So basically you have a currency that you no longer want to use so you trade it for a different currency. You then spend the currency that you traded it for and the government says "you have to pay us taxes since the currency you use is now more valuable than ours." Seems like a racket to me.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:18:57
But how dumb is it to post your plan on the biggest Bitcoin early adapter community before it happens. Now I know to protect myself and never live in something called a Citadel.

think of litecoin as the gold-standard dollar from the early 1900's, then think of bitcoin as the gold. That's the simplest explanation. You'd use litecoin for day to day transactions and bitcoin for savings. Again, as far as I understand it.

kinda-not-really. It's more like the lightning network will include both BTC and LTC and businesses will be able to instantly convert between the two currencies. For example, a store that only accepts BTC will be able to accept LTC as well because of the instant conversion. I don't know technical details, but that's the gist of it.

You have to have a second wallet.         
Step 1. Move all coins from old core wallet to new core wallet.  (This seperates your legacy coins and 2x coins.)         
Step 2: Use old wallet's recovery seed to restore old wallet into new S2x wallet. (Make sure the new wallet supports S2X.).         
Step 3: Move S2X coins to a supported exchange and trade for actual bitcoins. 
Step 4: Deposit newly acquired bitcoins into new core wallet. 
Any questions?

Yes. It's a fact that it'll happen. It's also a fact that human brains are really bad at visualising logrithims, which is why everybody doubts that BTC will be 1m+. All the people with BTC right now are going to have their lives changed, even if they only hold 1mbtc. Bitcoin is literally going to change EVERYTHING and nobody except a few people have realized it yet. Remember, BTC went from .0001 USD to 6100 USD in **8 YEARS**. Think about that. That's a *60000000x+* increase in, say it with me, **8 YEARS**. Bitcoin is at a stage in its development where it is updated and patched monthly. Its still under very active development, and that contributes to its volitile nature. Give it 8 more years. This little "experiment" is going to completely change the world.

Yep. Because the block reward keeps the miners happy, the fast block time keeps them even happier, which leads to more miners, faster block time, larger network, more stability, faster confirmations, and overall good things for bitcoin.

Uhhh... Gold had extremely high volatility in it's early days. We've only had bitcoin for 7 years, we've had gold as a primary store of value for hundreds of years.

Once the US dollar tanks, It's going to REALLY tank. Just watch the news surrounding the petrodollar.  Once the Middle East stops accepting the petrodollar for oil trades then Shit is going to REALLY hit the fan.

It means transactions are confirming faster. If you go to blockchain.info you can see the transactions in real time. There's *plenty* of people using bitcoin.

I searched the area on google maps, and [this]( is all I could find. One lone shack with a private beach and no roads in or out. It's called Nunalla, Canada but I can't find any info about it on the internet, aside from a wikipedia page that lists Nunalla as one of Canada's most "extreme" communities. Again though, the shack in the picture is the only building I can find anywhere around the area.

If people stop mining because loss of profit then the hashrate will drop, the difficulty will adjust, and it will once again be "profitable" to mine. Keep in mind, if people continue to mine at a loss, then that's their choice. It means BTC is worth more to them than their home currency. Bitcoin difficulty is in no way tied to the value of any other currency.

Think, once governments start buying up all the BTC just like they did with all the gold back in the day, the price is going to to through the roof.        
I think the distant future of BTC isn't as a mainstream currency, but more like gold was used in the early 1900s, used to back different currencies. Imagine a BTC-standard dollar rather than a gold-standard dollar. That's my hope.
