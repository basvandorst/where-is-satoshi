Good advice. Anything you can buy with bitcoins -- buy it with bitcoins. Nothing to lose.

Bitcoin has gained incredibly amount of publicity in early 2014, especially compared to early 2013. Thanks to the networking effect, the bitcoin will keep spreading faster and faster. Things are happening quite rapidly, it is not even February yet and I can see lots of improvement everywhere. The train has left the station and I think it will be very hard to stop the train now.

I have to say that Redban was actually way smarter now than he usually is :D, I was actually surprised how reasonable he was. I love him, no homo.

My bet is that all these theoretical concepts of deflation being bad are weak, in fact, lowering prices is exactly what ought to happen when economy grows and technology advances. It is bullshit. Look at 19-20th centuries. The deflation spiral has no empirical evidence. Japan's economy was mostly likely due to the rapid technological advancement and many other factors where deflation(which was ridiculously small btw) was just one of the side-effects. 
The great thing is that we will finally have a deflationary currency which you cannot inflate even if you want to -- these theoretical concepts will finally be tested empirically in the real world, not in the minds of intellectuals.

Nothing new here. High risk, high possible yield. I think people in general know this -- they are prepared to lose all but because they believe in Bitcoin, they have high hopes for it and are willing to take the risk.

I will definitely read your paper. I am right now making my bachelor's exam on e-commerce and already wrote a two page part about Bitcoin and how it could improve/change e-commerce B|. Nothing big but I will represent it to around 30+ people, I guess that's better than nothing.

Inflation nowadays is the result of manipulating money supply and interest rates -- you cannot create more Bitcoins faster than the mining rate, and interest rates are also harder to deal with . Also, Bitcoin increases in value the bigger the BTC market grows, which means it is very deflationary.

I am a student and spent majority of my savings(which weren't too much anyway so not much to lose) buying at 750$ in January and then at 500$ this week. I have also invested some into stocks. Bitcoin taught me some basic concepts of investing and markets, which I find to be extremely valuable. I literally had zero idea how the stuff worked.

I once had a dream of Bitcoin hovering around $40k-50k...
