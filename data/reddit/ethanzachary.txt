I think you're forgetting about Tiger Direct, Zynga, Newegg, Rakuten, and Warner Brothers.  So they were 9/14 at best. :P

Is the PS4 a bundle or console only?
Also is that a Phantom 1 or 2?
Thanks and great sales!

I will give you an opinion and not so much of a "To Do". I would approach HR like you would a friend or family and explain the benefits to why and how the adaption of the cryptocurrency is gaining attraction. Maybe supply them with some documentation to BitPay API rollpay page and just really be informative on what it is that your requesting and why.
Hope this helps, mate!

Well thank you very much for your tip.
I did not expect that. 
I am going to get right on this and make this idea a reality.

Hey lets do it! :)

Seems like they are shutting down. Very weird. Thanks for that. My goal is to take a user through a beautiful experience. 
You'll have two options for the site.
1. Sell and post on your own time.
2. Take a few snap shots, desc of the product and we will do the rest for you. Once the item has sold, we send you a box with the address of the buyer for you and wait for your local mail service to pick it up. Leaving all the hassle to us.

In my spare time I am a IM, UX &amp; SEO specialist. I have the time. I love taking risks. I just wanted to see what the users of my site would say.
You have a point. Thank you very much.
