    The only problem that need to be fixed right now for this to happen is a trust-less way for the 2-way peg, as currently Rootstock relies on a federated peg of 25 companies to ensure this peg.
With the current bitcoin protocol this is not possible. If this problem would be solved we would have decentralised exchanges.

Where is the list of the 4000 merchants?
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:48:13
This is a limitation in the core code and not a port forward issue
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:22:39
Until I can run a full node home on my desktop computer I don't care about the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:23:36
if the fees would have been lower BCH would not exist
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:42:24
I know but when will we have fast and cheap transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:08:45
Please don't claim that everybody who hasn't made a statement regarding Segwit2X is rejecting it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:09:46
because the fees are too high
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:04:15
The developers who led us here already left the core team and they support 2x
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:19:02
1 year and 5 months is an 'eternity' in the crypto word! 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:18:55
Without an usable payment system decentralization is aimless.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:27:49
so in your opinion most of the early adapters are idiots
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:32:26
Gavin did a lot for Bitcoin. We can be only grateful to him.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:57:20
For me decentralization and confirmation time&amp;fee have the same importance.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:52:22
I would prefer to see a Gregory Maxwell vs Roger Ver debate
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:00:24
I used it earlier very often and recommended it to others.
I planned to live fully on bitcoins but recently I stopped using it as a payment system because transaction fees are too high and the confirmations take too long. 
For me the money aspect of bitcoin is as important as the decentralization (censorship resistance).
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:15:18
Lightning network is not ready yet! It'll probably take years to develop it fully. We need cheaper and faster transactions now and not in few years!
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:37:19
I do and I would do also after the segwit2x upgrade.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:09:52
If I could I would offer help or solutions but I'm not a core dev.
I think the core developers should do something because what we have now is a mess!
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:12:55
When will be LN ready?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:28:17
Of course it matters!
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:41:50
I can't understand what is wrong with segwit2x? The block size increase woldn't be an issue.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:19:28
Decentralization is also an important aspect, but if we can't use bitcoin as a payment system it is aimless.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:19:10
Yes but the core is against the 2x increase.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:52:38
and he got also a lot of others into it.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:48:01
I don't have to buy I have as many BCC as BTC. :)
As I understand the block size increase offers only temporal solutions to scaling issues.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:33:15
Have you used btc recently?
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:53:13
99 percent of the altcoins do the same
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:20:02
me too

i have heard the same argument before segwit activation but the fees are as high as before segwit
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:40:13
It seems it'll take years. We can not castrate bitcoin for years waiting for LN!
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:57:48
 Greg is indeed a competent developer but would be interesting to hear his opinions about social and economical aspects of the bitcoin development.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:22:55
Ohhh this is miracle!  Who cares?

How will this softfork exactly improve  privacy?
