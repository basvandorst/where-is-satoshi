it makes me angry when drug companies are like "oh yeah we tested drug x on y number of people and drug x won't harm you"
but then i ask myself "how do they know drug x won't have a ***long term*** negative effect?"  They don't.  nobody does.  but nobody is going to actually say so.

money isn't nice
money is coldly indifferent and anyone giving money advice should be too.
also, fractions, if you don't know how to use them you should have someone else who does handle your money for you
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:02:10
i know, i just kind of wanted to point out a parallel there
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:41:33


wow! you have the kahunas to pretend that this isn't the opposite of an advantage
but at least it will be a nice experiment to watch


this is a bad argument because the relative speed at which blocks are added always stays the same, btc or dog.  btc was never "easier" and they both have a logarithmic difficulty curve.  i think the success of cc has lead some to "harvest" some of that success by pretending to have lucrative mining opportunities for practically blank blockchains - insanity to think this is an advantage and not just the fact that it's a new ponzi scheme.
i can't take any of your shit seriously.  and seriously, when talking about money, you want to be serious
but success breeds success, so even your failed bullshit will still help us in the long run.

i think you and all the dogers are delusional when you compare the communities, as on average the asshole to niceguy ratio is the same in both, but it's ok because it helps cryptocurrency awareness.
actually there are some who are somehow thinking they can take the result of hard earned campaigning/developing and transfer that into a new name and then pretend that they made something new.
i will however acknowledge the experimental tweaks that are being tested with doge.  someone has to do the dirty work.

money is coldly indifferent
it's not my responsibility to do anything here. it's up to whoever wants to sell or buy to use their brain
simple as that
you want real money, you deal with fractions, you want some "happy fun land money" then you obviously have nothing serious to sell or buy
money is serious business and fractions ***are required*** to do serious business.  unless you're here for the penny tips and memes

inflation has incrementally conditioned people to think it has to be a "big number" to be a good amount of money.

why?  because it no longer fits the technical description of money.
it's a subversive tactic and a nice experiment to watch
it wouldn't have happened if doge didn't have so many anti cc people going "WOOPSIE looks like we promoted CC and raised awareness, better sabotage our claim before it's too late!  if doge is too successful this will backfire", in order to continue our delusion that we're hurting cc, even though it's astoundingly ignorant.

If you can't handle fractions you are not serious about money and shouldn't handle money. If you think you can without them you've been mislead.

@_date: 2014-02-05 02:45:11
nowhere does it mention scarcity and currency consists of a small fraction of the economy, the rest is just some numbers in some computers
the wiki page, in order to be correct would have to say first, right at the top: "the entire thing is a gigantic lie to earn slavery interest and we don't need banks or bankers anymore, we don't even need this page anymore because soon people will know what money really is *again*"
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:30:51

if you can't use fractions ***then you shouldn't handle money***
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:35:07
no, a formula for fail would be to try to disguise money as fun and hip.
money is cold and indifferent
and ***my money*** is serious business, so i choose the less pennytipping meme stroking catgif/doggif/whatever candy happyland devices
not because i think it's less "happy", but because it doesn't claim to be the better cc because it's "friendlier"
and if you can't use fractions you aren't serious about and shouldn't be handling money

and it backfired so they're in damage control with the scarcity attribute removal
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:13:24
then that's how it feels to dilute yourself into thinking you can get by without using fractions when dealing with serious money

you want to take risk you take risk
you are deluding yourself into thinking taking less risk means the tool you're using is less risky
the only risk is the risk you decide to take, regardless of your choice in cc
and if you are serious about helping someone deal with money, you will have them embrace fractions not deter them from using fractions
that's just dumb

@_date: 2014-02-05 02:49:53
its up to you if you feel you need to use element identifiers for every decimal place
we do for nickels dimes quarters pennies etc
and it has everything to do with inflation as the more shit gets out of whack the more identifiers we need
trillion billion million
what the ideal would be is everyone uses one unit for every transaction, that is obvious.
what i was trying to say about perception is that 
everyone is "scared of fractions" but what it really is that we have today pay "large amounts" of money represented by many a zero, when without inflation the number would be a "small amount" by our now "large amount small amount standard"
im not good at explaining things so if you dont get it by now dont bother even replying because im done with your ass

@_date: 2014-02-04 23:38:24
now that cc is starting to become trusted because of btc, people are taking advantage of that by starting new blank ponzie schemes and banking on the trust people have in other ccs, pretending that "it's easier" because they start mining at the fastest part so the numbers are flying around but no actual value is being made unless more people join.
we all know all ccs are Ponzi schemes, but these guys are sapping trust that people had for btc (whether they knew it or not) to build more schemes.  trust is the name of the game here, and they already betrayed that new blood by removing scarcity!
as someone else said, something will happen when most of them learn about inflation and escape their prison inside a snake's belly.
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:19:31

based on pretending that money is friendly joking integer only matter.  what you're doing is fooling people, making them dumber by allowing them to think they don't need to be able to use fractions, and then profiting from their trust, some of that trust, earned by other ccs


shortsighted are those that can't postulate the possibilities had the doges hadn't arrived on the scene.  i'll allow the popular notion that dog is probably good for btc in the long run, but i won't for a second pretend that i'm some kind of omnipotent god that knows what the situation would be without it, therefore i restrain my enthusiasm

I had that notion at one point too but it's simply not true
all of the arguments for doge when in a one or the other world are:

2: fun
3: oh btw we don't want scarcity
