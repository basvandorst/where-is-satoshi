I am not sure your comment could be more ironic if you tried

An argument for what? All I have said in the past is that BCH adheres to the original vision of Bitcoin than current Bitcoin does with Segwit. That is undeniably true regardless of how anyone feels about either currency.

You can't hold forever... At some point after very large gains people will want to secure their earnings and cash out. Make no mistake, people know Bitcoin is useless as a currency and are only in it as an investment. 
Once enough people start cashing out and panic begins the crash will be absolutely devastating.
The only way to possibly avoid this depends on the majority of people to keep holding even after making 5x, 10x, or even 50x gains. Sorry, but that will never happen.
The crash will happen maybe 6 days from now, maybe 6 months, who can say. Timing your sell is everything. If you can lock in 10x gains that is never a bad play.

That would still be taken into account in its value as a materiel

Gold is valued far above it's material uses.

It is valued more than its materiel use because people use it as a store of value. Obviously scarcity plays a role in why it would even be used a store of value in the first place.

That is specific to just that holiday. It is very rare to for anyone to use that order otherwise

There is a third option, that they are experiencing extremely high volumes right now

You mean the one that actually adheres to the white paper?
