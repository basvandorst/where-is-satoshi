If you are going for long term investment look at getting a Ledger or Trezor wallet, exchanges can go bust or be hacked, either way they wont be warning you to get your BTC off when things go south. Both Ledger wallets and Trezor wallets have good short videos of how to use them. Check out the Nano S vids here  short and easy to follow. Even if you dont buy one they at least show things working and may clear a few questions up.
It is very easy to lose access to your coins forever, make sure you are comfortable in some knowledge before buying, you will probably have time to learn as stated the exchanges are under big loads and there are wait times.

True, I was thinking more that when LN gains traction that to make it cheaper and less bloat on the blockchain a LN wallet/mini node on a Ledger or Trezor with spending btc for games, coffee etc and to just top up when needed.

Pretty disgusting the overall way bcash has been done, even though legal still very dishonest in ways and means.
If bcash was as good as it is supposed to be it would be able to stand on its own without trying to co-opt the Bitcoin brand, look at how well some of the useful alts have done but bcash flopped on the flippening and is pushed by a few large ego's with self interest in mind. Going by the language used by ardent bcash proponents, I would say most are young impressionable folk who just want to stick it to 'the man' and the rhetoric sounds good to them. They are cutting their own nose's off to spite their face.

Mine is not exactly as the seed says and there is also the question of a hidden wallet, the key to my seed is in another safe space. I thought of those problems or govt intervention and how to leave a will with still being able to sleep and not worry. I should of made it a bit clearer before that it was not verbatim on the engraving and another key to the seed is needed to clear it all up to make it work.

Most of the dips over the last 12 months can be put down to fake news and fud from certain groups, zoom out on your charts and the dips really dont look like much over time, many see them as opportunities for cheaper coins.

Yep, your coins always stay on the chain, wallets are key holders.
Once it is confirmed on the blockchain theres no chance from my understanding that balances can change. You could move coins to a 24 password wallet throw it away for a few years and buy a new one, enter them as before and good to go. But remember to back up the words securely, I engraved mine on stainless steel and put it in a big private vault, with another secured elsewhere as tough to get at, got worried about a $5 wrench attack :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:21:25
From Ledger wallets site 'The 24 words you copied on your Recovery sheet when you first handled your device is your backup. These 24 words are your "seed", which is like a passphrase that generates all your public and private addresses.
When you need to import your accounts in another compatible wallet, you must enter these 24 words in the new wallet, it will automatically synchronize all your transactions from the blockchain and shows your correct balance.' 
You can use the 24 words on different platforms and hardware wallets, I have the same wallet setup on a Trezor and a Ledger Nano S. 
Just make sure to do a wallet reset and enter the 24 words from the paper you wrote them on to be sure before sending BTC to it. Copy a receiving address from the wallet you first made and if it is the same when you remake the wallet again you a fine.

7103 Diamond Wheel Point, I found the smaller the head the less it tended to wander when engraving, also write out your seed with a marker helps guide when engraving. Got my stainless from a small local metal workshop specialising in stainless. $30 for 10 pieces about 1mm thick.

I was up for CGT of 25%, I held the BTC for more than 12 months before selling, buying and selling on an exchange resets the time every time to zero. 
If I had of sold for profit in less than 12 months it would of been 50% tax on profit by my memory. 
My yearly earnings were taken into account and the 25% was tiered to that, so I ended up paying less than the 25% because I had little earnings that year. This was for 2012/13 tax year and they really had no idea at the time and called it a CGT event because I had cash put into my bank account and the overseas money agency the govt has notified the ATO.
I like the sounds of buying stuff for below 10k for no CGT, not much I need in life above that to live comfortably besides some acres. 
As other have said though seek advice, vet your advisers as well for BTC knowledge.

Need more fiat to buy BTC with, how about a few betting tips before you go.

Really enjoyed your write up and am very impressed by your focus, at that age there was no way I would have anything near that. Kudos, methinks you have a very bright future ahead of you.

Got credit card sized stainless steel and brought a dremel to engrave the seed and feel so much better doing that, not all the seed is in the same place for my peace of mind.

For a better perspective when a drop happens in the current view of your chart, immediately and I mean let no bad emotions rise, ZOOM the f out and look at the chart for the last year.

The smartest young ones I know have big loans for phones and crap, not a bitcoin mention to be heard and here I am in my 50's rofling at the hubris of the naive youth who seem to think they made stuff happen.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:35:21
You should be paying attention to what bitcoiners want and the developers who are making it work, that's where the future is.

Np's I dont usually don't go a campaigning but hey they did the wrong thing to you for their own cock up.

No way man, this time it is different.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:30:13
I agree mostly but maybe the flip side will be many of those who become wealthy and are skilled will hopefully do something good with their time, once they are bored and need something to put their time to but I spose there will be many ruined by success as well. Folks need to think about it for sure.

I look at the history of the ups and downs, crashes and rockets much like the starting and warming up of a very old and out of tune motor. Lots of things happen on the inside that you don't see but get a feel for from observational history like if it is flooded, just cold, a small blockage clearing or many other things on the way to a smooth sounding motor purring along at near redline. I think we are just about past the cough and splutter stage, with some smoother running a lot sooner rather than later, going on full time scale of kick starting this beast, furiously with lots of sweat and swearing to the hang on for dear life its out of control.

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:47:02
Get some stainless steel about a credit card size and engraver like a dremel, engrave the 24 words on it. Hide it somewhere it wont be found. I put mine in a safe deposit box in a vault and changed a few things in case someone gains access to the vault somehow.

Patriarchy Inc has a filter that stops the ladies from ever seeing BTC stuff, the ones that make it here have transitioned to male troll accounts. /s

Ledger does all transaction history as if the fiat was at today's rate.
@_date: 2015-08-03 11:32:34
I am only hoping the pressure he is getting from his new overlords is enough to make him give up any hidden BTC he has.
At least I know his days are worse than mine at the moment for once since this debacle started.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:24:41
Do you have your setting to show mbtc or something smaller? Not sure what is going on really, just I know all transactions on my ledger history are at todays fiat/btc rate.

Lol Peter Vessenes what a crook.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:11:03
Someone or grp are trying desperately to drive the price down, hoping to cause some momentum,
but I think there is more fiat waiting than they are prepared for, the fear of the recent bubble which was a correction has died.

Running a Raspberry Pi is cheap and effortless once setup. Mine is going24/7 and the only down time was for a few hours was when a power outage happened from a storm. 
The reward is knowing I have a viable part of the network going.

He is looking to copy a bigger more grandiose stage, the one he is on is getting crowded and making him look slow, small and cheap. Roger needs bigger stages.

I hate the sound of this ver pricks voice, he has nothing to say but the same rhetoric in everything, runs Bitcoin and devs down but says nothing on using all the work done by the BTC devs. Edit out bad taste.

I kept getting them, set everything to accept and still nothing. A couple of hours later a flood of emailed codes come through. 
If you tried multiple times like me, wait when the  first email come for more. You want the last code or play a loop game with the procedure.

I will be skating the rings of Saturn before I die, with my shiny ufo like craft which will be printed in my backyard from dirt by a 3d printer that prints everything from nothing but earth, paid for by bitcoin from these here pioneering days.
But seriously this could all tumble back to earth for a year or more yet, me hopes not though.
Edit for clarity
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:29:46
was goxxed and I have both Trezors and Ledgers. As soon as I have BTC it is straight to a hardware wallet, added bonus is less chance of a rash momentary decision to panic sell.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:09:48
I have the feeling all of the big exchanges are under massive load to sign people up. Probably a good thing in a way, imagine the price if there were no AML/KYC going on.
