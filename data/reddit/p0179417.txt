Ive done some research and learned that it is essentially allowing  smartContracts on a sidechain of the blockchain. 
It's not what I was talking about thanks for telling me about rootstock. I'm surprised I haven't heard of this. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:10:52
Okay, thanks for explaining the various uses of the name: Segwit.
Going back to the question though, 






If you can clear it up then much appreciated... I feel like I am close to understanding how it works on a high level.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:04:52
Okay, fair enough. 
Can you point me to a source that goes over what segwit does and how it does it? I would imagine finding the right one would be a nightmare considering all the other projects that inherited the same name.
Would love to read up on it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:49:46
Okay, I understood segwit wrong then. I thought that people who accept segwit create their own "sidechain" and when huge majority accepts segwit then the "segwit side chain" become the real blockchain and everything moves forward from there.
I had no clue that the segwit addresses are just inserted on top of blocks.
Or am I still misunderstanding?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:48:59
i have never heard of rootstock. ever.
will have to look this up.

If lightning works well then we won't need bitcoinCash because there won't be a fee problem.
I'm not saying that they will function the same, but for the average user it will effectively be the same.
I personally like on-chain scaling much better, but the decentralization function deserves much more credit than people give it. Look at all the centralized coins that are gaining traction. I would love to continue to see Bitcoin stay decentralized while meeting current scaling needs (even if it is offchain) in order to be able to insert onchain scaling when they are able to get it working well.

When you open a channel, are you essentially paying for a spot on the blockchain and using that spot later when you want to close the channel? 
Will a closed channel look like one transaction on the blockchain or will it indicate everything g that has happened in the channel? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:23:30
Replying again hoping to get an answer. If I were a troll or a sockpuppet then I would't be doing this. I am a real person who is interested and want to learn more about the technology.
Below is my previous reply: 








@_date: 2018-01-09 04:44:31
I've read your comment again after getting more comfortable with various aspects of bitcoin. 
I'm happy to say that I understand everything you've said now. 
I'm very thankful for your time. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:08:33
Thanks for the website!
I think I am close to understanding.
Is segwit inserting addresses on top of blocks or is it the "sidechain" thing?
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:29:10
Wouldn't that be an issue of fee and not an issue of coinbase? 
If they implement segwit then would it solve the fee issue? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:06:30
When it gets time to settle the channel then does it go into the mempool? Where does the fee to open a channel go? 
Is it safe to say that opening  a channel is much like paying for a TX spot today and using it in the future? 
When the channel gets settled, does the TX in the blockchain only show one tx or is it a recollection of what has happened during while operating the channel? 
Is it possible for a bad actor to spam the mempool in order to force users to utilize a channel? 
Quick thought, not sure how accurate this is: I really like how LN flips the current power structure. It makes blockchain king and the fed(or any entity wanting to run the node, but could be the fed) under. We can still use the blockchain if we want, or we can take the benefits of using fedChannel. 
So many questions! 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:26:19
Appreciate the clarity!
You mentioned that the transactions required to break even is dependent on lightning fees, does this mean that the fee to open/close a channel is different from a mempool fee?
If a channel can be opened between the well known Alice and Bob, aka normal people then I'm assuming channels don't have to be full nodes. Are there any benefits for them to be full nodes? I feel this is an amazing way to solve the issue of nodes not being compensated for their efforts.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:30:12
Thanks for be explanation. 
Okay next part is a little technical, but hope you can answer. Correct me if I'm wrong.
assuming each user in a channel transacted with every other user then to find the total blockchain tx required to settle a channel, assuming n=TotalUsersInChannel, the equation would be n!/(n-2)!. This would give us the total number of 2 people combinations between n users, for any number of users &gt;0 since 2/0 is infinity but anyways...
* So 2 users = 4 tx, 
* 3 users = 6tx, 
* 4 users = 12 tx, 
* 5 users = 60tx
Or to find total tx we can do TxByUniquePairOfUsers * 2.
So when you open a channel it is only beneficial if you utilize more transactions than TxByUniquePairOfUsers *2.

So, in general, richest man in world can build &gt;50% hashpower to control btc but to prevent this, we have the nodes which can ignore the "&gt;50%" blocks to prevent this. Is this right? 
Also, I don't think what I am saying is a &gt;50% hashrate mining attack. It is more like, halting progress of the blockchain by controlling a bunch of nodes. Is that a thing? Can that happen?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:27:39


Can you elaborate on this? Let me say this first: When I said SpecialInterest block, I meant a block that is being propogated because of specialInterests, not because it is an actual block that follows all protocol rules. That being said, how would denying a SpecialInterest block be considered attacking the network?


Okay, i agree that those all things make the network secure. Users are there to feed the miners, i suppose, while the others propogate blocks and check the protocol rules.


Yes, having all NonMiningNodes controlled by one party is dangerous, but going back to the topic. What can happen in that case? I believe another user answered it below, but it seems that he agrees with me. I don't want simple agreement (especially if I'm wrong, which is what I am trying to find out.), I want discussion to actually learn. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:47:05
Just want to say that I am not ignoring this post. There is obviously a whole lot I need to learn, so I am currently learning but it is slow progress. I'll reply with a real reply when I have a much better understanding.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:31:55
holy fuck that's smart. Didn't know that was even possible, since the chance of getting the same address is so small. 
Any clue how he did that? I don't see why **all** wallets do this.
I feel like the only way to have the same address and private keys are to hold an address prefork, so after fork you can still use that same address+keys on each respective chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:35:42
I think youre right  about censoring shills. 
I haven't been censored and I can only chalk it up to me being a real person and not a shill.
I have asked sincere questions and gotten great answers here and I'm really thankful. 
Both sides are circlejerks but you can find gold (not bitcoingold, haha) if you look for it.

I support both chains. If core can become "better" than cash then I'll use that for daily transactions as needed. They may have prebought to make money. I don't expect any finance people (or any person for that matter) to act any differently.
That being said, what's the point? Did they take away someone's house? Did they steal money from the single mom? 
I believe that the complaint is TwoFold: 
* they released a coin earlier than the public thought and probably been buying for awhile.
* didn't allow selling (though this falls in line with what happens whenever there is heavy load in their system).
If this is wrong the someone clear it up because that's the complaint I'm seeing.
After we can confirm that this is the complaint, I would like to say that what they didn't isn't a big deal because it falls directly in line with what I expect people to do if given the opportunity. In fact, ill go further and say that what they did does not compare to real issues like WageTheft.  I'm not saying it was good, it is completely shitty but let's not act like this is on the same level as stuff that impacts everyday people.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:53:46
What I mean by censor is actual banning/deleting of posts, not downvoting (sure, maybe its downvoting because of RogerBots).  There are plenty of examples here, and not many there (that I know of, you can prove me wrong on this of course). They have OpenModLogs there and not here, which is another big thing. A user told me that the censorship is due to people with special interests brigading shit which is understandable but the ModLogs are still concerning enough to where I think censoring to an extent does happen.
Like I said, they downvote but you can still have discussion. In general both sides tend to result in personal attacks though but sometimes you can find people who will have discussions. It isn't so much different here either.
You know what I'm pleasantly surprised for? I haven't gotten censored for talking about shit that SmallBlockers might not like. I ask questions cause im legit curious and have really good discussions, and you can't really have discussions there because it a lot of shit ends up pointing to a damn conspiracy theory or "maybe you should ask them", which still doesn't answer the question. I can't remember exactly what I asked but i was a little pissed when the general answer I got was "choose bch/btc, and don't look back. youll be happier." dude wtf man...
I am actually having discussions with people right now. Sometimes what they say is shit I don't completely understand so i read their post and find other sources to truly understand it before I reply. It may awhile before I get back to them, but it's only respectful since they've spent so much time explaining shit to me. I really am thankful.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:13:25
Let's keep the debate about technical issues rather than personal attacks.
That said, holy shit this is new and it's bad... I understand the interview but this is another level. Other guy should've given back what isn't his, and Roger shouldn't have done what he did. 
Is BitcoinCash (or bcash, i get it...) better? Debateable. Personal attacks don't improve core efficiency. They also don't disprove the utility of cash.
What is the point of nodes though? I haven't found a sufficient answer through Google or any other sources. I understand what they do but I don't think they necessarily serve a purpose. If there were no nodes then miners themselves would check the rules. If there were a trillion nodes then miners would still check the rules as would the other nodes. If there was a &gt;50% miner problem then nodes can't prevent anything.
I don't know what would happen if all nodes (except miners) were owned by one malicious person though, I would guess that worst would be the nodes declining every block except a chosen (special interest) one, but it still doesn't stop the miners from eventually getting the right block and continuing the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:55:43
Not saying one side is better than the other. Both sides meme while this sub censors, though I think if you come across as a genuinely curious person then you won't get banned. I haven't gotten banned, and I'm glad because ive learned a whole lot.
All in all, yes I see memes on other side and always talking about censorship/WhitePaperBitcoin(we get it... Never stops with this). For here, I always see memes/PersonalAttacks(we also get it...roger did some really shitty stuff). 
Really wish we would see more technical talk and conversations about what developers are working on. Hate the *endless* memes man... Such a waste of space.

Look up what anecdotal means and get back to me on the first point. Who the hell cares for karma, do you? What normal person cares about bitcoin so much that they would take a picture of a store? Dude, idk about your friends but mine take pictures of shit they care about, and adoption of crypto isn't something they care about. 
Anyways, learn what an anecdote is first and you can get back to me. Or say "you didn't provide proof" and I'll say that's right, cause it's an anecdote and I don't care that much anyways since my point was to show you how ridiculous it was talk about "skyrocketting bitcoinCash fees" when it was less than a dollar at the peak. 
Don't get me wrong, there's real shit wrong with bitcoincash but it's not the fees. To point at those "skyrocketing fees"  as if it held any weight is the same as claiming Trump is a liar because his real name is  "drumpf". It just looks stupid and does nothing to make your point that bitcoinCash sucks. It's worse because it just makes you look desperate or something. 
I should know coinbase has minimum on bitcoinCash withdrawal? Well, I don't know. Sorry, still don't see what point youre trying to make with that. Are you saying that they suck because you can't withdraw 20 usd of crypto? If that's your point then sure, by that definition they do suck indeed. Still don't see what point you were trying to make. 
This isn't my sub, sure you're right about that. I get emotional when baseless accusations start coming out, I'm sure you can empathize. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:27:23
UASF is what segwit is, isn't it?
They signal that they agree with it and when a huge majority agree then they switch altogether.
What if 99% of nodes (non-mining, full) agree and 1% (the miners) doesn't? I never quite understood that. I believe it needs support from wallets and pretty much the entire ecosystem.
Can you explain what youre trying to say though? I'm having a hard time seeing how UASF answers the node question.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:05:33
Thanks for the detailed writeup.
Any bitcoin is just a number in a ledger(blockchain), and it's history can be found each dating back to a coinbase (the 50/25 btc mining reward). If this is true then how is it that people *lose* their bitcoin by losing their usb/hdd? Does it mean they lost their private keys (since bitcoin doesn't actually exist, that is, you cannot *store* bitcoin, rather the blockchain stores that a certain address holds bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:11:37
This next part is anecdotal, so take from it what you will: friend lives in 용산, a district in Seoul. He said that it's still uncommon to see people taking crypto, but it's becoming more common. Maybe grocery isn't the right term, they have lots of small convenience stores called supers. The main thing is that crypto is so mainstream that the general public talks about it regularly. My friend is very general public. 
How would I know why you can't withdraw 20usd worth of bch off coinbase? It's not like any exchange doesn't have any temporary problems... When you can't take it  out permanently then we have an issue. 
That being said... There's no need for your vitriol here. Get out of my sub if your going to be toxic and blame others for being shills. Im sure my post history very much disproves that I'm a shill for anyone. Uncalled for toxicity and personal attacks that have no basis is what turns communities into shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:24:36
A rough measure to see how much something is utilized is to see how much is being traded or how many transactions are going through. Something like blockchain.info would be good, I guess, or any metrics measuring website. 
I would say that people are using BitcoinCash based on this measurement. 
Likewise, there is extreme demand for Bitcoin (much more than BitcoinCash) because people are paying 20 dollar fees to use it. Penny fees are great, but anyone is willing to pay it - awesome but kinda kills the measurement. Paying 20 usd fees shows real use, not quirky uses that go along with users like me. Sure for streamlined money it works but in our scenario it lowers the accuracy of what we're trying to measure. 
That being said BitcoinCash has much larger use than Litecoin at the very very least since both are small fee and on similar exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:14:59
Okay, so in other words this app creates a different address for you after each transaction?

Dude you can't bring in all your conspiracies without bringing light to the other side of the story: blockstream/core is in bed with people who want to cripple bitcoin. 
Both sides have their arguments. I'm not saying one is true or false, im only bringing light to both arguments so people can decide for themselves.
Personally, I think both sides have legit arguments. If lightning works well then we won't need bitcoinCash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:56:32
Yeah you're right. I still need an answer to my node question though, 
I'll get around to asking the right person sooner or later. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:28:02
Gone through the roof, to around a dollar per TX? Am I reading that right? You really feeling good because cash fees have gone up 100x, and it's still around a dollar? 
I support both chains. BitcoinCash is better than alts because it has a much stronger network. Can't spend ltc/monero to buy real shit like you can bitcoinCash. I believe Japan and Korea are huge in bitcoinCash and that's insane to me. I can send any amount of money to friends in Asia, and they can use that bitcoinCash to buy goods and services, and those businesses can use their hard earned bitcoinCash to buy groceries, and pay rent, and so on.
I'll admit that as far as tech goes, core and cash fall short by a lot. Luckily bitcoin as a whole only needs to function well enough to be a fiat replacement.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:42:47
Not saying he is correct but let's play Devils advocate for a second since I've had the same question for awhile. 
If 100 percent of NoMineNodes decide to drop every block except one with special interest then they still can't add that block to the blockchain since they're not miners. Or maybe they can, but the honest/real miners won't accept it and will therefore quickly become a "least work chain". Correct? 
Likewise, if all miners except one(special interest block miner) do their own thing then eventually the correct blocks will be relayed and everything will move on as usual. There will be huge delays but, like the mempool, nothing is *really* forgotten. Only delayed. Correct? 
As I learn about bitcoin these weird question come up and I have to get the right answers before I can move on. Hate having holes in my understanding. 
I understand the decentralization part completely. Nodes = more copies. More copies = more security.  These questions are geared more towards "what power do nodes actually have" kind of thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:35:21
I guess it is because of my elementary understanding of a bitcoin wallet. I am understanding more about the blockchain as a whole, but not so much about wallets.
How exactly is a wallet *made*? I know that every possible wallet is already out there, and that the only problem is making private keys for those wallets. That's it though. My experience with making a wallet is to "click create" and there you go lol. So clicking create on both chains hoping to get the *same* one seems insane...which is why I thought it was impossible.
If you can chime in any interesting information on wallets then I would much appreciate it. During commute I'm sure that I'll get around to youtube videos about wallets eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:42:31
Interesting you say this. 
Vitalik said that the purpose of creating eth was that he didnt like seeing each coin doing its thing in its own network. Eth was designed so it can have 5(any number of  coins) coins doing their thing all on the same network so more stabile and stuff. 
Why did I say this? Idk. I really don't have a point to this post, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:12
Seems like we agree on everything, unless I missed something. The part about Satoshi mentioning Nodes in WhitePaper being miners is new though, and seems to fall in line with our understanding.
Can you elaborate on what you mean by NonMiningNodes holding transactions for miners though? I didn't know this was a thing. Is the MemPool sort-of like holding the tx in NonMiningNode memory for miners to scoop up?
I hope the other guy brings in discussion because we are all here to learn.

@_date: 2017-11-25 18:01:24
Okay I see what youre saying much more clearly. This is really interesting, I'm learning a hell of a lot from everyone in this post.
To put it in a nutshell, what youre saying is that BitcoinCash(BigBlocks) was not consented between the bitcoin ecosystem. This does not mean it will not work or cannot work, but rather that it simply was not consented by everyone(or enough of each part of the ecosystem for healthy funcitonality) in the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:35:50


Who is in charge of the ones who hold power to change the code? I've never truly understood this and assumed that whoever held the rights to change the github repo then they also hold the power to change/restrict change to the code.


I don't follow how SmallBlocks are able to do this. I have heard it a few times but never understood how or why. Can you elaborate a bit? I've asked a few times what a node is but never got an answer. I assumed it was like a bitcoin mining rig but without actual mining, which would mean it is just a recollection of the blockchain. But more and more I feel like I am wrong on that.


Does BitcoinCash have any huge problems that the general public (me and people like me) isn't aware of? I thought BitcoinCash was a hardfork for bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:56:14
My mistake for using Core and Blockstream as one and the same. Does Blockstream not hold complete control over the code though? Which I guess would be the same for any open source code - whoever holds the power to make changes holds the same amount of power as Blockstream does with Core. Correct?
When you say that Bitcoin is censorship resistant you mean that it is decentralized right?
Another question that I just thought of. If we need lower fees right now then why don't we: increase blocksize, become more efficient to decrease tx sizes, and then decrease blocksize?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:29:12
I guess we differ on what "enough backing" means. IMO enough backing is enough to exist AND be relevant. (see XT/BU, I would say that they exist but are NOT relevant)
What would be your definition of enough backing?

I'll watch this later and get back to you on it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:40:31
Very interesting input.
Couple questions. 
* I still don't know exactly what a node is. I thought it was like a recollection of the blockchain, but not mining. I think I'm clearly wrong in this though. Can you elaborate on what a node is? I don't remember these being a necessary thing in the blockchain technology.
* You mention that BigBlocks risk centralization of base layer. How do you come to this conclusion? I agree that if the base layer becomes centralized then bad things can happen but I don't see the connection between BigBlocks and centralization.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:52:45
Or its another way to differentiate... 
If i say BitcoinCash then I'm probably going to say BitcoinCore. 
Likewise, if I say Bcash then I'm probably going to say Bcore. 
I get why the other sub cares so much. Why do people in this sub care so much?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:26:21


Can you elaborate on this part a bit? A huge part of BigBlockers argument is that Core will NOT increase blocksize due to (what they presume to be) personal financial interests.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:46:54
Sure, you can call it bcash, and sure I can call it BitcoinCash, but in order to keep from complicating things we should explain to new users the simple facts: bitcoin is trying to make things more efficient to lower fees and BitcoinCash is just increasing blocksize to lower fees. 
Let them do their research and choose what they like. 
Don't really think it matters what you call anything as long as you explain to the user what is going on. Likewise, saying anything without explaining is worse than calling a bicycles same as motorcycles. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:16:15
Can you elaborate on this? I thought that if forks did not have enough backign then they would quickly become useless (like XT or BU etc).
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:20:45
Okay, I guess I should rephrase the question. BitcoinCash currently exists AND is relevant because it has enough backing.
Your definition of backing is: support from people in general, aka the peasants of the system.
How would you measure something like that? What gives SmallBlocks/BitcoinCore backing from the little guy and BigBlocks/BitcoinCash not enough backing?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:48:45
You're exactly right that the name does the heavy lifting. What's your point?

@_date: 2017-11-24 02:11:07
Wait, I thought that like a week or two ago there was going to be another fork because the blocksize increase for Segwit wasn't going to happen, so angry people wanted another fork. But then it got cancelled. Is this wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:02:42
I read it and will watch the andreas video linked. Can't say I agree with everythign said because I don't completely understand exactly what he is saying so after I do my research then we will see.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:30:03
I think what you say is reasonable if segwit were still going to happen but didn't it not happen and will not happen?
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:39:40
I read it and it was pretty eye opening. Few questions though,


This is a big problem. Wouldn't lower fees resolve this issue and allow the blocksize to become smaller because people *can* spend the dust?
He then goes on to say that it is detrimental for economy and why. But again, lower fees so we can get rid of the dust, no?


Scattered throughout he talks about how higher cost means centralization of money, and that jihan/erik/etc are tryingt o control the money supply and eventually have control over Bitcoin. Can you paint the picture for me? I don't see the connection.
BigBlockers claim the exact opposite, how Core holds complete control and are trying to benefit from the small blocks.
I know I will never find out the "truth" but can you help me fill in the gaps in my understanding?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:48:06


I tried to look up the github commits during august to see the blocksize increase but its a hassle to even get to it. Do you know of an easier way to look up the commits by date? I do agree that having half transaction sizes is better than 2x blocksize increase. For sure.


Yeah, I know. It's the view from one side. I'm trying to get a good whole picture. I was also told that I would be banned by now for trying to learn, but I'm not banned which is really cool and eye opening. Maybe I was listening to the wrong people all along, or maybe both sides have legitimate points. Can only make that decision when I learn enough about both viewpoints.

I listened to the video.
I have to say that lots of what Doug Polk says are not things that make somebody a bad actor in an ecosystem.
Here is a list of what Doug mentioned:
- explosives: he was 19 and he kept them next to his bed. Let's not act like this is even a real reason. Even if he were older it is an attempt at making him look bad. It is like saying that Bernie Sanders sold marijuana when he was in college and therefore is not fit to be president.
- Dox: This was his bad for sure. It is legitimate. To be fair though, he was the victim and retaliated. The argument can be made that he felt like someone stole from his store and posted a picture of the guy on the front door. Obviously many flaws with this analogy but point is that it is not onesided.
- Ragequit: This does is nothing. If you watch the interview then you will know that the guy had an agenda and was being a general asshole trying to make him ragequit. I don't blame Roger for losing his cool.
- Richard Heart: Roger said he didn't sell anything and to pump bitcoinCash. I find this hard to believe, and I think it is a lie.
- LN: He complimented it and then said negative things about it. I don't see the big issue here, I find that lightning is awesome but also find that there could be flaws - though I am not the most informed person on the lightning network.
These were the main points I remember, but in general there is nothing that makes me think he is any better or worse than a normal person. I personally believe that **he thinks** he is doing the right thing but is misled since linear scaling will not cut it for worldwide adoption of Crypto.
I support bitcoin and the tech it brings (satellite, sms, crypto-usb thing, layer2 solutions). I do not support the demonizing of Roger and all the personal attacks. My gripe is that I really wish both sides can chill the fuck out on the personal attacks.

What did Roger do that makes him a bad actor? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:09:21
Yeah youre right on all those points.
Each of those points are legitimate concerns. If attacks revolved around those points then it would seem very reasonable since those are very reasonable concerns.
When people talk about the above reasons and point to Roger being some psychopath or something then I can't help but cringe. It all really feels like grasping at straws...Literally feels people trying to demonize somebody for doing **nothing**.
Examples: 
- When people were posting the ragequit everywhere and upvoting it seemed so ridiculous, like people were pulling at thin air. If anyone actually watched the interview then they would see how stupid the whole debacle is.
- Whenever people talk about him going to prison for selling "explosives" when he was 19, I can't help but think how stupid this reason is. It really is just making a big deal out of nothing.
- pretty much any example that Doug brought up, which are very vocal attacks on this sub.
but once again, yes. All 3 of your reasons are concerns.

I keep hearing about how ver is a scam artist. What scams did he run? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:10:13
I've seen him selling explosives and going to prison but those are not real reasons that make him a bad actor.
The "stealing hashrate" argument does not stand because it is an ideological battle - if I own a car house then is the house mine to do as i please?
Him stealing open source and labeling it as himself is though, but idk if it is big enough.
Can you link me your favorite vid that explains him being a bad actor?
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:06:13
Okay that reason is pretty legit.
I always try to weed out herd mentality by asking for tangible reasons, and that is one.
Anything else that comes to mind?

I've already PMed you before but with no response. Please respond back to this one. I'll copy and paste the message I sent last time.

Nice writeup! I never thought of the last scenario though and don't think it will apply to me - I'm poor so maybe when I actually obtain some form of wealth I will think about it haha.
I did see that the differences between the tier1 and tier2 is that
1.  There are physical backups as well as digital backups.
2. that it is not connected to the internet. 
What do you think about a factory reset phone or a phone with a custom rom that is not connected to the internet? This way people can install the app and create wallets and create physical backups all without being connected and is much easier and more accessible than a beater desktop with clean OS. I tried to go to the "coinsafe" link in the tier two explanation but cannot access it but I assume it goes in depth about installing a clean OS to an unused desktop etc etc.

Awesome, thanks. I'll do some reading on "airgapped computers."

Getting the feeling that you don't understand the "blockchain" portion and how it relates to cryptocurrency.
Here is the rundown.
- Blockchain:Bitcoin as electricity:lightbulb
- Blockchain can be used for many things but the obvious example is currency (bitcoin)
- What else can blockchain be used for? Voting so one person = one vote (one address = one token, send token to Bernie's address to vote for him)
- Why would it be good for voting? Can clearly see through the **blockchain** where each address got all their tokens from (where each candidate got all their votes from) thereby reducing the need to count votes/go to voting centers/corruption/double voting/all that JizzJazz
- Obviously many issues surrounding this solution exist, but my point is to show you that blockchain is only a technology
side note:if what you are saying is exactly what core meant then they are lying to you. I am sure it is not exactly what they meant. I like the technology advances that Core and other devs brings to Bitcoin and have a hard time believing that is exactly what they meant.

Well the key word was "fresh blood." You claimed it will bring in more fresh blood so others can offload their coins.
Either way, why does it upset you when people talk about holding?
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:56:06
I wouldnt have to worry about overdraft fees then. Correct?

He was just a "nice" guy and I thought we were having a nice conversation.
He brought it up so I naturally thought he was legitimately interested.
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:36:16
I still don't understand the buttcoin thing, I guess theyre a group of bitcoin trolls?


I can't understand this bit. Can you rephrase?
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:35:00
what bitcoins? prove that I have bitcoins because I don't. :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:48:17
I just got hte email from the same address.
It was asking "how likely are you to recommend coinbase to a friend"
I clicked 8, and it redirected me but I shut out the window before it can finish loading. Should I be scared of anything?
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:02:01
yeah i don't care enough to try to prove myself as it seems near impossible. I guess we can continue to let each other do their own thing.
But how would talking about bitcoin being persecuted make more people buy in? it would have the exact opposite effect. Seems like the logic is off a bit.

Rain btc? I'll make sure to bring an umbrella! 
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:37:26
Maybe when I am in a better position I can say that. Definitely a good comeback though.

if you play league, then you will understand my humor.
midlane dies 5 times after enemy annie is lvl 6.
teammate proceeds to call our midlane a noob.
our midlane defends himself by saying "its not me!! its that bear that pops out of nowhere!!!"
