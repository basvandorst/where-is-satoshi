I never said it added to the price. It reveals scam coins.  And solid dev team is a solid project. Get out of here rookie.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:25:25
Ok, I think we're arguing slightly different things here. I get your argument. I'm debating that the actual number doesn't hold any weight and that's proven by how many coins flip flop positions due to their market cap. This whole "700billion" market cap for the sector could turn to 0 tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:34:01
There are a bunch of people who can swing stocks with their words, don't underestimate the influence of some people and the herd mentality of others.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:12:39
How's that mistake? You hook him up he hooks you up, business, bra.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:09:09
1k took 15 days for me.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:03:21
So? It's still meaningless. All it says is that people are willing to pay this price at this point in time.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:14:49
Pretty much. 
"If you're not going to take the time to learn, I'm not going to take the time to help you invest"
This market would probably be at least 5 times smaller if people tried to learn first, and that's kind of scary.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:00:20
Don't invest what you can't afford to lose, if you're always scared how your crypto is doing, you're doing it wrong.
Read the whitepapers
see if code is actually being contributed to the project regularaly
see how active the dev team is with the community
see how big the community is compared to it's market cap
see if they have a working project, that's a huge plus, huge
see how much hype is around the project, no matter how good it seems, with no hype it isn't going anywhere
I'm sure there's a lot more but thats good for now
I bought into bounty0x a few days ago because I loved the project and the community was huge compared to it's market cap, it had a working project and hype. boom its up like crazy and still has like a 60 mill market cap i think
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:45:49
So what's your opinion on non mineable market caps. Because those are truly worthless in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:19:51
Just because people refuse to adopt segwit, and will most likely choose not to adopt lightning either...
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:16:49
Because it is. The marketcap tanked 150 billion. And what did that tell us? shit all. 
It doesn't tell us how much money is in the system, how many players, how many people are trading, where the market is heading. So please tell me why market cap is such a good indicator of anything.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:24
Don't regret it. Your wife was correct to take your initial investment out. That's the first thing everyone should do once you feel like you have enough money made. The goal is to play with the houses money.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:43:11
It's almost like people buy houses based on how much you're worth. What a concept.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:45:00
Um, Bitcoin cash owns Bitcoin.com. the wallet downloaded from that site defaults to Bitcoin cash. It's a big scam with a lot of money behind it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:23:56
10th also
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:36:30
It is 10% Btc/usdt. If you're not including bitfinex they are using usdt
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:50:38
But bitfinex is showing 8.88% volume
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:59:19
Unless you were planning to take your money out of Bitcoin this year, don't worry about it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:48
There's been a correction every time it's run up like this, it's really not hard to see. This rally has been a little different though, there is just so much hype right now that it can rally higher, but it needs to correct.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:20:07
Like everyone already does, then you buy low and watch it double in price again, and so the cycle of fools continue to line my pockets.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:00:13
There are solutions, they are just going too slow.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:07:09
I started with 1000 and I'm over 5k now in 3 months trading after work. I love luc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:19:08
And when Bitcoin theoretically tanks, hell be the one with all the money left. I'm in the same boat, could have made a bit more if I just stuck it in and left it, but I like my guaranteed profits, I'm not a gambler.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:07:25
I saw bars swing 5- 10% every second for minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:54:41
It's going down because it went up too fast, end of story.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:53
Well, it's been around for 8 years and has always had an upward trend, sooooo calling it a gamble is a little much.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:00:46
I love these comments. Less for me to compete with I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:08:53
They can only tax you if you go to fiat. And no laws apply to bitcoin, kind of the point. Nobody has to listen to anyone no matter how many rules are imposed, but that's not to say rules aren't going to be a good thing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:16:42
Because I'm just some jackass on the internet. I'll leave that to the programmers. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:29:08
People may not agree with the philosophy behind ripple, but it's actually useful and serves it purpose and had been adopted by some banks. It's not Bitcoin but it doesn't try to be.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:06
I saw the market dump like crazy yesterday and the orders just kept getting eaten up. I think we're in a different time now.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:32:26
Look at volume, past patterns, how much it's currently risen, news, a correction due. Anything, and then you make an educated guess.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:46:44
I totally agree, it's just pretty much always corrects for steep climbs. But now with all this new adoption and futures, who knows. I just hope the big cats aren't trying to short the market with the futures all while adding distrust to cryptos because we've been on a steeper climb for a while now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:33:37
Everything on reddit gets turned into a religion. A bunch of crazy people on this site.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:08
No, that was smart. Pretty much anyone who got into bitcoin in the first few years was stupid. And even now, people are just slightly less stupid. I don't mind being one of those stupid people though, because the payoff is too large for the risk involved. Wait, does that make me not stupid? I don't know any more.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:44:18
What are you taking about man. They don't hold their bitcoin, it gets transferred to fiat instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:11:52
The thing with Cryptos is, they can literally be the future of money and each coin has a unique system that is useful in one way or another. Nobody knows what can happen, but when that thing does happen it's going to be monstrous.
I look at Cryptos as inventing the wheel in a time where we didn't need to transport anything.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:01:37
No more stupid than dollars. A word is just a word.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:23:09
It's dropping because around 8k it went bonkers and took off. Just coming back to reality now. Every crypto is way over valued though in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:22:42
The market doesn't wait for you. There's days I can't make a trade because I'm at work. It happens. To stop that though, place alerts at prices you like, if you're around, you'll snag them.
The only reason I made so much though, was because I started with 1k. A 10% increase is already 100 bucks right there. And that's on the low end for some volatile cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:58:33
These walls wouldn't work if people knew what they were doing. Kind of annoying
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:11:51
It's just ironic they created their own coin to be the real/better Bitcoin and they are still taking code from it. I get how projects work, but there is some irony here.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:53:30
Cryptokitties was hammering ETH for a while. Just wait until it get big like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:04:01
Seriously, there's only something like 7 million unique Bitcoin accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:03:39
Yes, the only way to buy many alt coins is with btc. So when btc is rising they do the reverse and buy btc with their alts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:22
Or people see something of value that they actually own and isn't tied to any government or nation.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:18:32
Ya, but the way they went about it centralizes the coin and is not the vision bitcoin had. I rather some growing pains and doing it properly then just forking for temporary solutions. They just wanted money.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:10:52
Increasing block sizes has it's own downfalls.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:09:56
It is listed as such, that is a lie. They use usdt. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:17:37
You clearly don't know anything about Bitcoin. There are payment systems that lock in prices and the companies of these systems eats the fluctuations in prices.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:59:05
Shares? West are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:20:30
Ya, but solution's are being put in place, instead of a kneejerk hardfork of the biggest crypto there is. If Bitcoin fails, we all fail, for a long time at least. They should want to see bitcoin succeed, not fork and start a war.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:46
USDT does 10% of bitcoin trading volume. Just a heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:09:26
And it's so pointless too. I don't dwell on anything, nobody can see the future whether it was bitcoin or beanie babies. Living in the moment is the best thing you can do for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:46:01
Nothing, the correction seems on par for what it should be. Just look at a day graph of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:13:59
Well, it's shaking the tree of loose leaves which is actually healthy for bitcoin. BUT, it would have been better if it was all avoided in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:40:50
The goal is to amass bitcoins when trading like that, not to make fiat. You're banking on Bitcoin going up long run (and short for quick profits).
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:19:55
lol fuck off dick bag
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:56:58
Because this is the early stages of something very big.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:29:58
This is how I feel when I ride a pump on a coin. I bail out at 30% and then it raises to 70. Like goddamn, but you just never know.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:19:16
Well, that quote just proves they don't know what Bitcoin is and shouldn't make any comments on it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:36
exchanges don't print usdt out of no where. Not how it works. It's a coin, not owned by exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:28:26
Bitcoin takes around 10 minutes for a transaction. I pay with one Bitcoin, but within that 10 minute period bitcoin drops a bit. 
That doesn't matter, the prices were locked in at time of payment and the company that runs this payment system eats the difference.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:08:30
No, but you have Cryptos worth multi billions of dollars with no working project. Dogecoin has a 1 bill market cap. This space is going to implode hard.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:09:27
I'm totally fine with that for now. You can only improve upon a horse and carriage so much until the cars come.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:04:47
Not when you sell in the profit zone. It's impossible to lose money, just potential money and potential money isn't real money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:03:24
I'm talking btc/usdt. This is the important one. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:13:52
Because you're not on a segwit wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:40:21
Ya, and everyone thought pets.com was going to be huge.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:02:00
Well, it happens every year. I think it's going to happen with REQ. It's a game changer.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:49
Lol, that's like nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:16:09
Lol you're loss buddy. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and has risen way over 100 000%. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:30:14
That brand recognition, definitely didn't work for apple or Nike /s
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:19:38
Don't be retarded. 
1. I have a career I've worked hard on, not just going to uproot for a risky venture
2. I'm talking about for people with the cash flow to invest in a high risk business. It's not like they need to invest millions.
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:16:42
Or maybe they don't. The risk to reward ratio on bitcoin is very, very good.
Some people have literally become billionaires. I don't think people realize how much a billion dollars really is.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:44:33
Ya, and so is buying it, yet i've done that for 16 years straight. Sound stupid now?
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:53:55
That's not right at all lol
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:21:24
I've never heard anyone say on accident here in Canada. Not one person.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:31:05
you're seriously an idiot. I should just go sell drugs too. Essentially everyone I know does them. Low risk, all my friends. Sounds good to me.
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:57:17


thought we were trying to be better than fiat. bitcoin atms have insane fees


depends what you call significant. Atm aren't exactly "expensive" and they essential print money for being plugged into a wall.


and I see where he is coming from, honestly, it's a digital currency... it's really not here for the super casual user yet
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:37:29
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:18:08
It's not meaningless. It's data.
A more apt comparison would be global temperatures rising. They keep rising every year, sure something could happen to stop that, but the data points to it continuing to rise.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:27:15
Ya, that's fair. Too many people are willing to take panicy losses on their "investments" or whatever you want to call bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:09:13
Why would you buy and sell at such a small swing? That's just asking for trouble.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:24:25
Except bitcoin is not like anything we have ever seen. It's already changed the world, nobody can speculate on it either way. At this moment in time it looks like it has an extremely bright future with it experiences crashes or not.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:51:31
This is a stupid strawman that has nothing to do with what we're talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:19:21
Because when you say bitcoin, people don't think about the 1s and 0s, they visualize a B and a coin. When you say apple, you think computers and apple logo, not hardware manufacturer. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:03:18
There's more to it then that, clearly. Have you not been reading the news at all?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:24:54
It's because you had allow non intrusive ads checked, which I think is nice to leave checked. We should reward non intrusive ads, people still need to get paid. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:02:59
I've never used coinbase and I day trade. Meh.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:56:16
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:32:46
Miners switch between established coins all the time... One get's hard  and they move to the other and back and forth. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:16:52
The sole reason I make money off cryptos is because of people described in his comment.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:57:41
Why are you not trading in usd?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:20:27
I feel like people need to start looking at crashes as a good thing. Bitcoin has proven that it recovers from every negative thing thrown at it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:11:26
Who owns any open source software? What's your point?
How about this, it's both.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:10:54
Well they're taking market share because they're more profitable to mine at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:04:01
They supported the hard fork.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:14:59
Electricity is the single greatest hurdle to making money while mining.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:06:03
Well, when you hit certain "psychological barriers" Price tends to run a bit. Like 6K 6.5k 7k. It hit 6.5 and jumped.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:29:52
No he didn't because bitcoin is actually terrible for the environment. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:14:32
Some exchanges have insurance. Like coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:12:06
Same for the drop to. They buy up all the orders and looks like the price is crashing.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:57:46
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:55:42
Lol, it is 100% a brand name.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:33:24
Dude, Bitcoin was ready to be illegal at one point and was super shady in the beginning. Don't act like you're smart because you acted foolishly and it paid off.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:24:38
It dipped 1k lol....
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:15:27
You misunderstood him then though. Because he was talking about the company mining with their products, which they would have an advantage over everyone else if they were getting free electricity.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:38:20
A mail icon... like everyone uses for email. Anyways that's besides the point, I'd say the technology is the blockchain. Since there are many cryptos, each one is a brand based on blockchain technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:33:28
Me too, but the charts seem more stable for usd.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:22:59
Two things that will ruin you when trading. 
1. Impatience 
2. Emotions
On the recent Bitcoin dip I made one of these mistakes and I normally don't. I Bought too fast in the dip at 6600. But I checked my emotions at the door even though it continued to tank. Look where it is now, don't let those two things get ya.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:57:37
It is an altcoin, and not even a good one at that, there are better altcoins if you really want to bring true value into this.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:18:08
Bitcoin dipped under 3k before it started it's rise to 7
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:13:22
Well, a competing coin that's taking advantage of the Bitcoin brand. There's better coins out there, they just want Bitcoin money.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:32:08
They stopped selling because they weren't profitable as a company, the other company was though, pretty much using the exact setup they we're.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:15:41
You misunderstood him then though. Because he was talking about the company mining with their products, which they would have an advantage over everyone else if they were getting free electricity.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:48:35
Just saying insurance does "exist".
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:18:35
lol so many butt hurt people in here investing all they had 
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:25:02
Ya, basic gardening, you plant different things at different times lol.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:24:00
Neural network nodes. I doubt half the country knows what 2 of those words are sadly...
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:03:10
But that's what happens. People buying this amount of coins are not here to hodl. They're here to manipulate and make money. That's how that money is reflected in the market
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:24:59
I think they burn excess gas anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:18:17
Everyone who thinks their alt is safe.
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:52:14
I think you should put half of it into ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:34:47
This just in, North korea uses a currency to buy shit.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:01:09
Then why do you have any issue with giving one?
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:16:47
You know how many coins no longer exist? Just look at the top 100 throughout the years. Hodl does not guarantee your coin will not bleed into oblivion. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:34:49
Purchase large amount of coins outside the market. Use said coins to manipulate market. Easy peasy.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:32:28
What are you talking about? Nobody owns the blockchain. It's decentralized, that's the whole point. Nobody and everybody holds the power.
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:14:34
Dark pools still effect the main market.  It's just easier to unload or load. Those coins just don't get continually traded among dark pools. Economics ain't simple bro.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:57:10
Pow is unsustainable and environment wrecking, there is literally no way around that, it's physics.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:43:54
You have to trust someone. Are you saying you don't use api keys at all?
Hell Equifax already screwed you over and you thought you were safe. 
Point is if you're so infosec you know that your information isn't safe even with trusted parties.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:34:05
Do you know how api keys work? Shut the fuck up dude.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:12:11
I guess I'm specifically talking about bitcoins, which this is being built for.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:19:33
You calling it an investment has already doomed bitcoin, seeing as it's supposed to be a currency, which would be literally it's only worth. But people are buying it up likes stocks which means it has no real value driving it besides speculation on how much money you might be able to make off it. It's a house of cards.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:32:43
Well, we're going to have to use government currency no matter how they decide to implement it. I don't really understand the point you're trying to get across here.
If you really think governments are just going to let the people replace their currency with non government controlled crypto you're very naive.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:03:13
Except that's not how it works. Business don't horde their crypto when they get paid, that's money they need. But congrats on being an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:56:20
Bitcoin is already dead as a currency. It's literally just gambling, how can no one here see this?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:01:38
Don't do it unless you plan to lose money. Plain and simple. Bitcoin is for the gambling man. It has ruined many lives of people who don't understand this. It is not an investment. It is a gamble, don't drink the kool aid.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:48:13
Ah, yes, the currency with thousand dollar swings, perfect for my business.
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:31:49
It has to do with volume, it makes the bull trap pretty easy to spot now.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:52:37
*results may vary
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:07:48
And that would mean there would be at least 1 for every 5 - 10 minute drive in my city. That's not bad at all.

Dare I say any fork should not be allowed to use the original coins name. You have a different vision? Cool, get a different name or you're just trying to scam people. If you're coin can't stand on it's own without riding the wave of the original, it's a scam.
