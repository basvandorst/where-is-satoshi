BCH is only 15% more profitable to mine than BTC right now. It was over 2 times more profitable yesterday. Miners should be back to BTC now and price will rise.

I believe the next crash (might be as big as this one) will come on or before Oct 31.

Next huge bump will come when China lifts the ban.

I made $100 on investment of approx $1000 on the bull trap yesterday. If i had more money to invest, I would've invested it.

I think last 2 weeks of October are crucial for a major bump or crash because there will be a China Communist Party Reshuffle on Oct 18, which is before closing of OkCoin and Houbi. If the exchanges don't resume back it can result in a temporary loss of confidence in Bitcoin among new buyers/sellers.

Already bought into the hype at $3100.

Why would the exchanges ban the bots? Don't the exchanges make money on every transaction?
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:15:36
Sell now. There seems to be a big dump going on.

If anything, banks are probably buying into crypto themselves because of incredible gains.

Last time too I bought during the dip. Invested around 90k INR ($1400~) total so far.

Just China manipulating the market to grab those cheap coins.

Another exchange needs to shut down for the drop.
