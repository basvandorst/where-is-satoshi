If I want to begin selling bitcoin face to face, how do I ensure protection for both myself and the potential buyer/seller. Realistically how can I ensure I get cash and they get bitcoin without having to trust each other?

Just in case anyone doesn't know, they are making a play on words and a reference to the 1oz South African gold coin the krugerrand. Once there was a time when they were the investment of choice for the kind of crowd that's all over bitcoin now.

Your repeated accusations of "selfishness" towards users that think dropping "bitcoin" from the name of your service is stupid, makes zero fucking sense. How about you make an attempt to convince people that this new direction is a positive one, rather than shitting on redditors that are giving you good advice.

It's not hypocritical to be lesbian and to criticize pedophilia.
Lesbianism is not an opinion or way of life that is being advocated for. Hypocrisy requires a contradiction between advocacy and action.
I understand your point but your criticism is way off.

Okay? So a straight person who would stand up for people's right to love whoever they want would be a hypocrite for not supporting the same right for pedophiles?

What's a proper exchange to use during times like these?

1. I am sympathetic to pedophiles due to the fact they suffer from a mental disorder, the law has nothing to do with it. This disorder is directly correlated with the rape, abuse and victimization of children.
2. She didn't say that. Merely stated that she is a lesbian.

The "Buy smile face or buy frown face" shitpost is dumb?
The great insight.

Joe isn't dumb at all, you cannot be dumb to be a major self made success like he is in multiple industries (comedy, television, MMA presenter, major podcast runner). 
He makes his guest spell out underlying assumptions for his audience, he is the audience surrogate.

So the people that understand securities and currency trading DO know what's going to happen?

Just replying to say that a friend and I had essentially the same problem, but after posting a comment describing the situation and providing my order # on their forum, the funds were soon in my account. I assume high volume is the reason for the delay.
