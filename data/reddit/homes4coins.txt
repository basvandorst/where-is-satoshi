Hi, thanks for the great feedback. I haven't had time to go into VRBO and update the listings to say that we will take Bitcoins, but I will do that by tomorrow.  I'm pouring concrete today at another home, so I'm a little busy this afternoon :)
And, yes, I'll let other VRBO owners know that it's easy and convenient (once I find out that that's the case; my husband needs to walk me though creating a wallet and posting that on the site) or in the emails once someone confirms, so I know which order is tied to whose bitcoins.

Thanks for all the great comments!  My intention is to accept Bitcoins, not use a service that turns them into cash, until perhaps the price is too high (not too low; he's convinced me that it will get to at least $1,000 in the next year or two; after that, perhaps I'll reconsider).  
I agree the accounting might be a little tougher.  What I'm planning to do is note the price that was paid in cash and declare that as income when I sell the coins, with anything beyond that as capital gains (or just never sell, because we are guessing by the time it's $1,000, one should be able to buy all sorts of things with Bitcoins).
But, yes, I'm finally a "bit-liever" - wish I was one back when I talked my husband out of buying more coins at $70....

Our VRBO listings are now updated to indicate on the site that we take Bitcoins (it's under the Rate information - they don't let you use Bitcoin as a currency yet, but they do let you make notes about the rates, so that's where I put it).  Thanks for all of your support, and we hope to have some Bitcoiners staying in our homes in Las Vegas in the near future!
