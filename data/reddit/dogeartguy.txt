Anyone with minimal intuition should have smelled the Mt Gox implosion coming from a mile away. I, quite frankly, am having trouble getting my sympathy on.  I am an amateur amateur hobby trader and knew to stay clear of that exchange. Silk Road 2? Really? Again, sounds like a great way to get your coins heisted. I appreciate the invention that Bitcoin is. I get it and it makes sense to me and I understand why it was created the way it was. I feel it has done well at solving the working digital currency equation. Trouble isn't the tech. The trouble is man. Same as with fiat currency. Seems there are a lot of people hanging around in r/bitcoin who dont actually like it. But if you're here you must own some(?). Tip it my way, guys. I will actually appreciate it :)

I was excited, I did my research. 20,000 doesnt come close to getting you started, try 180-220,000 USD just to turn it on legally and know it isnt going to run out of funds. The service agreement does more to add to reasons this isnt the ATM to purchase.

Tell us more about this bot keeping prices down. How do you know that and what else do you know about it?

Can someone please tell me what "taint analysis" is? I simply must know.

Hey, they just deleted my account and acted like it never existed after I told them I lost control of the associated email, so you at least have dialog. They wiped me out and ran.

Looks to be humor, sourpuss.
