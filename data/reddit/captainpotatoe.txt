Lol...you think he should try and spend his $100k of bitcoin in the real world? With the average transaction cost being over $20? I guess he will just need to buy 5000 buckets of kfc chicken. He made absolutely the right move here. Bitcoin is not at all ready for mass use and when you need to realize profits the only way to do that is convert to fiat.

This is a cringy whiny shitpost. If you think that Bitcoin can solve the issues you listed you are delusional.

I know a few wealthy people, I notice that they are more or less just as happy as I am. The one constant I see is the more they buy, the more they have to complain and worry about. I feel like if I struck it rich I would buy a modest piece of land with a reasonable house. I would avoid piling up toys for myself. If I want to go boating I would much much rather just go rent one vs owning. But at the same time I would just rather have the freedom to do what I want when I want. Wife and I want to take a 2 week motorcycle trip, leave tomorrow no problem. Want to spoil family members sure no problem.. Freedom is what I am gunning for.

Oh how naive OP is...

It baffles and angers them??? If you think that the millennial generation holds even 10% of this new market you need to check your head. Nothing will change with crypto, The rich will stay rich and the poor will stay poor

This post is about as ironic as they come.

Why is anyone impressed with these things. These are just small time investors purchasing prebuilt atms with the hope of making a profit.

Calm your tits and hold.

Just remember that there is no way that you would have held it until it hit 3k. You probably would have sold when it hit $10.
