Western Union is gonna go out of business if Bitcoin becomes mainstream.

She's not telling the truth when she says she's worried about the safety of her money being sent via money transfer. She's actually afraid of the cost of transaction fees wire transfer companies will impose on here money.
Bitcoin will eventually solve this problem.

Remember, bitcoin is supposed to be P2P. One of the main advantage of using bitcoin is removing the third party in the equation. 
But good luck to you!

$24,453,000,000 in remittances were sent to Philippines from other countries in 2012. Roughly 10% of that goes directly to companies like Western Union and Money Gram. 10% of $24,453,000,000 is around $2,446,300,000.
When you send using bitcoin, it only cost $0.05.

Steam accepts PayPal. Does this mean I can buy games on steam using bitcoin?

A large portion of the people living in the Philippines do not have bank accounts, so they have to collect their money through a western union retail store in person and have to pay an average of 9% for the western union retail store operator.

Has this issue been resolved? I can't access my account. The website is not accepting my log in credentials.

Hashprime is offline now. I wonder how many people got bamboozled and how many bitcoin was stolen. Someone should write about this. 
BTW: I'm going to move my coins away from blockchain.info. I don't think I can trust a wallet that partners itself with a scam website. So irresponsible. 
Goodbye blockchain, hello BitGo.

 I found this website on the frontpage of blockchain.info. It's one of the partners.
They should be mindful of the sites they post on their front page to prevent people from getting duped. So irresponsible.
