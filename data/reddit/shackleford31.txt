The online bank Simple is great for crypto. It’s free, easy to sign up for, and the app is great. It’s a division of BBVA Compass bank. Simple.com.Also worth noting,  the international transaction fee is only 1% when using your debit card for buying crypto with coinbase, which is much lower than the 3% international transaction fee many other banks charge. Coinbase uses banks in the UK to process card payments, hence the fee.

The cheapest way is to use coinbase’s GDAX exchange to send your bitcoin to any wallet you choose, because it’s free. There are no fees if you use GDAX. Just log onto GDAX.com, login with your coinbase credentials (coinbase owns GDAX so you are already registered), click “deposit” to transfer your bitcoin from coinbase to GDAX (its instant and also free), then click “withdraw” then “BTC Address” to send any amount to any wallet address you like for free. It’s a service GDAX provides for everybody, I use it multiple times a day to send BTC out for zero fees.

The latter.

Futures obviously weren’t designed for the volatility of crypto.  There are going to so many halts it’s going to be like stop n go traffic. Wild.

Can’t wait. Going to be a fun, wild, ride.

It’s a good idea, yes. For the zero fee withdrawals.

Use GDAX to transfer your funds to Bittrex to trade for altcoins, there are no fees when transferring with GDAX*

Great way to start. If it skyrockets you’ll be happy, If it dips hard, you’ll only be out a few bucks ����

Use Third party API apps to trade on your phone, there are many. Cool thing is, they are often faster than the exchanges websites. I use the this now-discontinued iOS app called TB Bittrex to trade cryptos on my iPhone all day long. Works great. There are a few similar ones out there on the App Store. Careful for phishing scams.

Use Gemini, it is a US based exchange just like coinbase/GDAX. Very easy to use. Happy trading :)

It’ll get there. Eventually. You’re good though. Just wait.

The game plan is HODL.

Use GDAX, there are no transfer fees.

It works great. I’ve had mine since August and I pay my monthly bills with it. Uber with it, get cash from ATM’s. Cash back at the store, etc. Very convenient. You can set it to withdraw from any of your CB wallets so if you feel like paying with your litecoin, ETH, or bcash stash, you can.

Not much, $10-$15 max? Only one way to find out..

Nobody knows. Futures where supposed to “tame volatility”, but it’s been an even crazier epic roller coaster since then.

Investing that amount in a series of low-minimum ICO’s can turn it into several thousand worth of USD. Easily. Tons of people doing it on YouTube, check it out. I’ve done it, it works. Thanks especially to the explosion of lending coin ICO’s.

There are no transaction fees when paying with the Shift card since everyone’s coinbase funds are off-chain. The guy was mistaken and/or spreading FUD.

Buy a larger amount of bitcoin, like $500, transfer to copay wallet, set fee to super economy, then send total amount GDAX exchange where you can send to any address for zero fees all you want. (US Customers only I believe)
