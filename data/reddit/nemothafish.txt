Amazing! I would totally love to be a part of something like this. Sounds exciting. I think I wouldn’t have a chance though since I’m in Taiwan. Lol. I still want to say that you are awesome to consider this! Thanks for being awesome!

Thank you for the information. I am not sure exactly why it is that way though. Referral or not, I still recommend checking them out. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:24:41
I did actually get it. I enjoyed it as well. Lol thanks for the clarifying support though. Haha. Great movie!

There are several different "exchanges" used around the world. You will need to find one that is from your location. 
Once you have an exchange, you will need to set up an account. 
After you set up an account you will need to become "verified" with that exchange. They will ask for personal information such as bank account and government issued ID. 
After you have been verified, then you will be able to buy bitcoin from that exchange company. 
The exchange will provide 2 different addresses. One address will be a private address, which you should never share with anyone. Keep it secret, keep it safe. The other address will be a public address, which others will use to send you bitcoin. It is okay to share this one. 
When is a good time to buy in? Right now, yesterday, last week. Just do it. Bitcoin is a gamble, but some trust it enough to say that it will continue to rise over time. 
If you have more questions, I strongly suggest not using /bitcoin, but rather /bitcoinbeginners. Good luck!

I didn't buy BTC solely for profit. I believe in the system. Now.. if I make a few thousand dollars off my purchases... I will not complain.

I understand your argument... but... only 21 million will exist and the theory is that once all the BTC is mined, it will begin to "trickle down" into all corners of the world. Yes, in the beginning there will be very wealthy individuals who control the majority of it, but eventually it will make its way around.

When did you first buy into Bitcoin? Just curious due to the question.

Not 101K? 為什麼?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:54:48
LOL are we talking like 10 year old smart nephews or like the 20 year old smart nephews? If they are that smart, and smart enough to care about technology, then why don't the 20 year old smart nephews already know? Also, what about the smart nieces? Do they get a chance as well? Thanks for the response! Keep HODLing

I feel that this article was not written due to a governmental request. I imagine that the author wrote this because he has his hands deep in someone's pockets, who's fearing the potential of what Bitcoin and the Blockchain has.

My guess would be that they buy more crypto currency cheaper than they sell it to you, pay for their mining fees, or pay for the utility fees to run the machine. Also probably includes some profit for the owner of the ATM. That is, unless the ATM is directly connected to an exchange some how. The "atms" here in Taiwan, which are not really ATMs, but rather a kiosk that serves more purposes than just to sell BTC, are directly connected to an exchange that is used here in Taiwan. When you "buy" from the kiosk, it creates an account for the email you input. If you are making your second (or more) purchase from the kiosk, it will just use the same account associated with the email you used, and tie the coins you bought to that account. Sorry if this is unclear... I was kind of thinking, typing and rambling at the same time.

I did this too, about three weeks ago. I only traded .01 btc. I sold the .01, expected a dip, then bought it back at an increased price of $300USD/1BTC... I learned my lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:46:02
Okay! I have honestly never watched a single episode of that show. Now that I have been enlightened, I will begin with season 1, episode 1. Thanks for that! I'm taking your post into cooperation.

Someone is always listening. Please understand that your life is far more valuable than anything in this universe. I wish you well my friend. Don't evaluate your life based off of some monetary value, but rather the people around you, the air you breath, the chances that you get each day and even the things you might miss out on. Sometimes those "missed chances" make the best stories for others to learn from in the future. You have a story to share, so be around to share it with the right person when they need you. You are needed.  Don't consider Bitcoin, or any amount of any kind of money as your only chance for success. Success comes in many different forms.

Several of my coworkers began hearing me speak about BTC earlier in the year. Price began to rise, then several of my coworkers began asking me about BTC. Price rose even more, seveal of my coworkers began asking me how much I have gained off my BTC and then asked me when they should buy. Price rose even more, several of my coworkers began asking me how to buy their own BTC, price rose even more. Several of my coworkers actually bought BTC, price rose some more. They became more interested and continued to buy small amounts, price rose even more.... and then it began to go down. Now, everyone that I have spoken to has sold their BTC. I laugh, they think I am crazy. Oh well, BTC is on sale and I'm buying even more. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:17:58
I have only spent my "drinking" money each month. So if it does crash, it would be unfortunate, but it wouldn't break me. I have been buying a little each month for the past 5 months, so I haven't done bad, but still would suck. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:27:05
I didn't buy the dip... :( I had to work. I was trying to make money by working. I could have made money by "not working"....

"Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy."

I am not a pro on the topic, so take what I advise with some caution. I would recommend not buying 500 worth in the beginning. Instead, maybe just start buying 100 each week or each month. I suggest this since you are a college student and your funds might be tight. I try to keep the rule of thumb to not spend money that I would be upset about losing. I actually buy a little at a time and it has actually paid off for me pretty well so far. I have bought at some higher times and also bought in the dips. I would think of this as a safer way to "invest". Good luck either way!

I'm a teacher, and I am not asking for a handout. I am going to suggest though, that you go find a random teacher at a title 1 school near you (If you are not in the states, this basically means a school that is located in a low socioeconomic area. "Poverty"). Donate to them. Help a teacher out so they can help a child out. Good on you sir for your kindness.

So if, by chance, Bitcoin were to drop in value to let's say $100 USD, would they then be obligated to sell the house for $4,000 USD? I guess they could just decide to take it off the market. ..
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:41:28
So Facebook or Reddit didn't consume your life before Bitcoin? Or, did Bitcoin just replace another addiction?

I am not really educated enough on the topic to form a valid response, but I will agree with you that it does look shady. I'm sure that if there is any foul play, we will hear about it soon enough.

That’s amazing! When I first heard about bitcoin, I too wanted to get involved. That was around 2011.  I unfortunately made excuses due to being a broke college student. I was over loaded with assignments, which drove down my ability to research the information needed to learn about Bitcoin, and I was short on money due to paying for expensive college classes and living necessities. The dream of becoming “educated” in the US is definitely designed to keep Americans in debt. Today, I am proud to say that I am now putting a little amount each month into Bitcoin. I chose to become a teacher and am now $50,000 in debt to the US government, but I am not making excuses any longer for not investing.
