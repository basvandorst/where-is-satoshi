Bitcoin is not really a set of items/tokens/coins.  It's really just a public ledger, which is maintained by a large peer-to-peer network.  The network itself is the final authority.  Approximately every 10 minutes, a "block" is added on to the end of the ledger.  These blocks list transactions that the network has accepted.  The way these blocks are constructed/verified is somewhat tricky, but very important.
I suggest you check out the original white paper, it's not too hard to get through: 
If you want a gentler introduction: 


What actually gets stored are private encryption keys.  They can be stored digitially, on a physical device, or in your memory.  Bitcoins themselves are really just entries in the public ledger (the "blockchain")


There's no reason people couldn't, en masse, abandon the platform.  This would cause the BTC/USD exchange rate to fall, and that would create price inflation.  But it would not create any more bitcoins.

Thanks for reading.  I'm not exactly a bitcoin fanatic, though I do think it's fascinating.

Bitcoin may not be immune to inflation.  But the specific mechanism you particularly described (Some unknown actor just issuing a bunch of coins and causes hyperinflation) is impossible by design.  
The problem of an unreliable/unaccountable issuer of currency is one of the fundamental problems bitcoin provably solves.
Again, if you don't have a basic literacy in some area, you should probably refrain from making claims.


In this case, bitcoin *is* exempt from a particular set of risks.  Namely, that of an unreliable/unaccountable issuer.


After having tried to parse that sentence, I no longer accept your claim that you're a professor of anything.  And, what sort of economist misspells "currencies"?
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:27:55
Sorry if I misread your English.
I'm all for a careful discussion of the issues.  I was only making a very specific critique.  Your claim that some unreliable/unaccountable individual could issue bitcoin at will.  While it's generally true for most other currencies (at least those not backed by gold), it's not true, explicitly and by design, for bitcoin.  This is the reason that bitcoin fans often refer to any currency other than bitcoin as a fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:25:12
Well, the "true believers" around here think that bitcoin is going to become the dominant currency in the world (or at least a very important one).
If you believe that will happen, then you would naturally be long on bitcoin.  If 50% of global transactions were made in bitcoin, you'd have less than 21 million units of currency representing half of all global economic activity.
I don't know how economists compare the size of the money supply to the volume of economic activity, but I'm sure you guys have some models.  If you assume 21MM bitcoins, and some % of global trade denominated in bitcoins, I suspect you can come up with some approximation of the fair value of 1 BTC.  
If you assume the 21MM will be constant, and that the % stays constant, then as global economic activity grows, bitcoin should experience price deflation proportional to the %, right?
Or something like that.  I'm not an economist, and I don't understand those models very well.  But that's the general gist -- and also a frequent criticism of bitcoin: that it's inherently deflationary, and therefore badly-suited for use as currency, since people will prefer hoarding to spending or lending.

Jokes aside, it sounds like bitstamp can't find the deposit because "whoops pounds/dollars/exchange-rates".  
Hopefully bitstamp figures it out and goes more towards "always".  But it's unfair to place the blame entirely on bitstamp when: a) OP admits he fucked what currency to spend, and b) this is a transaction involving banks.
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:49:05
I didn't say it means nothing.  I said you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the technical underpinnings of bitcoin so profound that it has led you make absurd claims.  You might be forgiven, since you claim expertise in economics, and not mathematics or computer science.  
As a professor, though, you should know better than to make such ill-informed pronouncement, no matter the topic.

I signed up just to check them out, and got the .1 BTC they were offering.  Tried to transfer it out, it went unconfirmed, and timed out.  Now my account shows no transactions at all, and a zero balance.
I haven't tried emailing them, since it was just a little promotional .1 BTC, but it does make me less-than-confident about using them for anything real.
@_date: 2012-03-05 06:04:14
If the BTC holders are upset, they can only blame themselves.  
They traded control for lower overhead.  Furthermore, if they had done more (like encrypting their wallets on disk), they would have kept their bitcoins.


I have a bunch of servers at linode.  Based on the available information, I'm very confident none of them were tampered with, since none of them have been re-booted recently.

That is true, but only because the attackers were interested in bitcoins.  From what linode has posted publicly, the attackers had the power to root each and every linode.  The fact that they chose to attack only BTC related servers was completely incidental.

Right, but until you redeemed the it, the note didn't refer to any specific, physical, gold.  It referred to whatever gold you might happen to receive when you turned in the note.
The Romulan Safe is kind of interesting.  If the atoms were scrambled, then whatever was put in the safe *does not exist*, so it's absurd to demand that someone produce that non-existant item.  If you compel that person to operate the safe, you're literally asking them to create the very evidence you expect to convict them with -- which appears clearly violative of the 5th Amendment.  So yes, the Romulan safe is pretty good analogy.
So then you ask, "if we treat the key-safe this way, why should a different kind of safe (romulan) be treated differently?"  The answer is that just because we refer to both of them as "safes", they are actually two very different devices, that do two totally different things.  One of them is a locked container, and the other is an encryption device. 
The middle road, as I think I mentioned before is a combination safe.  While there isn't any binding precedent, the Supreme court has suggested in other rulings that there is, in fact, a distinction:
[Why criminals should always use combination safes](
So it's far from settled, but at least those of us who find the idea of forced decryption unsettling in the shadow of the 5th Amendment appear to not be completely nuts.

I'm withholding judgment for a few days.  The status.linode.com post is certainly thin on details, but it smells like an initial statement.  I've been very happy with Linode for a few years, and fully expect that they're still analyzing the compromise, reviewing their security policies, and implementing changes.
Doing those things, and doing them right, takes time.  They became aware of the breach on Thursday, so it's been about 48 hours.  I'll give them another 72 to get everything sorted, then write and post a sufficiently detailed explanation.
Now, that's just my tolerance, and yours might be different.
But I am curious what would have been an acceptable timetable, to you, for linode to make a comprehensive public announcement.
@_date: 2012-02-24 01:13:03
That is not more apt.  A key is physical.
The best analogy I can think of is this:
The police arrest Joey the Bookie, and seize his book as evidence.  However, his book is full of what looks like gibberish.  The police conclude that he has some system for recording bets that they can't figure out.  The prosecutor asks the judge to order Joey to decrypt his notes.
IANAL, and AFAIK, there's no case that goes like that.  But it's not really at all like opening a safe.  The contents of the drive are there for all to see.  It's just that nobody knows what they mean except the defendant.
@_date: 2012-02-26 19:00:17
It wasn't the introduction of fiat money.  Even under the gold standard, currency was a physical analog for some abstract quantity of gold.  The currency didn't represent specific gold, as the gold in the vault was fungible.  


No, only the safe scenario relies on "opening a locked door".  The fundamental misunderstanding at play here is that encrypting data is like putting it in a safe. 


Stop lumping safes and encryption together.  In the case of encryption, you are, literally, compelling someone to "reproduce self incriminating material", while in the safe scenario you aren't.  This is exactly the difference between the two, and one reason that the safe/key analogy fails.


This is my point.  Forcing someone to divulge a password used as an encryption key (or forcing them to decrypt the data for the court) is a lot more like demanding a combination or the reproduction of self-incriminating material than it is to compelling them to produce a physical key or grant access to a physical safe.
@_date: 2012-02-25 06:13:34
Respectfully, you're exactly backwards about money.  Money is a representation of value -- an entirely abstract thing.  Currency (what you're actually talking about) is a physical analog for an idea (money).  Money (the non-physical one) is arguably the real thing.  Slips of paper are just an accounting aid. 
For instance, an entity (generally a government) might at some point retire some kind of currency.  They'll announce that you have to come trade it in for the new stuff, and if you fail to do so before some particular date (let's call it "D"), the currency you're holding will become worthless, as it will be divorced from the money it represents.  The act of changing the currency does not mean that all debts (money) disappear.  If you owe me $10 at D-1, you still owe me $10 (payable in the new currency, which is now the only valid tender) at D+1.
And I maintain my little story about the bookie is the better analogy, because, well, it's actually closer.  The fact that the digital encryption is stronger, faster, and automated, doesn't change it from being coded information into a physical object.  
If the court can't compel the bookie to interpret his chicken-scratch, then it ought not be able to compel the owner of an encrypted hard drive to supply either the information necessary to decrypt it, nor the decrypted contents.

Account setup went fine. I received my .1, and tried to withdraw it to my master wallet.  It sat pending for a while.  blockchain.info show the transaction as unconfirmed.  So, there were two transactions in my transaction log.
Today, coinbase shows a zero balance and empty transaction log.
Clearly, something isn't working as intended.
@_date: 2012-03-05 16:26:52
Well, technically, you can, but you have to decrypt it first. 
If any of the victims had constructed a system where the wallet is only decrypted to memory (say at system startup, requiring someone to provide a password via the console), and only persisted to disk in encrypted form, this attack would have been foiled.
I'm not saying that the above kind of setup was at all obvious, and it isn't without drawbacks (it's inconvenient to have to go get on the console in order to boot your VPS, etc).  But had someone thought to do it, they would've avoided the loss of BTC.
I'm very upset about the incident, and am preparing to move a bunch of services away from linode in the event that they don't provide a more thorough public response in the next day or two.
But HighBeamHater's post was incorrect on several points, and rather hyperbolic.

Mined coins aren't free.  Say you have $100 to spend on either mining, or buying BTC.  If someone says that "mining is unprofitable", they mean that you'll get more BTC by buying them directly.

I'm not sure, but regular, non-hyper, inflation seems like a good thing to me.  I think I'd rather have constant, moderate inflation than constant moderate deflation.

No, I'm saying that one can argue that the majority controls US monetary policy, too.  We could leverage the democratic process and go back to the gold standard, or adopt BTC as legal tender.
I have nothing against the project.  I think it's an important thing.  I never said it was without merit.  I just criticized OP's stupid jingoistic "PR" piece.
I think anti-central-banking gold-buggery is, as best, preaching to the choir, and at worst actually counter-productive.
@_date: 2011-11-03 08:35:08
That's fairly true, but so what? 
I mean, the Fed/US Government "controls" USD insofar as they could inflate the hell out of it -- but it's terribly unlikely they would.
They could also outlaw (or impose draconian regulation upon) the internet, which would be bad news for bitcoin (for anyone in the US)

Bitcoins are certainly not asset-backed.  The bitcoin system is simply a big, incredibly-hard-to-forge, shared ledger.
If we did have an asset-backed currency (or if we just used gold as currency), my point would still stand:  Deflation sucks unless you have more currency than debt.

I'm not advocating for Satoshi to be identified.  I just think the notion that s/he'll immediately be "smeared as a terrorist, criminal, pedophile, or weirdo" doesn't track.  Where are the smear pieces about Andresen et al?
Yes, as bitcoin grows in significance, the powers that be will try to regulate it, just like they have the internet.  Just like they did with encryption in the 90s.  And while they DOJ did harass Phil Zimmerman for a few years, nothing ever came of it.  They certainly didn't smear him in the press as a weirdo. They investigated him for breaking a (dumb) law that he may well have broken, and in the end, they left him alone.
I'm sorry for calling names, but there's so much big-brother paranoia in the bitcoin community, and I don't think it's healthy.  If that sort of paranoid talk continues to be the public face of bitcoin, there's a real chance that it'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  It's not to say your concerns aren't valid, but when the community so regularly talks in such adversarial terms, you're just giving ammo to anyone who wants to call you paranoid anti-government weirdo fundamentalists.

If you want something to go mainstream, it's silly to talk like a fundamentalist.  Bitcoin fundamentalists, to the casual observer, are indistinguishable from the libertarian fringe.

I was with you that far, but I thought you were talking about bitcoin proponents who think big brother is panicing and about to bring down the iron fist.
Then I realized that you were paranoid and saw threats everywhere.
Yes, governments will try to to regulate any currency that becomes widely adopted.  They'll certainly keep an eye on any emergent tech.  
But, I mean, look at the linked article!  It's bunch of obviously out-of-context quotes posted on the internet by "the proud CEO of ForexMinute.com, the brand new financial news portal which is making waves", who runs the site which is transparently pro-bitcoin.
Given the source, I don't believe that all of a sudden big brother is freaking out.  It seems much more likely that some guy named Jonathan Millet set up an ugly website to try to spread FUD, for whatever reason.
