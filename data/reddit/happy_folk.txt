Unless Im missing something, I definitely have a 10k sell limit per week on Coinbase.

I’ve been wondering lately - where are people buying/selling large amounts of crypto? As far as I’m aware, Coinbase and the like have limits of ~10k per week.

Holy cow! How does one do that?

How long has it been like this? I did the Dwolla to CampBX about 2 weeks ago and after I bought ~5 coins I sent them pretty much immediately to my wallet. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:57:28
Damn. What does it say? Can you sell them or are they completely locked?

I like CampBX... but I don't have any experience with anything else but getting coins locally. From my beginning (3 months ago I got into bitcoins), I had been wary of MtGox and heard a lot of negative stuff so I never bothered.
It's super easy to go from your bank to Dwolla to CampBX. You have to give Dwolla some personal information, obviously, because you're tying your bank account to it. It took about 3-4 days (maybe a week?) to tie my bank to Dwolla. You basically give Dwolla your account number and routing number (found on your checks), and they deposit a small amount into your account (like 3 cents) and you simply just tell them how much they deposited. It's no different than opening a PayPal account. 
Once you're hooked up with Dwolla, it takes about another 3-4 business days for a transfer from your bank account to Dwolla. I transfered the money from my bank to Dwolla, then from Dwolla to CampBX. It takes about 6 hours for money to move from Dwolla to CampBX, I believe. Now I that I had money on CampBX, and I did a market order and it got filled within a minute. As soon as I saw that my orders went through, I used CampBX to send my coins to my online wallet. 
There are limitations of CampBX, of course.. I'm not verified on CampBX so I'm not allowed to transfer anymore than $1000 USD per day, which is fine by me. To transfer more, I believe you have to send them a photocopy of your ID and whatnot. In terms of its user interface, it works for me, I'm not a day trader or anything and don't plan on buying/selling often. 
If you're looking just to buy some bitcoins to have, maybe just look into LocalBitCoins. It's basically like the Craigslist of bitcoins.. you meet a stranger in a public place, make the trade and you're off on your way.

Did you even read the post? I made huge gains but have only converted my initial investment plus a little back into fiat. I'm curious how I prove to the IRS what my initial investment was vs gains with no official documentation.

Localbitcoins.com I'd say is your best bet for fast and anonymous, but you may end up paying a little more depending on your dealer. That's how I got first into the market since I really didnt want to deal with bank transfers and whatnot at first. I had a good experience:
I basically found a guy on the site who had a bunch of reviews and sent him a message saying I wanted some coins and he told me where/when we could meet. I was originally sketched out about the whole experience since I was meeting a stranger not at a public place to get a digital currency with $1000 cash on me. He had a bunch of reviews, so I took the chance and didnt ask to meet elsewhere. I do a lot of stuff on Craigslist and CouchSurfing, so meeting strangers from the internet isnt too strange for me though. We didn't use Localbitcoins escrow system which helps the transfers be more secure for both parties... he basically just uses the website as advertisement and then charges his own little fee (otherwise Localbitcoins takes a fee from both parties). 
We met up outside his "friends place" in a nice neighborhood. It was raining so he got in my car. We agreed on Market Price + 4.5% commission (is that a good deal?), so he took out his phone, and calculated the number of bitcoins for my $1000. He rounded the number up and sent me the coins. I checked on my phone and sure enough it popped up on my Coinbase app. I handed over the fat stack of bills and we talked about bitcoins for awhile. Overall a good transaction. 
So if you find a dealer in your area, it's probably the most anonymous and fastest way. You could get bitcoins within an hour if the person is available. I think most other FAST ways would require you to sign up for a special bank account (Like the CapitalOne P2P?) or use MoneyGram or such. 
The other way I've done it was use CampBX, Dwolla and my bank. Dwolla sends two small amounts of money to my bank (a few cents) and after ~3 days it showed up and I verified the amounts with Dwolla. Now I had verified my bank account with Dwolla, but to transfer money from my bank to Dwolla took almost a week. From Dwolla to CampBX it took about 20 minutes, and then the market order was pretty much instantaneous. Dwolla asked me some multiple choice questions when I wanted to send me the money, like "Which zip code have you lived in the last 5 years?", but nothing too crazy like social security. I'm not verified on CampBX so I won't be able to take more than $1000 out of the site per day, but I'm not dealing with large amounts of money so I dont care. 
So that's my experience, hope it helps.

Just got an email from Coinbase saying that the coins were sent, but still nothing at all on Blockchain. I guess it's been slow?

Invest 1,000 into Bitcoin. Now it's worth 20,000. I convert my initial investment plus 500 little into fiat, so 1,500 deposited in my account. 500 is my gains.
So for that 500, do I literally just say "I made 500 on an investment" with no documentation? Do I do that now or when I file my taxes?

Fastest and easiest way, IMO, is using 
Find a seller in your area that has some ratings, email him, meet up at a convenient place, make sure he sends the coins, hand him the cash. I did this to get into the market and the time from sending the dealer an email to having bitcoins in my wallet was about 4 hours. 
It's no different than buying/selling something on Craigslist. 
The only other painless way I know of is Bank to Dwolla to CampBX, but that takes about a week to be all said and done. 
EDIT: by local exchanges, did you mean meeting up with sellers? Woops.

I can't help but be filled with regret when it comes to the stock market and Bitcoin. "Why didn't I invest all my money in the stock market at XYZ!" Well, because at that time who knows what would've happened. That's why there are good investors and bad investors.. Those that make a killing and those that lose everything.
Still though, had a CS major friend mentioned Bitcoin to me 3 years ago and showed me how to set it up, I probably would've put 50 or 100 bucks in just for kicks. I could've bought a condo in Seattle now! Oh well.
