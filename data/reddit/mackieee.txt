Gamblers, the exchanges are the casinos.

That's it! Broken the seal! Just like the first piss after ~~2 beers~~ 5 beers!

No. Far from it.

On IG (A UK Stockbroker) records the the mid price on 18th Dec was 10798.. we've not even broken that yet - no need to fear!

That was a sharp drop on the 5 minute candle :(

Maybe that's exactly why Bitcoin is the price it is..

$75,000 would probably be able to buy enough land for a shed. 
A shed.

This is insane :o
Support at 16k? If that falls through..

Now surely this would decrease supply of available Bitcoins coming onto the market.. Hence should have a positive effect on the price?

It’s deemed as a soft paywall. Financial Times do this too.

I didn't realise the transaction/volumes were that low against the ATH. Thanks for sharing.

Have you got "Mid" as your candle/line measure or Bid/Ask?
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:05:01
Exactly, if it ever got to a point - companies raising money purely from ICO’s. Feds would step in - that’s what China did!

It’s incredibly easy to trade on a bull market too. Hence why so many jumped on the BTC wagon on the way up. There wasn’t any technical knowledge required.

If you threw $1,000 overboard into the sea or into a fire - it was still ledger that was part of a transaction (Shop keeper gave it you.. or withdrew from the ATM). However now lost or destroyed - how is this any different?

Hello Bid again.. It's felt like the hundredth time you've hit this price!

Don't worry, there's a [film that's got you covered](
