LOL i like that line "WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK" lol it describes perfectly my feelings right now.  i finally decide to buy bitcoin and its nearly fucking impossible.

also everywhere that seems to be willing to do it instantly is using Simplex which has a $10 minimum fee, again ridiculous if I just need only $20 worth of btc.  that will last me a year for what I am using it for,  so it's again totally ridiculous.

That's my point exactly.  He claims to be a tech guru and expert, but all he is is a rich boy who got lucky on an investment.

Awesome now just convince everyone that lightning is not a shitcoin and maybe one day his retail business will have someone pay with it.

It's a comedic-opinion piece.  I am not some kind of journalist and don't expect a pulitzer.  Sounds like you could use a sense of humor yourself.  
 Or maybe go masturbate sometime.  Sounds like you need it with all the masturbation and circle jerking in your comment. LOL Cheers, mate.

The "state of the bitcoin community" lmao get over yourself.  Reddit is such a shit-hole corner of the web I think you could combine every reddit user on earth and that would not equal the 'state of the bitcoin community' LMAO give me a break.
I am the OP,  and I wrote the article on Medium that I quoted here...  and my article wasn't based on a meme,  it was based on a recent more in-depth interview he did on another Crypto-focused news site.

None of what you said further proves decentralization, actually does the opposite.

Obviously. But way off from what Satoshi intended, I believe.

excellent info ur a goldmine my friend
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:33:52
Thank you!!
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:31:18
Actually you are so wrong.

Interesting thanks for the tidbit of inside info, definitely helps clear up the confusion in my mind. 
It's interesting to see so many claims of early developers,  but to me, as a developer,  it's still very un-clear.
For example,  the forum post you mention by Hal says:
"When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them."
To me this sounds like Hal is the VERY next person to even see, or use,  or "develop"  butcoin.    Was Hal not an actual developer then?   Was it true that Hal was first "user" of bitcoin but not a developer on the project?  
Does this mean that Satoshi had development help before this first release and use?  
Thanks again for helping me get the timeline straight it's very interesting indeed.

You my friend are truly awake.

Sounds real nice but in reality this is not how it works.  The last 100 changes to btc core have been made without asking anyone and with zero 'conensus'  hence my point, the old way is no more, it's been taken over.
@_date: 2019-12-12 23:05:44
or am i wrong? trying to get the facts straight and the internet is confusing.
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:29:44
Excellent, finally someone who gets it.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:11:47
oh yeah i have full custody and found uot from crowmining.com it can be sold

If you set the roadmap, you are controlling it. This "mess or chaos' is highly controlled since every "roadmap" choice is chosen by 2 or 3 top developers.
