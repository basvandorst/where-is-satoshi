When talking about the horrors of bitcoin for businesses -- volatility, illiquidity -- they seem unaware of bitpay and coinbase.  They also seem to assume that bitcoin will never get more liquid, nor less volatile.

So let me see if I get it.  The worry is that people will borrow Rupees, exchange them for bitcoin, driving the price of Rupees down.  If enough people do this, the central bank and IMF simply cannot support the price of Rupees by buying, and the value of Rupees crashes.  Then the attackers exchange bitcoins back to pay off their Rupee-based debt?
Not sure I follow the attack strategy, since it seems to me when you go to pay back your Rupee debt, you have to buy Rupees with bitcoins, and doing so will drive the price of Rupees right back up.  But I'm probably missing something about the setup.
In any case, the bottom line is that such an attack is possible.  If central banks and the IMF held btc, they could support fiat buy selling btc for fiat during attacks... is that the idea?
If that's really a strategy of central banks, that is super bullish.

Very good point. This is what JP Morgan did in '29, and it's what the Fed does as well.  But it is a bit of a collective action problem.  Who are the biggest BTC owners and will they co-operate and all "fall on their swords" together (meaning, no one actually does)?  Or will some buy and others sell, and the price drops anyway, only some get out and some don't?
@_date: 2011-06-18 09:23:16

The risk may pay off I'm proud to have bought at today's low point: 20.1.  Not sure what my average price in was per BTC, but somewhere around 24.  So it wasn't a total disaster.

Or, more accurately, how many dollars, or bitcoins, are being offered.  One hedge fund manager could wipe out the whole market, in either direction.

Fees instituted to get some profit for the site as people cash out during the crash, which is all they can do with btc.  Buying makes no sense whatsoever if you're Chinese.

LOL.  So, China news is irrelevant.  What we should rely on is chart voodoo?
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:46:51
At departure deposit $1,200 @ $120 / BTC -3% ATM fee ($36).  Price drops to $90 over the course of your flight.  Withdraw equivalent of $864 in Euros at arrival -3% fee: $838.  Yeah, that's excellent.
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:32:45
Wait, so if you have a lot of btc, you just play it at the last second and take all of the money on the other side?  And if you have a small amount, you place and hope?

Satoshi-like, but also Perelman-like.  Great story, even if it's not bitcoin proper.

Do you think this is stable and long-term?  Or has the government just not gotten around to calling these smaller processors into a back room and forbidding them as well?  
Why would the government allow small unknown payment processors to do something they've already said the big ones cannot do?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:25:37
I never understand this argument.  Let's see how it goes:
1. Bitcoin is deflationary, e.g., it goes up in value over time.
2. People won't spend deflationary currency, but save it instead.
3. Therefore, people won't spend bitcoins.
4. If bitcoin isn't spent, then it won't work as a currency.
5. Therefore, bitcoin won't work as a currency.
6. If bitcoin won't work as a currency, then its price will go down.
7. Therefore, its value will drop to nothing.
But wait.  Didn't premise 1 say the price will only go up?  If 1 is true, then 7 is false.  If 7 is true, then 1 is false.  How is this argument supposed to work?
Deflationary currencies will be spent *less* than inflationary currencies.  It doesn't follow that they won't be spent.  If bitcoin is spent less than dollars, does that mean its value is nothing?  NO!  Worries about the deflationary nature of the coin, and hoarding of bitcoin does not take its value to nothing.  And if it did, then guess what, people would want to spend it again, because it is clearly NOT deflationary.
The argument is self-defeating.  In fact, deflationary currencies have competing pressures, and as they swing in value, they are more or less likely to be spent.  It is not as simple as DEFLATIONARY -&gt; INCREASING VALUE -&gt; NO SPEND -&gt; NO VALUE -&gt; INFLATIONARY

This is the bull scenario.  The bear scenario is that everywhere else will succumb to finance-sector pressure and regulate in similar ways. 
We see now the dependence of btc on a benevolent state.

I'm impressed by the website and the clarity of this guy's writing.  Maybe the Foundation should sit down with him over coffee.

I had a talk with a clueless macro economist last week, and it filled me with hope, even with all the FUD coming out of China, Norway, etc.  He was worried about counterfeiting "the bitcoins" or nefarious schemes built into the software by its shady authors.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:59:27
BTC enthusiasts need to make up their minds.  Are they ready to be outlaws and "defeat" governments and banks?  Or do they want to persuade govenrnments and banks to peacefully co-exist?  
You can't have it both ways, people!
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:27:31
Fastest and easiest way to get started.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:02:29
yeah, the price would go up on remaining bitcoins not on the order book.  coinholders would be richer, but the currency would be no worse off, on the whole.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:06:37
Congrats.  Now just try not to panic when the price goes down... or up.  Wait for the infrastructure to develop and actually try to help existing bitcoin businesses grow.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:45:52
Open source isn't inherently secure, but this particular code is sitting there on github and lots and lots of experts have examined it.  If the code itself were going to screw you over, someone would have noticed it.  It's the  source of paper wallet production.  Chances of corruption of that source code are really low.
As for 2, can't you just cut and paste the code from github?  Would cut-paste itself be corrupted somehow?
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:09:33
I don't think btc will take off in any major 1st-world nation, as they are all too tightly controlled by the banks.  Rather, look to Panama, Honduras, Kenya, etc.  If the experiment is successful and bitcoin proves itself over time as a reliable means of exchange, with a more settled price, expect some bold policy makers to break the stranglehold of banker money and reap the rewards of efficiency.  But that could take 10-15 years.  
I'm going to wait it out, but that's because I "invested" only what I could afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:46:26
Don't mine.  It will cost you a lot and pay nothing.  Take what little money you have and buy some bitcoins through localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:35:49
Governments and banks.  In particular, I think they won't outlaw it, or even tax it in the US, but they'll feel they're not doing their job if they don't create new regulatory hurdles.  Additionally, they will try blacklisting and statistically tracking all expenditures.
Also, *centralization*.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:58:55
The code is open source, so as long as you are offline when you run it, it's secure.
How do you check balance?  Blockchain.info.  The address is public.  Only the key is private.
How do you spend from it?  You have to enter your key (cut-and-past, or scan the QR code with your phone and the blockchain.info app).  When you enter the key, you can spend from blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:46:49
If I'm wrong about this, the jesus, maybe I should just cash out of fucking bitcoin.  I can't do 18-step security shit, and general public can't be expected to either.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:00:58
That is so complicated.  No need to use the brainwallet.  Just use the encrypted wallet.  The encryption is hard to break even for short passwords, as was demonstrated here by a challenge.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:49:06
If you can't deposit and withdraw to the exchanges, how is that good news?  It's all bad, as far as I can tell.  BTC is black-market only after the new year.

There has to be a dedicated app with a wallet you pre-load.
Use the .gps on your phone.  The price comes up for the spots around you and you click on one to purchase through the parking app.  Meter maids have the app too and can see which spots are taken.
Also, this allows variable rate parking so spots get more expensive as the slots fill.

The news from China is definitely enough to explain the drop.  Given that you can't deposit via the payment processors in China, it's a wonder the price hasn't dropped near zero.  You can only take RMB out, but can put BTC in.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:11:57

When it will either go to $10,000 or $.10 in five years, yeah, $850 is closer to the high number, and therefore safer.  Paradoxical, yet true.
@_date: 2013-05-07 18:04:01
I can't believe the price is still above $100, after this news.  If regulators target BTC, they will make it unprofitable to run an exchange, require record-keeping of ordinary merchants,  make taxes nightmarishly complicated, etc.  I am bullish, long-term, but in the short term, this should at least scare prices below $50 so I can buy some.  Why hasn't that happened?
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:03:45
This may be a result of their *mandatory savings*.

@_date: 2013-11-20 19:56:10
Of course, banks do not want you opting out of fiat currency.  Don't be surprised if they make it difficult, along with their government lackeys.
But you can *easily* get bitcoins.  Go to localbitcoins.com.  Buy some bitcoins from an actual human being, face-to-face.  Not all transactions have to happen online; there's a real world out there, and people who want to sell to you.
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:27:13
Well, there are a lot of stories about looming regulation.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:01:25
They have to hedge against that risk with futures.  And that will cost the customer, ultimately.  I don't see how this could be profitable.  Risk management would have to be cheaper than the efficiency gains of bitcoin, and I don't think they could be, given the wild swings in price of btc.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:18:22
great idea.  volume is all that matters.  preev should do this, at least.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:56:50
Right.  Embargo is the big threat.
As for taxes/regulation, I agree too, but the taxes under consideration are standard VAT, which would kill bitcoin effectively, since it needs velocity and retaxing every exchange point would be prohibitive.

Enough smaller nations who have nothing to lose by loose regulations / taxes on btc and it might gain momentum.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:01:32
For $1 billion, you could just buy enough mining equipment for 51%.  Much cheaper, and I can't believe the banks, NSA, and China haven't already done this.  $1b is nothing to them, compared to the threat bitcoin poses to the world order.  Why hasn't it happened yet?
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:21:27
We also have ominous news on the regulation front as a counterbalance.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:02:08
No.  It may go to the 200's in the short term.  China has essentially banned it and is blocking withdrawals.  When the world processes this, the markets will continue to tumble.  Why or how anyone can buy btc in china on the exchange is beyond me.  And those exchanges were the majority of volume.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:45:08
Paper wallet is easy.  Go to bitaddress.org.  It's open source code.  Once you load the page, go offline and run the javascript to create addresses and keys.  Print, and if you like, save a .pdf file in your dropbox, and be done with it.

The value of bitcoin is its utility to users of bitcoin.  It is useful as an efficient means of transferring wealth, as an inflation-proof store of wealth, as a semi-anonymous means of doing business in ways that thwart onerous regulations, e.g., currency controls.
Tulips were not divisible or transmissible in the same way, nor was gold.  Bitcoin is just GOOD MONEY.  And that is the source of its value.
Btw, the only concept of value I understand is the amount someone is willing to pay.  What other notion of value do you have in mind?
