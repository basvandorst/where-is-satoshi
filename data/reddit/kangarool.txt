What’s the explanation? That they just set whatever exchange/market price they want? I’m not doubting you, I’m confirming it - as an experiment, I bought $100 AUS in BTC, and it sold to me at c. $16K when the worldwide rate was approx US$11 or so ... it was on coinspot. Very, very unimpressed but that’s why i experimented with such a small amount. Getting my money out of there immediately.

That is great, thanks for perspective - both balanced, and very persuasive. 
I suppose the big question in all this is time/tipping point. One, or the other, model will win if it does, or does not, persuade the majority of not just Americans, but the entire world, that there is another, better way.
Good luck to us both and thanks for your contribution.

Jesus Christ. Look at the last paragraph alone:
*“bitcoin is a highly experimental digital asset. It’s kind of like investing money in a kickstarter. You have no idea what the end result is going to look like.”*
OK. Then — 2 sentences later:
*”If you are going to invest money in bitcoins, please remember to do your research and study the graphs so that you may know where the price is headed.”*
You have no idea what the price will be. So, study ‘the graphs’ so you know what the price will be. 
And if that isn’t enough - look at his photo. 
Jesus Christ what has happened to the world. This is Forbes putting their name to this fucking shit.

That’s the problem - you didn’t specify different quantities bought initially. Most people (myself included) would assume same, like-for-like quantities purchased. 
The language you used, “buying at 17.5K and $15K...” suggests strongly that the quantity is constant.

@_date: 2017-12-17 06:16:36
I get what that would mean, but don’t necessarily agree that it is anything close to inevitable. And, more to the point - what if the exchange-and-hold-hold-hold-hold-hold behaviour, at macro, is exactly what *precludes* bitcoin from ever having hope of replacing all other currencies?
Please understand i am complete believer in all that bitcoin/blockchain could/can be — but also believe that i have a reasonable grasp of basic human behaviour and collective thinking.

Just looked at my title to this post... Hopefully I didn’t mislead in the title, I don’t mean to suggest that this article argues for bitcoin as a safe haven from bubble.
What I mean is, while everyone rushes to debate if Bitcoin is/is not ‘in a bubble’, here’s an article warning (fairly credibly, but i haven’t really explored his claims in depth yet) that the world economy is frothy at moment.
If for argument’s sake we accept this as true, it’s interesting to think about the impact it would have on adoption and uptake of Bitcoin as a safe haven. I would think a bursting economic bubble (a la 2008 events) would be the single greatest catalyst in ‘everyday people’ actually looking at how/why Bitcoin is systemically superior to fiat.
I am neither a tech nor economic expert, in totally unrelated field. But, my layman’s logic goes something like:
1) Macro economy overly exuberant and corrects”
2) Normal people lose heaps in savings, stocks, retirement funds, etc”
3) Normal people say ‘that’s it, i’m not going to let that happen ever again”
4) Network effect of Bitcoin accelerates at orders of magnitude - my mom says she’s getting some bitcoin for safety.
And this is purely within a store-of-value perspective. Presumably at the point of these events happening, scalability issues also likely sorted or greatly improved, so the Bitcoin “normal people” use case improves even more so.
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:22:55


What do you base this claim on? I think it is central to your entire argument - that it is now collective mania and destined to reverse.
I don’t understand the tech, and much of the specific language of blockchain is meaningless to me. But, I absolutely get the concepts around all of this - and buy into it. Distributed, decentralised ledgers. Digital currencies that  resolve the double-spend problem. The risks and history of fiat currencies, central banks and private banks’ actions and interests, and the notion of having full security over my own money, etc.
So, I believe I understand what is unique and innovative about blockchain and bitcoin, but couldn’t really tell you accurately the first thing about, say, ‘hashing’ (what?).
In your estimation, based on this description, did I “know” what I was buying? Would you think I’d be representative of the new buyers? I do. Because, these are fairly straightforward concepts to grasp, and I doubt too many people around the world don’t at least grasp how this is different to the housing bubble, dot-com, tulips or any other.
What do you think?

Maybe. But why would they worry about 1BTC they couldn’t afford, when it’s easier and doable to buy a ton of Satoshis and bits to spend or HODL?

He’s trying to say that Buffet’s shittalking it now in hopes of moving price way down so he can get in and scoop up tons of BTC. Not that I agree, but that’s his point. I personally don’t think he (Buffett) is going to bother with playing market-moving games on something like this, i *do* believe he values stability in the (his) system more than anything else, hence his position on bitcoin is both rational and expected, and probably genuine. We may never know.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:19:51
I understand and don’t disagree, but the model (fiat, let’s assume US$) is a) established, b)prevalent and c) inflationary currency. So it isn’t apples to apples.

True. But... when, exactly, is “the end of it all”?
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:18:43
I’d be really interested to hear that and encourage you to post. That is a good insight that hasn’t occured to me - your suggestion seems (haven’t yet thought it through), seems to be a way to actually **act** in a way that supports greater adoption, not just more theorising... good start mate.

Those are all great points, esp the last sentence. 
Only thing I don’t follow is this: “They spend it on fiat mostly”...?

I can kind of verify by pointing you to coinspot.com.au, a fairly reputable and reliable exchange. They are no longer *allowed* to receive deposits, via bank transfer, from Aussie banks.
This is their post in regard:
*Please note: We have temporarily disabled new AUD deposits. Withdrawals and buy/sell are not affected and will operate as normal. The temporary restriction on AUD deposits will remain in effect until at least the first week of the new year. AUD Withdrawals, coin deposits, buy/sell orders and trading on the platform will continue to operate as normal. We assure you we are just as unhappy with the situation as you, but unfortunately Australian banks have been so far unwilling to work with the digital currency industry which leads to frequent account closures and strict limits on accounts whilst they remain operational, in effect debanking our industry. As the demand for Bitcoin and other crypto assets skyrockets it is in everyone’s best interest to ensure we have regulated, safe and stable digital currency service providers instead of pushing Australian consumers underground, to potentially unsafe vendors. It is our purpose to drive safe adoption of crypto assets and we assure you that we will continue to work on establishing a relationship with a banking partner so we can resume accepting AUD deposits as soon as possible.*
No matter how you look at it -seems outrageous and counterproductive to the banks’ long term interests.

Much like an infinite variety of definitions for the idea of “bubble”, there are nearly as many definitions of how old “Old” is — what is ‘old’ to you?
Then I’ll tell you how ‘old’ I am.
Then we’ll compare how many bitcoin each of us hodl.

His point is more that it’s 100K people who ‘got in first’ rather than 10 banks.  No idea if this is actually true or not, but that’s what he’s saying
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:25:39
Ah, thanks that makes much more sense. I am interested in bitcoin and what it might mean in future but don’t really know anything about it at all, other than the idea of it. Are there plans in the works as you say, and if so, who/what body controls or informs such a ‘semantic’ change let’s call it... i know no one ‘controls’ bitcoin, but how would the naming conventions shift, if/when they did? Just organically and through language/usage? Thanks for your reply.

Can someone help me understand something about Bitcoin. Say that it does eventually stabilise and people are comfortable to use Bitcoin for purchases. Doesn’t the long decimal place nature of it mean it will be hard to ‘sense’ the value of something, the way you automatically can with dollar-unit currency?
What I mean is, right now, you kind of know that a pizza is worth about 5 or 10 bucks, a nice car worth $30K or whatever. But, with Bitcoin, won’t you always have to convert the price into something you can more easily intuit? 
Example: Pizza A is BTC.00091, and pizza B is .00182. Pizza B is twice as much as A, but you (well, I at least) would have to calculate every single transaction and, if not convert back to dollars to compare, then at least find some rough comparison calc that I am unlikely to be able to do in my brain, on the spot. 
Is the long decimal-place structure of bitcoin a hindrance to its uptake by the masses, even if stability is assured?

What about when the ‘outcome’ is that it slowly (or rapidly) recovers and continues to rise past your buy-in point? Is the ‘only’ smart move still to have sold out before that happens?
