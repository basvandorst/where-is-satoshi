If you're susceptible to a phishing attack you shouldn't be using bitcoins.

I know your frustration I tried buying some bitcoins with my parents card because I didn't have a bank account at the time. I ended up paying $15 in fee's and had to wait a day for the payment to go through. It's ridiculous that you have to go through a third party, then that third party makes you go through a different third party, and both of them get to charge a fee. Bitcoin will ultimately fail if the average person can't easily purchase their coins.

I was happily mining on ninajacoin for about a week making a steady profit of 1.4 btc on every other block we found. I finally said fuck it im going back to deepbit after mining on a block 2 days straight for a measly .3 profit I could have wasted another 24 hours mining. Basically every pool is essentially the same you just need to find one that you feel the most comfortable mining in.

I'd but it.

I'm willing to sell all four of them for around $450, I'll also throw in 2 pcie 1x to pcie x16 adapters and a $60 motherboard that I won't be using anymore. I paid $600 for everything I'm selling and purchased it 2 months ago.
@_date: 2011-09-15 02:18:39
Yeah I could sell you one, I bought each of them for $130 I'll sell it for $110.

Then do a bank wire to your mtgox account if you don't want to go through a 3rd party.
