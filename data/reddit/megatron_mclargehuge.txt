Or they were naked shorting and got fucked by the prolonged price increase. Either way, they're presumably arbitraging the price gap as long as they actually have any BTC on hand to sell elsewhere.

It means they're selling BTC that belong to customers without permission, intending to replace them on the open market. That might be what MTGox did. A regulated ETF should have better segregation practices but who knows.

[OP mentions]( the defense is alluding to there being a lot of BTC missing from SR too. If true, it doesn't mesh with SR's seizure wiping out Gox. One of these guys has a lot of BTC stashed somewhere.

You're proposing that he laundered profits from a legal bitcoin exchange by storing them in an illegal drug business?

No, just enough to clear the outstanding offers in one exchange's order book. I don't know the bitcoin market microstructure but I assume it's modeled on mainstream financial exchanges. Usually you can submit orders like "buy 100 at $135" or "sell 10 at $140". When those prices cross, the trade is executed, but when they don't cross the orders sit waiting to be filled. If someone knew that the order book wasn't very deep, he could buy enough to cause an anomalously high quote to be published. If BitPay's system doesn't use volume weighted pricing, it could allow a malicious buyer to make a big order at a distorted exchange rate.
Your other post about them using the order books to determine the price sounds like an attempted solution. I think someone could still cause an instantaneous distortion, but it would be obvious and the real world purchase would be canceled.

Did you actually buy above market or just enter a bid that executed at a lower price? To print a weird quote you'd have to clear out all the sell orders, which might be impractically expensive. Still, they should be using VWAP to avoid avoid the threat.

The fact that it's fungible is what creates the Chinese demand. They're desperate for ways to get currency out of their country.

This sounds open to abuse. If I bid $500 for 1 BTC, can I buy $10,000 worth of real world stuff for 20 BTC right after that quote prints?
