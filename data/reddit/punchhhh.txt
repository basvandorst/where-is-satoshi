The fact that he started this article with yet another cryptotrader-barber analogy really makes me disregard his opinion.
In fact, I'm pretty sure he doesn't even go to barber shops, I think he believes barber shops are in a bubble that will pop soon enough and thus one of the oldest professions on earth will become extinct and we will all go back to our Philips shavers.

There was a post a couple of days ago asking koreans what's their position right now with the regulations and the exchanges coming back live and if they'll buy like crazy after sitting out a month or so, and many of them said they will pull out the minute they are able to.
If you think about it, many of them had profits and life savings in crypto and all of a sudden, they can't use those assets because of regulations, did you really think they'll jump head on after exchanges opened again? First thing they thought of was to get their investments to a safe place. Just let them sit a while, enjoy their money and they'll come back strong in a couple of months. It's inevitable, it's human nature. For God's sake, even their government was trading, they have it in their blood and they'll come back for more.

As a matter of fact, you are perfectly right. A couple of hints: [ID2020] ( [John Edge] ( [Taipei Project] (
But I don't know, maybe I'm just FUDing with no substance.

The point is to sell it at 9000$ and buy back at 7500$ if your triangles and brontosaur charts tell you it's gonna dip, thus making a profit of 500$.
Of course, most of the times it'll skyrocket to 15000$ after you sold at 9000$ and you'll feel like a complete moron.
Better to just hold if you're unexperienced.
