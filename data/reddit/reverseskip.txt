Ahhh. Got it now. Doh. What an idiot I am.

How do you know this?
So, bitfinex is 100% honest and trustworthy? 
They have no history of pulling shit like this in the past?

This reads like a post

So, is this bullish for btc and ether?  I'm confused because over at many are saying this indeed is a bullish announcement.  Did I just miss the sarcasm then?

Thanks.

Which ones did you get?

Based on how much hashrate contract?  IOW, how much do you have to pay to get 2BTC/year with them?
For eg., right now, the 2.5 TH/S shows 447.50USD.  How much TH/S do you have to purchase to get 2BTC/year?  Thanks.

Which ASICs are you using?

Sweet, sweet. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:39:11
If they can cancel any time, and if they do, do you lose all of the money you put in to buy the hashrate contract?

Nice! From where though? Their website says it's not shipping until for a while
