I've been a Bitcoin enthusiast for a while now and decided I'd cash a bit out to fund the purchase. It's an absolutely amazing vehicle--have zero regrets about the purchase and so far have put maybe 300 miles on the car.

I started pooled mining early in 2012 on desktop equipment (previously used for gaming).
Had just quit a job and took some IRA investments to purchase most of the BTC in the portfolio. Wish that I'd had the foresight to purchase more--but like I said... no regrets! =D

The "Plus" option description is as follows:
"Performance Plus adds world class handling to the incredible acceleration of Model S Performance, while also improving range. After hundreds of iterations affecting every detail of the suspension, our vehicle dynamics team was able to achieve the rare outcome of improving both performance and efficiency. In addition to upgraded dampers, bushings, stabilizer bars and tires (Michelin Pilot Sport PS2), the rear tires are 20 mm wider and staggered for improved acceleration on low grip surfaces. Range improves 6 to 12 miles over regular 21" wheels." Source: (

A full copy of the Blockchain is around ~60 Gbytes, but your processor should have very little bearing on your ability to download it. I think what your asking is more geared towards the hardware required to verify the blocks downloaded to your hard disk... and I've done it with low power AMD SoC as well as beefy Intel i7 equipment. Let's just say the more powerful CPU takes significantly less time to verify the downloaded blocks.

Appreciate the feedback! I work for a major software company and the number one complaint we get is around how clients/devices are licensed.
There are constantly issues around expiration, renewal, and extensions--that on a technical level are all tied to certificate generation and validation. However since all these processes are manually handled via SFDC back end changes--it makes more sense to me to reference licensing data embedded in a blockchain structure that is public, global, and always available. That way the customer can submit payment and license extension requests directly to the blockchain--completely circumventing the manual process. Thanks for helping me think it through.

You're precisely right. The current pool distribution makes individual mining pretty ineffective (

Reached out to Tesla in late 2013 regarding the purchase of a Model S using Bitcoin. Needless to say they weren't thrilled at the prospect.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:10:39
Beat you to the punch! This has been my dream car for a while and "the car that Bitcoin bought."
@_date: 2013-10-10 13:13:41
Sorry! Forgot units... but the point is still the same.
Best candidates look like China or Argentina.

The future is coming... and it sounds awesome!
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:11:18
That's exactly what I thought. Some poor saps are actually gonna buy them =(
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:32:03
Yes. I spoke to the Tesla finance team for a while about this and they said to "hold onto your Bitcoin for a while, and buy a Model X." 
Don't think that's the company's official position, but it was cool to talk with one of the guys there who was pretty excited about Bitcoin.
EDIT: Chris was the fellow I talked with.
His exact words were: "As a technology car company I wish they would but unfortunately USD is the only form of payment accepted. However, it is awesome to hear that you are an investor of Bitcoin." So no... they wouldn't take BTC directly. =(

Went to Freedmen's restaurant yesterday to speak with the co-owner (Cuatro) and manager of the establishment about Bitcoin. They seemed excited about the possibility of integrating it into the business!
Thought it might be fun if the next digital currency meet up was held here for several reasons:
1) wide open patio with lots of space for folks to cavort
2) a BAD ASS barbecue pit master (Evan) who served up house made pickles of all sorts
3) drinks were insanely good and reasonably priced
4) the more we show our support for local businesses the better the chance of them accepting BTC as a form of payment
Hope everyone had an awesome night!

They would probably appreciate the gesture!

LOL... Nice

Indiegogo and Etsy would also greatly benefit from Bitcoin support.
Seems like every other campaign is stalled because "it took us several weeks longer than expected to receive funds"

Nah Mark was busy running around the world. As a matter of fact he was rather annoyed that he was re-routed around North Korean airspace.

You got it. Confusing at first, but that's the idea!

Yep. There was low music and enough of a breeze to make it bearable (by Miami standards)

@_date: 2013-04-06 01:25:14
Yep! VP of cloud services. Really humble given his position. I asked if they would accept Bitcoin for payment--not yet, but in the meantime I shared some articles and resources with him and Mark that hopefully will spark some interest in the subject.
@_date: 2013-10-10 02:57:38
Think of it this way--
$600 billion * 2% = $12 BILLION dollars up for grabs if you capture even a tiny fraction of the market.

So... Titanium is great if you have a rooted device. But what about everyone else out there? Tough shit?! Maybe they should start using applications that give them recovery options instead of relying on third party applications.

Came out a little darker than I expected, but otherwise a quality ISO/IEC 7813 card ( with black core and all the other features that I requested.

Will be picking up a Tesla Model S in the near future and thought it would be appropriate to share the charging love with other tech savvy folks in Miami.
Although Tesla does not directly accept Bitcoin (yet) this is the first I've heard of someone using Bitcoin to purchase a car. Figured I'd embrace the future fully! =P
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:47:24
I'm feeling the same way... Communicated the potential of Bitcoin to the family--they called it a scam, a Ponzi scheme, and worse. Nobody listened.
I've been lusting after the Tesla Model S since it was revealed--and now thanks to Bitcoin I can place the pre-order for the Performance edition.
Who's laughing now?! =P

Quick recap for anyone who is confused--
Here's the breakdown of OP's process and method to brute-force the passphrase protected wallet. Seems like and have re-coded the Casascius C# Bitcoin-Address-Utility into C and are attempting to brute-force the passphrase as we wait and watch!
Step  Generate BIP38 Passphrase-protected Paper Wallet:
Step  Send BTC to generated address:
Step  Post BIP38 Passphrase-protected Private Key:
Step  Re-code Casascius C# Bitcoin-Address-Utility into C
Step  Edit code, compile code, run code, ???, PROFIT!!
BIP 0038 Standards Track:
Mike Caldwell (Casascius) C# Bitcoin-Address-Utility:
UPDATE: Looks like makes a very valid point in the thread here ( and I quote "this a fruitless exercise" when all Unicode characters are included as it would take ~3.9 million years to attempt all possible permutations at 7 keys per second.

This is absolutely true, however the majority of charging locations in Miami are located at private hospital parking lots or at Nissan dealerships.
There is a serious void of charging locations in the neighborhood, so I figured that it would be appropriate to open it up to other Tesla owners.

PundIT LLC is a registered business in Florida, however I choose not to accept cash or credit because I don't want every single person in Miami with an electric car showing up on the porch.
It's obviously a very limited market, but I like it that way.

Both are decent options. However, I'm not a LastPass user, nor do I trust Google to keep a backup of my entire device (or go through the trouble of extracting the information for this one specific purpose).
Authy does everything that the Google Authenticator does, and keeps an encrypted backup so I can recover when moving from one device (Android, iPhone, other) to another.
