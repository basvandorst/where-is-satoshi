I think people believe the fees would eventually be driven down to zero or near zero, which I disagree with.
Imagine: Miner A decides "I will only include transactions with fees above 1000".
Miner B decides "I will include any transaction with any fee." Perhaps this miner has even decided to mine at a loss so she does not care about fees.
Which direction is the fee "equilibrium" going to go? People will see that their low or no fee transactions are being confirmed and so fees will go down.
At least that is (one of) the theories behind "we need a block size limit".
I think what fails to be calculated is that, people are willing to pay to use the network and to see its continued security, even if they are not "forced" into doing so by an artificially induced fee market. So in my view, the average fee paid would realistically never actually drop to zero.

Actually paying no fee is not in your best interest as it does not support the security of the system. Most people will be willing to pay some fee in order to support the system they are using. I'm not sure of the current statistics but I know bitcoin core has some code to allow a certain number of fee-less transactions.

Will go away after transaction confirms.

I'm counting on people acting in their best interest and voluntarily paying a fee to support a service they use. Voluntarily paying a fee for a service is definitely not "socialist". If anything, artificially restricting the supply of block space would be more along the lines of a socialist action.

How does a handful of low-memory nodes limiting their mempool lead to "a transaction can be broadcast without having a high probability of eventually paying the fee" ?
I hope it is abundantly clear to everyone that Peter is using scare tactics to try and discredit Mike and Gavin's work. They have created a good solution to a problem that a minority of volunteer node operators are facing. Thanks Mike and Gavin for keeping bitcoin decentralized.
