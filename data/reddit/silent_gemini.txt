Value is based on what someone will pay or trade for something,
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:14:37
Isn't the only reason something has value is because someone else wants it?
Arbitrarily arguing something is worthless or has no value is a very personal stance.  Someone somewhere can find value in anything.  Right now, many people find value in cryptocurrancy, and each one of those people have their own reasons.

If a used cars value could fluctuate up and down 20%, 50%, 100% or more within a few months time then your comparison might be valid.  This is crypto...not a used car.
Look at the history of this asset, everyone who bought at every other all time high would have made a profit if they just relaxed and waited to sell higher than they purchased.
The majority of people will loose their shirt if they try and chase the market.  Buying and selling is great, but it's a strategy that should be decided before the purchase.  The main problem is when people sell based on emotion.
Its just easier and safer for the majority of people to just sit back and wait for the price to reach their exit point...that exit point should be determined before the purchase.
*shrugs*  or, just chase the market, I don't really care.

I miss the auto purchase feature with Lawnmower.  I wish they would implement it again with LTC or ETH.  Every purchase was rounded up to the nearest dollar and BTC was purchased once it hit $10 or so.

Right now um seeing Bcash at 8499.03 on the order book.  Put my sell in, and it went on the books.  10 min,later my Bcash is back in my wallet and my sell,order is gone.   Now it wont let me place a sell order, something about Cancel Only allowed....wtf Coinbase, I really wanted to dump this shit at that silly price.
I'm assuming the 8499 is a coinbase bug.

You cant just say lets peg coin X to item Y.  In order for it to actual mean,something there must be a custodial system.  Some way to make sure there is an X to Y ratio and some,how for me to transfer X,into Y or Y into X.
In the case of Gold, wouldnt we need a Fort Knox like system...who would govern that....?

So Russia is going to start an ICO (Russian Mining Coin) which will give the token holders a percent of the 18% set aside from Bitcoin mining profits.
Nations are now getting involved in the ICO market.  Interesting times ahead.

Look at a historical chart. Pick an all time high 3 years ago, compare that to the all time high a year later, do that up until now.  Now notice all of the dips in between those all time highs...
If the volatility is to much for you, at least hold until the price is back to your purchase price. 
There is a lot of emotion in BTC and I bet it gets pushed to 4500 or 5000 soon just because it would make a nice news headline.
 What do you gain by selling now...  But thats just my take on the situation.

I didn't realize Google Authenticator kept your tokens local.  I figured they were stored on Google's servers like all of their services.  Ill have to do a little more research.  Thank You

Which 2FA are you referring to?

Is there a technical reason why Bitcoin only adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks?  Many alt coins have had success with PID based per block difficulty adjustments.
Alt coins have been dealing with miners bouncing around for awhile now, maybe Bitcoin would benefit from a dynamic difficulty algorithm.

Every time the market rises people start crying...please drop so I can buy more.  When the market drops people start crying....omg its over, BTC is dead.  The crypto community is a fickled bunch.

I have been using CapOne360 with Coinbase for about 4 years without issue.  All of my deposits and withdrawals have been through a checking account.  I hope they don't decide to throw a fit any time soon.  If they do I'll be moving all of my banking away from them
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:06:24
Cashing out at zero profit kinda makes all of the previous emotional stress you went through pointless.  At least give yourself a small percentage gain.  Even a 5% profit is better than any other financial vehicle.

This is the same service that Lawnmower offered around 2013ish?  I used it back then, linked to a debit card.  Every little purchase rounded up to the next dollar, the difference was collected and then a BTC purchase would be made through coinbase.  It worked pretty slick back then.  I was sad to see them cancel the service, and i hope this service works as well.

If I was at a lumber yard and saw a Lambo in the parking lot, I would hang around for a bit just to see if the owner sticks a couple 2x4 in the front seat or straps a piece of plywood on the roof. :)  I watch that happen with a little BMW, it was rather comical.

Shouldn't the users wallet be able to properly set the fee for a timely confirmation time?  Honestly, I don't no exactly how the fee systems works,  most of my coin movements are transferred into LTC/ETH.  BTCs fees are just to high for rhw price range that I work with.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:12:06
Yep, at least in the US.
If you mine crypto you owe income tax on the fair market value of the coin.
If you trade crypto-to-crypto you owe tax, short-term or long term.
At least in the US.

Ahh, 2014 and the LawnMower app.  Every debit card transaction I made was rounded up to the nearest dollar, after $10 was collected it would buy me BTC.  I used that app for about a year straight.
It was a great way to get passive BTC.  I wish it would come back for LTC,ETH or VTC.  Maybe even BTC on LN.

Quoting the last paragraph.
"Base block size increase delivers what users need today, and SegWit secures the foundation for tomorrow."
Is that first sentence even valid anymore?  Most blocks now are under 1MB and miners are still mining blocks that are not full.  You can see this for yourself on any explorer.  So, why is a block size increases needed right now?
The author accepts that SegWit lays a strong foundation for the future.  Users don't need larger blocks right now.  Let SegWit mature and flow through the system.  Maybe by then some other arbitrary block size increase will be suggested.

This document says that Crypto Coins are virtual and are not taxed.... Crypto to Crypto trades are taxable starting in 2018.
Plus the income tax percentages are not correct.  If you Google US income tax brackets you will see that 35% is not the lowest bracket.
Nice looking document, but I'm going to say its misleading.

Ya, I agree its complete conspiracy and just a crazy theory.
Statements like this
 "He goes on to claim that cryptocurrencies pose realistic threats to financial stability, and that they must be terminated - with the only solution being to replace private cryptos with fiat cryptos issued by PBOC."
Make me think that there is a possibility it could happen.

Maybe the oscillation will continue for awhile until for awhile until the community has lost all hope and bags have been filled.  Then the market will allowed to increase...then a parabolic increase will occur..FOMO will take hold and the lambo dreams will return.  ATHs will be broken and then those bags will be dumped, dropping the market lower than today.
Rinse and repeat.

I always wondered about this also.  Cant you just send the coins to an exchange, let them sit there for a few days and then withdraw to a different address?
Poloniex for example.  You send coins to a deposit address, but when you withdraw they come from the main exchange address, not the deposit one.  Doesn't this break the link?

* 1.) China takes control over all large scale industrial miners
* 2.) China adopts BCH as the only approved crypto in China
* 3.) ??
* 4.) BitcoinCash is now BitcoinChina.
* 5.) Since China now controls all of the large miners and the ASIC producers, their new currency is immune to a 51% style attack.
* Just a theory *shrugs*

Liquidate some of those gains to pay the tax requirement.  Leave the excess gains in crypto or cash them out also (user choice).
This year, every month I look at my portfolio, calculate my profit/loss.  I liquidate enough to pay the tax amount.  That fiat goes into a savings account which will be used for the upcoming tax season.  If I didnt do it that way, I'm essentially using money that is not mine, hoping the market increases, but if the market tanks during tax season i would be screwed.  I don't like it, but i'd rather play it safe.

Crypto is fine, its the fiat system that is plugged up with red tape.
Move fiat into the exchange before you "need" it.   I consider the delay an emotional buffer.  In the long run the 7-10 day fluctuation really doesnt matter (typically)
@_date: 2018-07-07 14:39:52
That doesnt matter.  When my trades occur, I own the U.S. government X amount in USD taxes.  I liquidate Y crypto to get that X USD.  10 months from now I still only owe X USD.  10 months from now I might have to liquidate more or less crypto.  I'm comfortable with the potential gains loss to gaurentee I cover the owed USD.

$4 Billion dollar money laundering scheme between 2011-2017.  
$4 Billion dollars in 6 years sounded like a decent amount of money to me.  My first thought was now the anti-crypto people will now point at this article and say "See crypto is a money laundering haven and needs more regulation"
Then I went to Google:
"In 2009 roughly $1.6 Trillion dollars was laundered.."  This mostly occurs through the normal financial channels.
So, I guess Bitcoin needs to step it up to compete with the established financial system.
