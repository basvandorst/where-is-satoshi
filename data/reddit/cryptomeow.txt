On the one hand, it sounds reasonable, but I guess WS will win more than crypto. The rules of the classical financial world don't meet the very structure of the crypto, and I do not see how to reconcile them without compromising the latter. Actually, I do not even see the precondition for them to be changed. Btw why are you so sure we need this legitimization and WS money at all?

What a beautiful work of art. I like the drawing technique. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:12:17
Sounds interesting! I, inter alia, investigate the relationship between public opinion and the exchange rate, so many thanks for your comment! :) But could you please explain also why do you think that the situation nr 2 means time to sell?
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:57:47
not surprised at all
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:35:10
Think it was on purpose :)
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:57:04
That's really weird in a certain way. Seriously, I don't get why is everyone so happy about that.
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:54:56
Wow, very nice. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:32:05
why? what's the problem with paying if you like the painting the artist did? no matter where you saw it, you are enjoying it, which is equivalent to paying for the ice cream you just ate. btw, no one forces you to pay, you only pay if you like the work of art itself.

Healthy skepticism hasn't killed anyone yet, in contrast to the undue optimism. But maybe you could explain why do you think it's cool? :)
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:32:30
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:00:16
Found a great report about bitcoin perspectives. Maybe that will bring some peace in your minds. Keep calm anyway.
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:29:20
Agree. Fair point. But I still can't get why do people trade on emotion.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:30:12
Yep, that's so funny and so sad at the same time.
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:15:05
ahhaahh true
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:34:28
Sounds like the perfect reason for buying, actually
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:24:39
;) Nice guys. They actually publish a report on the state of the market 4 times a year.  I like their analysis, very clear tho.  
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:18:26
Why are you so sure that's good news?
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:44:17
Hmmmm :)
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:08:41
I wouldn't be so optimistic.
Seems like once Wall Street gets the control they want they will not let it go so easily. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:07:13
Why do you think this is a good indicator? People love to dramatize everything. Could you please tell more detail, what exactly do you mean?
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:27:04
Market is a bad place for emotions, I think.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:23:48
Exactly. And knowledge.
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:20:24
Yep, your right. I see your point, but I'm talking not exactly about the community reaction, but about the perspectives right now, and they are not that bright. Recognition is important, of course, but there is the probability of BTC eventually losing its value after the integrating with the classical financial world, as Wall Street offers it to play by the old rules despite the fact BTC has completely different structure than the fiat money.
@_date: 2018-08-09 09:48:30
I would like to know it too!
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:55:37
Haha, no, but thanks! I would like to be:) But actually I just found this while searching and liked it so much so decided to share.
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:13:21
cause it will get cheaper?
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:52:52
But you didn't sell, did you?
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:58:49
Why do you think so? :(
