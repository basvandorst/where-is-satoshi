I assume you were the one posting “in 16 and just made this app...”? 
Definitely not downloading your app now that you have pathetically lied and then just awkwardly admitted it.

Who the hell are you people? Honestly I’m interested to understand who has this much to put to crypto and also hangs on reddit

Hey yall. I have some super small BitcoinX and superbitcoin balances on Binance and I'm wondering how to get rid of them. Anybody have an address for either of these that I could send them to?

wow your so godly and principled 
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:07:50
I kinda think that we’re actually in the middle of a huge multi year equilibrium cycle and we’re about to form a lower high before pulling back to higher low. Ie: tightening wedge formation. I have no conviction on that tho haha
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:16:50
So sounds like your pretty confident we’re on that same track again?

I love you

I love you. You took the words out of my lazy mouth(keyboard) that I don’t ever bother to type out myself. I think that btc could blow up again but it would require multiple significant structural catalysts. I’m still actively buying but I definitely view it as lost money.

We don’t know what big money is doing because they don’t put on a position then come to R/crypto and post about it hoping for affirmation in their world view. There’s plenty of big money already in the game and plenty waiting to get in and then there’s the majority that probably wants nothing to do with crypto because it doesn’t fit remotely close to their scope/thesis.

Renewables are what’s is referred to as intermittent power source. Coal and traditional sources are called on-demand. If anybody is mining with renewables they either have big batteries or compliment with an on demand source. My understanding was the most crypto is mines in big data centers in China powered by coal.

fuck im an idiot...when I was making this post it had been about 3 minutes since I made the trade so I jumped to that conclusion.... I just looked again and I see the orders I just made and they were totally normal fills they just didnt post for a few minutes for whatever reason. I'm gunna go ahead and delete this....
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:52:27
Yeah normally theres some slop but this was wild. I bought right in the middle of a pretty quick aggressive move...I guess it just had some insane slippage? The weird thing is that I didn't see it come through in the order book...i'm not sure how/if they batch fills so its probably pretty hard to track down an individual trade anyway...

Difference being the value of usd is basically agreed upon by every person in the world as it’s the primary currency. Then there’s bitcoin with how many users?
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:01:50
Then the transactional volume of usd with decrease but would still remain at the top?
