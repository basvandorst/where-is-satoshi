Coinbase is garbage, and the issue here is that they are openly lying. I don't care if the transactions are as swift a liquid burrito, if they close random accounts and openly **LIE** to customers, they can fuck off.

LOL. They are handling a billion independent and unstable shitcoin chains, trading engines (with advanced features), KYC, and chat functionality with millions of views. They probably need a space station and rocket scientists by now.

Yes, he claims he used those funds and computers to create Bitcoin, which is why he was entitled to the 'refund'.

Not a scam, just sub-par infrastructure and code, as well as not enough (qualified) employees.

Nah they're good people, but the site was first coded as a hobby project by a script kiddie with a music degree and barely any coding experience. Then it sort of piled on from there and got re-coded a few times. It will take a while for it to get organized (if it doesn't collapse). The infrastructure isn't that great - they got hacked twice, and accounts are getting hacked all the time. It's possible that either they need to get everything organized (hire more, and more qualified staff), or that they got screwed by hackers or bugs. Recently the site traffic scaled by 10x or something ridiculous like that, and since they are processing a few things manually (apparently), then it's GG.

OK. so you not only need to explain why your money is on there, but also why your account is suspended? Sorry, but your money is gone.

Nobody gives a shit. A friend of mine has 400 BTC on an exchange that was seized in early 2013 by European authorities. Will never see that shit again, even with a lawsuit going on.

You must be living in lala land if you think you'll ever see these again. Honestly. I still don't have access to coins from exchanges that were shut down 3-4 years ago. The coins are gone. If you lost millions and still have millions, you may have a chance at irritating and annoying the US govt before you still end up without any money.
RemindMe! 1 year "Nope, this exchange didn't pay out either and a-spookyghost was right."

"Societies are not monoliths!", he cries as he Googles(tm) for an Amazon(tm) sale.
