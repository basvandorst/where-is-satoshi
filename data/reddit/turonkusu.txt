tsch...the very second this happens I will get rid of all my bitcoins thank you. infinite in money never goes

When Bitcoin goes up, I wish I hadn't bought all that junk. When Bitcoin goes down, I am working to regain the money I spent when it was up
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:17:03
hopefully it will remain....we are trusting that this new way of thinking gets us out from a whole of rotten economy. Bitcoin is not a perfect solution but by god i wanna see how far this can go
@_date: 2017-03-31 05:45:14
even if that were true....the main point of fiat currency is flawed. You cannot pay interest on money, if you started with zero money. and central banks and treasuries just issue massive IOU's ...that is the problem. Central bank debt is impossible to pay

all exchanges are saying they will not use BU unless a "replay attack" is fixed....that means no selling BU to buy BTC
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:03:57
well yeah.....that's pretty much what I read in the title =P

I like it!!!! Russians are ...unique

moderation is good move it has to be unbiased...but for bitcoin, can that be accomplished? I mean, the moderator has to be knowledgeable in the topic but just knowing int he topic...would make him loose his "unbiased"?

Rule 1 of economics....its all about the "incentive"

Its funny...v P n ....P as in private...together with authorized...then put chinal....so look
Authorized private things in China...that sentence doesn't even make sense xD. That only sounds like goverment officials would have that
@_date: 2017-01-28 06:55:50
indeed. mexicans have little to safeguard their income...not to mention most earn just five dollars a day and if you are lucky 10 dollars a day. BTC in a way is a lifeline for me, without it, i would have to resort to buying gold, somehow though...BTC feels better, one way or another, I have placed my bet and family's future on BTC in a big way

Damn, this is starting to sound like WWII shit when German's money was carried in wheelbarrows 
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:01:38
dude that is awesome! I live very close to that area and have been itching to use bitcoin here in Mexico in some way! I also noticed that the peso is worth more in bitcoin that the dollar (proportionally speaking) so if mexican want their money to mean something in the future...they will do well to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:51:23
hahah! but ...they only have the really cheap kind of lollipops...pssh being a bank you'd think they could at least afford the ones with bubblegum inside
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:20:09
okay okay i understand that far. now the only reason its causing a sabotage is because their hasing power is so big that when they discover the block the other chains have no option but to also report that block as valid and its a reace on to the next block?
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:21:31
Mexican here....already have 5 BTC in cold storage, couldn't afford more. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:12:15
asking a question in-between here educate me....for this miners...does he release his code running on that hardware? Is there a backdoor he may have hidden in those machines that he could take advantage of them? (may sound noob but I don't know much about these hardware pieces)
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:57:34
heck no!! Back way then, I used to drive 2 hours to the only anime store I knew instead of buying online just for the experience. I go to fancy cafeterias for the experience, create bran wallets just for fun and feel I am a spy, figure out the math for fun, I would even drive to a business that acceptsbitcoin just so i can have the pleasue of paying with them in the real practical world
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:17:18
no i thought think it will be niche either, it is pretty pretty hard to counterfeit. Its possible but very very hard, you'd have to trick the whole blockchain and have serious machine power (unless i am misunderstanding how it works) It's not controlled by anyone given power, more annonymous than fiat currency, very quick, anyone in the world can use it. Given just these qualities, i think if enough people come to turst it, it can definitely be a replacement for the dollar. We all know the dollar is surviving beyond its life anyway
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:34:45
so as I have read they are focusing only in the block reward and not wanting the mempool to go down maybe because...they only want the money. And since they have a high hashing power.....here is my last question....the fact that other pools are trying to comfirm those transanctions what happens....easy numbers. say the chain is at block 500 and antpool got the empty block 501....pool "a" begins to comfrim transactions for block 502 but then antpool gets another emply block (502) what happens then? those transactions can be put into block 503? and hope antpool doesn't get another block or it will keep delaying a block with transactiosn on it?
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:43:25
It's funny when I think about it.... Mathematical equations which shape a system of trust is being cited as "ilegal" or rather in a more prctical term is being "made to appear" as not useful, a threat to banking systems, power, etc etc...hahaha its awesome how this world works
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:40:45
thank you sirs! that clarifies the current possible state of the coins! I shall have bitcoins to spend and help and bitcoins to save.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:05:03
if this pool is mining a lot of empty blocks wouldn't the other pools and bitcoin users begin to ignore their chain?
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:38:00
you know the part that is the icing on the cake? That flat currency is infinite...conjured out of nowhere, we are made to pay with IOUs fromt the central bank with their monopoly money and then they want us to submit to them. But Satoshi came up with math and system to get off from their control and fake money...psh. Poor bank people, their are working as much as we do but the system for flat currency is evil man....evil
Over here in Mexico I use bitso for my bitcoins andthe representatives in my bank had NO IDEA what bitcoin was. And then the wire transfer to BITSO has this code...and the specific code for BITSO (using a national standard for wire transfers) they had NO IDEA what the code meant.... in my case ignorance is better that otherwise
@_date: 2016-12-22 05:56:12
that's genius! i never saw that rule of the game!!!! Awesome reality huh?
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:19:56
I actually thought about this too. yes, you are not creating more bitcoins, just splitting existing bitcoins into smaller units. What I am wondering though is.... since bitcoin is cryptocurrency, we could divide it into smaller and smaller pieces, millions or billions, and each smaller piece will be worth more and more. Example; 1 satoshi now buys you nothing, but in the future 1 satoshi will be able to buy something because there would be something even smaller like hmmm a microsatoshi.  The pie and pizza example work the same way. In times where there is plenty food, all slices will beequal in value, even if you divide into 100 slices. But in times where food is scarce, 1/100 of a pizza will be worth more. see? so yes, following that thought, how can one say bitcoin isn't infinite? the point of bitcoin was to stop infinite money supply, and that only works if bitcoin isn't allowed to subdivide itself endlessly
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:18:57
no, but what i said, is....if a penny comes to be worth more than it is now, and a millionth of a penny becomes worth what a penny is worth now. Example. In mexico there used to be pesos....1000 pesos was the standard coin, but because of inflation the goverment told the citizens, we will betaking 3 zeroes out of the coins "to make it easier" and 1000 pesos will become, 1 new peso. See the coin never changed, but it was subdivided to hide inflation. and 1000 pesos become worth 1 pesos. and by consequence,  one hundredth of an old peso become worth one cent in new peso

which wallet would you recommend? 
@_date: 2017-04-18 03:17:59
I don't remember where I saw it, but they said quantum computers may not be more powerful than binary ones for math computations of this nature, but would be very good at probability problems
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:08:26
sweet, i was hoping for another place to spend my bitcoin aside from purse
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:38:29
huh.....now that you mention it.....makes sense
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:40:48
that was good man! I will say this though. I am one of themany who should have gotten into bitcoin when Ifirst heard of it because I udnerstood its potential but man...anyway. I convinced my sidter and mom to put some of their savings in this explaining the risks. it was 98000 mexican pesos...i managed to grow them to 250,000 pesos when we neared the 3000 dollar mark...should have sold then....withdraw the profit and start back again with 98000 pesos in bitcon....but anyway I fell asleep and didn't I sold at 111,000 pesos to avoid loosing part of their money but i will not give u in bitcoin yet, coming August 1 man....it will be very excitring to see

Bitcoin is finite, so as others have said, what will happen to miners at the end of mining all the coins? haven't read the whitepaper that satoshi wrote, did he put a check for that? and economy does say that sometimes greed in two parties actually makes both better off "freakonomics"
