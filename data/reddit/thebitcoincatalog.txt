The FBI actually did say they will liquid the bitcoins in the market once the trial will be over. This could take years but at that time, it will be a good opportunity to buy.

I find pretty funny and interesting that for the first time the public can monitor the money that a government own. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 02:33:47
This is a great article. I think this will create good opportunities to bitcoin businesses that wish to do partnership with banks.

Seems down. You can still use

You can question bitcoin all you want but you will inevitably find that bitcoin is pretty much a rock solid concept. An open source project with that much people improving and developping it makes it over time more and more flawless and usefull.

Seems that you don't know what a ponzi shemes is. Nor what bitcoin is.

Short answer: Cryptography
@_date: 2013-05-25 05:34:02
I Agree but bitcoin is what it is... Do you have any idea of how to describe the same thing otherwise?
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:17:04
@_date: 2013-10-03 23:13:52
Why not just sell them some? Even if a small amount.
