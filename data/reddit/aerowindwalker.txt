You might be onto something. Loans are confirmed to be the tool trading firms use to manipulate BTC price 
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:48:32
I don't know if they will stop. I just know the loan issued yesterday were 72 hours.
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:13:38
I agree with you, but what we already know is that loans' due dates matches the drops, and the release of new loans matches the rallies. Other things, we are yet to know, or will never know.
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:52:16
Yeah by 15th I bet it goes up to $1200 already.
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:44:46
It counts the past 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:18:18
I bet they found out about this, the question is if they can and will do something about it: Loans are confirmed to be the tool trading firms use to manipulate BTC price
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:50:17
How about selling the house for BTC?
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:57:42
You give out low or zero interest loan to people. Previously there were 1 billion usd worth of BTC were purchased with loans in a period of 3 to 4 months, and probably another billion investment from the financial firms who lent money out (that's why the market cap went up from 9B to 17B and then dipped to 15B when the loans came out). Right now this number will pump up again. 26M usd loans released yesterday, 28M usd loans released today.
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:23:31
The problem for many investors isn't the price going down when it was hiking up to $1000+, the problem was the price going up and then drops before most people can react (the lack of stability is the problem). Those people who bought in at $1000+ could have gotten 30%+ more BTC if they waited for the price to drop to $700+. When I post this thread the BTC was trading at 6614 CNY (came up aggressively from the 6300 CNY making a lot of people think a new rally has begun) and it is now at 6220 CNY (6% down), so at least I have corrected predicted the bull trap. In terms of not buying this month, I think we can look at it this way. Tmr it might go up or the day after, but upward trends will not last too long genrally speaking in the entire January, which means the difficulty of spotting the low and high is extraordinarily high, and at any point you buy in now you have a 50% chance to regret for days or weeks or even months (so you can buy if you decide to just hold it for years, I encourage you to). This is why I will wait it out until the next month.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:50:47
I do in the sense that I received these loans myself. Not in the sense that I work for any trading platforms or large trading firms.
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:28:12
No it will be controlled by China. Loans are confirmed to be the tool trading firms use to manipulate BTC price
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:40:55
Excellent read, of course I feel like the view in this article still is a bit narrow. Bitcoin has a lot more features than splitting a finite currency supply more ways. It is for example, decentralized, easier to improve, and extraordinarily secure (you can't even take it down with a national army) etc.
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:44:59

@_date: 2017-01-08 08:06:03
I don't want to share any insider info with individuals who want to pump their fiat currency reserve (and TBH most of the readers over there probably knew before I did). I want to share it with people who support and believe in BTC and want to ultimately pump their BTC reserve.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:31:10
No quibble. Don't have time for that. You see each time before the drop there is news coming out, it means this news is to facilitate the drop. They are two sides of the same coin. Just the news won't work, just the loans might not work too well. But the loans can be used to predict the market since they are issued ahead of the time. The due date is when the drop happens.
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:40:25
Apparently a lot of people don't even seem to know they gave out loans. Read my previous thread:

I think there are margin buying discount too, like no over night fee etc. I didn't use any of those products.
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:55:40
They did want to cool down BTC. Because the BTC is much cheaper to buy earlier this month with USD ($1000 for 1 BTC) than CNY (8000 for 1 BTC, while the exchange rate was around 1 USD for 6.85 CNY) a lot of people would buy USD in China and wire it to the US, and then buy BTC, transfer them back to Chinese exchange and then dump them for CNY. For people who had the access to trade licenses in China, they could make as much as 16% in a day up to 245K USD in profit. And this does create China's USD reserve outflow - which is why China had to put actions into cooling down the bitcoin market. Now bitcoin is cheaper to buy with CNY.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:46:21
No I can't give you a sheet of how many loans were given out, and when they are due, because I don't work for the people who manipulate the price.
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:09:06
We certainly need markets outside of China because: Loans are confirmed to be the tool trading firms use to manipulate BTC price
But I doubt it will go back to 1000 even for a day in January.

No I was just pissed when I said that. That guy was probably working for some bitcoin trading firm or whoever was manipulating the price. He is probably covering things up or he is just a huge moron who didn't think before shitting out his stupid ideas and went all the way to defend his shit.
The more likely case of scenario is these BTC price manipulators are connected in the government or the bank and new what the bank will do, so they modified the loan period to match the upcoming events in order to max out their profits.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:42:43
Again I have no time to quibble. From what we know, the loans is the key factor. People have to sell to pay back loans, they don't have to react when news come out.
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:39:59
And you could have bought 30 BTC today with the same money. Happy 2017. :)
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:38:18
Is this coindesk? That's not the prediction, just telling you the highest/lowest price today. Are you referring to Clif High predicting the price of bitcoin being $850 at the end of 2016? Technically speaking he was wrong because it was up at $1200.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:23:45
By matching drops 5 times in a row. This is like winning lotteries 5 times in a row.
@_date: 2017-01-14 10:50:39
Right now I am not sure, this is why I don't trade this month. I think by next month, the price we see in the market will be closer to the natural price of BTC. Based on the population of ownership and the total transactions, I think BTC is growing at a rate of a little under 40% a year (which is super fast already), but since May last year the price has gone up 200%, this is certainly not a natural phenomenon.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:51:47
I certainly wouldn't because a random dude who is just being rude and frankly a bit silly. My last reply to your nonsense.

Excellent writing. I would recommend new investors considering similar long term investment strategy.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:16:05
Hey thank god someone seems to know shit showed up. Yeah I admit it might seem like FUD to some people, but I prefer to stand out of it for now myself. Normal margin trading isn't really anything too harmful, but when you set a deadline to the loans it becomes a problem and it is a way to manipulate the market. Hope it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:12:19
After being right 5 times in a row, I think this is the reason: 
And the timing is precise down to the hours.
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:12:35
Correct, but myself isn't going to touch something so hot. I actually made 25K before the crash, and bought back 120 BTC at 7433 CNY, and then dumped at 7380 CNY the second day (lost $900), and then bought at 5930 CNY, dumped just now at 6550 CNY. I still hold 60 BTC bought over the last 6 years at an average price of $25.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:13:15
Indeed because CNY is a bit over-appreciated at the moment and the Chinese BTC market had a lot of loans.
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:09:25
That has little to do with bot trading. Two separated things. Bots are for hedging, and spikes (pump and dump) were created by loans. You can read this thread of mine and follow links to my previous threads:

If you bought at $2 then you really have no reason to sell. For those who bought at $900, they absolutely should. Loans are confirmed to be the tool trading firms use to manipulate BTC price 
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:57:16
Last time I checked today, four Chinese BTC platforms are offering 126M RMB of unclaimed low interest loans (18M USD). I don't think they would be stupid enough to do that if the market will continue to crash.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:56:59
The last time they called me the operator has stated the loans will be 72 or 48 hours. I said no, I would not prefer to get these loans.

I am the inside source. I repeatedly stated. I received these loans myself.
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:28:48
Correct except these loans were given out in a period of three to four months and paid back in a window of a week or less. I think the average people who got those loans doubled or tripled their investment before or during the crash.
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:54:59
That's no secret. I use bots myself, so are most traders who either know how to make a bot or are willing to pay for a bot. To make tiny percentage each day by finding the differences across the trading platforms. It's called hedging. It only gives you 3 to 7% of the return each month (and shrinking). For regular people, it's best if you just buy and hold. BTC is going up at 15% to 20% each month.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:08:50
I estimate somewhere around one billion USD. I really have no idea - could be a lot less or a lot more. I personally had a loan of a little less than 900K RMB (125K USD).
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:35:03

No more predictions. I said it earlier I am not trading anymore this month. There is something here I think we need to be clear. I do not have super human ability or intelligence to predict the future. The difference is only I knew some information other people didn't know. Because I am not involved in trading since three days ago, I don't have the additional info anymore (I don't know if new loans are released and when they are due). This is why I cannot predict the market anymore after the drop we just witnessed. My two cents is the market is clearly manipulated at the moment, and it will go against more investors - first the small fish, then the bigger fish. I made money as the bigger fish (relatively) in the last few weeks and now I know I will be the next target so I stopped. If you are holding, my best advice to you is to take a step back and come back in the future. If you borrowed money to invest, or you need fiat currency immediately, probably you should sell right now to get what you need and come back to invest in the future (even if tmr the price might go up a bit, you don't want to take that kind of risk). Right now the market is too unpredictable. I can't tell you if it goes up or down. I can say the chance of going up or going down is exactly 50/50. So for the short term investor, there is no game here, just gambling.

Yes and no, the idea is right, but the loans came from peer-to-peer funds, which means someone bought a type of high risk investment fund with a yearly return up to maybe 35% or even higher and then his money and millions of other people's money will be given out as these loans.

Another problem is when someone has a choice to spend BTC or fiat currency, he is going to use fiat currency because the latter has an inflation rate. This means holding on to fiat currency will only devalue in the long run, making the spending a bit more preferable. This is why fiat currency was designed to have an inflation rate (vesus the gold standard). We are tapping into the same problem fiat currency makers have been dealing with in the last century, and now we have to come up with new solutions for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-12-26 08:15:02
Am I wrong or China is the biggest BTC market ATM?
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:41:14
There are multiple ways you can see it. For most people whose investment is just under 10 BTC, you should be able see the offer on their homepages and should be able to get a discount on special occasions when requesting a loan. For traders who has probably over 50 BTC, they call you up and offer the loans.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:12:43
Oh, I don't see into the future. I just know there are going to be a lot of bull traps and unexpected drops because right now in the market too much of trading were done with the so-called "shadow money." ( I am okay with people doing margin trading or a healthy portion of loans in the market. I feel like investing my time into trading right now in a market that isn't exactly trading at its natural price (again I could be wrong about this) will be devastating to my own well being so I want to enter again when the market is more healthy (or not, maybe I will just buy more at a price I find reasonable and then just hold). Regardless I am holding enough BTC from years ago I don't have to trade to make more.

I suspect you are just here to confuse people.
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:04:46
To be honest, 1B is only my estimate. I suspect the strategy for the investment firm is to invest half in May, when the price shortly spiked, and then started to introduce low or zero interest loan to people, and then it took out the 1B first, and the investors who was selling to pay back those loans followed. This is only my wild guess, but it worked for me. (I took out 125K USD of loans myself.) If this theory is true, then the peer-to-peer investment fund firm would have made 45% to 80% of their original investment in a single year. That of course is not too remarkable for Chinese investment firms. I met with investors in China who made 100% or 200% of their investment through insider trading (with an investment over 1B, that is extremely hard, for people who were investing 100K, it is possible to make 1200% to 2000% but that rarely apply for billion dollar investors).
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:37:07
Yes, they might actually be the one who is manipulating the price.
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:17:32
Well I've never used BTC for drug or those so-called black market stuffs. I sold a car for BTC before, and I've bought things with BTC from other people, like iPhone, iPad, Macbook, etc.
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:38:48
Personally I think this is going to be a race between the adoptation of BTC and the cost of mining. If we keep holding on BTC instead of spending them, then perhaps the problem will eventually occur...but alternatively, governments can host and charge people with transaction fee as a way of taxation. Of course, many people wouldn't like such alternative. A problem with BTC is that it doesn't encourage spending. If more people use it, the higher the value of the currency will be, and then buying with bitcoin is going to be a bad investment.
