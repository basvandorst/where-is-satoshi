Sure, but there were plenty of people with BTC balances already on Gox who were willing to sell at low prices to get out.
Gox could just fill them at their low offer. If it actually had their BTC, it could then sell those on another exchange for a nice profit. If it didn't (because it had lost/spent/whatever them) then it would take a cash hit, but at the low Gox price as opposed to the wider market price.

But buying them at Gox's low price, transferring them to another exchange and selling them there would.
Similarly when they restricted cash withdrawals months back and had the highest BTC prices around, they could have bought BTC on other exchanges, transferred them back to Gox and sold them there at a nice profit.
Extremely underhanded, but that's one way they could have been trying to dig themselves out of a big hole.

Well said. This whole black-and-white, us-or-them, all-or-nothing talk is unconstructive and often misleading. As if a 2MB hard-fork occurring somehow means core has lost all relevance and classic has forever become the arbiter of what Bitcoin is/isn't. It's like a bad one-dimensional Hollywood movie.
If core continues to provide quality software with great features as they have so far, and does so better than any completing implementation, then they are likely to be used by the majority in the long run^* even if there's a detour through an alternative implementation. IF there is a fork and the majority converges on classic, core might be forced to accept a block size bump if they want to again be the software of choice. Or convince the majority to reduce the block size again.
If on the other hand another implementation does a better job of meeting the diverse demands of Bitcoin participants, there's a good chance it'll win out. That's market forces at work. 
I don't see how the Bitcoin protocol and development could proceed long-term any other way while remaining *truly* decentralised, given that there will be disagreement in any sufficiently large system of actors with diverse incentives, and on average *as incentives diversify, contentiousness of decisions increases*.
  
^* This assumes all participants have perfect information and act in their best interests, which in reality is not always the case. For a large population with sufficiently diverse incentives however, this should balance out.

Possibly, though I think that if the majority of Bitcoin demand comes from buy-and-hold investors rather than for payment of goods/services (and continues to), a heavy crash is inevitable, fork or no fork.
Also just because merchants sell their coins, I don't think that means they don't add to demand. By that logic, anyone who spends as much money as they earn doesn't add to demand for money.
By the way, in case you're interested:  ~~demande~~ demand, ~~investitor~~ investor

I'm making an assumption that if there is a **clear supermajority** on one branch, receivers of bitcoin are going to very quickly pay attention to the majority chain for confirmations, etc. to minimise their risk of loss.
Less actors accepting bitcoin on the minority fork =&gt; less tx volume =&gt; less demand for those coins.
This is an assumption though; I'd be interested in hearing from anyone why they think this would not be the case.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:28:46
Right, and that is a function of willing buyers. Demand for coins that exist only on a minority chain will decrease, resulting in a reduced bidding price.
The minor would have to mine blocks on the minority chain at an increased rate (due to possessing a larger fraction of the total hash power behind the chain) that more than offsets this price decrease in order to avoid losing money.
Given the difficulty won't change for up to ~2k blocks after the fork, a miner is unlikely to mine appreciably more blocks, so overall, they're likely to be worse off.

..which is why the button ordering is randomised. The PIN is never passed to the device; rather a sequence of unlabelled button presses is. Only the device (and you, looking at its screen) know how those buttons map to numbers for that transaction.

This would require hacking the firmware within the hardware device. 
Although nothing is 100% secure, the effort required is much higher than creating malware for PC wallets which is evidently still proving fruitful, so it's probably not worth worrying about for the time being.

Or perhaps they did the math and determined that mining empty blocks gives them a speed advantage that more than compensates for the lost fee revenue. In that case, they *are* acting rationally.
@_date: 2019-08-08 04:04:12
The PIN doesn't change but the buttons that you have to click on the screen do, since the button ordering is randomly generated and only displayed on the device.
The PC never has access to your pin; only a sequence of button presses that changes each time.

Both this and the other reply to my comment are missing a key point. Assuming avg. fees/block are 4% of block reward, then if empty blocks increase their chance of mining the next block first by &gt; 4%, then it's the economically rational thing to do.
If it allows them to start mining a bit sooner than other miners (I'm not familiar with the low-level details of the protocol) and/or propagates faster so is more likely to be received first *all else being equal*, then I don't see why it couldn't be the case. One would need plenty of data and some analysis to confidently answer either way.
Anyone care to point out the flaw in that argument?

Doesn't Fox news claim to be 'fair and balanced'? As far as I have seen they are anything but, and there's no 'most likely' about it.

Was with you right up until the end bit. There is no guarantee a limit order will ever fill, let alone fill in a reasonable timeframe. Ask anyone trying to sell Enron shares that way in 2001.
'WILL' needs a qualification.
