I’m looking into it (this is a shared account with my sister who initially made it, she’s in the middle of med school exams).
In the case I don’t, i’m just wondering if there are alternatives. Would deriving the first wallet address be sufficient?
@_date: 2019-12-12 02:42:26
why? i can have 3 words missing each with 6 possibilities which gives 216 phrases?  i assure you this is correct as I am working on it

i’ll take a look and reply back with my findings in the next week!
Just another question:  when I query the blockchain  API, should I be passing my master public key?  I’m not sure what to be searching for or if the master public key would even work

So basically the words are in the right order but the handwriting for a few of them are terrible and I'm not sure the correct word (but I have a list of ~5 candidates for those).  Like word  is either fee, or knee, not sure which.
All are in the right order though and I have a list of phrases that pass checksum (I already automated that part)

I do not know how to prove this without giving away the word list, but I assure you my intention is not to waste anyone's time or energy.  
Kindly refer to this:

I really want to avoid generating the first address since that part is difficult to automate (at least so far)

Thank you so much for taking the time to post the platform!
However, the thing is that I don't have an address.  I only have candidate seeds that I derived based off of the handwriting and words that look like each other.  They all pass checksum.
I CAN derive an address from the seed, but if I do, it will appear as if no transactions have occurred.  Is there any way to retrospectively find an address?  I guess all the information I have are a list of candidate seeds.  Nothing more.

Okay I lied, there are more like 500 candidate phrases that I have, too much time to sit and do one at a time.

No it's  multiple and i don't have any addresses.  See original post.
