I'm a millennial and  this statement is totally false. Boomers own shit we rent boomers have most of the liquid assets and tangible assets like land real estate business etc...
We are fcked due to hyper inflation insane national debt.

Has anyone heard of zelle or cash app lol its basically bank wore but much cheaper easier/faster. Almost defeats the point of this graph L. Nobody bank wires money anymore. Fintech systems are taking over with or without BTC.

Gold is just an superior asset in my opinion I give two fcks about the gains. The test of time will always go to gold and not some artificially made cryptographic currency with an artificially supply. When the lights turn off and the web is off gold silver amongst other precious metals always wins

In my opinion, it’s a colossal pump-and-dump scheme, the likes of which the world has never seen. In a pump-and-dump game, promoters “pump” up the price of a security creating a speculative frenzy, then “dump”

BTC is a ponzi scheme in my opinion. What give its its inherent value*** really scarcity???? are you guys drunk over your mind. Utlilty is king and if bitcoin is suposseblly a much more convertible/transferable asset to replace gold then that useless because as we've seen in the past anyone can fork off the btc Blockchain or make another Blockchain and, call it myass coin. Myass coin can be 10mill or 5 mill or whatever freaking scarce number you want to throw out thier. What makes it valuable???? The decentralization part of it lol.
I know this is going to get down voted as he'll fck it burn me if you want. I'm looking from an entirely different angle then most of you guys in this echo chamber.

Please enlightend I get the economic reason for it. Why BTC when clearly thier are better performing Blockchain on chain and off chain that are cheaper faster more liquid etc... From the arguments I've read in the past they all rely on its scarcity. POW is an outdated consensus. Especially when your comparing it to POS and POC
