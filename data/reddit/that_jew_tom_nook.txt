Someone already suggested this, he suggested we sponsor [Alex Caceres.]( He seems like a [cool dude.](
Heres an [interview](

My new band name!
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:53:18
Ah but overstock has said they now plan to keep some btc.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:47:41
And many older folks didn't trust computers for any kind of transaction until recently. Of course it'll take some time for them to understand it.
@_date: 2014-01-04 21:07:56
You may have said the word 'literally' too many times, but all in all good interview.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:20:11
The Winklevii are gonna sue you just like they sued Zuckerberg!
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:09:10
That explains why I didn't see it
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:03:11
It more so applys to businesses and charities. You can see if they actually have the money they say they do, and see where its going.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:02:40
Some people would work for 2 dollars an hour. For instance while doing on the job training, instead of an internship they could give you low pay. Or maybe for an easy job like sitting on my front porch all day, to make sure no one robs the place. The fact is the minimum wage doesnt do anything to solve poverty, it just disallows people to have easy low paying jobs.
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:43:06
if it helps me avoid taxes then yes
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:13:05
Hmm thats the paper I read and I looked at the funnys, but I mustve not see this one. And no I havent but I did see it on coinmap! Do you know any other place that accepts btc?
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:38:11
Thats where I am! I was just reading the paper before I read this too.. didnt see it though, must be a different newspaper.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:56:43
Yes but imagine ten thousand 90 lb pasty nerds coming at you
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:07:58
You're really well spoken and seem to be pretty objective. You should really do more interviews!
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:42:15
Yeah good point.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:51:01
Yeah, it crashed. But I will legitimately cut off my own dick on camera if it doesnt recover.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:43:29
Someone should mod this in!
@_date: 2014-05-06 20:26:18
Could pay people to clean it
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:47:12
You can now use your digital currency to buy digital crack!

Please join us at r/btc. It doesn't have a huge amount of subs yet, but at least theres no censorship over there
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:59:07
Yeah literally everyone knows that just so you know. But without us, r/bitcoin isnt a community. So people are just letting the mods know we don't like this.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:19:01
One of the main reasons I come here is to see what companies are accepting bitcoin. Are you saying that should be banned?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:13:37
It's beautiful. Nice work dude.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:10:49
A good slang term isn't gonna be decided this way. Millibits? Embees? Ugh... It just sounds too artificial and boring. Its gotta be spontaneous!
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:41:31
18 year old high school graduate. Currently a construction worker. I own 1 bitcoin, plan on buying more.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:21:31
it just fell by like 30 dollars, so you were right!
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:06:49
Okay, I'll come back if it falls to $200.. but not before buying a lot of bitcoin! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:36:44
Didn't he say he would be making an announcement in november?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:19:21
It's bad for governments. Good for people.
@_date: 2013-08-31 03:46:53
It's actually closer to 45k
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:19:17
OP is kinda getting worked up over nothing. He's probably still a good guy though. mpkomara your face should be used as an example in the 'handsome' page on Wikipedia. :^)
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:25:35
you're gonna miss your chance if your expectations are that high! too many people wanting to buy cheap BTC for that to happen.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:16:37
Do it friend. I'm 18 and I make minimum wage. But I invested in bitcoin a couple of months ago and made over $1,000.
