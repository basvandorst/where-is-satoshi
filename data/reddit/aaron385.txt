Thanks to this post and a few others like it recently, I have tried my hand at setting up a node on a VPS at ramnode. With a somewhat crash course in Linux (Ubuntu) plus the scripts linked here, success!
    (Node Stats via python)
It's funded for 3 months.  I had to upgrade to the 1 gig ram package (~$7/mo) to get bitcoind to run stable.  Donations via the stats page would be appreciated!  I'm a total NooB to Linux anything so this was a great reason to learn something new.  Thanks to all who have contributed in this thread.

So let me get this right...  If I owned 13.7 Bitcoins, ~ 1/millionth of all BTC in existence currently, these VC investors just invested $75 in my BTC stash.  That is pretty significant given the current price of BTC.

You can limit the number of connections allowed on the current version which will have some affect on data usage.  Allegedly, future versions of the programs will have bandwidth allocation options like utorrent.  I'm currently seeing about 150 gigs of bandwidth used per month and my ISP supposedly sends the nastygram when usage hits 250 gigs per month.

I am running 0.10.0.rc1 on a new Ubuntu VPS I set up for the good of all mankind:      (stats)
Can verify version using IP @ 
It crashes about twice a day when I allocate only 500megs of Ram to the VPS but it seems to be stable with 1 gig ram and 256 Swap.  I updated to 0.10 during the blockchain download and boy they were not kidding about the new release initially syncing way faster!  Two thumbs up for that improvement.

A good rule of thumb I like is 10% of all assets in physical metals.  Finance wise I consider Bitcoin like physical metals so I lump it into that category.  Therefore it will always be less than 10% of assets because I will also keep buying silver under the 10% threshold.

Been on the wait list for proton mail for some time now...  A month or so.  It surely isn't perfect but it looks like the best solution for your average Joe who doesn't want their entire email history to be so easily "discoverable."  Oh and for those asking what this has to do with Bitcoin, Bitcoin got me interested in cryptography and as I began to understand its use in the Blockchain I started to wonder how else cryptography could improve my life.  That's how I found proton mail.

First I wouldn't "wait" to start running a full node...  I have been hearing about the "better solution" on the horizon for far too long.  Besides, you can upgrade to the latest release whenever you feel like it.  I'm running 0.10.0rc1.
So if you don't control your router you can still make a full node but you will need to run it on a virtual server.  This solution isn't free.  Check out  for a virtual server with at least 1 gig ram and 50 gigs hard drive space, should be ~$5 per month, some take bitcoin.  I use ramnode but there are cheaper solutions.

I like slush pool.  Been hashing there for a while.  I like the new interface and it could stand to benefit from a new logo.  Make sure to check out their interface so you have a good starting point on their visual theme.  You can access an example of the new dashboard from their home page.

Kind of like you are supposed to pay sales tax on stuff you buy out of state on the internet...  which I'm sure has a high percentage of compliance :)
But one serious takeaway is that you should transfer your coins out of coinbase or any other "watched" exchange immediately after purchase.  Do that and there are no capital gains visible.  There will always be a local market, just as with gold and silver.

Ok here is some info on Node running since it has been a hobby of mine for the last few weeks.  I am currently running two full nodes, one locally on an old netbook and the other on a Ram Node VPS for $7/mo.  Each node seems to use 3-5 gigs of Data per day and those stats can be seen for my VPS node here:    
The old Atom single core netbook (circa 2009) seems like the winner price wise.  It was free-ish since I have upgraded and was no longer using it...  It's sitting closed (screen off) on a kill-a-watt meter now with 82 connections drawing between 8-9 watts.  Back when it had only 20 or so connections it was 5-7 watts.  I remote desktop connect to it to view my stats so it can stay in the basement and I don't have to physically mess with it at all.  It took over a week running 0.10.0.rc1 to process the blockchain initially due to the super slow processor but now it coasts under 10-15% CPU load most of the time (Windows 7).
I set the Ubuntu based VPS up using the usual scripts found on r/bitcoin with a few tweaks, like upgrading to 0.10.rc1.  The el-cheapo 512mb ram VPS didn't keep bitcoind running continuously even after the full sync so I had to upgrade to the 1 gig of ram version with 256meg swap.  It's cruising now but I am not ecstatic about the $7 per month charge.  
I purchased an Odroid C1 to build the ultimate low power node but it turns out the ARM chip they use doesn't play well with bitcoind.  It's a similar reason to why you have to run Odroids special version of Ubuntu.  Problem is they don't have their own special compiled version of Bitcoind and my weak sauce Linux skills are not able to get the job done.  So now the C1 sits.. awaiting me finding some other use for it.  If anyone has had success setting up a C1 as a full node, please point me in the right direction!

I disabled windows update so it wont auto reboot itself and with it's 250 gig hard drive it should be good until it dies.  I intend to leave it online until hardware failure or I get a nastygram from Comcast about the data usage.

1. Download the bootstrap of the blockchain over Torrent ( to speed up the inital process (hours instead of days).
   
2. Place bootstrap.dat in /home/user/.bitcoin or %AppData%\Roaming\Bitcoin
3. Download and run the Bitcoin-qt client on a device that is online 24/7.
   
4. Port-forward 8333 from your router to your internal IP.

How do I "Activate" my full node?
@_date: 2015-01-24 15:44:39
You make no money running a full node currently, protocols may change in the future.  There are still a few good reasons to run a full node though.  It's cool, you get to contribute to the health of the bitcoin community more than just filling up r/bitcoin with posts (i.e. warm fuzzy feeling).  You can connect your hot wallet to your own full node and have peace of mind that your transactions are being linked to 100ish other nodes vs. 8.  It's a good excuse to learn some Ubuntu Linux and web server admin with a cheap VPS.  You can see real time network stats if you have them set up like I do on my node here:  
@_date: 2015-01-28 06:27:57
When I put on a Bitcoin shirt and cruise around town, I get people coming up and asking about it.  They have already heard of it and want to know more.  When I talk to people about buying gold and silver it's like they can't (don't want to) grasp the concept.  Its like asking America at large about the internet in 1996...  yea ~35% of them are somewhat familiar with it and less than 5% really know what is going on.

Yea...  that is how I roll.

Running a full node from home can be optimized by ensuring you are on a gigabit connection to the router (helps with 100+ connection days) and also I found my internet became much more desirable when I enabled QoS at the router and set the full node to lowest priority.  Now it moves 300 gigabytes a month with virtually no noticeable difference in my internet performance.  I use to know my full node was down when my internet got noticeably faster/snappier.  Remember an old laptop (free) makes a fine full node by doing nothing more than running Core and forwarding port 8333, even comes with it's own screen.  
If you don't want to mess with your home network, try your hand running a virtual server (~$5 per month).  VPS providers will set up a virtual server for you in a data center that you can hammer away at.  Lowendbox is a good place to find one.  I have a VPS set up with Ramnode running a full node, bandwidth and stats here:

I know it isn't very sexy but you could simply buy an old laptop on craigslist for under $100 and install bitcoin core.  I had an old laptop that was getting no love, now it's a 24/7 full node.  I tried to turn a $35 Odroid into a full node and it was a pain in the ass...  never did get it working.  By the time you add enough memory, power supply, etc, it's nowhere near $35.

Yea the same people who go on and on about how a deflationary currency will never work then turn around and propose a negative interest rate on deposits in the national banking system to encourage spending.  Only problem is cash.  Now I'm seeing "news" articles every week demanding the end of cash.  Cash spending limits are being lowered across the globe.  Cryptocurrency is looking better every day.

I have a full node running on a single core atom netbook from many years ago.  It's far too slow to do anything else useful but it will easily run a full node once synced.  
I also have a VPS running a full node here:     - you can see stats such as data usage if you want to get a better understanding of what it will look like over time.  
@_date: 2015-03-02 12:50:00
Even if you opt out it will only be effective until they update their policy (which they do about once per quarter) and then at that point they will default you back to opted-in for your marketing enjoyment.  You literally need to opt out about once every 90 days of each individual account you have via snail mail.  Ain't nobody got time for that.
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:59:11
Now that you have a Node up and running, consider setting up a stats page like mine:  
Not that it helps the community or anything but it is a much easier way to keep track of your node status and data usage.

The netbook is usually less than 20% CPU usage (initial sync was pegged at 100% for about a week).  The netbook is running nothing more than bitcoin core with port 8333 forwarded.  The stats on the link I posted are generated by my VPS (a different node) running on Ubuntu.  The recipe for that is located here:

Yea, every birthday that has come along in the last few months, I have sent my friends $20 on coinbase (to their e-mail).  It seems to make the hassle of setting up an account worth it for them.  It seems to go over better than a stupid gift card though I do get some bitching on occasion.  
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:17:54
Consider this, you have two barriers of entry to the outside world in a typical home setup.  There is the firewall of the router and the software firewall of the individual PCs.  Your best choice to run a full node at home would be from a separate computer running a different OS.  Consider perhaps a raspberry Pi or an old netbook with Ubuntu linux running a bitcoin node and all other devices on the network are macs/windows machines.  Very low probability of sideways attack even if the Bitcoin node server is compromised (because those different devices wouldn't talk to each other even if you wanted them to).  
Oh and BTW, I have not seen any reports of bitcoin core becoming compromised by having port 8333 open.  YMMV  If it ever happens I am pretty sure the community will hear about it.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:08:36
Yea I mean think of small tweaks to existing wallets that will make all the difference...  a "Luddite mode" option if you will.  Coinbase could do it easily with their USD wallets, just instant convert any sent BTC to USD (in Luddite mode).  When you send the person $20 worth of BTC they will get exactly $20 USD into their simple PayPal-resembling wallet.  Bring on the sea of Luddites!  
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:02:07
Check  for deals, I'm running a node on a $7/mo VPS right now.  Do realize the lowest end boxes they provide generally don't work as a node.  You will want at least 1 gig of ram, 40 gigs (or more) of hard drive space, and 1TB bandwidth.

As I understand it, malware on the blockchain poses no risk to us since no part of the blockchain is executable.  It might set off a malware detection flag if scanned with a program for detecting bad stuff but you can just add an exception and move on with life.

Both my nodes got crashed this weekend due to too many connections I think.  My locally run netbook node which crashed Friday is now having to rebuild the blockchain which will take most of this week for it's comically slow atom processor to accomplish.  
My VPS node crashed this morning at 125 connections and is now back online after a reboot.  Stats here:  
If you are running bitcoin core please forward port 8333 on your router and ensure you are seeing &gt;8 connections in the Debug window.

This worked after installing cURL on my Ubuntu VPS:  
I needed an excuse to log in and update to rc4 anyways!  I didn't need to mess with the index file or http in any way because I already had the donation BTC address on the home page (see link above).  
Anything to encourage new nodes to come online is awesome in my book!
