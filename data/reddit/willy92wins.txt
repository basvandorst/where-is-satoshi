I didnt say anything about safety, and you certainly  shouldn't trust anyone without proof, that is even the principle of bitcoin, but in this case you can easily check for yourself if the hardware has been tampered. One upside of local resellers is that they have a higher accountability if the hardware has any flaws or has been modified with malitious intempts.

good luck regulating a self regulated and de-centralized blockchain. All governments can do is regulate exchanges or banks, but that only incentivices individuals to become BTC traders themselves, since regulation/prohibition only increases the BTC prices locally in the black/grey market

@_date: 2017-12-22 10:01:02
That doesnt stop people from using alternative methods of payment, like sending funds to a phone number, finding alternative banks which wont block the transactions or just trading in cash. It also incentivizes them to start offering their habilities or goods for BTC directly instead of in fiat (just like its happening on countries like India or Venezuela). The prohibiton itself and the banks blocking money sent to/from exchanges will just make BTC price higher (less offer and abt same demand), which is a even bigger incentive to find a way around that for economical actors.

In fact you are the one using a ad verecundiam fallacy claiming you know economics because you have a certain title, while you think (and incorrectly state) the market is a consensual hallucination. This shows you dont understand shit about economics, no matter what private/political entity you have paid to give you a title (be it a master or not). Claiming your arguments are valid because you have a certain title is the way you **don't** discuss if youre trying to be logical.
PD: I didnt even ad hominem as an answer to your comment, I discussed and answered you comment:


and then described the situation


I never even tried to rebate your argument with a ad hominem phallacy, i just rebated it with logic and then called you out as an ignorant. Maybe you should also study more debate on top of studying good economics ;)

Hi OP, I think creating a public poll will allow you to record/check/analyze your results in an easier way. Anyway, here are my answers:
1. I did come into the market during the previous bull run and had to watch BTC falling from +1k to barely over 100 usd (as probably the great majority of investors did, manu people come into crypto during hype cycles).
2. I has used BTC before on some deep web wabepages but for me it has just value as medium of exchange (I kinda saw it like WOW gold). Once I saw the market was pumping hard, I forced myself to read the Whitepaper and its echonomical implications (since I come from an IT background my knowledge abt money was limited), and finally started to glimpse the huge distuptions this technology could cause.
3. I have traded many times, but finally decided against daily trading because of how much commitment it required, now im only swing trading.
4. Bitcoin will probably become a strong alternative over strong fiat during next inflationary cycles to come, just as we are observing now with weaker currencies (specially in South América and Africa).
5. My biggest concerns are 2; deflationary cycles once BTC becomes mainstream, and the small (but true) probability of BTC community not beeing able to reach a consensus once the next Hard Fork is required, so the value of the asset will end up really dilluted throughout many forks

I didn't say so. I just implied that inherent fiat price instability (always going downwards) is a incentive for people to move over to another currency that might also be of unstable value, but increasing instead of decreasing (inflationary vs deflationary) . Maybe you could put a little bit more of effort to read between the lines ;)

Yet you can make fungible bitcoin transactions with Wasabi wallet or Lighting network, so you can achieve monero anonimity witout using XMR. On the other hand you NEED another crypto which has touring complete language for smart contracts, since BTC rsk contracts won't be touring complete. There are other examples of blockchain implementations thath you can't achieve with BTC's blockchain, like Siacoin's decentralized memory loaning for example. This is why even though BTC is and will probably be the most important coin, there will always be other useful coins/tokens (hence not shitcoins)

So many inacuracies in your post i dont even know where to start, but let me tear it apart:


This literally causes bubbles since it incentivates investing no matter what or where as long as you think results are gonna be less bad than inflation and at the same time is stealing from citizens, specially from ones with retirement plans.


something beeing a norm doesnt mean its good


Deflation encourages saving over spending, lending is also incentivized this way, since x coins today are worth less than tomorrow, then lending with small interest rates is possible (the deflation is enough incentive).
Other advantages of deflation are:
-costs of living decreasing
-making a business becomes cheaper
-commodities prices decrease (cheaper food, goods, tools)
-long term innovation becomes more important to incentivize people to spend
plus a long list of other advantages


prices wont be fixed because offer and demand are both dynamic.

Honest question, do really you think all coins beside bitcoin are shitcoins?
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:50:57
Let me explain you something. Fiat money doenst work in long periods of time contrary to your statements. Bitcoin only needs to work in long time periods as a better reserve of value (and does allready) to replace usd. This is because you are not the one deciding the criteria a currency should meet for other people switch to it, people decide individually. And the masses will eventually jump to the best reserve of value (fixed offer) rather than the most inflationary one. Both logic and history are enough evidence.

Depends on for what. There are many simple TA strategies that would have made you win more money on BTC than just hodling (for example MACD crossing). When you say they "dont work", you are beeing blunt and not even thinking about what youre saying. They dont work for what purpose? Having a 100% efficiency trading? No strategy will give you that. But what you can assure with mathematical data is that hodling is NOT the best strategy, and following certain TA indicators is better than just buying and hodling through &gt;80% dips

No, they dont. They might use threat of violence through regulation to FORCE the cost down, but negotiation as such doesnt happen.


This is a false dichotomy fallacy. There are way more options, like for example make everybody pay for their own stuff AND in case somebody can't afford them, then giving them a check only valid for medicines for example. This way they themselves can buy it. Also the level of demagoguery in your answer is so huge i cant barely believe that you could even consider this line as an argument. ¿Who besides you talked about using taxes to kill ppl overseas? 


The taxes is not a binary argument (pro tax or anti tax), is more of a quantity and optimization issue. Governments could collect way more or way less taxes, but the most productive way money can be spent is by its owner, not by the state.

YOU are the one arguing on basis of this supposition, I'm the one who is just plainly stating things are NOT this way now, and there are not any public plans to change this.


You were the one to bring up Wasabi, i never mentioned it as a good privacy tool. There are better methods to anonymize btc than with coinjoin tx (i specifically mentioned mixers). 


Even if you were refering to node level, youre still wrong. LN is very cheap and easy to install even as a node. You just have to download and execute a binary app and that is everything required except for any microsoft/apple/linux OS, the space for the blockchain and an internet connection:


If you were familiar at a technical level, you'd know that if 33-byte schnorr public keys were to be implemented, and the eliptic curve digital signature algorithm was changed for a schnorr algorithm, this will provide full anonomity.


Then talk no further, since all BTC is more fungible than any other phisical currency (and those are allready considered fungible by anybody with a basic knowledge echonomics).

isnt it actually the 20M club since satoshi has/had 1M BTC which probably wont ever come back into circulation?

The assumption is based on a game theoretical model. As a hard fork will be required for this, a great majority of the network would have to "vote" in favor of the fork by forking themselves. But at the same time this devaluates their hodlings. So we assume people will continue to act in a way that profits them in the long run.

I disagree. You are mixing up reserve of value with means of exchange. Bitcoin is not a good means of exchange since its very volatile. Bitcoin has been a better reserve of value than any other asset if you count since it's inception. If bitcoin surges becaue people hold it as a reserve of value, then it will eventually reach a higher volume and market cap, this liquidity will eventually bring volatility down. With volatility down bitcoin will be a better mean of exchange, and probably will be more accepted in this fashion. So what we really need is to succeed as a reserve of value, to then succeed as a means of exchange

Accepting btc with a "dark history" is not illegal in any democratic country, and probably wont ever be.


This is simply not true, mixing dies help achieve 100% anonymity as long as you don't reuse wallet addresses 


You wish. LN apps are free on app store, quite inutitive to use and tx costs are less than a cent. How is that too expensive? 


You probably should read a little bit about schnorr signatures 


The solution for what? If youre talking about instant, borderless, cheap and pseudonimous transactions (soon to be anonymous) then yes, BTC is in fact the answer

Same thing could happen with usd bank transfers if a criminal got caught and his accounts would be audited. Would you say usd is not fungible?
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:14:22
I dont believe it, Im certain. Bitcoin as a protocol is hardcoded so bitcoins are fungible, because the rules don't enforce any check on comparing one satoshi/btc to another, else layer 2 protocols like lightning couldnt work. For example if a new state for channel is signed by both parties and the channel is closed, the network doesnt "pick" one bitcoin/sat over another, it will always consider 1 btc = 1 btc (obviously) which is literally what fungibility means.
Edit: Another way of proving that there is no fungibility is that you cant track a specific satoshi over the blockchain. If I receive 100 msats to my pub address (with some unspent outputs) and i send 100 msats shortly after receiving them, there is not any way of telling if the sats i sent forward are the same i received to the same public address, because they are fungible.

Nice try IRS
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:25:10
Its a simple point, which you would have understood if you read between lines. If you wanna measure offer variability you have to study inflation/deflation of such asset, which is the best measure to compare offer increases/decreases, not divisibility.
@_date: 2019-12-11 17:18:48
I get your point, which is a good one, but imho this is pushing too far the definition of fungibility. I could also argue that people wouldn't accept a dollar stolen from a bank, or used for nefarious acts. Since the value of goods is subjective, then we could carry on and argue there is not such a thing as a 100% fungible asset, since certain individuals could not want to trade equal assets as if they had the same value. But in the broader sense, normal btc users wont even ask where their btc came from, both if they bought/traded them at a centralized or p2p market. Also taking into account the low txfees, then we can assure operations like bitcoin mixing, lightning transactions,  are really easy to carry out and have a better fungibility than any other good known.
@_date: 2019-12-11 11:54:16
Fungibility is a must for pseudinomity in btc.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:36:46
Are you dumb or trolling? Just stop making up ridiculous statements. OP was talking about money vs BTC and specifically about FINITE vs INFINITE (scarcity was not mentioned once). You can't create bitcoin excluding the hardcoded ~21M Bitcoins. You can create any other thing in the universe, hence OP is right and youre only a hater trying to make stupid statements.


Practically every magnitude is infinitely divisible mr Einstein, because that is a inherent quality of decimal numbers.

divisibility =/= inflationary offer

I found this interview very helpful since it actually talks about inflation and what it's expected to happen in a not far future:
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:30:50


You keep mixing concepts, im taling about land, not houses. Land IS scarce, specially in good locations. Even if you increase population density (building more accomodations/m^2), that phisical scarcity will still exist.
BTW, purchasing a m2 of land in Ginza (one of the best zones in Tokyo) is over 360000 usd, while in the most expensive zone of a city with 10 times less populartion is around 4500usd. This illustrates exactly my point. Bigger demand, bigger Price per m^2. Thats why if demand is expected to increase in the long run, then the real estate prices will follow
@_date: 2019-04-22 11:35:10
Honestly curious; In what way do you think Real estate is a Ponzi? 
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:52:32
I think you aren't understanding my main point. Offer is limited because space in cities is limited. This has no relation with ponzi schemes, its merely a phisical size issue of cities; you can keep building houses but only on the outskirts, since downtown cities are allready populated. Land is not fungible, thats why good land locations will always keep increasing (as long as population keeps increasing), and not because of a piramid scheme

Same here with expedia, getting so many spam emails from them after using them once.
@_date: 2019-04-24 11:55:15
Sorry i took so long to answer but i wanted to read your post calmly and address all of it.


In this case the profits are indeed coming from product sales, the real state itself. Smart investors know the profit comes from restrained offer (number of flats available in downtown of a big city is aproximately the same over time) and increase in demand (population growth and rural exodus).


There is no illusion of this except on uneducated investors. People with basic notions in echonomy know how offer/demand work. Smart house buyers know the profit come from increase of valuation as a result of this


Of course this will happen, since the global population and city populartion is on an increase and not expected to decrease in any terms, and its obious that offer will more or less move sideways
@_date: 2019-04-22 11:15:39
Real state also has market cycles, anybody with half a neurone will acknowledge that, but also we both know that once the next crisis comes and finishes, real state prices in populares cites will reach ath once again, since the offer is severely limitated, whole demand is naturally increasing. Just zoom out on the historic charts
@_date: 2019-04-22 10:07:34
The fact that spanish economy and job market is hyperregulated and with the highest fiscal effort in europe (hence failing), and having a high spending ratio which causes a public deficit has nothing to do with ordinary people finding a workaround to inflation and low interest rates buying assets that usually dont devaluate in Price over time.
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:47:56


One of the goals is beeing a peer to peer trustless means of exchange. But bitcoin is also based on previous projects which are cited on the whitepaper. One of those is Bit Gold by Nick Szabo, which is according to it's cited creator "a collectible market based mechanism for inflation control". Satoshi also admits in the whitepaper (point 6. Incentives) that he wants bitcoin to be inflation free (hence a reserve of value): 
"Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free."


If everyone is willing to hold btc, then they will also be ready to sell other currencies for btc, hence making then demand will go up. With a fixed offer its easy to guess what will happen to price in this case.


You're making a subjective statement. The truth is that the value of something in fact IS subjective, and many people will give it value for other reasons. Anyway the price will always objetiveley be the cross of offer/demand, so as long as people are demanding bitcoin, it doesnt matter if they want to use it as a means of exchange or as a reserve of value.


I completely agree. Low/fixed offer doesnt mean anything will have a good demand hence a high price. But as stated previously, the demand can happen for many reasons, not just for the reason you expect.
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:15:42
That's a good question. As an example, Spain is one of the 1st world countries that suffered more inflationary issues with its previous currency, the peseta. This caused people to start intesting in real estate. Now Spain is the country in the world where there is one of the highest % of people owning their own house (over 70%). People always end up finding a way to spend their money in assets that dont devaluate. Nowadays, Spain is also one of the countries in europe with more BTC penetration
@_date: 2019-04-24 18:47:34


This just shows you didnt understand my statement. Land is NOT fungible, so the total quantity of land is not important (unless you think 1m^2 in sahara desert is as desirable and should have the same price as 1m^2 in Tokyo). Land in downtown capital cities for example is way more limited (fixed offer) while global population increases (growing demand) this is what you are failing to undertand, when its totally a free market action (maybe not 100% because perfect competition and total free market are unobtainable, but pretty close). 


Its your duty to back up your claims showing evidence. Specially when you are claming some kinng of global manipulation over the best terrains worldwide

innovation requires somebody to save money. If a corporation or a person wants to start a profitable project, then its better to get some leverage than to save money for the project, since you'll be losing a cost of opportunity while you save money

You make a statement, yet dont show evidence. In what way is cash inefficient? I can of curse agree with you that Fiat cash is inefficient, but a currency pegged to a stable value (doesnt necesarily have to be gold) isnt inefficient by itself
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:33:39
you keep changing your point. The original statement was "youre free to spend your cash as you decide" I have proved it wrong. Now you say its inefficient, which is not true, since without cash we wouldnt be able to trade efficiently, and that is exactly the biggest use case for cash (medium of exchange).
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:37:53


That's called constraint, not freedom. BTW the majority of people living nowadays in the world can't chose the society they live on, since many countries dont even recognise the right to independence/disassociation. (including many EU countries, USA, and great part of the rest of the world) Also the great majority of people in the world arent even able to legally emigrate out of the home countries, or just dont have enough resources to do so.


It is as efficient to cash than using credit cards. The only potential loss of efficiency with cash is when storing it (inflation, money decaying or breaking over time, etc...), not while using it.


You keep confusing spending with saving, we were only talking about spending cash, yet you tried to change your initial argument and turn it against hedging cash. I could just have my value invested in gold (or any other good reserve value) and sell for any currency whenever I want to purchase something. This is not inefficient per-se as long as youre not getting ripped off while exchanging from one source of value to another
@_date: 2019-05-07 09:10:20
