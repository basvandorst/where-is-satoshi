I'm just assuming, but, a 1996 NSA report surfaced, ‘predicting’ a crypto-cyber unit eerily close to Bitcoin. So eerily close, that, knowing their M.O., the question arises whether this report is a prediction, or a plan.

What you did there, I see it.

TOR is open source. Doesn't mean they don't know how to extract info from the original source destination and manipulate it. TOR was created by the Navy as well.

I don't get it. What did he say that wasn't fact? Serious question. Bitcoin is still very, very small. [Anyway, see here](  
  
EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes. You guys are fanboys that have no idea about bitcoin. You blind little punk ass cheerleaders.

When I wrote 'evolve', I meant adding security features and other things where volatility of such a currency should keep prices steady (think of multi-sigs, 51% attack, mining monopolies, bitcoin-to-fiat comparison measurements, etc..). But why would you be opposed to having a fiat-like cryptocurrency? How do you think countries would efficiently run their countries without fiat-like protocols? Think about taxes and it's uses. Who's going to fund that pothole in front of your house if noone wants to contribute? If you like government transparency, imagine if they didn't use a fiat-like crypto and decided to do malicious activity threatening everything you love about freedom behind the scenes (not that they don't do that today, but at least for most of the things, there's records of every transaction). Also, who says you wont be able to use cryptocurrencies anonymously? I think that will not go anywhere. There will be many cryptocurrencies which you can use to achieve that. I think the future will have both centralized and decentralized currencies and they will coexist simultaneously and for different purposes.

I've always said. Satoshi Nakamoto is NSA. That's just a bullshit Japanese name.

His proposal is cryptocurrency. You should listen to him because he's incredibly intelligent and Greece's track record has nothing to do with him (unless you're talking about the 3 months he's been finance minister -- which still doesn't mean anything). There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies in this world with new ones coming out every-other day. Bitcoin is not the end-all be-all solution to world issues (think of the 51% attack scenario), but cryptocurrencies are without a doubt the future. Everyone will be using multi-cryptocurrencies for various types transactions. Cryptocurrencies needs to evolve and everyone needs to listen to the criticisms instead of stuffing their heads in the sand like a bunch of childish fanboys.

Actually you're wrong. Yanis Varoufakis loves cryptocurrency. He's proposed his own version that solves a few issues that people and governments have with it.

50/50 because in reality, nobody has any real idea. They can only speculate.

It seems at this point, you don't want to believe in truth. You just want to live a lie. That's your choice. The proof is everywhere. It's already a known thing. You must be new to bitcoin. You should start with the resources provided to you on the sidebar in this subreddit. I also suggest you use Google to learn more.

Someone owns 51%. We know this. What we don't know is when he'll use it against us. Who is he? Is it Satoshi himself? Or is Satoshi just a front for an alphabet agency? We don't know, but what we do know is the chances can go either way, hence 50/50.
