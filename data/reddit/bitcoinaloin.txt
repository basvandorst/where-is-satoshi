Tempting amount of btc, I think you did the right thing contacting the owner. The right thing from the owner would be to give you a reward because you could have just sweeped the btc to your wallet and be gone with it!

Anyone know why the classic nodes suddenly dropped?
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:17:30
No, idiot! (Facepalms) you can't use a satoshi to buy one bitcoin block, you have to first hash the miners and decentralisation!!

Yeah, I am sure. But as human nature I can also be wrong :) I don't believe in ethereum succeeding in the long term (10 years), but time will tell

I take money of the table every month. I move my euro-fiat-currency to the most immutable ledger there is. I prefer Bitcoin over the premined, no proof of work, centralized and no coin cap currency called euro.
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:15:22
There really is just one blockchain which is the bitcoin blockchain. It is the most immutable and has the most hashing power behind it.

People mistakenly say "just hold" when talking about altcoins, the only thing you should just hold is bitcoin. Only bitcoin matters

Left one up and right one down?
@_date: 2017-01-20 07:18:46
If it is good I would donate some btc to you
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:27:49
Drama and fud in bitcoin is your friend, more time to hoard bitcoins to yourself.

Doesn't matter bitcoin is superior to everything. positive news or negative news who cares. Bitcoin works.

Memorize the seed, no one can pull them from your head.
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:07:27
This is not a good idea. Recovery seeds should kept offline for obvious security reasons

What is centralized?
@_date: 2016-09-21 10:13:34
It will go up then down then up again and then down and after that up

Can you tell us why?
@_date: 2017-04-04 14:23:04
I could have bought more btc. I wouldn't have made any "money" because who would be so stupid to exchange bitcoins for fiat ? :Dd

Trezor gives you the 24 word combination on the trezor device. I don't know about the technical stuff

Genesis mining is a scam, all cloud mining is a scam

Their BU coins would be worthless thats what holding them back from hard forking. This all feels like a stalling tactic.. UASF ! BIP148 ftw power to the users
@_date: 2016-10-01 10:27:10
Correct answer would have been onecoin? :D
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:56:42
Interesting read, good points. I believe we can and have to scale on-chain and at the same time develope off-chain solutions.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:05:58
Have my upvote sir!

100k bitcoin would be great
@_date: 2017-05-06 07:44:26
Do you think btc will be higher in 2 years or your long term hodl timeframe, if yes buy now.
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:18:22
Relax, buy the dip. Segwit will get activated with BIP148
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:12:00
UASF ftw! Activate segwit and lets then look at hardforking for a bigger blocksize
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:10:11
Where do you hodl? Do you work anymore ?
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:13:30
I will after core release full node software that supports it. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:10:46
I am with you buddy! Budget everything and put all extra money into btc. Fuck scam fiat money
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:03:19
Lol wall of text. Good read nevertheless. :D I hope you in the past sees this and buys more 
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:15:18
I will update myself if not before July
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:51:12
Well nothing is certain. So it's smart to use words like if when there are many possible outcomes
