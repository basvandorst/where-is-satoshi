Sure it does, fiat is inflationary, BTC is not. Conventional wisdom says spend fiat, not BTC. 


With Fiat. 


Incorrect, you would compare its revenue to its cost of energy consumption. If revenue is greater than the cost of energy consumption, its a good decision, one that allows you the means of spending fiat to produce BTC at a more discounted rate than you can buy it at. 


You would absolutely pay for that in dollars. No question about it. 


That statement is only true if the determination is that the mine produces less gold than you can buy with dollars today. You have no way of determining that to be a fact. 


Some of us quite literally cannot short or long BTC as those avenues have been closed off to us. Also, you're speaking about hindsight again. I could theoretically go back in time and open up a 100X short at 19,900, but it wouldn't have theoretically stayed open until the bottom, it would have closed several times, so I'd have had to have been secure and timed it "just right" several times, including the deadcat bounce which really wrecked everyone taking leveraged positions. 
However, we don't live in a theoretical world where we make the perfect trades for 18 months in a row. We live in a world where you quite literally missed your window to short, and I *DID NOT* Miss my window to mine. So your dogged rhetoric here is serving no other purpose than to get your own blood pumping about how smart you *would have been* had you acted on hindsight. 


Incorrect. If you spent 20,000 to physically acquire miners on December 17th, 2017,  or 20,000 on BTC, who would be the clear winner today? The miner, by a mile!
The problem you're really having with this thought experiment, is that you keep talking about buying the equpment in BTC, which is a finite value in our consideration. Whereas when you buy equipment in Fiat to mine BTC, the value is much more complex. 1BTC on 12/17/17 was nearly $20,000. A year later, it was $3,600. 1BTC will always be 1BTC, but 1BTC might not always be $20,000, as we all learned.

@_date: 2019-07-08 09:44:36


You keep framing the argument like you're going to spend twice as much to purchase the equipment as its worth. That's just not the case. 
Example: Had you purchased an antminer on December 17th, 2017 for the $1600 or whatever it cost at that time, you'd have 10x'd your investment, which would otherwise be worth, what? $960 today if you had purchased BTC instead? Your "logic" is defeated, again. 


Apparently its quite impossible for you to understand some very basic applications to this thought problem, like what happens when the price goes down? Every time I give you a scenario where your logic because flawed, you move the goal posts and insert hindsight. "Oh, well I'd have 100x'd my short position then", right, allow me to roll my eyes further. 
Also, how hard is it for *YOU* to understand that I write-off 100% of my mining equipment? 
I get it, you vehemently oppose mining, despite the fact that its literally the core requirement for this entire system to run. Without it, this entire thing grinds to a halt, and all value is lost. At which point I must remind you that the miner, again, would benefit the most because he'd at least have some scrap value in that scenario. 
I know you're not going to stop arguing anytime soon, just understand that not only is your logic completely flawed, opinion completely wrong, and the whole basis of your argument moot, but your'e quite literally creating your own scenarios where the only outcome is your flawed logic coming out on top, and even those are being defeated by counter-logic. 
Move on guy.

You shouldn't. 


This is extremely wrong and I've explained why a dozen times already. Also, the fact that you ignorantly claim that it can't be done even with free electricity is just mind boggling at how little you actually know about mining. 


If you avoid purchasing ASICs until after they go on sale, you're already getting them significantly below cost.  Also Bitmain is morons, that's why they basically failed and had to pivot their business model. 
Also, I'm not sure how many times I need to state this for it to impact your logic enough to stop your argument dead in its tracks, but I completely write off 100% of my hardware. Period. This means that if I spend $2,000,000 on hardware, I get to write-off $2,000,000 against any income for my business. 
Most importantly, your assertion that free energy wouldn't make up the difference is absolutely the dumbest thing I've heard. Technological improvements haven't increased that drastically to phase out the ability for these machines to still submit accepted shares and perform their functions on the algorithm, even several generations old.

At some point your'e going to let loose this idea that you're buying them in BTC. Also, since it was profitable to mine all the way down to our bottom this year, it was far and beyond the better choice, unless you're suggesting that everyone could have sold the top and bought the bottom, without hindsight being 20/20 of course. 
Hell, I'll give you 1BTC right now if you can show me your trading account that shows only a sell order on December 17th 2017, and no buy orders until, lets say December 17th 2018-March 30th 2019, with no sells in between, and no sells since.

The major components are the cards, and they'll range between 250-700 per card depending on make and model number. With today's fall, an average 6 card rig on the Nvidia side with higher end units, will bring in about $8-10 a day in profit. An RX580 rig from the AMD side will bring in about $4.75-$5.15 per day in profit. 
The Nvidia's generally create more revenue and use less wattage, but cost more initially to setup. The AMDs are much cheaper but require more attention to setup and get running correctly. Resale value falls to the nvidia side considerably. 
If I were to build a cheap and powerful miner today, I'd try to find a deal on some RX580 8g's, slap a cheap Celeron processor on a B250 mining expert board with 8g ram, run her on SMOS and call it good. Hope ETH goes up by the time I start selling to cover costs.

And the math shows that the miner would yield more BTC, quite clearly. 
However, you still need to disengage from the purchase of a miner being done in BTC. 


Yes because as you said, we won't know the price of BTC 12 months from now, so we can't pretend to also determine its difficulty increasing or lowering.
Lets actually do some forensics, shall we?
Prior to our last uptick in difficulty, our last peak difficulty was....
October 4th, 2018. Difficulty of 7,454,968,648,263. Our hashrate, back then, 53,364,744,228 GH/s.
Today, June 14th, 2019 we have a difficulty of 7,459,680,720,542, and a hashrate of 55,994,234,000 GH/s.
Just six months ago, December 18th, 2018  we had a difficulty of 5,106,422,924,659, and a hashrate of 36,553,199,102 GH/s. 
So yes, I'm not going to make **ANY** speculations based on future difficulty and hashrate.
But please, tell me more about how I, as a miner, and you as a non-miner, should be operating my business.

This is vehemently wrong, and I'm not sure how to best convey that point to you. Mining is more than just BTC, and as long as BTC is the flagship value, new currency being trading on the BTC pair are awarded inherent value due to the minimum value of 1 satoshi. As long as those coins can be mined, there will always be value in mining. 


That's a seriously flawed logic, there. Most mining farms around the world have pretty ridiculously cheap energy, including my own. Further, there's more to mining than just BTC, and any farm mining ONLY BTC or even only mining with ASICS on SHA-256 are asking to be pushed out of the market. I've been operating for years without having to shut down my farm, nor the miners in my own home on much more expensive energy. As old hardware is phased out of the market due to technological advances, there is always a proportionate adjustment to nethash. Conversely, with GPUmining, you're mining coins that are traded against the BTC pair, and often times asic resistant, so there's always profit to be made to secure the chain, doubly so if BTC is thriving. 


Mining hardware is not being restricted by Bitmain at all, and they are not the sole supplier of miners. Further, they have ALWAYS adhered to the practice of mining on new equipment for quite some time before selling the machines off as "new" to the public as they develop and roll out their new equipment. However, with the last 16 months of damage to Bitmain, they are effectively dead in the water as a major supplier going forward. As far as being shafted buying hte gear due to inflated prices, that's where writing it off comes into play as a business model. Its simply equipment, and most countries allow for this, at least the big players do. 


I'm sorry, this is just an absolute asinine statement. First, there is no such thing as free electricity, lets get that out of our system. Second, your math regarding equipment investment is wildly inaccurate. If I spend 10 BTC on mining equipment, and write off 7.5BTC of it, and mine 9 BTC, I've net 6.5BTC. Also, If I did theoretically have "free" energy, which doesn't exist, I'd indefinitely make money until the difficulty was so high that the equipment quite literally could not function to hash, which would be the better part of a decade at this point, even with the current nethash increase. The actual return on the equipment, by the way, is much higher than earning 9 btc for a 10btc expense. I don't know that I've ever owned any machine that hasn't at least tripled its investment for me, and I"ve owned some pretty inefficient ones in my day!


Or, you have no fucking clue about the profitability of mining as it is, and don't know what you're talking about. I don't know, perhaps you're from a different country who has ridiculously expensive electricity and cannot be mined in. Here in the US, unless you live in a major population center, you could quite literally buy an ASIC off the shelf and expect to turn a profit on it paying even residential rates (on average) pretty much anywhere in the country.  Your whole perspective of "Doom and gloom" with mining is just incorrect and ill-informed.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:20:39


Honestly, I'm surprised you could make this statement after reading my post, as it has the entirely opposite effect of what I wrote to you. 


Correct, I still have to pay for it up front with Capital, which is then written off 100% at the end of the year if I've made at least that much mining, that year. 






The generation of taxable goods is separate from writing off the equipment. 


I have no way to predict that, as bitcoin difficulty has been historically unpredictable. We could even go down, again. We could even go exponential, again. 
The reality is probably going to be less dramatic than either you or I think, as the current bulk of machines on the network today are nearing unprofitable territories, but also signaled the "end" of mass production from manufacturers like Bitmain and Innosilicon. If we don't have any technological breakthroughs soon, we'll plateau once these machines fall off. 


Yes, lets do that. 


This has been your major flaw since the beginning. You're not buying the S17 in BTC, you're buying it in fiat. You're converting Fiat into a machine that converts electricity into BTC.
Even if we used *yesterdays* BTC price of 8200, you'd be at the BTC purchase equivalent of .28 BTC, and earns .002BTC per day in PROFIT, which would take roughly 140 days to earn back that .28BTC investment, long before June of Next Year when we expect the next halving. 


If you take electric costs out, it would earn closer to $17.50/day, or .0021 BTC/day, or roughly 133 days. You'd effectively have it paid back by Christmas, and have the next 6 months to mine, for free. 
Also, its important to note, that so long as a machine can submit shares on free electricity, it will **ALWAYS** be profitable to run. 
But yes, please do cease this utterly unproductive discussion. 
 even when its actually delivered by the end of august and even without having electricity costs.
@_date: 2019-06-14 05:18:19


That's a great story, however, its not reality. 
Block rewards might be fixed, but the value of those block rewards are not, at least not in 2019. Also, your flawed reality exists under the notion that old machinery stays on the network, and it doesn't. As newer, more power, yet more efficient machines enter the network, they are simply replacing the older, less efficient units. There is always profit to be made. 


Do you live in an area where electricity is expensive? Why are you continuing to comment about free/negative cost electricity, which simply doesn't exist at scale today and isn't being used? Furthermore, why do you think it needs to be free for mining to make sense? I pay 5.3c/kwh and deeply profit every single day, my energy doesn't need to be free or negative. 
You are correct, however, I simply do not "get" what it is you're trying to say, because what you're trying to say seems to be a fairy tale that only you can perceive. 


Again, your logic here is deeply flawed. One, ASIC resistance isn't a myth, ASICS CANNOT keep up with humans' ability to tweak an algorithm and completely brick an ASIC, especially so if the team behind the project puts an emphasis on being ASIC resistant. I can give you dozens of examples today of profitable, anti-asic coins that you can mine with your GPU today and ensure that you'll always be free of asic computation in the future. Also, the idea that it can be mined "better" with ASIC's, is also flawed. Its not about the most efficient path to mining an algorithm, its about cultivating and maintaining the highest total of miners securing the network, keeping the project decentralized. That is why we focus on asic-resistant algorithms and constantly fork the coins. 
Lastly, you are not competing with "free" GPU's of gamers at all. They still had a cost themselves, but ultimately their cost of hardware isn't the competition point, its the cost of energy and the comparative profit they earn. Having a million gamers using their single GPU's to secure a network at 50c/day does wonders for my nearly 400 GPU's securing the network daily, more points of security is a win for all. 


I'm not wrong at all. Someone has to pay for the turbines, transformers, power lines, and solar panels. Just because you have periods of cheap, free or even negative cost electricity doesn't mean you're not paying for it somewhere else. For instance, if the government subsidizes the electric company and offers this radical deal to you, you're paying for it with your tax dollars taken out of your paycheck. Conversely, if this were true, I'd abuse the shit out of the system and only operate when getting paid to operate or when it was free, and I"d literally pickup all the **FREE** ASICs being tossed in the trash around the world. 
Again, a fairytale scenario. 


Then you need to go input the data into a calculator, because I assure you, I profit quite heavily from paying for my electricity, and I don't get it for free or negatively priced, and would make a fortune more than I am now since its my literal biggest expense. 


This is inherently false and shows a total misunderstanding of how pools work. As long as your hardware can submit just a single share to the pool, you'll get rewarded for it every time the pool pays out its shares. Of course this differs between PPS and PPLNS but long term will be very similar in payment. You're also failing to consider the price, too. 
As an example, for the last 4 months profits have steadily increased month after month with the same hardware, yet difficulty and hashrate have gone up. How can this be? Its because the price of bitcoin has gone up........which is something you're ignoring entirely. Price, more than anything, dictates profitability and my willingness to mine a project. 


First, I did make a profit, not "I think I made a profit". Second, I was not lucky getting some retail asics. Third, why would I buy asics in BTC to mine BTC? BTC is deflationary, fiat is Inflationary, it would make quite literally **ZERO FUCKING SENSE** to buy miners with BTC when I can buy them with fiat. 
As for what they actually do, they build the machines, mine on them until they get to the point where they will become unprofitable in 12-18 months, and then sell them as "new" to "retail" miners, who will buy them and turn a small profit from them, some more than others, depending on their electric costs, and repeat over and over again. This is why being a manufacturer of mining equipment is so lucrative, because you're milking the best parts of the profit from the start, and then letting them go for what you built them for, and recouping all of your R&amp;D costs. This is also why ASIC's aren't a smart investment, and why they aren't the best route for mining, despite being efficient at what they do. GPU's will always be the best investment for mining because their primary market isn't mining, and the secondary market is expensive and plentiful!

Okay, its super clear now that you don't get the idea of a tax-write-off or what it means. 
Quite literally if I spend $1.2M in machinery, I write it off, completely on my taxes, meaning I spent 1.2M up front, and counted it against my income at the end of the year. As I understand it, you eurofolk don't get all of the same luxuries in that department, but here in America, the equipment is effectively free. I'm not paying ANYTHING for my machinery come tax time, unless I make less than the machinery is worth, in which case I'd likely take a 5-7 year deduction strategy and claim the 100% of equipment costs over that stretch.

No, I didn't. I quite literally stated that I was using a set of metrics from the very fucking beginning to make the calculations for our hypothetical scenario. Those were based on data between yesterday's bitcoin price from the start of our discussion, and the profit taken from the miner of the last 7 days of difficulty and nethash. 
That's not speculating 12 months in the fucking future, that's quite literally taking the most accurate data today, stating that there would be no change between now and then, and tallying up the results one would get, between now and then if all of the data stayed the same. 


Because apparently in your fucking world, they give out free energy, and even pay you to use it! Under what circumstance would you **NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY?**
This is literally an example of your failure to understand what mining is, which is literally converting ENERGY (the free shit or even paid to use shit you get in your country) into Crypto, in this case BTC. 
If your cost is ZERO, and your result is anything above ZERO, its a profit. Even more, if your cost is ZERO, and your result is ZERO, but your net gain on using the energy is above ZERO it is again, a PROFIT. 
What don't get you get about this? What isn't clicking in your head that you need to be maxing your available energy use to take advantage of this to profit? All the while receiving the mined BTC/Crypto rewards from the actual process itself?


That's a much better forecast than predicting up or down.

Start one now before its too late, but also take the time to really consider the approach and what you're trying to get out of it. There's a ton of profit in mining right now, last year, the year before that, and every year prior since the advent of cryptocurrency mining, you just need moderately inexpensive electricity, and a technical know-how. It also helps if you know people in the right places so they can negotiate on your behalf so that the city and the power company cuts you some slack :P.

There's several mining subs here and on bitcointalk you can check out. 
The catch with mining Bitcoin specifically, as that your hardware is quite literally worthless once it becomes obsolete, so if you can't write hardware off where you live, it'll be a very slim margin unless of course you get this mythical "free energy", then its always a positive forever.

Part 2:


Alright guy, I'm going to explain to you how this works. Now keep in mind, I'm in America where our tax laws and business laws are different, energy is much cheaper here, and mining in the free market is thriving.
I buy 3,000 GPU's for $375/unit new. That's a cool, calm, $1,125,000 USD.  I then spend another $75,000 in server PSU's, PDU's, processors, mobo's, etc. I'm at $1,200,000 ready to roll. I negotiate 5.3c/kwh with the power company at my location, I sink another $40,000 into retrofitting my warehouse for natural cooling flow, and I Pay $8,500/mo for the rent. From here, I write off $1,240,000 in equipment for getting my operation up and running. I of course needed that cash up front to get operation, but regardless, here we are. 
I make $3,800/day in Revenue, and profit roughly $3,100 of that. For the sake of argument, I'll hold onto all of it until the end of the year for tax purposes. Naturally we can presume that approximately $700 is spent per day operating my miners. Or roughly $255,500 per year. 
A the end of the year, I've made $1,387,000 in revenue, I've spent $1,240,000 in equipment, and $255,500 in energy costs. I write off $1,240,000 against my $1,387,000 in revenue, and the $255,500 in energy. In 2019 according to our tax law, I'll be able to write off $1,250,000 in expenses completely and immediately, dollar for dollar, so I'll be taking the full deduction of $1,240,000 immediately. Meaning my net gain was $-108,500 on the equipment and energy cost alone to get them up and running, and doesn't account for employees and rent. Luckily, we can get employees for cheap and pay 4 employees $35k/yr to keep the entire facility operational and up-to-date 24/7/365. This also includes myself as one of the employees. With rent at $8,500/mo and Employees at $11,666/mo, that means we can take on an additional $140,000 for the employees, and $102,000 for the rent. Leaving me at a total net of -$350,500. 
Keep in mind, I now have $1,387,000 in crypto, $1,240,000 in equipment, and -$1,737,500 in cash, or a net gain of $889,500 in valuation. This is of course assuming that the crypto did not go up at all in that time throughout the year. 
Now, lets fast forward to the next year, end of year. Lets assume that our GPU's are 15% less efficient for the entirety of the year, and the crypto stays the same price. 
I spent $255,500 in energy again, another $140,000 in employees, and another $102,000 in rent. We now make $3,230 in revenue, of that $2,530 of it is profit, per day.  At the end of the year, we have earned $1,178,950 in crypto, and spent $497,500. For a net gain of $681,450. Of which we'll pay our corporate income tax of something like $113,900+34% of income over $335,000, or $117,793, or a total of $231,693, leaving my corporation with a total net of $449,757. 
After two years we now have, $1,240,000 in equipment, $2,565,950 in crypto, and -$1,287,743, and a total valuation of $2,518,207. 
Not a bad business after two years, but surely we'll begin to run into hardware issues. This is where it really makes sense for GPU mining. 
In the two years I've ran the GPU's, they've dropped 40% in retail value, but only about 26% in the value of what I purchased them for from my distributor. My $375 GPU's are now worth $277.50 on the second hand market. From this point forward, I slowly take down my GPU miners section by section, and re-sell the hardware on the 2nd hand market. Returning approximately 74% of my upfront value back to me. I can now pocket this cash and close up shop if I wanted to, leaving me at +$2,565,950 in crypto, and -$370,XXX in cash, or I can use that newfound hard cash to then purchase newer, more efficient GPU's and start slowly recycling the process again, and again writing off the complete expense of the GPU's. 
Another option is to start super small and scale up as you BEP your hardware prior to writing it off, which basically ensures very little operational cost, but very slow to ramp up income. 
In either case, mining is very much alive today, the predominant difference is that there's really no secondhand market for ASICS, which makes them a much riskier investment up front.

Trust me, you don't know that ;)


Also not the case


These numbers look to be based on the average cost/kwh of the country they are in. You obviously couldn't get an exact cost of production since the energy required as well as the individual costs of energy fluctuate from location to location.

That honestly depends on the make and model of the ASIC, but they are not quiet at all. Imagine a hair drier running 24/7, and that's pretty consistent with most ASICs. Also, if you're talking about running one in your dorm room at school, your RA will likely cite it as a fire hazard. However, you can absolutely get away with a GPU miner.

@_date: 2019-06-14 04:03:39
Since you edited the post slightly and commented that this was written as intended, I'll use this reply to answer some questions/statements. 


You could actually do that if you wanted to. What you use your electricity on is up to you. As the miners are computers, you can write it off as an IT expense. Or if you wanted to get super technical, its a financial instrument expense. There's a thousand ways to write off equipment, its best to find one most correctly suited for you, however.  As your comment is about the mining business itself, let me first say that by the point someone sits down to learn about mining, even on their home computer, you could effectively create a mining business right there, on that single computer inside of your home. You just can't write off more than you spend, of course. 


*This is why I asked you if you wanted to reformat your commentary, because I have no frame of context reference for this question/statement, so now I have to assume its usage*
I cannot even begin to find the context to this question to answer it. Are you referencing the earlier car showroom still? If you are, then yes you could pop up a business inside of an existing business, and sublet space and "bill" it, if that's what you're asking. 


Wouldn't do what, exactly? Again, this is why its imperative that you add the context in a quote and reformat your post. So we're clear, nothing in my statement would suggest I'd have to buy new rigs before the others are paid off. I'm also not specifically referencing mining of BTC itself, either. Mining setups like my own, mine more than just one algorithm. Some algorithms are much better to mine than others, some require much less expensive hardware and turnover rate, as well. I haven't purchased new hardware in over 16 months, all of it is now paid off, and all of it is still profitable. 


No. 


You can't make sense of it because you simply don't understand what it takes to mine. Hardware, Power, Internet, that's it. You certainly don't start out of a massive warehouse with solar panels, buying the land, etc, because the short term loans and interest required to purchase all of that upfront without immediate startup capital would crush you. You start small, you lease your space, you expand as you profit, and more importantly decide how you want to handle the rewards. Trade them, sell them immediately, store some of it away for long term HODLing, these decisions are honestly more important than the decision to mine itself. All you need to do is open up shop in an area with cheap electric, because that will be your largest expense. Also, why are we concerned about equipment cost and renewal? The amount you'll be able to write off (nearly all of it) will be used against your income. If I buy 2,000 worth of equipment, I get to write off 1,750 in most cases against my income. The issue is available capital and lines of credit, because in order to scale up, you have to have cash to operate enough to get it "up to speed", and in order to do so, you need cash/credit on hand. Sourcing hardware is your next step, and I'm not going to help you there as its a closely guarded tidbit of information most of us hold dearly to our chests, but rest assured, there's distributors out there ready to unload product at a moments notice for you, at heavily discounted rates. But again, you can write most of that off, your main focus is energy which can't be written off completely, though a minor amount can. If its not cheap, its not worth opening up shop. Luckily every power company in America advertises their rates, and if you're a big enough operation you can negotiate with them on a deal, as I have. 


No, to literally all of that. 


Flawed, how? A network can't be decentralized if only a few big players are doing the work. If this were to happen, a 51% attack would become likely and the network would be compromised and faith lost. Conversely, there's many of us out there across many pools who add our work in to decentralize the load, so that we don't run into a centralization problem. 
Conversely, anything other than a system of Proof of Work is an inherently centralized and flawed system that cannot possibly remain decentralized or call itself such. Take most concepts of Proof of Stake as an example. Those with the most of a coin could effectively control it, and limits to number of nodes per wallet, and amount of coins being staked only allow for a "grey market proxy" to be entered, which just further damages the network in and of itself. You simply can't do that with Proof of Work. 


Or you could invest your money into mining hardware that isn't mining bitcoin, that maintains its physical value longer, and can be traded/exchanged/paid out in Bitcoin. The Ebang route you mention would net something like $11/day in profit on the 5.3c/kwh that I currently spend, a breakeven if all thing stayed the same, in 162.34 days, or a profit of $8.57 and breakeven in 215.95 days at 10c/kwh. Again, power is your most important factor. Again though, I reiterate, we'll be writing off those hardware costs. 
Also, I'm not sure what you have against pools, but solo mining is entirely out of the picture on BTC and larger coins.
@_date: 2019-06-13 06:22:25


Lets say you spend $2,000 on bitcoin today, at $8,200. It goes to $16,400 by November. You now have $4,000 in Fiat, but the exact same amount in USD. Not assuming any trading, of course, despite your user name. 
If I sink that same $2,000 into a small mining rig that makes $5/day in profit (averaged over the last 2-3 months) and that same event takes place that pushes Bitcoin to $16,400, my unchanged satoshi value will now produce $10/day in that time going forward. By November, we'll call it November first, and starting the process today, I'll have made around $675 without the change, and $1,350 with the change. 
So lets cover the net result so far.  135 days of mining $5/day (profit) has yielded $675. Our equipment is still roughly worth the $2,000 we sank into it in that time, but for tax purposes can almost completely be written off, or gradually taken down in depreciation at the end of tax season, but we'll get back to that in a moment, for now, just the profit. 
If at the end of these 135 days Bitcoin has not moved, I've made $675 mining/converting the currency I'm mining to Bitcoin, and profiting. If it hasn't gone up, you're still sitting at $2,000 invested, and I'm sitting at $2,000 invested with $675 in profit, or reinvested. In the scenario we moved to $16,400, I'm sitting at $2,000 invested, and $1,350 in profit, or reinvested. You're sitting at $2,000 invested and $2,000 gained in Fiat value, but still not additional satoshis. Now, the wonderful thing about mining is that when we hit those bull markets, altcoins take off, and also gain satoshis against BTC, as well as being worth more in value from the simple satoshi "rising tides lift all boats" methodology. 
Where you simply bought .24 BTC, I've mined .08 in this time, covering 1/3rd of your investment. Now, of course you can trade this over time, but as we all know, sometimes the market is just down and you're waiting, and sometimes there's just no decent trades to be made, but similarly, I can also trade my newly minted satoshis as well. So, whatever gains you be taking, its reasonable to suggest I also gained the same amount, just with less invested. 
Now lets consider this like a simple math problem. 
If you took $2,000 to invest and sank it in BTC at an 8% return, and I instead invested annually $1,825 into my holdings by way of earning $5/day for 365 days a year, after 20 years I'll have put away $90,196.83. You'll have put away $9,321.91. 
And before you argue "But yeah, I'll make way more than 8%", it only gets worse. There really isn't a growth model where simply "buying" Bitcoin outperforms mining it, and that's not even to speak about the risk factors involved, the tax gains I can take towards doing this aren't even accounted for here. I can basically write off all the hardware against my income, or gradually do it over a few years to offset operational expenses. I can also write off quite a bit of my business as a whole, where any gains made "simply trading" BTC for profits is exposed to both STCG and LTCG. 
The wonderful part about mining is that even in the tough times, unless you have just super ridiculous energy costs, you'll always be MILDLY profitable at worst as long as your technology is kept within 3-4 years of date, which as we discussed, can be written off.

To really understand why its not a zero sum game, you have to understand that there's different philosophies in mining to begin with. Not everyone has the same goal and same end game, and each approach is treated differently. 
For those like myself simply in it for the money, I buy my equipment, write it off, mine, spend pay my expenses, and just continue until obsolete, generally planning for the next round of upgrades. 
What makes mining **NOT** a zero sum game, is that the price isn't finite. It goes up, it goes down, and the rewards work just the same. 
Lets take my basement, as an example. I've got 3 mining rigs running 24/7 for about 2.5 years mining BTG. During the absolute bottom of our most recent bear market (DEC-MAR), I was being rewarded with about 1.2BTG/day mining. Today, that same setup is yielding about .65BTG/day. However, I'm currently profiting 6x as much with those exact same machines on that exact same power. So, what changed? Well, like all things crypto related, the price bottomed which forced expensive energy folks off the network, give the network enough time and the difficulty lowers, which allows me to yield more shares and therefore a larger portion of the rewards, even though they are now worth less. As the market recovers, more hashrate is added to the network, and it runs exceptionally lean until the bull market cycles back in again, and profits start to increase again. There's also the off chance that much of the hashrate dropped off the network was from those currently mining at a near-breakeven which were simply keeping difficulties high and not really generating a profit. When prices drop, they have a tendency to get liquidated physically, as these tend to be the most obsolete miners on the market. The same holds drew with ASICs as it does with GPU's, and there' s an adjustment to the rewards and difficulty. Now, the main difference with ASICs is that they have basically hit a wall in technical breakthroughs, and are now focused on efficiency which is slimming the market. Since the hashpower isn't dramatically increased, the older miners remain on the market. Once the price drops again ,rates go up, or a new technological advancement pushes the needle, all of those older units will get powered down and turned into paper-weights. Again, though, the cheaper you get the energy, the more room you have to work with. 
As of this moment, my basement setup (as an example) is making $12.01/day (based on current nethash/difficulty) at 12.9c/kwh which is pretty close to the US national average for energy costs. At 8c/kwh which we could consider Tier1 demand level, we'd be at $14.59/day based on the same projection of nethash/difficulty. At 5.3c/kwh, where my farm mines at, it would net $16.02, and at 3c/kwh, where the much larger mines are running off of, they'd make $17.32, and in remote regions of the world with access to super cheap hydroelectric power,  we'd be looking at $17.86 (1.8c/kwh). And that's profit out of a total $18.81 in revenue from the rewards. 
So as you can see, the profit is quite healthy. Make no mistake about it, there's always profit to be made, and as long as profit can be made, its not a zero sum game at all. Its also fundamentally hard to be a zero sum game when the value of the gains and losses are measured two dimensional against one another.

No, you don't, and no, it isn't. 
The IRS doesn't give a fuck how many Bitcoins I've mined every year, they want to know how many US dollars it was worth at the time of mining, and if I sold it for a profit or less or held it. 
My hardware is bought in USD, my employees are paid in USD, and my taxes are paid in USD. NOT BTC. 


Are you even serious right now?


You're retarded. 


But not available at scale. 


You're an absolute moron. $/W is wholly irrelevant compared to Hash/Watt. 


Now I'm certainly you don't know what you're talking about. 
UPS stands for Uninterruptible Power Supply, or in your language, uninterruptible power supply power supply. 
Also, you're not even touching on the increased rewards per block, as well as the increased rewards in general from the lowered hashrate "back then", but its okay, I'm sure you'll keep spitting out fictitious numbers. 


That antminer's cost will drop significantly as profits reduce. Watch a launch, they'll go for 3-6k, then a few weeks later 2500, then 2200, then 1500, then 3 for 1000, etc. 
As for electricity cost mattering, I've only been stating that this the entire time you fucking moron. Good lord. 


Your estimates are absolutely trash so far, and at the time of production, were far more than $100 to produce. Also, here we are 10 years later, and your theory of profitability and not being able to remain competitive is still wrong. Mining profits have grown month over month for almost 4 months now, despite difficulty and hashrate going upwards. That's due in large part to the fact that, as I stated, older units get phased out in lieue of newer, more efficient units, which generally means both less energy spent, and slightly more hashrate. 


I can't imagine how you would think that would be possible. If there's no profit in mining, the entire Bitcoin chain comes to a halt as there is nobody left to hash, and the difficulty would be so high it would take a reset to get it back down before the entire world freaked out and start paper trading BTC wallets. 


Your argument here suggests otherwise, and you definitely weren't involved half a decade before I heard about Bitcoin, so go ahead and mark that off of your list of bullshit topics to bring up to try and "godwin" an argument. 


That's all well and good, until you see that hashrate hasn't grown exponentially, in large part because technology has fallen behind the Moore's law curve, and has been that way for many years now. 


Your opinion. 


Also your opinion. 


If you legitimately had free electricity, and you're not using it, you're just an absolute moron, period. The amount of money you could make from converting that free electricity into crypto, or even charging people to host for them, would be astonishing!
Problem is, your "free electricity" isn't available at scale. 


I do understand difficulty, it appears as if you don't, though. 
It seems like for you its a nice talking point at a cocktail party to impress others with how smart you are, but here, in this thread, you don't know what you're talking about, and you're certainly not convincing anyone, least of all me. 
But that's fine, I'll just go back to profiting from crypto 24/7/365 as I have since I started mining. How'd that crash from 20k down to 3.4k do for your holdings? Because I still made profit :P

Oh buddy, how wrong you are on this one. Try reading the whole fucking thing before trying to argue, this is a scenario, and in it the value of the coin being mined stays the same. 


No. There is no "2 years ago" in this scenario, and in fact it was stated that the value of the coin being mined stayed the same. In fact, the reality for the argument in its hypothetical form would be the equivalent of purchasing $1.2M per BTC, or 146 BTC and some change.  then 2 years later having a valuation of $2,518,207. or 307BTC and some change. 


No. 146 to make 307 in this hypothetical, which doesn't include the liquidation of the equipment after the fact, that would likely net another 30% to the valuation. 


Obviously. 


Ooof, your case hasn't rested, because you forgot to read the scenario entirely. 


Says the guy who's trying to interject past data into a standardized hypothetical, despite it being stated that all values remained the same. 


This is a foolish comment. Again, as stated, Fiat is inflationary, and Crypto is Deflationary. That means that any expense in Crypto instead of fiat, is an illogical one, and a very poor choice monetarily. My purchases in BTC/Crypto 2 years from now will have comparatively more purchasing power than had I bought those purchases in fiat, which means if you can purchase crypto and/or machines to mine crypto, you're in a better position than had you spent crypto for the same product. 
Conversely, and a part you don't really get yet, Mining at its core is simply converting Electricity into Cryptocurrency. If Crypto is Deflationary, and Fiat is Inflationary, then I'm making a small margin in value on every watt I convert to Crypto alone. 


No, you're totally right, man. Mining is such a terrible idea, its only the largest part of the Crypto space. But go ahead, tell me about Cloud Mining contracts that quite literally rented out inefficient XEON processors to mine XMR and then convert to BTC. The scam was brilliant, give me your BTC to later get less BTC, but ultimately a foolish one, and one that many of us were pointing out. Honestly at this rate, I'm doing arguing with you because you're absolutely fucking mental! 


I sacrifice precisely zero crypto to keep the network secure, I honestly don't know where you're getting this idea from.

I can claim the booked loss against all income, which is why you do it. Its even advisable to do so.

2. Buy 15k, sell at 5k, book 10k losses, wait 30 days, buy back at 5k, and hold.

Option 1, wherever I sell it at above 15k, I book profit and pay capital gains.

@_date: 2018-11-18 02:51:58
This is about 75% correct. What’s missing is the advancements in hashpower efficiency pushing out older equipment and quite often these cycles don’t react in a continuous fashion. Usually it’s large spikes (relative) up and down as machines get added or removed. First dip downward is almost always high electric cost miners, second dip down is old equipment being ran by low electricity cost miners. Third dip you never want.

Though you've certainly learned a lesson, let me aide you in a few others. 
1. Nobody is ever going to send you any significant amount of bitcoin for free, ever. Lesser, value-less currencies, perhaps as a method of adoption, but would never ask for you to send them currency first.
2. If you hear or see the words "lend" in the pitch, title, whitepaper, or name of the currency, that should be one of the biggest, most vividly colored red flags in the existence of mankind. Nobody is going to give you free stuff for nothing. 
3. Refer to points 1 and 2.

This has to be a troll account. I refuse to accept the notion that someone would actually think they would receive bitcoin by first sending a small amount to the account, expecting a larger amount to return. 
First of all, a true giveaway wouldn't require you to send them any money first, they'd just ask you to post a wallet address to send the funds to. 
Second of all, NOBODY is ever going to give you money for nothing, and certainly not double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple the amount you're supposed to send them first. At least, not with a token or coin that actually has an immense amount of value already built around it. TRTL, sure.

You can only carry forward $3,000 per year, so by taking a loss this year in 2018, and buying the asset, you've given yourself a 3k deduction for at least the next 3 years.

What would the value of BTC in X or Y years matter?
If you bought at 15k and sold at 5k, waited the 30 days to hop back in a theoretical 5k again, to avoid it being a wash trade, you've now booked the 10k loss which you can claim against any gains at a rate of 3k/year going forward.  If BTC is worth 20k in year 1, I'm not selling, and therefore not realizing any gains, especially those that would forcibly fall under the short term capital gains tax. In year 2, at 25k, I'm not selling either, but had I waited to sell here, I'm now taxed less on the gains than had I sold in year 1. By years 3 and 4, I'm still not selling the asset. 
In the meantime, over those 4 years I've secured 30k in unrealized asset gains, but have secured 10k in deductibles from my income taxes in that time. 
Your scenario presumes selling the asset every year, also, its wrong because your third year deduction says -4, where it should be -3 still.

Within a 30 day timeline. Like that solid 2ish month window where BTC didn't move from that $6200-$6400 range that literally everyone started washing in. In fact, pretty much every time BTC hits a rejection point where it needed to close above a certain point in the day to turn things around, but didn't, a lot of people started the washing process, which really helps for accumulation at the end of the day.

Report seems a bit misleading, but I don't know how Canadian accounting works towards depreciating your assets immediately or year after year, etc. Also, I don't know their amortization details to really make an educated opinion of how they are running this thing. Strongest guess I could muster based on familiar US laws,  is that they've taken the maximum depreciation/write off possible, and taking a FY1 loss to carry forward as a cushion against the rising costs of Bitcoin (presumably), and basically setting their infrastructure up this year and focusing on rapid expansion (at a "loss) to milk additional profits in forward years.

This is my kind of reporting! 
"Eventually, one day, before long, probably in a little bit, we will have a bull run"
@_date: 2018-11-18 08:49:04
Let me explain this, because a lot of people can't quite wrap their head around it (not saying you in particular, but its something for all ages and experience levels). Miners don't mine at a loss with the hope that the price will one day rise. We don't mine at a loss, period. There's a huge reason for this that everyone seems to not understand. That is this; When mining becomes unprofitable, it literally means its cheaper for us to buy the coin, than to mine it. Meaning; If I were mining a coin and its no longer profitable for me to mine, if I continue to mine it, I'll be buying $5500 bitcoin, at $5501. You wouldn't pay more for the same product would you? Of course not. 
Its a very common misunderstanding for lots of crypto folks whom lack any mining experience, or don't quite grasp the full concept. When we talk about profitability, we're not just creating money out of nowhere without cost. If a bitcoin is worth $5,500, and I make $200 mining it, that means it cost me $5,300 to mine it. If it remains to cost me $5300 to mine it, and it drops to $5299, what am I to do? Pay more for the same product? That's not how businesses are ran, so we pull out. 
That's where the next point of confusion comes in. When we power down, we're not talking about throwing in the towel and giving up forever. We're simply talking about powering off until profitability returns, and then we're right back at it again. There's no mining at a loss, no mining because we believe the price will be higher, we simply don't mine it. That's in large part because of the value of our work going down below the cost. As an example, my basement has 3 small 6 card mining rigs, all nvidia 1070ti-1080ti models. Right this second, those three rigs are earning me $5.35/day in profit, combined. Right now they are mining Bitcoin Gold and earning ~.49 BTG per day in total revenue. When difficulty drops (good for miners) that figure might swell to .65 per day (in recent numbers) which is superb for me! When difficulty is being driven up due to miners joining the BTG network from other options that have become unprofitable, I might earn as little as .34 BTG per day, which is basically the cost of me to mine them. 
What's happening right now is a number of things. 
1. Bitmain has targeted some of their ASICs away from BTC, which will show a pretty substantial drop in nethash. 
2. High cost elecetricity miners (your household asic types) have taken their asics off the network and likely sold the hardware. 
3. Old equipment is being removed from the network due to lack of profits from newer equipment doing twice the work with half the energy cost. 
Of those three developments, only one is a naturally occurring and expected development. That's the technology improvement. The other two are more or less systemic issues 
One of those three, is a red flag, and that's the BCH hardfork and the asic power that Bitmain (and a few others) hold over the networks. The argument has been made that hashrate has gone down for a while, so the fork wouldn't be the reason for the drop over that period, and I'd disagree slightly. Though the hashrate has gone down by a number of already defined reasons, if I were someone with that kind of hashrate to throw around who vehemently believed my fork was the better fork, I'd have mined the absolute piss out of BCH prior to the fork. In fact, I'd have sold BTC to acquire BCH, even if it were dropping in price, because ultimately I'd be receiving both parties, and could hold one (raising price) and dump the other (lowering price). Does that rationale ring a bell? It should, because the rumors over the last 3-4 months were that Jihan had stopped mining BTC (not completely but &gt;90%) and was going "all in" on BCH, and then the IPO info came out and they disclosed their holdings that had shown that Jihan and Bitmain had been dumping BTC to acquire BCH. 
Pretty good insurance policy for ensuring that your most profitable fork would be the survivor when you hold both the hashrate, and the raw volume from the split of those pre-fork purchases. 
Say what you will about Jihan being evil, but his tactics so far have been A+
Edit: Full disclosure, I own zero BCH and don't really "have a dog in the fight" for the current BCH war.

I'm not sure they've destroyed lives yet, though I certainly couldn't argue against it since there will be significant collateral damage before its all over, its really more of a case for egotistical leaders not finding ways to work out their differences. The hilarious part is, what's going on right now between the Jihan, Roger, and Craig triangle, is about as opposite as one could get from Satoshi and his vision, its just pure irony.

I'm involved in a local community meetup that discusses bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and one of our regulars first got introduced to bitcoin by buying $20 worth from an atm like this, and later went back to buy more. He's a much older gentleman, and had no idea how any of it worked, just wanted in, but had no idea how to get "in" to the market other than one of these machines. I showed him how to setup an account with coinbase so that he could seamlessly use and transfer with gdax after waiting on the ACH transfer or wire into the account. Now he buys me a drink at every meeting :D

Unfortunately GDAX is coinbase, so you have to setup that account first. Gdax accepts bank transfers, and in case I’m mistaken, are also insured or are at least legally liable for their holdings. Other than this nonsense with Wikileaks shop, which is just a judgement call on legal liabilities, I don’t see the issue with using coinbase to setup access to the US’s biggest exchange. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:09:58
So, joining the wikileaks attempt at taking them down makes you different, how? 
Everything they are doing is legal, and if they decided not to support someone for whatever legal reason that drove them to do so, how does that turn into trying to take down the biggest entry into bitcoin available for us customers?
Terrible idea, this is how fud happens.

You're a little behind, OP. 
This is one of 4 wallets totaling 149k BTC being moved, in exactly the same way. In total, over 500k unique addresses were used to move it all. Between the 4 addresses, they date back to a large move around 11/19/13, and funded by an originating account from 3/18/11 which was first created by a faucet.

By mining at a loss, he's removing profit from others, by adding hashrate, and therefore difficulty to the network, which currently is on the way down, and would come down faster if his hashrate were not present. Its not a permanent thing, but it would help if his miners were powered down temporarily until the re-balance could take effect. 
If instead, he removed his miner from the network, and simply bought the amount of bitcoin each day that he would be mining, he would not only allow for the DAA do adjust lower, and therefore bring back some profitability that he might be able to power back on with, but he'd also be purchasing *ON* the network, which would effectively be driving price up, rather than down by selling it to cover mining expenses. He'd also *NOT* be effectively buying BTC for more than its worse, which is precisely what he' doing by mining at a loss. 
In perfect truth, he needs to power down his S7's and junk them, and his S9's are not far behind. In fact, if he's already out of profit with the S9's, he needs to sell them or sell them for parts before everyone gets ahead of him and scraps them for S15's.

Unpopular opinion: I think they got it right by doing a cash settled futures contract. Though it has a tendency to put sell pressure on the market, and t hey could do so with nefarious intent, it will eventually bring on long term, large scale adoption. Had it been actual BTC settled futures based on USD pricing, the price of Bitcoin would have skyrocketed to points we probably couldn't yet actually fathom and chaos would have ensued. Very likely, we'd have pushed back full scale adoption for decades by this metric. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:14:26
No its not. Not even in the slightest. When you invest in something, you have equity. When you gamble on something, you have equity. Unless of course we're talking about some fantasy world theory that you have cooked up in your head or something.

It has more to do with that fact that cash settled futures is a form of "paper trading" bitcoin, and since this action doesn't happen on the network, HODLers don't receive the benefit of the transactions, which inversely applies pretty serious amounts of sell pressure.
