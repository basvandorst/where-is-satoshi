When you say "too low" how much exactly did you put?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:22:21
I gotchu! GL!

Does it matter where you hold them? I have part of my coin in Coinbase and part in Blockchain wallet.

What is the 21 million club mean?

That makes all sorts of sense now. Thanks stranger!
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:15
You're awesome. Thanks for the insight internet stranger! I'll do some more research for sure.

I use jump desktop.com for all my remote viewing and have never had one issue. Idk how many computers they support but it's worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:00:15
Thanks for the response! I don't know where my private key is but I do have my seed written and in my safe so I imagine I can use that if there is a fork.

This subreddit is here to help out, no need for forgiveness!
Your statement would be true if 1 BTC was worth only $100. Then your $100 would be worth 1 BTC so it would rise in value as it goes up. If you spent $100 right now you would actually own .009ish BTC. Looking forward to the future when BTC is worth $20,000 you would still own .009 which would be worth $180 then. 
Hope that helps!

GL stranger! I honestly have no idea just wanted to send good vibes! You should offer a BTC tip instead of PayPal. People might jump on the opportunity quick!

Everyone is here saying congrats and you just decide to be a douche? OP has nothing to prove to you Mr. Thundercock. Take your toxic posts elsewhere :)
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:08:23
Perfect, thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:17:16
Love it! Thanks for the help!

What does HODL mean?
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:07:05
I'm gonna guess $22,000
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:35:48
Perfect I will do more research on both! I appreciate the advice. Do you transfer to the physical wallet Everytime you purchase or wait for any reason?
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:29:24
Makes sense haha. I'm new to this. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:07:48
Remindme! 5 Years
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:53:39
Thanks! I'll check that out. I also love hearing different points of view too. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:44:54
Yeah that makes sense and those are what prompted me to look into this. Is there fees associated with transferring to a physical wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:07:20
Sounds like a guy who is salty about not buying more BTC. Obviously OP knows it's a risk, he doesn't need people like you telling him nor is he telling people to invest all their money. He is simply profiting off a huge risk in his life that no one around him believed in. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:28:57
What external wallet is worth it? I'm always afraid of a hardware failure then I'm broke lol. What does it look like to transfer into paper keys?
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:01:39
1.5 million USD is no joke either haha. Makes my 0.044744 btc look like a joke! Lol, I just started buying a week ago. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:26:55
Is there a reason for this or sarcasm? Lol. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:42:58
Is there a disadvantage to keeping the coins in Coinbase right now until I get one?
