definitely starting small, thanks for the guidance. i was too fixated on the market of bitcoin itself. i didn't consider that bitcoin's price is constantly moving around. cheers.

i like how friends and family come out of the woodwork to let me know prices are plummeting as if i'm Satoshi himself or i'm somehow investing with their money... same with ya'll?

but if you look at stuff like ransomware, where victims are just told to send X BTC to a wallet somewhere for the decryption keys... that's hard-coded into the malware right? i just thought itd be funny to see a hacker ask for 1 BTC or something when it was 15k and by the time their campaign worked it'd be worth much less and they facepalm.

wtf prompted this surge? usually dips are attributable to something, even if its an educated guess.
