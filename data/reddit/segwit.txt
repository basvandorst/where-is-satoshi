what is custody model of coinapult, can I use their api for accepting funds and on the same time keeping control of my bitcoins?

what do you mean by hand. I have created my wallet with multisig. And I used xpub to make opportunity to develop apps which accept Bitcoin. On my web-site there is possibility to generate invoice.
Why should it take 1 day to be included into Mycelium wallet?

I hate you, I hate you. You say the bad thing to me :) Why they don't fix it just for me?
2) I'm okay with this level of understanding. Yo live in past century. Bitcoin is for everybody.
Don't take personally though, but trend goes towards simplifying programming languages, and I am okay with making mistakes while learning new stuff. I think their API is handy and I'm okay with it, and nice seeing it evolving. Yes, it took me some difficulty to fix their "example" code in their API tutorial (because they made a lots of grammar mistakes in their example php code)
Pretty nerdy approach to keep new users afraid of programming, I recommend you to watch  to get more social.
I'm using blockchain's API since 2012 for lots of simple experiments. Mycelium Gear is stupid in my opinion, they lack proper documentation and have stupid limitation of 15 minutes for purchase.
And I still don't understand why they need to limit me from using 20 wallets, I think they should stop doing that.

of course I think not enough covered here, but at least for newbie its not so frustrating &amp; even fun to watch

I'm using blockchain.info carefully &amp; mostly because I understand its weak spots &amp; for 5 years I never lost any money, I keep hearing all people loses.
I think if you're having a problem with your computer, maybe you better switch to Android? Using Mycelium will help, its way more convenient from the point of User Friendliness by the way.

Nice explanation. There's something I don't get. How Mycelium wallet supports more than 20+ transactions, and how I can't use xpub to fascilitate this transactions?
I think saying "APIs are not required" isn't correct way to explain Blockchain's API. The API of blockchain for receiving addresses works in order to handle events. So, their API use my xpub to generate addresses, and if e.g. my coffee machine is using their API to watch unconfirmed transactions, this would mean that my coffee machine can't serve over 20 cups of coffee. This is what I'm using it for approximately when I'm building my web-sites.
And before xpub system, and before HD wallets in a new BETA blockchain.info interface, their APIv1 used addresses held in custody on Blockchain servers. Now with APIv2 they're switching their API on new levels where custodial model is eliminated and now they don't hold your funds. Good job for them &amp; big deal for newbie developers, because they can easily setup their web-services.

Submitted support ticket to Blockchain.info.
I had to check 20 block explorers because none of them support xpub
This one worked [linktoxpub] it represents my 0.25 BTC transaction, while blockchain.info doesn't shows it and I can't spend it on my mycelium, this is after 2 hours of waiting.
What is going on? I had such problem several times in past when I tried to send Bitcoins to my friends (that times it was low amounts, so we forgot about money, someone laughed that Bitcoin doesn't works). Does xpub addresses mined in a special incompatible way? Or what? Can't find any reasonable explanation why there's such a problem of detecting address on HD wallets.

don't blame him, its all because of government.
government is root of all evil.
