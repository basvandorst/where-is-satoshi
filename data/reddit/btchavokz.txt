don't think for a second that all these guys don't understand bitcoin, and are now trying to demonize it by saying it's all these things:
untrusted, unstable, useless, deceptive, inefficient, non-inclusive, non-transparent, unappealing, holding back innovation, unsafe, complicated, stupid, irrelevant, disrupting, facilitating of evil, comes from unknown evil source
it's pathetic of MC to do this, yet i can't look away
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:01:38
they don't want this out in the open so they won't tell you what that policy is
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:02:55
according to this, it's:

not worth anything because it can't be used to buy fuel
not used to buy fuel because it isn't worth anything
the more uses it has the more stable it becomes
once acceptance reaches this level, and it is used to trade for oil, then its value will stabilize even more.

the video is right about one thing, bitcoin is disruptive!

3 pillars of bitcoin:
* faith
* math
* usage
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:48:10
bitcoin is:
untrusted, unstable, useless, deceptive, inefficient, non-inclusive, non-transparent, unappealing, holding back innovation, unsafe, complicated, stupid, irrelevant, disrupting, facilitating of evil, comes from unknown evil source
credit cards are the opposite of bitcoin *beats chest*
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:43:17
That's because everything else is "virtual credits" in computers already - even paper cash is recorded and tracked at all times (well at least they wish it were)

@_date: 2014-11-12 16:14:20
i was saying you can have a billion of

as far as security goes credit cards are the worst

@_date: 2014-11-11 21:08:38
all these suggestions are for piggybacking an existing web service (yes i know that's kinda what OP wants)
what you need to do is true blockchain integration, so that you aren't relying on a centralized third party
aside from artificially centralizing your POS, it's kind of a cop-out from a programming perspective.

@_date: 2014-12-18 23:27:48

you can't lend bitcoin you don't have, SOMEONE has to loan it to you so you can loan it out, not true at all for fiat

@_date: 2014-12-01 16:57:50


you couldn't be more wrong
the reason fractional reserve banking works is because the fed can "print" money to then loan to the banks.  With Bitcoin, there is no "printing free money"
the "snake eating its own tail" model doesn't work at all for bitcoin

fiat is backed by guns and debt, that's why it has value, and that's why it's "preferred" right now.  there is only an illusion of choice
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:19:56
pure BTC transactions are the ones that bolster the crypto-economy when neither party "exits the market", and it's the collective belief in its persistent value over time, that gives it value,and pure mathematics that holds the network afloat.
the ones who only immediately retreat to fiat land are turds
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:22:14
money is an agreement between two entities, in this case it's an agreement between bitcoin nodes to follow the protocol, so yeah it's "real" money
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:28:17
it will eventually have the attribute of absolute scarcity when the algorithm determines it - combine scarcity with extreme fungibility, something to look forward to.
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:17:32
a rather drastic concealment of hashing power introduced at the right time might have a shot
I still don't think the protocol is sensitive to that situation, otherwise it would have been a shit show long ago.
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:38:27
where it isn't profitable or profitable enough to set up the technology there
eventually the internet and bitcoin or some other cc will be the standard for all nations, what then, no use for banks anymore, humanity liberated from the slimy tentacle monsters like the one that made this video
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:40:15
so why not start a new fork and "magic" the national debt into it?  first mover benefit via genesis block tweak, then force it to gain value by requiring taxes and such to be paid with it, and use that to pay foreign nations
you get a "pool" for the government to use to oppress, control, and the like, so it's happy, ***and*** the currency gains value.
oh right, isn't that basically the USD except after it lost its buying power?
someone's knees gave in: 
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:46:23
he also states that bitcoin is:
* untrusted, unstable, useless, deceptive, inefficient, non-inclusive, non-transparent, unappealing, holding back innovation, unsafe, complicated, stupid, irrelevant, disrupting, facilitating of evil, comes from unknown evil source
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:09:16
1: the government has no money
2: neither does the fed, depending on if fort Knox is empty
it's this nexus of ignorance and mind-washing propaganda that boils down to this, a bunch of people standing on each others backs and puffing their chests.
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:30:12
they are centralized, like PayPal, they aren't part of the overall picture, at least until reputable ones come along
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:00:52
that "stretching" is handled by the protocol, it automatically adjusts the difficulty
my guess is that there's a moment where the difficulty is absurd compared to the payout, it quickly self-correct, or it be very infeasible for a while, but not open to attack.

do you have plans to make "adapters" that will plug into zope.interface, for 3rd party onion routing?
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:12:15
i disagree
the state can very well make its own fork that completely replaces the economy, with relatively small effort
the way i see it is, if govt embraces it, then it will be a good thing
in fact, i would go andnsay that we should put together a fork just to simulate "neo y2k"
simply reserve money for the future budget and FDIC and send that to the BLOCKCHAIN TREASURY DEPARTMENT
could even integrate the existing fed and treasury as the private key holders and genesis block authors
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:21:58

@_date: 2015-04-07 18:04:56
it may have served a purpose at one point, but it's been assimilated and is now something entirely different
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:53:11
it's hubris to call bitcoin virtual currency or virtual payment method, or virtual at all when they themselves print (enter a number into a computer) unbacked virtual money, and then coerce you to use it and call it money.  They can't tie fiat to physical money because 99% of it isn't cash, and is "numbers in computers".  even if it were all physical bank notes, it's still fake, virtual, worthless, stealth taxation crap that they coerce us into using and accepting as money.
they seek to define virtual as not fiat and it shows.  fiat is as virtual, if not more virtual than bitcoin.
they have laws against counterfeiting so they can't just call it fake money because they'd be required to stop it (and it would expose the hypocrisy), so they choose the next best marginalizing convoluted label.
I can't fucking wait for their vice grip on the idea of money to start shaking loose. People for far too long have trusted bankers and government to define money, allowing them to commit unspeakable atrocities.
none of my rant is Netherlands specific, it's a global systemic problem, just that this official definition presents a nice opportunity to point out this fallacy  A fallacy which is widespread, the schism between what we would be using as money if the people decided what to use, as opposed to whatever truly worthless slave-note systems our governments force upon us via guns, dependence on fossil fuel, debt, and taxes (you can't use potatoes to pay your taxes, you must use their funny "money")  They really don't want anyone thinking critically about all of this, which is why it pains the average person to do so.  The average person will sooner assume "they" know better and will decide that virtual = not fiat, rather than exercise critical thinking.  This needs to stop.  I can't fucking wait!

The real burden is gaining a reputation, because that's what will get you sales.

we can't even begin to have a reasonable conversation until this is out of the way:  the people being scammed are those who are using fiat, not those using bitcoin.

in other words:

DNMs definitely have a place in today's world, for the benefit of safety alone.
anyone who justifies the WOD because some drugs are worse than others, is a hypocritical toolbag in my not-so-humble opinion.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:42:03
yes but in reality there are new things like DNMs that do flout law, and provide a seriously needed service that increases the safety for those involved, as opposed to dealing with your local gang banger's poisoned and unrated product
soon decentralized DNMs will flout as well, what then mr "it can't be that way"
not so clear-cut is it

just wanted to point out that when cryptocurrencies take over there won't be a need for "fraud protection", or giving out your personal information for it
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:53:45
or better yet, realized for the sick bile that it is
you don't need to ban something that people don't want
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:27:19
look into stealth taxation
tldr:  fiat is fake-ass scam money
just think, if fiat actually had real value, the banks that got bailouts would be out on their ass, but instead they "just realized" that they can simply print IOUs in different ways to alleviate the immediate situation.
fiat is a gigantic steaming pile of lies and poisonous horse-shit, since you can at least fertilize fields with good horse-shit

PFFFFT, OBVIOUSLY
good fucking eye there, good fucking eye
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:17:07
not getting you
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:18:55
which is good 
we should be able to rate vendors, and see their reputations
this is how it should be

who said anything about government
government doesn't provide insurance services for banks
but government is part of the snake that eats its own tail, so I can see why you could find that confusing.

which is actually still viable in a new bitcoin fork (which the fed probably has in secret testing already)
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:02:54
it's incredibly naive to think that vested interests won't utilize every avenue of social engineering they can. A notion like this is also naive as fuck.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:51:26
they will refuse to see the connection or the hypocrisy
they have  a strict agenda dictated by vested interests
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:45:48
the WOD is a huge money maker with vested interests, that alone should be enough to make one question the validity of it.
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:17:11
you don't ***NEED*** anything when you have free reign to rewrite any/all of it.
but I agree about the difference you contrasted
distributed online ledger is exotically different than {one guy in the fed and one guy in the treasury deciding on what design to give their BONDAGE AND IOU PAPERS
and now that it's not even backed by gold anymore, the fiat is some kind of unrecognizable convoluted truly worthless thing
you wouldn't sell your house for someone's "I promise to give you x ounces of nothingness", so why put up with it now with fiat currency?  GUNS AND DEBT
that's not how money is supposed to work, and is having wretched disturbing effects everywhere

LE also skirts the 4th all the time because digital information isn't actually literally written on paper
you know it's true
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:21:20
I imagine that you don't have the tools for the job because the job is new and very niche atm.
think guys with guns guarding safe-deposit-boxes, something the bankers are very good at, and will be their only job once the sick is purged (fiat elimination)
