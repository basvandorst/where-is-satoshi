$60 million worth of bitcoin potentially stolen at Nicehash. I wouldnt use that site...
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:56:29
If people have bought at 15k why suggest for them to sell if they dont need the money right away?
Its best for them to hold and wait for market to calm down....
Just stop acting like you have a crystal ball and knowing how far it will crash... you dont. Nobody does.
Its fine that you sold your coins for a profit, congrats...
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:58:04
Never invest more than you can afford to lose....
If its money that you dont need right now, just stay calm and watch the market...
Swings are normal, this one is more brutal but the market will recover...
Stop looking at the prices for a week and come back to see how prices are doing...
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:53:14
Oh my god...
Shouldnt you be in Kindergarden?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:59:20
Are they losing Bitcoin... no?
If they had one Bitcoin, they still have one Bitcoin...
Causing people to panic will lose them money... If they just relax and wait til the market calms down.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:48:19
Never would have seen that by myself.
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:17:17
He isnt making random assumptions and predicting crashes...
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:53:42
I call bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:29:20
Havent sold one bit of it yet, been hodling.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:51:37
Asking this retarded question in the Bitcoin Subreddit?
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:22:42
I use an app called cryptonaut, best app I have seen around.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:14:43
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:04:12
This lame graph again...
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:46:58
yeah ok.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:47:00
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:01:41
Yeah ok Expert....
Ever follow whats going on?
Bitcoin goes down, what happens to ALTs? They crash harder!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:33:32
Fuck off Troll.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:33:18
Fuck off.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:14:19
Crystal Ball?
Where does everybody find these?
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:47:29
fuck off
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:00:56
Wow, you sound retarded...
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:59:33
DUDE, just shut up.
Mr Crystal Ball!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:36:23
Coming from someone that is hodling Kucoin...
Hows that working for ya? lol
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:49:05
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:43:17
Take your FUD somewhere else Clown.
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:23:28
They tell me what I can spend MY money on...
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:20:38
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:26:15
Yeah, because all the other cryptos are doing great dumbass.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:54:42
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:28:58
Haters gonna hate. :D
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:33:19
Because all your posts are shit...
FUD here, crystal ball here...
You act like a small kid...
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:35:17
Oh yeah, because all the coins you mentioned are doing sooo good....
Literally every coin depends on Bitcoin. It crashes so do other all other ALTs, but worse... If you really think a crypto will ever pass Bitcoin you are delusional...
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:45:11
There are so many apps out there that are free and have no ads and dont require any kind of personal information...
Why would I pay to use this app, it will track my portfolio just like any other app out there, for example cryptonaut. Will let me enter purchase date and use price of that day...
Dont see the point of paying for it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:13:45
Where to buy this magic ball that everyone seems to own?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:16:10
Yeah because ALTs are doing great...
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:29:19
Stop with the FUD...
Bitcoin has "died" multiple times and it was just a hunch on its way up.
Please do sell all your Bitcoin and come back later if you are sooooo sure it will fall ways....
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:51:15
You are annoying! Every post the same shit with you.
Glad you sold your coins, just rebuy later and shut it...
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:40:37
Lol, yeah. Dream on.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:27:42
Just read your sentences....
I've been waiting for months to see bitcoin go down more then alts
I really want to see btc stop dictating everything and see alts grow into their own
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:09:04
Old news...
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:39:22
Yeah ok.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:11:00
Hey, Im on kraken.com. 
Yes you also need to verify but it went alot quicker then it said on their site. Only took 48 hours. 
Good luck fellow Bitcoiner!
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:24:28
I want what you are smoking. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:24:07
Thanks for the warning.
Do you have any alternatives?
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:24:43
Not here to call you an idiot, anyone who comes in here to do that is a fool!
I feel sorry for you man and hope you get the lost BTC back...
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:54:01
Of course...
Germany has rules, laws, regulations on everything...
It cracks me up everytime!
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:25:02
Wow that sure looks like a neat machine.
I wish there more BTC ATMs in Germany, but Germany always sooo long to get new technology over here.
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:29:20
I have been in the same boat...
I had Bitcoin in my head for a very long time, but was too afraid to pull the trigger...
I have been reading more and more about the coin and just decided to keep buying on a weekly basis in the hope to average a good price.
I was first debatting waiting on a dip, but those dont come very often und in the long run wont make a difference. I now just buy a bit more on a dip.
Im in it for the long run.
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:41:08
Yeah. Looks like fake reviews. Wouldnt trust it. 
You are just here to promote your ref link
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:59:56
Been there.
Next stop moon.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:31:12
Yeah sure. 
Dodgy and a sure way to lose BTC
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:51:57
Bitcoin being Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:21:05
sell it and use fiat.
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:57:27
Oh come on. Yeah the video will prove its not a scam. Anybody who puts money there deserves to lose it. 
Take the scam elsewhere
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:03:54
Thanks for this.
I will now rewatch Lost! :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:45:15
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:16:54
Too late, for is happening in about 4 minutes
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:19:22
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:32:10
Its german...
But these are getting funny!
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:20:27
Sure and if you close your eyes and smash your head against the screen he will give you double.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:45:36
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:16:25
[May the Fork be with you!](
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:32:20
So glad I never bought there.
I would pull it off the exchange and bankrupt them...
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:26:13
I would stay away...
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:04:37
kraken.com works fine for me.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:51:00
Sorry for Thread Hijacking.
Any reads out there for begginers? That start of "slow"?
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:18:23
Been said so many times....
If you want Bitcoins and plan to hodl, buy whenever you want...
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:58:43
Bitcoin is becoming mainstream, weak hands enter the market and think its a get rich quick chance... 
Dips come and FUD is spread and they sell...
They will regret. ��
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:08:10
Stay strong!
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:09:52
I think the people that bought at an ATH are gone.
People that bought in February when it started to go back up are probably still selling because of the FUD. 
Whales are gonna gobble up the cheap coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:34:25
Old news. 
What else you got?
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:37:05
old news.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:49:27
The UPS guy is full of shit.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:33:47
Super old news. 
Just wake up?
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:15:39
Yeah we all sold at $19500.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:55:02
I want what you are smoking. 
100USD or even 1k USD? 
Yeah, keep dreaming. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:55:00
Wow. Old news
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:24:00
Why link this?
So people visit the site and have to sign up for VIP to get it?
Clickbait and bullshit post.
Here it is for free, no signup, direct download.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:38:51
same here, I have the same no coiners around me saying exactly the same thing.
"I told you Bitcoin is thrash"
"I told you Bitcoin will never be worth anything"
"Bitcoin will be worth 0 in no time"
Screw them, its just hate.
They will see in the future and I will be the last one laughing.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:56:37
Sure. I guarantee the upward trend to 20k is paused. But this FUD will fade about the sell off and whales will buy up the cheap coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:42:07
Fuck them and your FUD
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:02:10
worthless post.
Lets talk again in one month and see where the price is.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:02:59
You should cash out and give that money to someone to teach you to spell.
That would be a good investment for you.

Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme...
What kind of bullshit are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:58:45
Yeah ok Mr. Expert
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:54:39
All these so called experts. 
It might go up, it might crash even more. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:30:20
Experts. Yeah sure. 
1k no way will it get that low! Everybody seems to be a god damn expert!
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:32:29
no ref link, but still SPAM
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:50:26
No Problem.
Just didnt want to end up in trouble when the fork comes.
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:50:06
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:40:04
Thank you all.
Will be buying more and just HODL!
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:28:23
I need this shirt...
all of my newb friends all thought they had to always buy a full bitcoin...
Once I told them they could buy fractions, even its only $10 at a time, they all started buying...
This shirt would have made my life easier...
