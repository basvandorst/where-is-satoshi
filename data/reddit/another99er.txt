All your losses are covered by the bank. If you're a smart consumer, you shouldn't have been paying any bank fees in the first place. Bitcoin does not offer any type of protection for when things go south.
Additionally, you should be able to see past transactions by logging into your bank's website...

Like Chuckee Cheese tokens or something? I'd probably laugh it off, think they were weird, and toss the coins. 
Coincidentally, does Changetip share what % of tips are returned/not collected? I'm pretty sure the # is pretty high which just furthers this point.

Why did you use bitcoin for the purchase instead of a credit card? You could have gotten valuable cashback!
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:05:33
If you see Bitcoin as a speculative investment, there is no reason to actually spend it.
You're paying an extra 1%-2% for no reason. You could save money if you used cash or get cash back/rewards using a credit card.

Most currencies don't fluctuate as much as Bitcoin does. I think someone posted a graph earlier that showed Bitcoin did worse than Russia's Ruble and Ukraine's Hryvnia (two currencies that had "big" declines this year). Besides, Bitcoin is expected to drastically fluctuate in value. Just ask any of the pseudo-investors on this subreddit that are waiting for it to go to the moon.
I don't see how any rational person who wants to save money can "store value" in an unpredictable cryptocurrency. People who are savers and want to "store value" are risk averse. The whole idea of saving money is to avoid fluctuations in value. 
Advocating Bitcoin to someone who wants to save money instead of suggesting a savings account, CD, or bond, is like telling them to keep it in penny stocks .

That's a fair point, however, the chances of this bill passing are literally 0%. I don't see why the US government would actively choose to not regulate a currency that undermines the current system and is best know for facilitating illicit purchases.
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:18:41
Savers? Are you talking about people who save money via Bitcoin? It's unclear how or why Bitcoin is a preferential to other saving accounts, especially given the unpredictable price fluctuations.
If you meant to refer to people who store wealth or transfer it, I'm still not convinced Bitcoin offers any real advantages:
* Why is Bitcoin a better method for storing wealth? Most people don't store gold or anything. People like having insured accounts which are protected. Bitcoin does not offer any sort of security guarantees. I'm a "smart person" who has saving and wants them in a safe account where I'm not liable for fraud/hackers/etc.
* Most people don't need to transfer $ across borders. This is not a common issue. Even if Bitcoin didn't have a dozens of issues and actually was perfect for international money transfers, I don't see how that would make other people join the cause...

Hey, look at you missing out on valuable cashback opportunities...
@_date: 2014-08-23 04:03:11
A lot of pro-Bitcoiners seem really against banks, credit cards, and anything involving "centralized" finance.
Mate- if you buy something and it goes up in value, that doesn't make credit cards less valuable. For example, if I picked a risky stock that went up 100% in value and I doubled my initial investment, I would still pay for all my purchases with a credit card. It wouldn't make sense for me sell my stock and pay with the profits instead of getting cashback from a credit card.
I always hate when people make it seem as if paying of a credit card monthly is some gargantuan task.
@_date: 2014-08-22 03:46:49
Er... getting lucky with an incredibly risky and volatile investment shouldn't preclude anyone from getting cashback on everyday purchases. 
You're not getting a better deal with your bitcoins if you have the opportunity to pay with a credit card, regardless of how much bitcoin value has fluctuated.
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:25:31
You're being overly paranoid. This is clearly for security purposes. 
If I find some dude's wallet, I could very easily sign up for a site like Circle, flash his driver's license, and use his credit/debit cards to buy Bitcoin. 
How else would you recommend Circle avoid this type of risk?
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:51:35
If Bitcoin is ever going to be taken seriously as a legitimate currency, it needs regulation. 
Bitcoin needs to have some level of government involvement. 
Countries will not allow a virtual decentralized currency which is best known for illegal transactions to thrive and grow.
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:49:33
No- I'm rather fascinated by the bitcoin phenomenon but, frankly, am unable to understand it.
Unfortunately, this community is full of people like you who are unwilling to help explain it to skeptics, who are unable to debate, and who seem resentful of anyone who isn't a bitcoin fanatic...
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:48:24
The Russian Ruble is not meant to be an investment vehicle. 
Your belief is Bitcoin is based on the fact that you are a fan. Saving money in Bitcoin is SPECULATION. You are lying to yourself if you think otherwise. It's very easy to read a few CoinDesk articles, see some dreamy rants posted on this subreddit, and be fooled into thinking you know where the market is going. No one knows. There are no guarantees. 401K are for stable assets, not for risky investments. 
Stocks have existed for hundreds of years and are still unpredictable. You are not doing yourself any favors by saying Bitcoin is comparable.
I'm not sure if it's worth continuing this conversation. You seem like one of those people eager to gloss over Bitcoin's many flaws just because you have invested in it. Good luck- you'll need it.

I'm sorry for bringing a dose of reality into Welcome to the real world, kids.
@_date: 2014-12-31 05:36:46
Really? You'd be OK if a friend came over and gave sent you "money" worth 1 penny or kopiyka AND you'd have to go through multiple steps to turn it into currency you could use?
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:51:49
I'm not sure I understand your question.
Cash is trackable on some level. It is also controlled and regulated by the government. Even so, it already can be problematic due to the level of anonymity it provides. 
You really think that countries would allow a digital cash alternative that allows even more anonymity to survive without any regulation?
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:14:03
Let's take bitcoin out of the equation and compare credits cards vs. cash. How many businesses offer a cash discount? In my neck of the woods, only gas stations do so (and in most cases, it's still better to pay with credit cards due to cash back).
Businesses don't separate out credit card related processing fees. Very few businesses give a cash discount even though processing cash is even easier/better than bitcoin. If most businesses never bothered doing a cash discount, there is no reason they would do one for bitcoin.

As others have stated, most developed countries have Deposit insurance. For more information, [see Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_insurance).
I always find it funny when Bitcoin fans talk about the dollar losing value. [Like seriously]( dude?
People who want to avoid getting "robbed" through inflation in the US and are risk adverse need to invest in bonds. I-Bonds are designed to counteract inflation. 
Bitcoin is no way a better alternative for people who want to save money and avoid risk. Sound money does not lose more than 50% of its value in 1 year.
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:44:28
Try any bank! You know, those government backed institutions that insure your money and reward consumer spending? Nothing beats cashback :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:15:33
What you asked for is against eBay policy. 
eBay's fee goes toward maintaining their site, innovating their tech, and protecting their customers from scammers. 
Anyone who agrees to an irreversible Bitcoin transaction to pay for an eBay purchase is a moron who's begging to be taken advantage of.
@_date: 2014-08-24 23:16:51
You should sell your bitcoin for cash instead of spending them. If you make your purchases with credit cards, you get cashback and enjoy other benefits like consumer protection, warranty extensions, etc. You can pay your credit card bill with the proceeds of the bitcoin sale. There is no reason to actually spend bitcoin when buying stuff...
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:57:41
The dollar is regulated and controlled by the government...
Math is not regulation. Math simply validates that different Bitcoin are unique.
@_date: 2014-08-25 03:55:20
Lol, how is this a weak response? It's true and you haven't been able to refute anything I've said....
I think you're missing the point, mate. My argument is that there isn't any reason to be a Bitcoin user. So far, you're failing miserably at convincing me otherwise.
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:30:31
Yeah, nothing like overpaying for notebooks...
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:10:49
Yes and that's why most governments have a lot of control over their currencies...
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:46:33
Right, places like [eBay don't sell Amazon gift cards]( And it's not like there are any [gift card exchanges sites]( that would buy them for cash.
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:38:34
I have actually done this before. How about you give it a try and post proof that it doesn't work? As long as you specify that you're not interested in redeeming the card, they would be happy to verify the balance for you.
Amazon Gift Cards are actually super popular on gift card exchange sites. Sign up for an alert at  and you'll see how quickly they are purchased after they are listed. 
To further the point, you can see all the ways legitimate cards can be sold for cash at this link:

Why wouldn't Mechanical Turk workers (who already get paid pennies) want to cut their paycheck in half just to get Bitcoin (a digital currency which is equally difficult to spend)?
Clearly this convoluted explanation coming directly from Purse.io is a lot more realistic than credit card fraud. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:45:35
I have bought Amazon cards before from Raise.com, MonsterGiftCard.com, and others. Amazon cards are super popular and go out of stock really quickly. Like I said, sign up for an alert at  and you'll see how quickly they are purchased after they are listed.
You're just repeating the propaganda Purse is promoting to justify credit card fraud. Ultimately, these guys are going to get shut down for helping facilitate fraud. 
You can risk using the service and hope you're not one of the poor saps who gets left holding the bag when Purse closes shop, pivots, or whatever. Too risky for me but, hey, that's the whole idea behind Bitcoin isn't it? :P
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:23:12
This is nonsense. If you call Amazon or message their support representatives, they can help you check the card balance without applying it your account.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:10:09
Clearly, the CEO of a company that depends on Bitcoin succeeding as a currency has no ulterior motive in predicting that the price will go up...
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:46:43
There are many other mainstream sites where people sell Amazon gift cards. Ex: [eBay](
The only reason people would go to an obscure place like Purse to liquidate Amazon gift cards is because they need the payment they receive to be irreversible. 
Why would someone need the payment they get to be irreversible?   Credit card fraud. 
Anyone using Purse is risking getting a call from the police, FBI, or other government agency at some point in the future. There have already been several people who posted on Reddit who had this happen to them.
Sure, you might get away with saving money in the short term but ultimately, anyone using Purse is playing a dangerous game.
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:46:21
It's a little meaningless to highlight that 30% of all orders were paid with Bitcoin without sharing how many orders you actually received in total. 
Ex) 3 Bitcoin orders out of 10 total orders over the last 7 months isn't much to brag about...
@_date: 2015-10-04 07:45:37
So... 21 bitcoin boxes, implying a total of 70 orders. Eh- still not much to brag about in my book.
@_date: 2015-11-17 06:34:07
I can't believe that people want to risk price fluctuations and pay fees to sell bitcoin for their currency of choice when they can get a higher payout at places like eBay. You can claim otherwise but it seems illogical to me.
Purse **is** rife with fraud and will eventually be shut down. They've been operating for a several years without getting in trouble because they have a few thousand customers. If they ever scale with this business model, I can guarantee that they'll get shut down.
