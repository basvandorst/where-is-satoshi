Not the algorithm itself.  Its too complex.  But if you were saving your privatekey online behind a regular password, those might not be too complex to hack.  A lot of times systems get hacked because nobody changes the default password.  Bitcoin doesn't work like regular passwords though.  Its like if you tried to find a grain of sand and inside every grain of sand on Earth was another Earth and in one of those you have to find one grain of sand.  That's the "odds" of finding a bitcoin address with money in it by randomly going through every possible key and that was BEFORE the lightning network!  That's just on the legacy system. 
If you never share the private key online, it can't be hacked. 
If voting systems used blockchain keys to verify votes instead of variables, it would be a much safer way and accurate way to vote. 
On a hackable device let's say you have a variable $VotesForPutin.  You can change that to anything and there's very little way to verify it unless you had a paper log.
A blockchain network would have several nodes verifying vote transactions matched and the math adds up correctly or it would reject the vote. There's no one variable anymore.  Its a ledger of additions and subtractions.  There's no one admin key and you can't change the value you started with.  You might at best get a privatekey for one vote and could only send that one vote.  You couldn't magically make more.

Every time you "dispose" of a capital asset it is a taxable event. A gain or loss must be recognized regardless of the amount. Spending bitcoin is a disposition just like a sale of bitcoin is a disposition.
That goes for stocks, bonds, derivatives, and yes, cryptocurrency. The issue is more complex for cryptocurrency because many people "spend" it.
It's normally easy because your exchange or broker will track the necessary information for you, and every year they are legally required to provide you with a 1099-B form which has all that information for you.
Bitcoin exchanges aren't sending out 1099-B forms so the onus for reporting falls to the end user.

@_date: 2018-11-16 09:26:23
Before the lightning network, I think altcoins served a very important role in balancing out the needs for cheap transactions sometimes.  And Ethereum served its purpose with the different contract functions to prove that blockchain has more than one use as money.  Now that BitCoin is moving beyond its original parameters though, I think its ubiquitous presence all across the cryptoverse will continue to support its role as the central cryptocurrency no matter what new things may come. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:36:19
I had a plan actually to start paying off my credit cards with bitcoin, but to do that I'd need to put up 3 times the amount of bitcoin for the loan I'm asking for as collateral and every time it drops add more and more to that fund.  
Buying gas with Bitcoin is also a pain right now because the pump charges a temporary fee until you're done pumping and then refunds that.  Makes it difficult to track how much was really spent.
The only thing I've been able to buy with bitcoin successfully and consistently is fast food, but only because I have a shift card.  
My water company still requires me to check the meter manually and pay with a check.  I can't even convince them to accept payments online.  
We need more services that accept bitcoin!  Companies like Steam stepping out of that circle only make things worse.
