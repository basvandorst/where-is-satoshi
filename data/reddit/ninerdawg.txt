That is not how capital gains taxes work. If a CEO of a corporation is given a stock worth $100 today, they owe regular income taxes on $100 even if they do not sell the stock. If they hold the stock for a year and sell it for say $150, they will have paid tax at their ordinary rate on $100 in year line and capital gains taxes on the $50 capital gain in year two. If you eliminated capital gains taxes the CEO in your example would still pay the ordinary income tax on the $100. Getting paid in stock instead of cash does not change the taxable nature of the payment.

Look, if bitcoin is intended to be a currency, you don't want it's price to increase (or decrease.) You want stability. The first requirement for a store of value is that it "stores value." Looking for a bull run in the currency is antithetical to establishing a long run use for it as a currency.

If you have literally 1/2 your wealth in a single asset, you have a dangerously unbalanced portfolio. You should sell some of the batch and place into other assets.

Bullshit. There is a *mens rea* requirement that has to be fulfilled. You cant "accidentally" break that law.
Yes, I know you have read some story somewhere about some poor schmo who just happened to deposit $9,500 every day for a year and got busted. But you know what, its because the Feds think he intended to break the law, and most likely he did intend to.
Its just complete bullshit to think that people are routinely having their money taken because they accidentally broke the financial crimes reporting laws.

Well, buy stocks too, or bonds, or REITS. I’m sure if you hoard bitcoin, you will horde them too, but your portfolio will be massively less risky!

This is not true. If you *structure* your deposits to avoid reporting *requirements* you can get in trouble, but just withdrawing your own money to buy legal this is in no way going to get you "in trouble."

**This just isn't true.** When a currency system has been used to launder money, it absolutely has been blamed and forced to make changes. The best recent example is the reformation in the secrecy of the Swiss banking system that essentially the rest of the world demanded of the Swiss, but similar concerns are what prompted the US to adopt the $10,000 reporting limit on financial transactions. India recently made large bills illegal *spcifically* to stop money laundering/tax evasion.
  Governments absolutely blamed traditional currency systems, and forced reforms, when those systems permittedmoney laundering.

No it doesn't. Just because you say it does doesn't  make it true. People that have more skills will *still* be more employable and wealthier.  
You claim dollars are the issue, how *exactly* do pieces of paper create inequality? They don't. Maybe government policies do, but not dollars *per se*
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:58:34
I dunno, maybe it is a threat *to* income inequality! but it has not *caused* the current levels of inequality, which is what OP was implying.

So, since you are such an expert on the major financial systems, explain to me *exactly* how all the wealth that is currently in the hands of the wealthy going to be magically transformed into bitcoins and then be distributed to, "the people" I suppose. Seriously, what is the mechanism for that?
While you are at it, explain again exactly how bitcoin levels the playing field between say a Wall Street banker with a phd in finance, and a high school dropout in Compton? It doesn't. The guy from Wall Street will *still* be better educated and more able to make money.
Income inequality is not about the currency. It's about differential ability to create and retain wealth.

At best, bitcoin becomes a "mainstream" currency. But that in and of itself does nothing to change income inequality. There is nothing inherent about dollars that creates inequality. Inequality is mostly created from a) differences in human capital, b) initial wealth, and c) willingness (and ability) to postpone consumption. None of that is affected by bitcoin.

Yeah, good luck with that. 
For gods sake though, and I'm really being serious and sincere here, don't put all your money in bitcoins. It's genuinely unstable, and is a much bigger bubble than housing ever was. If you want to put a little money in it, that is fine. But don't invest your life savings. It's far more likely you will wind up destitute than rich through bitcoin.
