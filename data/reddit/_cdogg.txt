We are still so much in the wild-west it is ridiculous.  Please see my post below: 
I have lots of interest in the game because I bought in early.  I am a computer scientist and I find keeping up with all of the development a massive struggle.  There seems to be a big increase in ICO's (initial coin offerings) every day and I find it hard to keep track.
If I was new to crypto my advice would be to only invest what you can afford to lose. 
Edit: spelling - its late and I can't be arsed checking :-)

My advice is to keep your coins in a wallet that you control instead of an exchange or online wallet.  I use Electrum which is a available on multiiple platforms including windows..  Just make sure that you are holding the private keys to your coins, otherwise you don't own the coins.  It is that simple.

No.  Not by any measure

Yes, that's a big part of the success. In my opinion, a crypto currency will not be judged by the market cap but by the technology that sits behind it. Gold and Silver did not become standard bearers because they were worth so much, it was because they had a real-world practical USE.

I am a BTC hodler.
I do think we are all missing the point about what crypto currency is supposed to be.  The total circulation is about 0.3T USD, which is a drop in the ocean compared to other (long established) trading instruments.
My point is that while we are all celebrating a $10k ATH, the currency is still competing with those long established mechanisms which total the ~1000T USD mark.
I am very happy with the uptake of BTC, but please, lets not lose sight of the goal.

And what worries me is that people I have met are pouring their savings into these Currencies/ICOs.  This scares me a lot

Interesting article

Lets all be honest.  Bitcoin (and other cryptos) are so new we have no idea what is going to happen.  Bitcoin could be the preeminent coin that is used throughout the world, to supplement or even replace traditional FIAT currencies.  I truly hope that this is how it plays out (like I have said in previous comments I have a lot of skin the game).  However, we all have no idea how this is going to play out.  In my opinion this is why we haven't seen the real big boys enter the market.  But this is all just my opinion.

I am a computer scientist and I understand the technology behind these cryptos.  They all have their own merits, as with everything that is traded, but the immediate value of each is out of reach to the normal investor.  This will change as the Marketing teams get hold of them and the value in each of them is realised.

Use the Bitcoins, please I beg you all

Electrum (and other wallets) are just that - a place to keep your coins.  The difference between a wallet like Electrum and what is an exchange like Coinbase is that your private keys are stored and available on your PC in Electrum.  Coinbase does not give you these private keys because they say it is too difficult to provide them for all users (take from that what you will!). Coinbase is just an exchange, it allows you to easily deposit USD/GBP into BTC and vise-versa.  If Coinbase becomes insolvent then you will never get your private keys, as a result you won't have your bitcoins.  I'm not sure what you mean by "blockchain"? blockchain.info maybe? If it is an online wallet then just make sure there is a mechanism for you to export the private keys. 
Every time you transfer BTC between exchanges and wallets there are fees - the exchange may charge a percentage and/or fixed fee plus there is the TX fee for using BTC.
Hope this helps :-)

I've never had to export private keys from an online (iOS wallets are usually online wallets) wallet.  Googling this makes me cringe because it is so ridiculously complicated (it doesn't need to be this way).  Anyway, depending on how much you have (DO NOT, EVER, EVER POST ANY PERSONAL DETAILS OR HOW MUCH YOU HAVE) then the simplest way might be to just transfer the coins to another wallet that you trust (e.g. Electrum installed on your PC, which you can then export your private key easily) directly.  One of the premises that Bitcoin was built on was to allow - i.e. you can just move your coins about , from wallet to wallet to someone else's wallet etc etc. 
Anyway, I often use a site called shapeshifter.io to move coins around.

I get that, but do you understand how fragile the whole crypto space is right now?
I salute everyone involved and this IS a historic moment, no doubt about that. Let's also remember the technology that brought us here.  Do you remember MySpace.com?
