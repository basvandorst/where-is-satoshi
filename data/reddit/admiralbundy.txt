It’ll never burn out. I think for the 1070 drop the power limit to 80%. Set core clock+150 and memory +500. Have the temp limit at 75C.

Def mine on it. I use winminer. Just keep the temps below 75C. I find setting the power limit to 80% is more efficient. Your getting money for nothing. Why not do it??

Has anyone followed the tether price through this? It seems to be holding at parity even with -200M on market cap.

Took me about 5 hours. Now I’m thinking I’ve stuffed up. All on SSD with 100Mbit connection.

Australia post is the worst public service in the country. I don’t believe any of this.

Shouldn’t we be seeing the available supply being reduced for usdt? In order to correct the price. And if it doesn’t then it’s going to pop??
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:52:25
Well it’s 87c so I’m assuming it’s gone.
