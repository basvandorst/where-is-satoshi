Well then throw their own terms of use at them and say you didn't agree to that upon sign up?

We'll see - 3k is big resistance, but if it crosses it and stays, you'll see a high of 3.3k+ today

From their terms:


So withdraw to credit card? It didn't say too much about a flat fee for closing the account. Have a good read and figure out if theres a way for you to avoid fees.

Had a look at that - yeah I guess it's the publicity it creates? I was watching the news last night, it was on all major news outlets - price of BTC up ~15%

What do we think is the net impact to Bitcoin?
I guess we imagine quite a few BTC's will now be seized, not sure if it'll be enough to have any signicant impact to the price. But it might mean a load of people need to buy BTC to rebuy from a different site? I feel that this may already be priced into the market as Alphabay has been offline for a couple weeks already.
