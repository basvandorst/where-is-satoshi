It's in the planning phase and very much on the development roadmap. They have open dev calls and they discuss the progress monthly. Check out dev calls, they're open to anybody:  [

I'm sorry you feel that way but a majority of the users are Bitcoiners on OpenBazaar. There are many different opinions in the community. If you do not want to use other coins it's entirely usable as a bitcoin-only platform

I'm not on that team, it's a private company and not representative of all the OB devs, you can find a [list of contributors here](  But I do follow a lot of OB1 devs on Twitter. From that list alone I know Stevie is a Bitcoin maximalist, you can [check out his twitter]( Most of the rest are voluntarists and don't support BCH over BTC, the opinion is to let people pay with whatever they want. That's why they're building lightning support because that's what people asked for

I have no relation to OB1 which is the link that was posted. OB1 is a private company, it's like taking shots at the CEO of Coinbase and saying his opinion is representative of all Bitcoiner's. 
OpenBazaar exists  a project, not a company. Anyone can contribute, fork, or do whatever they want with it. The only idea behind it is to support decentralized markets. It is by far the most advanced decentralized marketplace project.
