You're looking at just the technical side. Let's say MtGox built a simple rule that trades must but 1.0 BTC or above. BOOM, problem solved. 
It's acceptable to have a platform that can't handle tons or trades. It's also great to have a platform that can handle micro-trades. It's *totally unacceptable* to have a platform that handles arbitrary micro-trades and can't handle large volumes of trades. I suspect the system you worked on either: 
a) Had good business rules preventing massive trade volumes
b) Had a good "Plan B" for high volumes that handled high volumes in a stable way, or
c) Was really lucky
EDIT: I'm not actually suggesting a 1 BTC limit, there are other, better more complicated suggestions floating around, I was just using that as a simple example. Right now it sounds like MtGox has overlap between things it lets users do and things it can't support well, which is bad.

Yeah, your rule is better. I wasn't suggesting they actually implement the 1 BTC limit, just using that as an extreme value.

You're correct that this isn't traditional HFT, but it can be handled identically to HFT control schemes (fees, minimum transactions, etc). I'm afraid some people are confusing the motive and the fix. The motive may be HFT or it may be a trade based DOS attach, doesn't really matter, it can be fixed using relatively simple and proven techniques.

By all means, please explain it to me then.

I will readily admit I've never done anything related to a trading platform, but I regularly work on apps that do document retrieval (and logging of the transaction) of reasonably large images. 33ms per retrieval would be a reasonable performance time for extraction of a normal image. And, mind you, I'm bound by whatever hardware I'm given b/c I'm working in a corporate environment. So, long story short, unless handling a mathematical transaction is far slower than sending 100kb over the wire, I would posit that 30 trans per second is really pretty crappy performance. Either this test is not as valid as we think it is, or MtGox performance is not good enough for a premier trading platform.

The primary trading platform for an asset fails to scale and causes an unpredictable crash of said asset? I would argue that that's the definition of a shitty platform.

Fair point, it's not 100% clear that MtGox caused the crash. Either way it didn't perform well under stress, adding to general anxiety and almost definitely further hurting values.
