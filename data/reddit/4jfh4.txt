I can tell you actually haven't given this any thought.  Thanks.

Devil's advocate: most people only really buy from retailers online and are able to pay just by signing in somewhere.  With BTC, you have to wait on confirmations and there's tons of overhead for getting started and keeping your money safe.
Of course that can change with time...
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:32:05


It absolutely does, because I said the *legal* definition. You're not paying attention.


You are jumping to so many unreasonable conclusions in this paragraph.  I'm not recognizing that people break laws, REALLY?  You can't honestly think that.
Jesus titty-fucking christ, I can't believe how eager you are to argue.  The fact is this (and was the whole point of my original post): that the LEGAL definition of a business includes paying taxes.  End of story dude.  You can argue until you're blue in the face about how things *should* be or what *some* people do (e.g. illegally operating a business), but it doesn't make my statement any less true.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:23:15
How does that lead to more faith in BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:52:05
Unfortunately for you, you have to obey the laws of your country of residence.  I'm sorry that you don't like it, but that doesn't make it any less real.
By the way, the majority of people in the US or world would agree that this is what defines an actual business.  You can't just choose to define some words only by what a single, small community (e.g. r/bitcoin) thinks (it's obvious the consensus here) if you want any reliable conveyance of the meaning of words to different groups of people.
I'm actually surprised that a simple, technically-correct statement is so controversial here.  It's like you guys are plugging your ears saying "nope nope nope, can't hear you world, i make up my own definitions" -- if you want change, that's not the way to get it done.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:22:05
Funny, I was going to say the same thing to you.  Evading taxes and denying the law is childish.  You can be a proponent of change while still obeying the law.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:13:02
Ditto, kind of hilarious actually.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:33:41
I agree, but what *effect* would that have?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:55:42
America is one of the most (if not the most) diverse countries on the planet.  I personally know more people that are meticulous with their money, than people who are careless with it.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:57:01
Is that not the case?  I've just read that in about a dozen different places, so just thought it was well established to be the case.
One article that comes to mind:
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:53:16
So what kind of transition (in detail) would you propose?  In all these future society campaigns I see, they tend to leave out that part, and most people that claim to be "realists" won't get on board because they can't see a clear path (no matter the duration).
Also, if we're aiming for a better society, why not something more along the lines of the Venus Project (just focus on the main idea instead of any specific details that might seem flawed), where currency is gone altogether?  Or do you see your stuff as more of a transition into something like that?
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:35:17
Well, thanks for your contribution.  I'm glad you were able to think critically and really listen.
Maybe you won't be such a condescending piece of shit next time?  One can only hope, I guess.
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:48:32
I bet that'd work for a while, until they put some automation in place to track your wallet for future spending (and you can bet your ass they'd do it after enough people start claiming BTC losses).
If the max time limit for an audit is still 3 years, then you'd just have to keep it there without spending for 3 years, and you'd be good to go  =P
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:55:08
these puns are un*bear*able
... did i do it right?
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:05:44
I'm sorry dude, but you're technically wrong.  You can't *legally* operate a business without filing with the government and paying taxes.  Note that ILICKSHOES said "starting a business is different from accepting payment," so he acknowledges that, sure, you can take money without telling the government, but that it's not the same as *actually* running a legitimate business.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:52:53


It happens often with mini-crashes due to a single seller.
Appreciate your responses btw
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:03:39
lol, i'm sorry massa, i'll try to do better
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:57:49
I appreciate your response as well as your ideals (and agree on most points), but unfortunately the point here isn't where we *should* be headed.  I love to talk about ideals and future societies until I'm blue in the face.  I'm simply pointing out that in today's world, this is the way it is and he is still technically right.
Also, what grounds did you have for this statement?


If "voluntary funding" hasn't been done before on a large scale, how do we know it will succeed?  Just for the sake of conversation, I'm curious how much you've thought about or researched this.
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:13:20
I (somewhat) agree ideologically, but he's technically right.  And my hesitation with 100% ideological agreement has to do with taxes -- governments need taxes to do the things that most people agree governments should do, but if no "business" had to pay taxes, the government couldn't do its job.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:00:51
True, but what alternatives are there?
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:24:42
We *are* talking about different things -- that's exactly what I wanted mughat to realize, but apparently he didn't. Check out my last response to him.


Of course they don't mention laws -- how can a simple definition possibly include all implications for all geographies?  The fact remains that to technically/actually/legally (all synonyms in this case, in my opinion, and if your beef is with the way I used those words, then we found our problem. But you know what I meant, and to argue just for the sake of argument is pointless) run a business in the US/UK/most countries, you have to register it with some government and pay your taxes.
So yes, you and mughat are using a loose (for lack of a better word) interpretation of business, and I'm using more of a strict interpretation with real-world implications.  As an aside, what made you pick google to give you the definition of a word ("technical"), instead of some other entity?  I used a government's idea of a business here because that's the most authoritative entity I can think of on what would actually constitute a business (and besides, it's not about the wording of the definition in this case anyway, and more about what that *implies*).
I guess I've said about all that I can.  If my point hasn't made it across by now, it's not going to.  Thanks for the exchange...
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:41:04
Absolutely! They make it so easy for consumers and they charge the merchants, so the real benefactors of Bitcoin are merchants (currently).  
We can only get widespread adoption if there's some incentive for buyers, so the single biggest thing we should be focusing on is making it easier.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:08:05
Good stuff, thanks for sharing.  I tend to agree with binlargin in that, on a micro scale, humans are very compassionate and willing to help others, while on a large scale, humans are generally more selfish.  I think it's just in our nature, but we can suppress that if we actively think about it and force ourselves to do the "best" thing for humankind.
I like to use the analogy of fighting / physical violence -- we know that doesn't really accomplish anything but sometimes we want to rip someone's head off.  Our ancestors used to do that, but now our society has conditioned us to think it through and suppress those urges for the betterment of everyone.
Anyway, looking towards the future and a (hopefully) post-scarcity society, I can see how currency could become almost useless.  If everyone is doing what they want because they enjoy it and we don't have this hoarding complex due to scarcity, we could all do things that directly benefit other humans, instead of working day after day for a handful of execs.  That belief takes a lot of faith in humanity as well, but I definitely want to believe we can get there one day  =)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:39:23
The assertive people don't have this "loan" problem -- I did the same thing as you (albeit in 5 years, probably for less $$) and the only loan I took out was in grad school because it was 0% while I was in school, and I could make 6% on it for a year.  Worked full time, scholarships, etc... graduated with some hefty savings.
The problem is, "normal" people who fall in the middle of the curve don't think about this kind of shit and are just told by advisers, parents, etc that they need to go to college at *any* cost, for *any* major, and they'll be fine.  Then they spend 5 years and take out $100k in loans for a liberal arts degree.
I'm just sympathetic towards them, that's all.  I know it's not really my problem, but I feel for a lot of the people that get themselves in that situation without really knowing.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:06:23
There are definitely smart people on both sides, but I think the cause for concern is the fact that bugs exist in *all* software, so *a single* exploit can effectively ruin Bitcoin (that's the argument at least).
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:43:15
Since it's supposedly controlled democratically, is that necessarily a bad thing?
Bitcoin can easily be manipulated by a single person, which I don't think would be the case with Zen...
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:33:32


Everyone knows this, but it's not a selling point for customers switching to Bitcoin. People want to see a direct benefit.  We know it'll probably reduce prices down the road if everyone adopts it, but the majority of people want timely, direct benefits.


We can focus on lots of things in parallel, but personally (like I mentioned) I think the single biggest factor for mass adoption would be making it easier for buyers to use day-to-day.  I think that decreasing costs is a selling point for merchants, and would still indirectly benefit consumers over time, but that point alone wouldn't attract as many users as making it *really* easy to use.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:27:23
Haha totally, I should have been more specific.  I mean current alternatives for normal folk in the US, and it was definitely a serious question.
Unfortunately for us, I think government-funded colleges are a LONGGG way out, and some people say it might never happen. Boooo
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:40:22
hell, someone had to say it
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:43:57
Very cool, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:28:27


Vendors will hold onto that extra margin for dear life though. If that cost ever does get eliminated, consumers would still have no protection and would be taking all the risk.  I'm thinking a very large cut in price would have to happen to attract the average consumer with the current state of things.
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:23:51
how likely is that? what kind of difficulty increase rate would this cause?

They all log keystrokes, but only a subset of them take screenshots.  His idea, albeit naive, is still better than nothing.  Security is all about layers.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:59:47
so serious...
@_date: 2013-05-02 06:03:03
Definitely! I would love to see more merchants offering direct discounts like that.  I think that'd really push consumer adoption.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:42:28
I mean, articles and posts are everywhere:
I don't get it, are you denying that this happens, or ... ?
Central control definitely isn't ideal, but neither is "free currency" if that means it can be manipulated so easily. I don't like that MtGox essentially a central exchange, and neither do most people, but that's the way it happened. I think people just gravitate towards those sorts of systems, just because they're easier.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:50:49


This isn't a debate on what's right or wrong, please stop trying to turn it into that to have something to argue about.  I agree with most humanitarian ideals, so I have to ask, what was the point of your post?
To get us back on track, you completely bailed on my original point, which is what legally defines a business.  If you want to ignore it and preach, that's fine, but I'm just reminding you in case you forgot.
By the way, I think what we have here is a misunderstanding on your part.  Here's what happened:
1) ILICKSHOES referred to the legal/actual definition of a business (he was being technical), and
2) You didn't recognize (or care) that he used the legal definition, so you insulted him.
Then I chimed in and said he was actually correct, because I hate when people are wrong *and* condescending at the same time.
I wish you the best...
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:45:35
Very insightful!  I'm glad you took the time to write that up (and that I read it all).
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:32:39
Quit being arrogant -- paying taxes is what LEGALLY DEFINES your business, whether you think it's right or not.  By the way, taxes are used to protect your rights.  How would they do that without money?  If they don't get money from taxes, where would it come from?  Donations?
Please try to think.
