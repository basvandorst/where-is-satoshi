We're not talking about Guiness Book of World Records. If I knew this was even a thing, I would have shown the altimeter screen on my Garmin GPS running watch and had a friend record me placing the trade on video with his phone. I also could have taken a screen shot of the trade confirm as well to cross-reference with GPS data from my hike.
If you live near Denver, then just drive up to Evans on the weekend. On a clear day, you should have cell phone service.

HODL until BTC/USD valuation is meaningless. Let the no-coiners keep their worthless pieces of paper. See you at the Citadel!

I'm pretty sure I beat this.  Last summer, I hiked the ridgeline along Mt. Evans and Mt. Spalding, then bought some BTC on coinbase from the parking lot while eating lunch before driving home. I'm sure someone else has as well - if not, then someone in the Denver area should do it this weekend and post pics.
The road going to Mt. Evans is the highest in North America, with the parking lot just below the peak of 4,346m. It won't look quite as dramatic as this if you're just chilling with shorts and a sweatshirt, but if you get it on record it will count all the same!

Great point! WTF are they doing mountaineering with a laptop? Ounces feel like pounds when you're carrying it up a mountain.

Hold the door! I want to get in one last order once my deposit clears in my checking account. Hopefully, I can get in before this rocket ship takes off to the moon!

These price interval memes age quickly.  Get those ATH memes ready instead!

I'm 80% HODL until it hits Barista FIRE, then HODL all else past McAfee's dinner.

Bitcoin leads to freedom from tyranny and corporate greed. Fiat leads to a gradual erosion of stored value through inflation, currency dilution, direct banking fees, and indirect banking fees (e.g. merchant transaction fees passed down to consumers).

IDK, Data from Star Trek is a really smart android. His positronic brain gives him computational capabilities which far surpass what we humans are able to comprehend. He wouldn't have launched a globalcoin if he didn't foresee a high probability of success.
I won't be buying any (I'm not even on FB), but I like the concept of a blended-currency stable coin with mass implementation. Ultimately, this is good for BTC.
