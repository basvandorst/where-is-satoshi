Wuille (spell it right please) spoke precisely about the fact that validating transactions which involve not-in-core TXO would incur the enormous cost of going to disk.  His work was in fact what inspired me to do the math.  Multi-level cache *does* help, but it isn't an algorithmic solution to having to keep the TXO set around — merely a band-aid.

The Monero folks are working tirelessly to scale it.
The spreadsheet (  ) depicts a scenario in which Monero has already solved its main scalability problem (as-full-as-possible pruning).  Beyond that, there's little algorithmic change that can be made to Monero to improve its scaling.

Yes, technically you are correct.  In an irrelevant way.
You present no reason to convince anyone that your desires are what will happen.  I'm just doing you a favor by presenting you the history of a chain becoming two competing chains rather than a single thing with a dead sibling, but you don't have to believe me that the same thing will happen.  Things will happen irrespective of your wishes for the future.  You can demand everyone will behave in such a way that a new chain must supersede the old chain... but your demands are unenforceable.
I'm just trying to be nice to you, so you stop believing idiotic wishful thinking that will cost you money.   However, if you are planning to lose money, hey, Vegas it all you want!  I'll probably profit from it anyway :-)  It's your cash... until it's mine!

Forgive me, but Star Wars "philosophy" is not an argument.
Contrary to what your favorite movie hero told you, it's perfectly okay to be absolutist about many things (you did not seem to have even entertained the idea, by the way — you just accepted what Hollywood told you without questioning it, and repeated it verbatim as a reply to my quote).
For example: I am an absolutist against rape.  Does this make me a Sith or some other sort of bad person?  No, obviously not.  On the contrary, *the bad people* would be those who suggest that rape is okay in *some* circumstances, like, you know, "the bitch ain't giving up the goods", or "it's Saturday", or "it isn't rape if we're married".  It's the *anti-absolutists* who are the wicked ones in that case.
There are quite a few matters in which you *should* be an absolutist — rape is merely the canonical example.  I encourage you to rub some brain cells together so that you can come up by yoursel with a few other matters that merit absolutism.


Here, you're merely repeating the middle ground fallacy that the Dutch government used as pretext to punish publication of papers without their permission, as well as the U.S. government used as pretext to punish Bitcoin trade without their permission.
Since that was already addressed in the post, I will conclude that you have nothing new to add.  I mean, the fallacy you just tried to argue for was already addressed in the article proper, so if you keep repeating it, that probably means — it's fair, I think, for me to deduce that — you're not interested in examining your own incorrect beliefs.

I only assumed one thing, and that was the definition that the forkers set forth for "success".  The assumptions are listed at the beginning of the post, which I have now clarified for your benefit.


That's not an assumption — that's a conclusion based on real-world observation.
Which chain is most profitable varies from instant to instant.  Bitcoin miners hopped onto Litecoin when their rigs became unprofitable with Bitcoin but profitable with Litecoin.  Ethereum miners hopscotched from chain to chain as they became less or more profitable for them.  There was software which would tell you which chain to mine to make more money.  I added a link to the software on the post, so you can see it for yourself.
Contrary to the forkers' wishes, it isn't the case that one of the chains will go on a downtrend until zero profitability. Rather, the profitability of any one chain in a pair moves up when miners leave it, and down when miners join it.  So the miners can choose which chain to mine on, and switch back and forth.
I have clarified this point on the original writeup.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:12:06


The fewer people mine a chain, the more profitable it is to become a miner.  As long as you gloss over that factor, you won't understand the argument I made (which I'm merely repeating here).
Edit: I took the time to clarify the post's wording that explains why total abandonment of any one chain will simply not happen.

The whitepaper explicitly mentions Bitcoin's limitations for microtransaction uses.
That is how I know — because I have read.


Let me see, who should I believe about that, the author of the foundational whitepaper of Bitcoin, or some rando on Reddit?
I trust you know the answer.
You are right about one thing, though: the free market in cryptocurrencies will solve that microtransaction problem — and the way the free market is solving that problem today, is *by individuals creating new, competing, innovative currencies like Monero*.

In comparison to Bitcoin, it doesn't matter in any case, because your transactions in Bitcoin are already ending up in big data centers (and data warehouses for analysis).
This was meant to disprove the angle that Monero is more scalable because it has a dynamic and unlimited block size.  It turns out that was a specious argument all along.  It *is* true that the number of transactions per second can grow when the block size is increased, but only up to a certain limit, beyond which there's an algorithmic ceiling, and an economic ceiling, which is reached.

Sadly, nope.  Your belief is disproven by the graphs.  You can argue that Monero has better features (that is totally arguable), but scalability-wise, Monero has a cap around 100tps, even assuming technologies of the year 2020.  A version of the Bitcoin algorithm with an "unlimited block size" has much better scaling properties.  Past the first scaling milestone I mentioned, you would need to assume in the year 2020 that technologies of the year 2030 are available to you, which is simply not going to happen.

Check the math.  At that point, only specialized farms with massive amounts of storage will be able to validate Monero.  Not decentralized anymore.

Sorry, but your conclusion does not follow from your premise — security decreases as hash power decreases, but it is not true that hash power decreases permanently, and it's not true at all that users of the original chain stop paying transaction fees.  Logically, what you're saying is false in multiple ways.
Experimentally, we also know it's false.  Ethereum classic security dropped a bit as people moved to the new chain.  Ethereum classic value plummeted to the floor too.
For a few days.  If things had stayed the way they were, you would have been right.  But, unfortunately, that was not what happened.
Then people that flocked away to the Ethereum challenger chain, eventually flocked back to the original chain.  People kept paying transaction fees in the Ethereum classic chain.  Hash power grew right back up.  Holding / selling / mining Ethereum classic became far more profitable than it was just a few days ago.
Data does not lie.
Your convictions regarding this subject are incompatible with both logic and reality, and therefore belong in the realm of wishful thinking.  Whether you will abandon them, of course, it is up to you.
You don't have to convince me, though.  Your task is to convince those who would continue to mine / trade / accept Bitcoin original chain coins, and tell them that they should abandon that chain and ignore their own profit motive.
Once the hard fork comes, you'll find out how persuasive you really are :-)


Again, sorry, but the reality of what happened to Ethereum shows it's not "two or three loonies" — it's about half of the original chain users.  Unless your coin had 6 loonies, it won't be 3 loonies per chain.

Edit: I will be away for a few hours.  If the graphs appear unreasonable, draw your own conclusions from the data presented below.  Thanks, and sorry I can't be present.
 data for the graphs is accessible here:
This page has a link to a downloadable spreadsheet that you can view.  Despite claims by a few liars here, the above is perfectly safe.  The spreadsheet is macro-free, it's free, and anyone can open it with free and open source software (LibreOffice Suite).  If you do not have the software, you can upload it to your favorite cloud service in order to inspect the contents, without any fear of malware.  Downloading the file is safe.  Uploading it to your favorite cloud office suite is also safe.  **Do not let ignorant people scare you into bullshit computer security beliefs.**
Summary of findings:
* At 3 TPS (about Bitcoin today), there is an explosion in data validation costs that makes it completely impossible to run validating nodes except for hard profit.  This is the centralization stage.
* At ~3 TPS, Bitcoin has an edge over Monero because it doesn't require expensive storage technology (like Zeus RAM drives) to keep it going.  And remember those numbers project 3 TPS many years down the road, whereas we already have 3 TPS with Bitcoin using current, shitty storage technology.  I can run a full Bitcoin node today on a bandwidth-limited connection and IOPS-limited drive, no problem — this would **not** be true for a 3 TPS Monero node.
* At 100 TPS, the time to validate a year's worth of transactions exceeds a year.
* At 3K TPS, the space needed to store the minimum data necessary to validate transactions begins to exceed the growth in storage available for the purpose, based on previous parameters.
* Some folks argue that the 3 TPS figure is too low.  I'm open to believing that, but even if the figure was substantially higher, eventually the problems of having to keep the TXO around catch up with Monero.
**Key takeaway: Monero can easily beat Bitcoin in performance, if an algorithm is devised that helps Monero avoid the need to keep the TXO set in memory.  Without that algorithm, Monero remains bound to a low TPS.**
**[UPDATE: someone has come up with an algorithmic rule for Monero's mixing process which would make this problem go away.](  Progress!**
A concern raised by a Monero user / dev:


2. 180K reads/sec from spinning rust or SSD can only happen with very expensive parallel arrays, or with datasets which have a hot set in memory (which won't be the case as the TXO grows far beyond RAM size).  This just proves my point that centralization is forced, at some point in the timeline,  by Monero's algorithmic demand that TXO be kept as a working set (whether in disk or in RAM).
4. LMDB cannot give Monero equal-to-RAM performance, because LMDB only serves as a way to obtain the necessary data to validate the incoming transactions.  Assuming that the TXO does not fit in RAM, you still need to go to disk to obtain the necessary blocks to perform the computations to validate a transaction.  No magical storage or database technology can prevent that.  Even if LMDB gave you a 5X performance edge over paging in and out from disk and into RAM, this is just a linear improvement that will be soon overshadowed by database growth (see next point).
3. Faster-than-exponential growth of the TXO set means that no linear improvement, or even exponential improvement, of computer technology can cross that ~3 TPS hump that we see on the graphs (without a 3 orders of magnitude degradation in transaction validation performance, which is the point of the graph).  It does not matter what LMDB can do for you today, as the growth surpasses what it can do for you.
4. Tweaking initial parameters in the spreadsheet can only serve to delay the point at which the 3 TPS problem occurs, or the 100 TPS problem occurs, or the ~3K TPS problem occurs.
2. Some people are claiming that I have refused to provide the data.  As the link above makes it clear, those are blatant lies.
These conclusions arise from (a) realistic, conservative parameters for computing growth (b) optimistic (in cases, completely vaporwarish) parameters for Monero's scaling, evolution and needs.  So, before anyone says that Monero is going to be the "money of tomorrow, not of today", keep in mind that the projections already contemplate the "computers of tomorrow".
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:35:55
Probably, probably not, I'm inclined to agree with you.
It's important to know that Bitcoin could scale better than Monero — irrespective of block size, which Monero supporters cite as "proof of better scalability" — simply because of the fact that Monero has an algorithm that is even less amenable to scaling than Bitcoin's.
Granted, Monero has that disadvantage, which is a direct result of Monero's added privacy.  So it remains to be seen what will happen.  
But, speaking strictly about scalability, it's totally false to say that Monero is more scalable.

Here's the spreadsheet: 
Even with a conservative 300 bytes block space used for transactions, Monero remains a growth hog.
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:56:41


The whole point of my post was to point out that having to keep the TXO around was the reason Monero can't scale (without centralization) past Bitcoin size, and can't scale (period) past 100 TPS.  Whether this is a weakness of Monero or not, the underlying factor is certainly a characteristic of it, without which Monero simply can't work.


In case you're referring to me (unlikely): don't be a douche, besh.  I spent two hours coming up with this work — this is hardly trollery.


We expect that old transactions will be pruning, but neither the UTXO nor the TXO can be pruned, ever, in Monero's design.  This is a reality of the design of Monero.


I think I have started by putting forward the right foot.

And today, that's pretty much what we got.
* The peer-to-peer markets dried up substantially.
* Charlie Shrem ended up in prison.
* A guy trading coins in Florida got charged with unlicensed money transmission (only now, after two years, he was released).
* Many exchanges folded, and many others simply prohibited U.S. customers, leaving only a handful of exchanges that clearly are Too Big To Fail.
* The use of Bitcoin for transactions got saddled with the burden of capital gains tax / accounting, substantially diminishing people's interest in using Bitcoin as a currency.
* People are in fear of going to prison for the "crime" of buying and selling coins without going through the very banking / permissioned system we are all trying to avoid.
So, yes, we predicted that the "regulations" would have those effects, and they did.  Of course, now that those things have happened, pinheads supporting "regulations" no longer say "ah, that's not going to happen" — they have changed their tune to "those victims had it coming, why did they disobey?".

That question fundamentally does not make sense.
Think of the question "why should or shouldn't a semi be a sportscar?"  That's not a question you would ask, because you understand already that a sportscar and a semi are designed for *different purposes* which are *at odds with each other* and are therefore shaped by *different design decisions*.  We know that a semi *is not* a sportscar, so the question "why shouldn't it be?" is besides the point.
Same thing with Bitcoin.  Its creator explicitly warned, in the document explaining Bitcoin's design, that Bitcoin was not meant to be a micropayment transaction network.
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:13:11

17 cents is perfectly reasonable.  Bitcoin is not a micropayment transaction network.
Edit: to the angry downvoters, how about not shooting the messenger, and how about reading the Bitcoin whitepaper instead?
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:36:40


The people who "were touting" such a thing never even bothered reading the white paper that designed and created Bitcoin.  Had they done that, they would not have been making shit up out of whole cloth.  Sorry you were fooled by blabbermouths who bordered on criminal negligence.
That doesn't make Bitcoin less valuable, though.  Just like transactional databases have their own value separate from analytics databases, each style of value transference network has its own value.


Your finding is based on rumor, hearsay, and disinformation.  Sorry.  I wish you were right, and I wish the original questioner was right, but that is simply not the case, mathematically speaking.
My advice is to use a different currency.  Ripple and Ethereum both explicitly support the use case of micropayments, and both directly network (one way or another) into Bitcoin, to settle larger payments.
If you came in here expecting a sportscar, while not having read the brochure for the Mack truck being built here, please, understand, it's not my fault or anyone else's that you're disappointed.  I really feel for you and anyone else who was misled by unscrupulous and unethical hype peddlers who didn't bother fact-checking the shit they were about to vomit.  My only recommendation is to read the white paper.
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:03:03


Irrespective of whatever you say (or how you project about "me being condescending" when in fact it is you who are) Bitcoin as-is won't support microtransactions.  Feel free to write BIP + code to change things.  Hot air won't.

Yes.  They will have to use a different currency other than Bitcoin.  This is not a problem, as we already have at least something useful for the purpose which can interface with Bitcoin as well: Ethereum.


Outside Bitcoin.


ETH sounds like the right digital asset for that particular purpose.
A fundamental philosophic point of Bitcoin is *not* to have a single monopolistic currency -- it is rather the opposite, let currencies compete and let users use the best tool for the job.  You would not use a Philips screwdrivers to drive a flathead screw.  Same here.

@_date: 2016-06-16 00:40:14
Not true.  I was at the payment channels presentation that happened a few weeks ago.  It is not designed to create micropayments -- it is designed to scale the count of normal-sized payments which the Bitcoin network expects, but those payments are still not going to be free (or absurdly economical) because the resources going into building the payment channels network *are not free*.
Mathematically and economically, payment channels do not create a use case by which payments which are cumbersome with $0.10 fees are automatically cheaper.  Nor do they achieve a 100X scaling capacity either.  And, finally, payment channels bind your money to a specific channel, so that you need to route your payments (technically, payment promises, but all of them crypto-assured) through the channel (and a few hops as well).
Understand the tech before peddling untruths, please.  It is vitally important that people understand what the technology can and cannot do.

That funneling is tempered by (a) how those coins achieve their scale (b) economic considerations w.r.t. the endurance of the value of those coins.
For example, it is very easy to move some of your bitcoins to Ethereum, and then you can do a crapton of stuff like micropayments... but you would be a fool to keep a substantial amount of value into Ethereum while knowing that the Ethereium network keeps printing money forever... so rationally you would only move the money you plan to use in the short term, and then move back into Bitcoin whatever money you get back from your economic activity using Ethereum.
Same you would do if you had a bank account and a cash register.

We told you that KYC/AML would bring about the end of your ability to have privacy in your finances, because it would create the necessary databases to track your every financial transaction, and to punish you very easily if you decide to transact outside the financial system.
We told you that KYC/AML would cause a global price stagnation that would last very long.
**Everything we predicted has become true.**
But no, the imbeciles who thought "YES, DESTROYING BITCOIN PRIVACY IS SURELY WHAT'S GONG TO MAKE BITCOIN MAINSTREAM", in their ever-more-stupid quest to pursue popularity above any and all values, cheered for KYC/AML.

He's wrong about his assumption.  Once they have the data, software can dice through it and link it to the massive amount of data that the IRS already extorts from nearly all other firms.  And then they can use the output of that to form-mail extortion letters en masse.  Given that they have been known for demanding money down to 85 cents, and they don't really seem to give too much of a shit about the absurd expense of collecting on that demand — legitimate or not — there is exactly *zero* reason to make the assumption that your interlocutor made.

Horribly dumb wishful thinking.  Once the software exists to analyze the transactions, it costs effectively the same (marginal cost) to send 1 million extortion letters or 1 dozen.  And most small fish are exactly the kinda people who, when getting one of their extortion letters, just pay up whatever they demand, precisely because they do not have the money or the time to challenge the extortion.
But most importantly, whether they aim at 1 million people or 1 dozen, if you were a loyal Coinsnitch user, the IRS still gets a 100% complete record of your Bitcoin holdings, down to the microsecond and the satoshi.  Your financial privacy = dead.

ARPANET was super centralized, so much so, that everyone who wanted access to it, had to log via a terminal into one of very few nodes connected to ARPANET.  The computing didn't happen on your "computer" (actually, a teletype), but on someone else's computer, of which there existed very few, and you were very privileged if you had that sort of access to one of those computers.
The only thing more centralized than ARPANET was the (at the time normal) practice of the day where *everyone* connected via teletype to a *single* mainframe, that had no other sort of network connectivity at all.  This is why it is said that ARPANET was a step (very tiny) towards decentralization.

All of you government suckers haven't yet caught to the fact that the price has only gone **down** since governments began to meddle with / tax / arrest Bitcoin users, all the way from $1100 to $220.  Never mind that Goxings were already illegal in the first place, yet governments have decided to do absolutely *nothing* to punish Goxers.  Never mind that Bitcoin was in fact, from the moment it was released in version 0.0.1, already legitimate and perfectly legal to use as well, so there's no need to "legitimize" anything.  Never mind that the infamous "bitlicense" would sink most Bitcoin businesses, leaving only a handful of oligopolists.  Never mind that no edict that makes an already-legitimate business *illegal* except for the richest people can possibly  "legitimize" said business -- if anything, it's the exact opposite, because it makes the business *illegitimate* for most people.
But no, for you suckers, up is down, dry is wet, and it's always that *the next magical government paper full of threats* will fix it all!  Oh, pretty please, Holy Godvernment, bukkake us all with the magical cum of legitimacy and justice that can only come from *your wyrd*!

You've just been told that we're the "bad guys", you believed it without proof, and you keep perpetuating this deceit.


This sentence is meaningless in more ways than one:
1. "Society" doesn't "use" anything, because "society" is a concept, not an actual thing with a mind that uses things.  *People* use things.
2. "Property" is simply a concept that encompasses a number of *theories* about who gets to use what when -- nothing more, nothing less.  Hoppean property theory, Marxist property theory, feudalism, and many others, each is a *specific theory*, prescribing different answers to the question.  Feudalism is simply the *obsolete theory* (nonetheless, very much alive today in some niches) that the *rulers* ought to decide who gets to use what when.

Your analogy is cancer because the "people who receive you" when you travel abroad aren't actually legitimate private property owners:
* When you go to your neighbor, you abide by his rules because he can prove to you he owns the house, having acquired it consensually and properly.
* When you go to a different nation, even if you go directly into a host's private property, there is still some stranger living sorta nearby who *doesn't own said property* yet falsely claims to control your behavior "legitimately" irrespective of what your host says.
All in all, dumb analogy that doesn't capture anything truthful about geopolitics, and is as "legit" as a child thinking that money just comes from Dad because all of these truthful factors are beyond his comprehension.

Buying from the market *is* the act that creates the market.  You can have a thousand sellers, but if no one is buying, that's not a market.

U.S. centric mindset.  The rest of the planet clearly doesn't exist.

wow, 20 cents!  So expensive!  I can't believe you were subject to that horrible indignity on a worldwide 24/7 settlement network!

Ah, the standard goalpost move.
A while ago, it was "you're paranoid, that won't happen".
Today, the goalposts were moved to "of course, what else did you expect?"

You're a fucking idiot, with all due respect.  Defining Bitcoin to be three different mutually exclusive things at the same time **is the exact opposite of what you claim to be "good" which is the removal of ambiguity**.  And you praise that!  Sorry, but only a fucking idiot would say such a stupid thing.

That was a retarded law.  First of all, Bitcoin was already property and there was no need to declare it as such, so it was It was 100% unnecessary.  Second, the many laws and regulations that target Bitcoin define Bitcoin inconsistently — some define it as a monetary instrument, some as property, usually to the self-serving convenience of the agency writing the law / regulation.

Before the tyrannical laws you seem to be defending, it was relatively commonplace.  It still is, in countries like Switzerland.


The "offense" is merely to withdraw, transport or deposit that amount of cash, whenever an authority decides they want to fuck with you.
There's nothing wrong with that act.
So, why is it a crime, and why are you defending it being criminalized?
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:25:33


Are you a fucking idiot?  Such activity is already illegal and perpetrators are held legally liable — it's called **fraud**.  What the fuck do you think happened to Trendon Shavers *years ago*?
It's like idiots like you think we're in 2017 and *no one ever had thought of making fraud illegal already*!  HAHAHAHAH!

Hah.  Wrong.  I carry cash all the time, normally large amounts.  ATMs let me withdraw up to 10K in one sitting.  My bank account has a 273K daily withdrawal limit.  I never pay for anything with a card.  And nobody bats an eye — you can buy a beer with a 200 CHF bill if you want.  The first time I tried it, I excused myself to the cashier, and the cashier said "ha, no worries, we are not poor here".  So I abandoned that slave mindset, and now I do it pretty much every weekend.
Maybe you're a poorfag?  Or maybe you just like it when strangers you never met collect information on your spending habits.  Donno.  Seems your life sucks in any case lol.

False dichotomy.  If they care about complying with regulations, they absolutely care about whether their users use Bitcoin to gamble.  And the proof is right there in the image that OP linked.  They sent them an e-mail explicitly saying "stop gambling with money coming from our service".
Can't really cover the Sun with your thumb, bud.

Holy shit, now you change your story for the *third time*!

Again, speak for yourself.  I do not live in a republic, nor would that mean that I have consented to anything.  Do you consent to McDonald's taking 50% of your income just because you set foot on their premises?   No.  So your rationale is tarded.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:34:26


I'll tell you this: Things will certainly not change as long as the majority of people believe the stupid bullshit you believe!

How quickly you switched from "they would never do that" to "but it was different that time".
The mark of a liar and a fanatic is that he can't keep his story straight.

Once again: **the libertarians were right** (about Bitcoin "regulations"), while everybody else was insulting the libertarians.
And, just like the last time, when the "regulations" were announced, the price took a huge shit on the carpet.
Well, guess what: now it's too late to do anything about it, because those "regulations" already have your identity linked to your coin purchases.  So not only do they know who you are and get to tax you, *they also get to steal your coins outright / hold you in prison indefinitely*, if you dare move about with more than an arbitrary amount.
Bravo, statists.  You got what you deserved, long and hard.  I just wish it was *you and only you* who got reamed, not us.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:28:48
Some of it will certainly pass, based on the track record of similar laws in the past.  Why?  Because they always seek to expand control over their subjects.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:35:40
You mean the LP.  Not libertarians (note the small L I used).  The other 95% of libertarians were busy working and figuring out how to protect their selves and assets from the State.
