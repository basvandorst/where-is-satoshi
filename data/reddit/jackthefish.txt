Have some respect. They are a small team, most major US and EU business outlets have been writing about them for over a week, every day.
They get more attention (and, in turn, load) than most young companies
ever will and probably did not anticipate it.
Bitcoin is very much a risky investment at the moment. Infrastructure
issues is part of the risk. If you did not
realize this, then you only have yourself to blame.

Then why Google and Facebook build their own hardware, Twitter has its own data center, CDNs have massive data centers and often report ordering hardware in a reasonable time frame is non-trivial.
Even power costs and availability are an issue for them.
The most important part to scaling anything is that you don't know two things:
 * When you will hit a massive wave of traffic/users/data
 * What part of your system is least prepared to handle it
 * What amount of operational manpower it will take
Trading is very different from running a social network. Go benchmark
xlarge instances on EC2 and you will learn that they are more than 3 times slower than bare metal machines with the same CPU on CPU workloads. More importantly, physical hardware you don't share has
predictable performance while cloud VMs do not. Trading does involve
a non-trivial computational component.
If you ever had to scale anything distantly popular, you would not claim
it's just a matter of using EC2. Context matters a lot, trading is very different from what most Web "programmers" work on and you don't know a thing about their infrastructure.
Then there are "human" operational pains. If you get 20K+ signups a day,
and your service requires verification, you have to have someone do that,
and deal with 150+ languages documents will come in in. You don't think that takes time on top of everything else?
