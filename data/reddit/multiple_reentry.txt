Hopefully back into btc after it takes a big dip. But it's all dumb luck tbh, if it rises hard to ath now I'll be kicking myself ;)

I bought a bitcoin in December and sold it yesterday, just before the recent dip. Clearly I'm a Warren Buffet like investing genius. AMA.

Yeah, cgt sucks, but I'll do the right thing. :)

Just a hunch. The 2019 bull run seems a little premature. I think it will dip hard before bull running again late this year.
But I was very tongue in cheek when I posted this. I have no expertise whatsoever. :)

7k aud invested into a mixture of btc, ltc (yay) and xrp (boo) mid December, this grew to 16k aud by the time I withdrew it yesterday. So a gain of approx 9k AUD.

They probably know what you had for breakfast this morning.

Broken through the barrier boys! Just pushed past 7k!!.. in Australian Dollarydoos at least :p
US 5k surely to follow soon!
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:04:15
I mean... when I cash out I guess, if I've made a profit then cgt will apply.
  
So far things are looking good given I bought in back in December.

$48 aud per Ltc when I bought it, $152 aud now. Not feeling that foolish.
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:13:45
but like any exchange, dont keep your money on there. Get a ledger.

Always pleasant when I go to bed and its 11.5k Austrslian dollarydoos, then wake up and its 12.5k.
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:08:27
lol... IKR! Went to bed with it hovering at 12.7k, woke up to it struggling to stay above 12k, then jumped on here to see it actually exceeded 13k... for 7 minutes. 
Crazy stuff.
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:05:01
lol.. nah not really.
It's a Simpsons reference.

No idea mate, I assume gst would be part of their fee structure.
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:18:33
No.. I dont think so.
YOu wouldnt pay gst on the bitcoin purchase, just on the fees the exchange is charging for transactions made. Wouldnt be much at all.
I'm no expert though mate, would recommend doing some googling before making any decisions.

Feeling pretty damn good about to my decision to get in to bitcoin and Ltc while there was blood on the streets in December '18.
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:22:19
Hooray for Dollarydoos!
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:13:23
yeah... btc markets. they seem solid.
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:59:51
I'm hoping for it to race to 20k by tomorrow.
Just saying.. :p
