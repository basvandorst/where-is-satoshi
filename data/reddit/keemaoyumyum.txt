Hard to say.  It could go either way, or probably both ways.  On one hand, people (mainly the people in bitcoin to “get rich quick”) will probably sell to have cash to pay their bills and stuff.  Believers in bitcoin won’t sell.  On the other hand, faith in banks will probably hit the floor and cause people to trust bitcoin a lot more and buy in.

Lol I’d love to know how he came up with that valuation...maybe the FMA report.

Saw this clip at work.  Bloomberg doesn’t have a clue

Sorry.  Basically a central banker at the Fed is dropping hints that when the economy crashes again they will print money to buy stocks to keep prices high, pay the plebs so they don’t revolt, and make interest rates negative (meaning you will be paying your bank interest for holding money in your bank accounts).

You’ll need the price of bitcoin when you bought it.  Some wallets track that, others don’t.  Otherwise if you know the date/time, you could use a price chart to estimate.  Then do a weighted average of the price times the quantity for each time you bought.

So Coinbase is starting a custody service...can someone help me understand why you would need a custodian for bitcoin?  Isn’t it just a matter of controlling your private keys?

Good point.  I’m sure they’d go after Coinbase legally if anything happened.  Whereas if they did it in house, they’d have to eat the loss.

1) One thing is that Bitcoin has a limited supply.  With their own coin, central banks would grant themselves the power to create more coins whenever they want, and inflating the supply would drive the value down.  For example, the value of the USD has dropped about 98% since the early 1900s.  
2) When institutional investors start piling in, the price should rise much more than 7k.  Some smaller hedge funds are starting to get in, but only institutions “on the fringe” are currently in.  Wait until ETFs start coming out...that will add significant demand to the market probably in the tens of millions if not more.

Right, and other institutional investors too.  I just thought there would easier ways to protect their crypto assets than paying 100k for coinbase’s service.

Use shapeshift.  Provide your public key for your BCH wallet and BTC wallet, and boom goes the dynamite.  
It walks you through on their site

Does anyone think one of the small tax haven countries (maybe a Caribbean island) will completely legalize crypto as legal tender anytime soon?
