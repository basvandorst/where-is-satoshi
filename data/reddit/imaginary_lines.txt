I don't use coinbase but afaik, you can transfer to gdax and purchase btc without fees.
Edit: welcome to the 21 million club!

You can use gdax for no fees.

Why is everyone thinking that it's gonna crash? Yes, a 25% increase in 24h is a lot but it's nothing unusual in crypto... It just looks a lot more than other coins just because the price is a lot higher.

Because a lot of people here are newcomers and did not make the gains that they are comfortable selling for yet.
If bitcoin tomorrow goes x10, many people would be selling or maybe, if more businesses would accept, buy something they always wanted.

Nobody got in at the same price and therefore the selling price is different for everyone. 
Maybe tomorrow bitcoin reaches a price that I'm willing to cash out for and I can purchase the car I've always wanted with bitcoin. Why would I use fiat?

he claims that investing in cryptos that banks offer will be a lot easier as the bank will do it for the users while now, non-tech savvy people have a hard time obtaining Bitcoin. As this goes on, these cryptos will be used by the world and not Bitcoin.

Yes. As long as you keep the private key, you can get the coins after the fork. 
Wait until there are clear instructions on how to do this because you might lose your bitcoin if you try to sell the b2x.

Ever thought that he might be an early adaptor and has been accumulating over the years and now finally made it to 21btc?

Bch only has a temporary solution, it's not scalable over time.

Yes, you choose the fee in Electrum. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:50:16
Yes. 
When you set up your trezor it will generate a new 24 word seed. You can then transfer your btc from electrum to trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:17:11
It's not that difficult. Once you bought your btc on an exchange, just download Electrum and choose new wallet.
It'll create a seed for you that you write down.

I travelled for 1.5 years with a lot less than 17k/year. Depending on where you travel, it can be very cheap

In response to that Bitcoin could be banned or placed under certain trading laws that makes it centrally controlled?

No, I read somewhere that if you have 10btc in your wallet at the time of the fork, you also receive the same amount in b2x.
What I'm trying to find out is this: 10btc = 10b2x?
Or do you get more than 10b2x?
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:48:28
Question, if you have 10btc do you also get 10b2x or is it calculated differently?
Is that happening for both forks?
