I like bitcoin. I want bitcoin to succeed. But I don’t know how you think 11USD is ok. You could ship actual gold for that price, ridiculous

If someone mocks themselves it is considered neither witty nor cool to rub it in. Good day sir

Barely any wire transfer fees in the EU, see SEPA.
Kind of ironic, traditional banks in the EU cheaper than bitcoin. But anyway. 
Since it was GBP/EUR then EUR/GPB it could be a currency conversion fee. Plus, even though coinbase don’t pay bank transfer fees they still charge for it. And I’m talking EUR to EUR, they still fucking charge a “bank fee” when it’s completely free. Been using it as a fiat on ramp for a while now but really need to get on to bitstamp

When I searched SEPA before commenting I saw that the uk were part of the agreement but haven’t researched it properly. Maybe you’re right I don’t know. But from Ireland to Coinbase (Estonia) it has never cost me a cent. 
But like I said coinbase add a fee when you cash out anyway which is lol

It’s just buy\sell orders. I was asleep last night when bitcoin hit 17k my buy orders were triggered on some alts that were cheap vs bitcoin pair at that moment. Sold them when I woke up increased bitcoin holdings by 5%.
The aim of the game is to gather as much bitcoin as possible for most traders so this will always cause market corrections. Since most people trading shitcoins are doing so to gather more bitcoin I think going into this bull market we could easily see 35k by feb.
Bitcoins market share is way undervalued right now. Should be a minimum 40-45%. 45-60 I’d say it would need to come down... but it definately could go back there for a while.
All just my speculation

If 30% constitutes a “bust”... did we not just go from 20k -&gt; 10k a few weeks ago?

I definitely would see it institutionally used for short term settlement and for wire transfers. Maybe a little too volatile as a reliable store of wealth though compared to the dollar and gold

It’s to discourage others from doing the same. I agree it’s an unfair sentence. 20 years would be fair

Like most drug dealers because it’s the most popular drug. Your point?

A website that was eBay for heroin. Just because he was pro btc doesnt make him a good person
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:07:42
What am I missing here, you guys are just blindly libertarian or what?
Dude creates eBay for heroin and you’re surprised he’s in jail?

If you set up a platform that makes law enforcement very difficult. Prepare to get slammed like a tonne of bricks. I believe in decriminalisation also though

Not even. Only what the most recent investors feel its worth. Price is based on the last transaction in the order book.

You can’t compare market cap to the wealth of a country. A 1 billion dollar company would never be able to get 1 billion USD by offloading its shares. Because as soon as they tried to offload all those shares at once the price per share would drop 95% and they would only get a fraction of the companies former ‘value’ in cash.
The price of equities and crypto is very subjective and pretty complex. Often price and value are completely different.
