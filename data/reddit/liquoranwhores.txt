This is much more useful than the potato quality video.

That URL is a bit too long.

Yeah, I honestly think the guy must have some serious mental health issues. I used to idle in IRC channel he frequented (he was using the LemonDev alias at the time) and he always came off as intelligent but like in a mad scientist way. He'd constantly make crazy grandiose claims that were never backed up or materialized.

 Is this the same guy from the nuPlay/nzbX scandal that annoyed the newsgroup world?

There is no incentive to run a full node.  I never understood this part of the Bitcoin economy. To expect people to dedicate 80GB of drive space and significant bandwidth without any return.

As the number of daily transactions increases (100k increase each year for the past two years) the average number of full nodes has basically remained static. How would you explain that we've doubled the number of daily bitcoin transactions (ie, people and businesses using them) yet haven't seen an increase in the number of full nodes running?

Yeah, that's not how it works.

Incorrect, you're simply making shit up. Commonly, this type of crime falls under either U.S. Code Section 1924 or U.S. Code Section 793(f). If you read them you won't see the word treason anywhere. Another good example, would be the Navy guy who was charged with Unauthorized Removal and Retention of Classified Materials. If you [look at the press release]( you again won't see the word treason used. Now, if there was any evidence that the party intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel, that could potentially fall under a treason like offense but again, this was never the issue.

Let me fix this for you: "While rare, some specific services within a few availability zones have temporarily failed. An example would be the S3 problems earlier this year in US-EAST. Due to the redundant nature of AWS and it's geographically dispersed datacenters, from a technical standpoint this is the absolute  definition of a distributed network. Arguments could be made from an administrative or legal standpoint that it might be a bad idea to have them all running within the same organization."

It's also interesting that they setup a fund for Dorian Nakamoto 4 years ago and they just cashed out the BTC in July of 2017. That was a serious hodl.

I apologize for not being more clear, but I was referring to the fact that very few encryption technologies last the test of time. This Youtube comment below sums up what I was thinking (but poorly communicated)

Absolutely not! I'll be the first to admit I have a very rudimentary understanding of the science behind encryption, I was just thinking of the natural progress of hashes like MD5 to SHA-1 to SHA-256 etc. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:09:52
Is it safe to assume that the encryption protecting said wallet would easily be crackable in a couple hundred years?
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:37:50
I don't think that's what he's asking..
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:44:20
That's an interesting question.

Wow, this website is pretty incredible.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:48:25
Good to know. Thank you for the reply!

FYI, you can use Gmail with your own domain so users can easily and quickly switch between accounts. It's pretty seamless and costs about $10/user per month.

While that's a neat video it's not relevant to quantum computing and it's impact on contemporary encryption technologies. I don't know the answer but this video isn't it.

I'm hoping this is /s

Good Game. Usually used to indicate you did a good job.

This is the best idea yet... Include the blockchain as well and your GG
