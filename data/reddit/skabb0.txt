Sadly these 15th &amp; 19th century examples are still alive and well..

And unfortunately, every time some third-party entity is compromised, people who have only a vague awareness of BTC, or are on the fence about it inevitably use it as an example of it 'getting hacked'.  Every single time, I've had someone come up to me and say some variation of "Did you see Bitcoin got hacked?", and I try to explain the difference.  For the really dense ones, the analogy that usually works is "If you sent $20 to someone to hold with the expectation that you'd get it back, and they got robbed, would that be a fault in the dollar?", which is by no means a perfect comparison, since the dollar is a physical object that *can* be taken by force, so in that sense it is more vulnerable.  I just hate the guilt by association.

Hey, I work there - I've even used this place's regular ATM in the past.  There was already a BTC ATM surprisingly closeby (55th and 9th iirc?) but you're right, this is definitely a more highly trafficked area.  Very cool.
 Edit:  And 8% is WAY lower than the one at 55th.  That one was insane - like upwards of $20 for a .3 (~$100 at the time) purchase.

I'm in my mid 30s and I was taught to type with two spaces after a period.  *It doesn't even require someone be THAT old.
*I still do it on autopilot - that was a completely unintentional example.
Edit:  Forgot Reddit trims the second space off.  There were originally two there.

Yeah, I was taught to type that way in the late 80s-early 90s, and there seemed to be a transitionary period around the time I was in college where either was acceptable; you were now taught to use one, but two wouldn't be corrected on a test/in a paper. In the last few years, I've noticed more and more articles/videos going out of their way to point out that two spaces is a flat out formatting error.  The spacing pendulum has swung, it seems, but by this point it's muscle memory.  Damn the prescriptivists, I look forward to the many other ways I'll eventually become a living relic.

My wife [has been accepting BTC for jewelry]( since I suggested it to her around 2014. 
   (sorry, gotta get the family plug in there when it's on topic)  ;)

TFW when you're probably getting on the bandwagon too late for a *second* time.  Nice of ya, subby ;)
