If Carmen Sandiego was mining bitcoin, where in the world would she be?

the largest korean bank is testing a platform for its customers to store bitcoin - the extent of which this will be used (ie storing, exchanging, debit card access, etc) is still in the air, afaik
But it could be super dope if it was like seamless transfer from btc to won and vise versa

I'm confused - Is it activated already?

Thanks for your reply! I haven't made it to the point of filing taxes yet in the US - I only recently left the country and my tourist visa is near expiring so I am looking for solutions so I do not have to leave the country every 6 months.

Thanks! Seems reasonable - though I don't know my spanish is good enough yet to argue that I can support myself with bitcoin X__X

Man I haven't tried to withdraw money recently, but I can definitely relate to this. I get part of my pay in bitcoin and I live in Mexico - Sometimes I will pull out $2000 pesos (~$50US) to supplement my regular income and that can last me for a week before I get paid again...now to pull out $2000, I would get charged the ATM fee and a 20% network fee. Pretty absurd. I haven't needed it in a while, but I can definitely feel for OP - if it took 5 days or 20% of the money I needed, I'd be pretty upset, too. 
It's not btc's fault, but something has to give. We need scaling solutions or something. As much as I believe in the project, I'm not here as an investor-only. I want real world functionality and this isn't it :(

Meanwhile, Tesla owners are using free charging stations to mine BTC jaja

Thanks for your reply - I am living off of it, but the transactions aren't necessarily recorded (I haven't saved ATM receipts, food/drink receipts, transactions, etc)

Now, out of curiousity, if you can protect your coin from this split - why would you? Then you wouldn't get the BCC and have a reduced BTC...right?
