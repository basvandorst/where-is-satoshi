You can send cash in unmarked envelopes if you don't have a bank account.
Let me reiterate my point: Bitcoin is hyped to death; the price right now reflects expectations on future use, not the present utility of Bitcoin. If these don't materialize due to technical limitations, Bitcoin will die a slow painful death for all involved. The likelihood of Bitcoin evolution hitting a brick wall is **very likely**.

yes, for as long as their hashing power is offline


yes, but they would have had to turn off their hashing power for 2016 blocks, forfeiting 1008 blocks of revenue, or $16,000,000 at the current price. After the difficulty corrects itself, they would get less than double the revenue, assuming hashing power grows exponentially, so this strategy would not outperform the always-on strategy.

For an entirely trust-free solution, I agree every transaction would have to be settled immediately on the blockchain, but off-chaining does have its benefits.
It allows for nearly instantaneous confirmation times, instead of relying on the blockchain to confirm a transaction roughly every 10 minutes. This would be ideal for retail. Less so for online purchases where fast processing isn't required. When there are more than 7 tps, I can imagine transactions will have to compete to be included in a block, so fees will be very relevant. This opens up the possibility of a [race attack] ( so a point of sale solution requiring complete trust wouldn't be viable.
Increased counterparty risk wouldn't be a huge problem if everyone limited the amount of coins they stored on their mobile wallets, like how I don't carry more than what I spend on a daily basis in my back pocket. Anyway, the risks don't completely outweigh the benefits of an off-chaining solution.

A few tips
Next time present without notecards. Its unprofessional. Just memorize what youre going to say. Itll take longer to prepare but the fluidity you get is worth the effort.
Practice in front of friends. Practice in an empty room. That will get rid of the stammering. Reading off cards will do that to you.
Slides were good, but try to spend at least 1 min on each one. I can see you spent a lot of effort on them but imo a great presentation needs great delivery. For each minute of my presentation, I rehearse at least 20 times as long. I spent 10 hours rehearsing my last 30 minute talk to get the phrasing and timing just right. Good luck on your next presentation.

I bought somewhere near 1100 on bitstamp. Not much, but enough to get my feet wet. When the price dropped below 1000 I thought I'd be okay. Bitcoin is volatile, but it always recovers.
But when it dropped down to 800 I panicked. Sold everything at a loss. Realized my mistake and rebought at 700. Now I have more coins and I get to write off my little capital loss on my taxes. Win win.
For the next 2 months, I'm optimistic. It's easy to give in to the fud posted around the web but I'm confident we've either seen the bottom or are within 100 of it. Anyway I'm in this thing for the next two years no matter what happens.

An introduction to internet funbux aka bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:23:12


Difficulty rises and falls with the network hash rate


To get to this state, miners have to agree to process more than 1 MB worth of transactions per block. Right now they don't because their mining costs are subsidized by a very large block reward. Once that diminishes, they will have to rely on transaction fees. However, larger blocks take longer to propagate across the network, increasing the likelihood of them not reaching more than 50% of the network before another block is solved, thus orphaning the block and causing a loss of revenue for the miner. So until larger blocks can be propagated to all the nodes just as fast as smaller blocks, we'll be stuck at 1MB. There has been work on using header-first synchronization, which may lead to a solution. Another way bitcoin may evolve is through centralization of block processing, which reduces the computational requirements of the network, where everyone uses simple payment verification clients instead of full nodes. Or total use of off-chain transactions, where large financial institutions settle bitcoin balances with one another on the blockchain while users like you and me transact via their third-party applications.

So tell me, what kind of scale up will IBLTs allow? 2x? 10x? Did you also read the related gist on collected stats? Looks like the size of an IBLT needed to resolve transaction differences will be at least a third a MB. *And that's just for the current 1 MB block size limit*. Who knows how much bigger IBLTs will need to be for &gt;1MB size blocks. Not to mention the problem that you can't gather real-world information to test this theory. Sounds like you only know how to google things. Maybe you should start reading what you find.

Non-mining full nodes determine consensus of the *blockchain*; miners are the only participants in the network that determine whether protocol upgrades are adopted because they alone have the power to include or reject nonstandard transactions from blocks (as the subdivision would be). See  for an example of how an upgrade could be rolled out. Even if all the non-mining full nodes were upgraded, it would be up to the miners to include the new rules.
I think miners would upgrade anyway, since high tx fees due to some arbitrary 1 satoshi lower bound would effectively kill all normal use of the network.

21 million times NO. I'm sorry you lost coins to Mt Gox, but you SERIOUSLY need to move on. You can persuade miners to create fake blocks but they will never be validated by the other 94% because what you are suggesting BREAKS THE PROTOCOL and weakens trust in it.
You sent coins to Mt Gox. For all intents and purposes Mt Gox owns these coins and can do whatever it wants with them. Including permanently destroying them. This transaction is no different from any other.
So what about the market price of bitcoin? Won't it scare future investors, depressing the price for a long period of time? Yes, and **this is actually a good thing**. If you don't understand and accept the risks of using bitcoin, *you shouldn't use bitcoin*, plain and simple.

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.
What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

Those are calculated fees for confirmation in the next block under the current state of the Bitcoin protocol with its small 1MB block size and high transaction volume. You can pay less if your transaction isn't time sensitive and it will eventually be confirmed. Or, if someone figures out how to propagate larger blocks at similar speeds as smaller blocks through the network and the block size is increased, the fees will decrease because miners will want to include as many non-zero fee transactions as possible to maximize revenue.

The price is $700 now? we are easily going 1000X, it happened before it's gonna happen again.

Bitcoin solves the problem of transacting between a small number of people. For bitcoin to disrupt the markets people say it's supposed to disrupt, transaction volume needs to increase by 10x or 100x, but then bitcoin no longer works: fees go up, centralization goes up, trust goes down, bandwidth throttles, and filling blocks become too competitive. So we're paying 1-2% in credit card fees by not using bitcoin?

My calculations say at the current exponential rate, transactional volume will saturate by this November if block sizes aren't increased from the hard 1 MB limit. When this happens, fees go way up. Decentralization goes down, trust in the network goes down, price dips/crashes as a result as more transactions are handled off the blockchain. The price should be around $1500 when this happens. Eventually, bitcoin settles down and fulfills a niche market comparable in size to a small to mid cap company (20B). This crash will make way for a fork of the protocol to allow larger block sizes or faster blocks.
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:19:42

Call me a realist, because I'd settle with just 10% of that valuation. I'd even give 5% of my stash to charity. Frankly, with the potential to process hundreds of thousands of transactions a day, Bitcoin is just poised to disrupt the banking industry. That alone makes Bitcoin worth trillions of dollars. Just ask Marc Andreessen himself!

They may be starting a wallet service so they can start doing off the blockchain transactions, which confirm instantly instead of confirming in 15 minutes. This would put them on par with coinbase.

Bitcoin is not a good store of value. A good store of value does not change in value over time.
Let me add some qualifications to your hyperbole. Bitcoin allows anyone, anywhere in the world (with an internet connection, precluding much of the developing world) to accept payments (but not all at once!) without having to open a bank account (transacting in cash does not require a bank account) by embedding code in their website (not if you want fiat to hedge against volatility, that would take more than just code). What would the value of this payment system be if it was a publicly listed company? (market cap of a currency and market cap of a company are not the same thing)
Bitcoin has roughly 1 million users worldwide. Credit card holders? Over 500 million. That makes Bitcoin pretty fucking overvalued.

Each red colored coin is worth 60 satoshi
btc.blue sells one for $0.10, at a rate of $166,666.66/BTC
Nice scam/stupid tax
I'll do better and sell anyone bitcoin at the heavily discounted rate of $10,000/BTC
edit: just tried buying 10M red colored coins and I didn't get an out of stock warning. I thought the website said there would be only 1M red colored coins in existence?

I just sent 1 satoshi to 100M people via coinbase. What now. Are we still early adopters?
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:46:49
The price isn't going to increase any more from companies like coinbase and bitpay adding bitcoin processing to more merchants. Even if amazon enabled bitcoin payments tomorrow, the price would be unchanged 3 months from now. It would go straight up then straight back down.
I'm of the opinion that bitcoin isn't meant for retail. It has unsurmountable technical limits that prevent it from scaling to meet the usage required for mainstream adoption. Yes even with proposed modifications like the block size increase or IBLTs. Bitcoin's strength lies in its uncorruptable global ledger. This can't remain if bitcoin becomes centralized.
To answer your question,  bitcoin will sustainably reach a new ATH when security is the primary motivation of usage. Not convenience. Not low fees. Not ETFs. These are all secondary to security. When bitcoin is the only means of keeping your money and reliably making payments, only then will it soar in value. Price increases for any other reason are unsustainable IMO. This paradigm shift will take a long time - 10 to 20 years long.

Somewhere in the middle, so ...

Either a 63X increase or 63X decrease. I'd say the chances are about equal!

No you shouldn't stay away from bitcoin. You have a gambling addiction, plain and simple. Gambling with USD or converting bitcoin into USD first and gambling with them is still gambling.
