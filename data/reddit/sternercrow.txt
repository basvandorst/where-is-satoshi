Does not require a good PC, just a fair bit of bandwidth and disk space.  Just make sure you forward your ports and test your node at 
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:55:28
I've had good experiences with Twilio, but the problem is the cost for the service.  It's totally fine for price if you limit the amount of daily texts for "free" users, and charge a monthly fee for unlimited ($5/month seemed to be the best option).  Remember though, set a limit by default - you don't want people spamming!
Depends on whether or not you think it's going to be super popular, and whether or not you can afford the usage.  At just under 0.01/text, you may be spending a thousand+/year if you get big enough.

Yeah.. there's a LOT of installing and cloning you have to do.  I'm planning on using lightning, but not in this state.  Once it's an exe that you run it'll be ready, but damn, this is a lot of work.
I've just cloned btcd, so I'm getting there..
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:02:21
That's how I thought it worked - glad to know I was correct!  God damn Lightning sounds awesome.  Looking forward to using it.

I use the GUI.  So I'm running with &gt;1mb blocks still, just the wallet isn't implemented?
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:57:20
Is there anything stopping people from attempting to steal right off the bat?  Before any transactions have been completed?  Or does this only affect people trying to chargeback (for lack of a better term)?
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:29:36
I read into it a little more, turns out it's only for people that attempt to chargeback a certain amount - at least from what I can find.  Say person A pays person B on a weekly basis, then tries to close the transaction as the first weekly payment.  Person B can send the latest transaction and take all the funds in the channel - correct?

@_date: 2018-01-14 18:29:08
If BCH was the more popular one, if it was the consensus, we would be using it.  I don't have a problem with that.  They're inefficient and follow the market.

Anyone know if this affects debit?
Just checked.  No fees other than what I paid via VISA debit.  Credit has been blocking transactions for a while now though.

Gotchya.  Thanks for clearing that up.  Wanted to make sure I'm doing what's best for the network.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:27:00
Less than $500, I recommend Electrum or Bitcoin Core if you want to run a full node (Personal Computer).
More than $500, I recommend buying a Trezor hardware wallet (or Ledger).  I cannot stress the importance of security in large amounts of crypto.  People are always trying to steal Bitcoin, so it's potentially dangerous to keep it on an exchange, or on a cellphone.

Either that or someone is enjoying spamming them with a ton of it.  It's very interesting, apparently blocks scale depending on how many tx's are in the pool, it just can't handle a few thousand at a time (lol).  Would be interesting to see how it would handle the amount of transactions Bitcoin is seeing (or any other popular crypto)

Sorry, I don't know of any good exchanges that support anywhere other than Canada (I use Kraken, GDAX, and Quadriga - not sure if they'll support your country).
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:30:14
The benefit is they eat the transaction fee.  The downfall with GDAX is it still doesn't support Segwit.  I'd rather you use something that supports Segwit if at all possible.  I've decided to remove my debit from Coinbase/GDAX and start using other exchanges because of the mempool issue.

That's so awesome.  Thanks for the clarification.

I'm calling bullshit on that.  That's a single 1070..  Calculator for a TI model is about 0.01.  Post your mining URL, I'm guessing when you take into account an average, you're making less than 0.01.

That's phenomenal man.  Excellent work.  Keep us posted when the prints are ready, I'll likely be buying one.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:21:08
I had a similar issue with a company in Canada.  Debit is still allowed, but not credit (I was enjoying a decent cash-back on my crypto buys).  I'm mostly indifferent, it's THEIR money you spend - not your own.  When you use debit, it is your own money, and I would have a problem with it.
Obviously I'd prefer they allow it, but it's totally up to the company.  Nobody should force a company to purchase something they do not agree with on your behalf.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:09:32
Do you know if Bitcoin Core supports this by default, or if it's running 1mb blocks?  I'd be interested in upgrading to a full node that supports Segwit, but my understanding is it doesn't yet.

@_date: 2017-12-30 16:34:24
Something I don't think people are taking into account is that you don't need to spend $20 in fees, you can lower the sat/byte.  It may take a few hours to open, or to close, but it'll only cost you a few bucks.  Significantly better than what everyone bitches about.

Honestly, it's as easy as running core.  I leave it going, always uploading to other clients, but I also use my rig to mine. Doesn't take much resource usage, but if you're using an HDD I'd make sure you have at least 500gb space, and only use that drive for core. Sometimes it uses 100% of my read speed on my 5400rpm drive.

Ignore what the other guy said. Its going to be less than a desktop. I wouldn't recommend mining on a laptop, as the price to component ratio is significantly worse. Airflow is also trash, so you're heating all parts rather than just the GPU. 
If you want to make money with Bitcoin, buy some and wait a year. If you want free cash on the side with little investment (and already have the hardware) I recommend mining with a desktop OR ASIC. You're likely to damage your laptop.

Yes, they are.  If money enters a Canadian bank account, and the amount is greater than $5,000, it is a flagged transaction.  Does this mean that you're certainly audited?  No.  Does this mean that you're in a list of people who will likely be audited?  Yes.

There are already coins (looking at you LTC) that are very cheap, but don't have to be centralized.  If you have an interest in a decentralized p2p network, you use Bitcoin and host your own node.  If you have an interest in fast/free transactions, you would have an interest in Lightning.  
I don't see the point of BCH.  Huge blocks with no transactions to fill them.  Every BCH block is ~100kb, maybe 200 max.  32mb block size is only there to stop everyday users from running a node - Only 0.3% of each block is being used...  (Get this) If you want a centralized way to send money, you can use a bank.  Most actually allow e-transferring for FREE.  $0.  Nada.  Nothing.  They'll even pay you money for having money!

If you provided detailed personal information, report it to the police and consider freezing your credit in case your identify is stolen.

Costs about 1/100th of a penny per move, so if OP is lucky he'll make $5.  It's totally a gimmick for twitch gaming, but think of the possibilities here.  1/100th of a penny is preventing people from spamming (like in the original Twitch plays Pokemon).  Think about how posting on forums could be - using LN as antispam.  Want to spam?  That'll cost you.  Want to make an account?  That'll cost you.  Even though it's pennies, it isn't going to be financially reasonable for spammers/bots.

Unless you already have the hardware, I really wouldn't bother. Small mining is dead, might make $1/day per gpu, but the returns are diminishing as of recent. Unless you already have free electric, I'd personally pass on mining. Better to buy some BTC and wait a year.

Small miner here. Benefit to not using Asics is being able to make a decent profit from hardware I already had. 980ti, 1060 3gb and 960, makes about $3CAD/day, which is nice because I don't pay electric. There was a much better payout until new Asics started running, was making about $15/day before. 
All that being said, I don't have a problem with Asics, just a problem with availability - when you buy one, it's last generation's used Asic.

Not sure where he got his numbers.. They're off.  Here's a chart with all transactions in the mempool, over the span of two hours.  
The ridiculous fees he's talking about are $0.16 to move $950+ or more:   which I believe is a little high, but in no way is it ridiculous.  Wallets?  Lol.  I can get a transaction through at 1sat in about 3 blocks on an average day, 15 on a bad day.  Mempool high? Bump it to two and you're golden.  Segwit has done wonders to this.
51% attacks aren't an issue yet, not to say that they can't be.  The hash rate is growing quickly, I'm interested to see how this all goes.  Smaller coins have a much higher chance of this happening (Remember that time it happened to Ethereum in 2016?  I member.)
Basically, do your own research, don't take my word for it, don't take his word for it.  Don't trust anything you read, find actual proof.  Don't trust, verify.

Wouldn't recommend building a PC just for that..  I'm using GPUs that I lowballed people for, but I already had my computer hardware.  If you're going to mine bitcoin, go ASIC.  If you want to mine altcoins and get paid in bitcoin, use NiceHash.  Just remember to check your electric price per day, and see how long it'll take for you to get a return on your investment.  
You could also just put $100 into bitcoin, then sell in a few months..  It's been spiking a lot this year.
@_date: 2016-05-24 19:12:56
I'm going to just post my two cents here.  99% of all MC servers break the EULA.  It's the only way to remain profitable..  It's super hard to sell cosmetics in a game designed around usable items, commands, and other in-game features.  
The loophole that I had found with my company was bridging our website with the minecraft server.  We were able to sell forum ranks which just so happen to link with in-game ranks.  Upon getting your in-game rank, the system would automatically give you in-game items..  It was really quite genius.  
I can't see Mojang/MS taking down servers for this in the near future unless they're making absolute bank, like Hypixel, or whatever the most popular ones are now.

Although you could say you're 1/50 billionth of the way there, the numbers you need to mine a block are so high at this point that starting at 1 and going up doesn't cut it (in REALLY simplified examples).

Safe as long as you know it's actually from Trezor, and hasn't been implanted with a chip to hack the device.  
Not safe if they get physical access.  They demonstrated a ramdump which shows the seed, as well as your pin.  In order to do this, they must remove the chip from the Trezor, and use a special reader, but they have been able to replicate it easily.  Basically, it's safer than a PC, but physical access is root access (as always).
