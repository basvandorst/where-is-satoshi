Wait I thought we were using Altcoins for spending now and Bitcoin is faux gold or something. 
We can only have 400k transactions per day, best not to waste them on coffee, food, etc.
Check out Viacoin and Litecoin in addition to Bitcoin &lt;3

Viacoin right? That is why I am invested. 
"Viacoin is the first digital currency to launch blockchain 2.0 technology on an altchain whereas all previous efforts have focused on leveraging the bitcoin blockchain. 
However, those attempts to use bitcoin been fraught with technical and political challenges because so far Bitcoin developers have considered those uses as spam and have taken technical measures to prevent them."

No, in order to be the universal protocol **everyone** must be able to use it, and currently only 400k-500k max transactions can be sent per day. 
Check out Viacoin. Gonna be big. Also Litecoin for transactions that get priced off Bitcoin Blockchain

If you actually think Bitcoin could be used by Greece with a 300k transaction limit per day you do not know enough about Bitcoin to comment about it :)
