instant buys through coinbase depend on your "verification level", basically the amount of KYC info you give them. The instant buys are enabled by linking a credit card, with a btc limit based on your verification level. but yes, coinbase charges a fee for all buys.

if this is true, the percentage of a purchase paid directly vs. indirectly with bitcoin is irrelevant. all that matters is that a purchase is made with some amount of bitcoins paid directly.

Yes, there are big exchanges (bitstamp, BTC-e, BTC-China, Kraken) and coinbase (which is more a broker than an exchange), but none have a monopoly, as you suggest. It's still early, and many more exchanges are on the horizon, the best of which will become the most popular.

I see your point. although, the companies (tiger direct, overstock..) probably see two numbers: # of bitcoin transactions, and # of bitcoins used for those transactions. while using gyft certainly would diminish the second number, the first number remains the same. needless to say, gyft is also a company who accepts bitcoins, and I also like to reward them with my business, especially since they cater to bitcoin with the 3% points deal.

If you have any bitcoins besides those on the ATM slip, I suggest you do a trial run for confidence. Go to bitaddress.org, print out (or screencapture) a new public/private key set, send a small amount of bitcoins to the public address, and try importing the private key into the blockchain app.

Coinbase, if you're in the US.


that's not an investment, that's called day trading. an investment is something that you hold onto for a while. that being said, you can do instant buys of 0.1-1 BTC depending on your verification level at Coinbase. but if you want to day trade larger amounts, I suggest using an actual exchange (Coinbase is not an actual exchange), or localbitcoins. If you're in the US, Campbx is the only exchange option.
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:56:15
Also, to verify the amount of bitcoins, you can go to your address book and select "add watch only address", then scan the public key. It will show you how many bitcoins are in that wallet, but it won't let you spend them unless you do a "custom spend" whereby you must enter/scan the private key.

@_date: 2014-01-23 22:54:33
The "DO NOT SCAN" is probably just a precaution so you don't accidentally show that to someone who you're trying to receive bitcoin from. The ATM would probably recognize that it's a private key and not do anything, but worst case scenario is whoever/whatever scans it swipes all your bitcoins. If your intent is to add the bitcoin to your blockchain wallet, you must either scan your private key or enter it manually.

This is not the case currently, and I don't think anyone would advocate for this model. Sure, Gox *was* the only exchange, for a short time, but that's only because it was the first exchange. The decentralized nature of the protocol is one of the primary benefits, and I don't believe  the community would neglect that by centralizing all the transactions into 1 or 2 exchanges.

member FreeMoney: "Beautiful stuff, I sent a few coins." Back when "bits" wasn't even a consideration.
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:35:05
You select "Scan private key" in the blockchain app. Then scan your private key, and the bitcoins on your slip will be transferred to your blockchain wallet. Your blockchain wallet should then show a balance of the amount of bitcoins that were on the ATM slip. To verify further, you can enter the public key of the ATM slip on blockchain.info and it should show 0 balance and the transaction of your coins being sent to your blockchain address.
The Mycelium wallet (as mentioned by dkmdlb) handles private keys a bit differently. Basically, instead of your bitcoins being transferred from your ATM slip to your blockchain wallet, you can import the private key into Mycelium, which will allow you to use the ATM slip as a wallet without having to transfer the bitcoins out of that address. Either app will work fine, I suggest you stick with blockchain if you already have that up and running.

I'm interested to see if others have found the same, or if the price difference depends on the day/time. For $20 at the exact same time, I got 0.04377 BTC from Circle, and only 0.04338 from Coinbase. Also find Circle easier because you can specify the amount you want in USD. Coinbase forces the user to enter a bitcoin amount, and then calculates the USD amount (unless I'm missing something), which usually requires several iterations to specify the exact amount you want to spend. Overall, I find Circle to be faster and easier.

@_date: 2014-07-28 17:54:54
I meant buying bitcoin (with USD) is instant. Before Circle, you either had to get your money onto an exchange (which takes days), or buy from Coinbase (which also takes days). Sure, bitcoin payments are instant, but before Circle, buying bitcoin with fiat is not. Once you have your bitcoin, you can move it to your own wallet, no 3rd party required.

@_date: 2015-01-23 21:39:33
this is true (and also a very new feature/integration), but it's because it forces you to use your Coinbase wallet. If you checkout with Coinbase on gyft, you have to use your Coinbase wallet. On Overstock, Coinbase is the payment processor, but you are free to use whatever wallet you want, which is why it's a bit more expensive.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:53:53

Buttercoin is an actual exchange, not a broker like Coinbase.

Hence the need for BIP38 encryption. If your private key is protected by a password, even if someone physically steals your paper wallet, they still need to crack the password. Also note that even though it's called a paper wallet, it can easily be stored digitally (preferably encrypted, again) on a usb/hard drive/cloud, and you can store multiple copies in different locations on different media. Check out bitaddress.org and [this video]( for more info.
Blockchain wallets are not "cold storage" they are hot wallets since they are created and used online. There are many horror stories of people losing their btc on blockchain wallets. Coinbase is a trustworthy company that uses multisig wallets in their vault, so far no hacks or thefts using their service, as far as I know.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:05:53

are you sure the first million dollar without fees is still happening? I thought that was a promo that has passed, but I could be wrong.
edit: Coinbase is great, but I prefer Bitpay from a UX standpoint, and also from a getting-a-better-value-for-your-bitcoin standpoint (their rates are better for consumers).
edit 2: [Coinbase is still doing the first million without fees](
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:44:36
Why are you against paper wallets? A BIP-38 encrypted paper wallet printed from an offline computer would probably be the best combination of safe and easy.
Of the two options you listed, I would tend to go with Coinbase. Also consider a BitGo multisig wallet, that's the service Bitstamp is now using for their multi-sig wallets (post-hack).
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:47:15
you should update your post and description. essentially they stopped taking bitcoin for less than 24 hrs.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:05:39
In terms of UX, it's not a big difference, but I prefer Bitpay having used both numerous times.
In terms of the rates, just take a look at [Bitpay's Rate]( compared to Coinbase's. Coinbase doesn't publish their rate for merchant transactions (until you initiate a purchase), they only list their rate for buying bitcoin from them, which is slightly different. But to prove it, just buy something on Overstock, who uses Coinbase to process their transactions. You'll notice that if you buy a $100 item from Overstock directly with bitcoin, you will pay slightly more than if you buy a $100 Overstock gift card through Gyft, and then use the giftcard to purchase the item. That's because Gyft uses Bitpay to process their transactions. Not to mention, you get an additional 3% back in points if you buy a gyft card.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:57:39
where can I see the prices Coinbase charges for purchases? Coinbase.com lists the price (before fees) for buying bitcoin, but that's not the same rate given to consumers purchasing from a merchant, is it? If so, why is purchasing a gyft card for Overstock cheaper than purchasing an item of the same dollar amount from Overstock directly using btc? If Coinbase is, in fact, cheaper than Bitpay, this is a recent development, because I've done the experiment numerous times, albeit several months ago. I've also noticed that Coinbase has just recently become cheaper (most of the time) than Circle, as originally Circle was always cheaper (for buying btc).
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:47:02
I'm talking about from a consumer's perspective, Bitpay is cheaper. Coinbase may in fact be better from a merchant's perspective. If you have evidence that Bitpay is more expensive for consumers I'd like to see it, because based on my experience Bitpay has always been cheaper for me.
