It's not about "pussies". Unfortunately a lot of people are easily conditioned for bullshit and propaganda, no matter how ridiculous. I'd rather them listen to Neil deGrass Tyson and believe in science than listen to Alex Jones and believe in insider job behind San Bernardino (as an example).
I respect people's freedom of speech and that's why I wouldn't want to, say, have his bullshit forbidden on government level, but I'm all for private entities not providing him a platform for his conspiracy theories.
It's as simple as that.
And taking this as an example of why crypto is important you are actually doing crypto a disservice, as this example is no par with "PayPal bans drug dealers and that's why we need crypto".

There is a Russian saying (sarcasm) "Millions of flies can't be wrong" (towards shit). Same here - millions of people can indeed be wrong. Hundred billions put in crypto is purely speculative money - people want a quick buck and invest in a highly speculative vehicle. Exactly like lottery. In crypto, people don't "invest in tech" right now - that's just a meme for hodlers who lost 95% of their investment since January.
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:08:44
You are wrong here - "the demand of a very small community of geeks" is not for Bitcoin as a currency, but as a speciation vehicle with hopes to "get rich fast". Bitcoin can only get "very expensive" if a lot of people start buying it. But the truth of the matter, compared to 2017 way more people are aware of it and way more people are aware of its crash. Bitcoin reached 20k because of the idiots who mortgaged their houses to buy it - this shit will not happen again as people see how this bubble popped.

Sorry, but his post makes no fucking sense. 90% of all bitcoins belong to 4% of all active wallets, or something like that. What impact do you think all redditors combined will make on the whales? I can tell you - none. Whether you take your small piece of bitcoin out of an exchange or not will make no difference when a whale comes with 10,000 bitcoins and decides to do some price manipulation. C'mon, be serious.

You are missing my point. I certainly have my own morals as I hope do you. But the government defines what is legal and what is not within the borders of the country it governs. If you disagree with the laws, try changing them thru electing a person you assign with most. 
But I'm not sure how it's all relevant to crypto. PayPal banning Alex Jones is a private entity refusing service to another private entity. If a government retaliated against Alex Jones for his bullshit, that would be a very different issue. Do you see the difference?
@_date: 2018-09-22 16:25:39
The government does indeed decide what is right and what is wrong - it's called "laws". You may or may not like the laws and that is why you vote for a certain candidate that you think is more aligned with your understanding of morality.

I'll have to rephrase your last statement - Fees only increase if users choose to have their transfers confirmed in timely matter during high load periods. 
You can set your fee to 1 sat but it will take a year (if at all) to get the transfer thru (I'm obviously not talking about LN, just purely Bitcoin network)
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:12:56
It's not a problem if you are willing to wait 25 days. But you can't disagree that it's absolutely not practical for any of Bitcoin' stated purposes.
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:48:17
If you are ok waiting for a couple days for the transfer to go thru, then TransferWise is a great service. They have minimal fees, around 1-1,5% - which in many cases is less than the fluctuation of Bitcoin for the same period of time ;)
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:56:02
Maybe for you ;) 
Day 0: x = initial investment
Day 1: x + x * 0.04 = x* 1.04
Day 2: x * 1.04 * 1.04 = x * (1.04^2)
Day 365: x * (1.04^356) = x * 1,648,803

But if you are talking about some local emp event, it will not cause the banking system to cease to exist, so why talk about gold/btc at all?
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:03:44
Wrong. They certainly do use Visa for conversion, when you pay in local currency. I've had it researched and confirmed by credit card companies back in the day when i was picking one for travel. And right now, while traveling, i see how much they charge me for purchases in local currencies, and it's marginally different from market rates.

You fellas realize that in case of an EMP all the electronics will be FRIED, and even if the scattered btc network will survive as well as some coins themselves hidden in emp resistant cold storage (well private keys really), there will be no way of using the network because why? You guessed correctly, all the electronics will have been fried.
It's extremely naive to think that in a global catastrophy event people will be able to use Bitcoin. The civilization is crumbling but everyone has access to electricity and internet ��
@_date: 2018-05-26 14:12:42

I would stay away from making this large sale in Bitcoin, and would definitely stay away from hodling that large sum in btc if the sale goes thru. Nobody can guarantee you where the market goes, especially some home grown analytic like a dude in this topic.
Oh and I'm pretty sure the seller will be responsive for income taxes on the sale of those bitcoins - way higher tax than what you pay for the sale of the house in fiat. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:56:11

I could. Gold and diamonds are artificial store of value and diamonds are actually not very liquid. Try buying a diamond and then selling it - you'll be lucky if you find someone who would give you 3/4 of what you paid for it if you need to sell it fast.
As for gold - you can say it's a good store of value medium, it's price is quite predictable and doesn't fluctuate much. Unlike Bitcoin, which truly sucks as a store of value - depending on when you bought it the value might have gone 100x up of 3x down.

You realize that was luck, right? He bought at the right time, once. He doesn't have any successful track record of trading crypto, and he hasn't had any correct predictions on crypto since the last bull run.
So basically this guy got lucky once, and now he gives (absolutely wrong) predictions that people listen to because he got lucky once.

@_date: 2018-10-04 09:34:27
There is a small difference between 2011 and now - publicity. In 2011 nobody knew about Bitcoin and nobody cared. Last year's bull run was because people discovered it and wanted to participate in a "get rich quick" scheme.
Do you realize why that bubble collapsed in January instead of keeping going? Because everybody who wanted to invest, invested. And the prices stopped going up. Smart people who were in the know (whales mostly) started taking profits but no new money were coming into the market so the prices started going down because of that. And then others started selling and then others started panic selling. And so on and so forth.
Basically, my point is - everybody who has money to buy crypto to invest for quick results already knows about crypto and its speculative nature, and stays away. 
Of course human stupidity and greed has no limits and another big bull run is possible (I would love one as much as you) but not likely.

@_date: 2018-10-17 17:35:03
The last big dip lasted 2 years ($1200 to $200). This one will probably last at least as much if not more. 
The other difference is - last year was the first time when many people lost Saturday amounts of money on this, including second mortgages, pension accounts etc. And the mass media made sure that everyone knows about those. So this time the memory will not be as short lived.
I say the next bull run will be in 3 years (unless crypto becomes Myspace, i.e. irrelevant)

Oh no, I'm under no impression that Bitcoin is a currency. In fact, it can't be a successful currency even if scaling is solved (current LN is not a secure implementation for global use) - its end-game deflationary properties disqualify it from being a currency. Economy only works when you have an incentive to invest money. If your currency it's not inflationary, you have no motivation to invest your money - you just hold it and it grows in value. That would lead to very quick economical stagnation - I mean, it's economy 101.
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:46:47
It has everything to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is nothing without infrastructure, and in 10 years the community around it failed to develop means of effectively using it

No, most people here don't believe crypto would replace money. They are hoping to make free money, that's it. And I don't understand the purpose of posting articles like this - their actual value is zero.

There is a great book that helped me quit 15 year ago. The book is called "Easy way to quit smoking" by Alan Carr. The book actually helped millions of people, including a bunch of my friends. Effortlessly. You read it while smoking, and by the end of it you just don't want to smoke any more. It's truly amazing, i suggest you try. 
The secret is - try to read it in one sitting. 
Found it: Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking

You are saying it like propagating Christianity was a good thing ��

With that supercomputer they don't need to mine - they will hack into Bitcoin ledger and assign themselves all the existing bitcoins.

Where were you buying - Coinbase? You can just to a find transfer there from your bank account directly. Or, even simpler, buy using localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:37:53
Do you mean the bank prevents your credit card or checking account from purchasing crypto?
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:08:27
There is no debit card limit for purchase, just for withdrawals. This story is 100% made up in attempt to create a use case for Bitcoin.

What do you mean by bcash 90% down since it's been launched? At launch, a year ago, it was around$500, now it's $700.

No, i will say you should get a life ;) It's not normal to get so wired up about ones and zeros ��

I'm taking from experience - I did the exercise not long ago when i had to transfer money quickly. Overall the difference between what i can spent and what the person cashed in 20 min (after received my ltc transfer) was over $200.

My point is that btc is a speculative investment, not money �� and you just proved it :) You don't invest in money expecting them to grow in value. Economy doesn't work with deflationary money, it's just basics.

I don't understand why anyone in their right mind would spent Bitcoin right now (unless you bought a plenty at $100)
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:40:47
It's a very narrow set of circumstances. If you had put $10000 into Bitcoin in December 2017, your $10,000 would right now because worth $3,000.

I actually heard this from several people who paid off their student loans with ltc gains. Good job!

Nah, I'm just making fun of the jumpy teenagers having orgasm every time Bitcoin goes up a couple percent.

You are missing one important detail - fees for converting fiat to crypto are quite big at the moment. Say you need to send $3k worth of crypto. You first go to Coinbase and buy LTC or ETH there, right? You will have to spend around $3150 for that buy because of Coinbase fees. Then you transfer the coins and pay withdrawal fees. Then the person who accepts the payment needs to exchange it back to fiat and gets screwed on exchange rates. In the end, you will pay $3200 and the other person will get $2900. Numbers are approximated but not far from the actual costs.

Sorry to break the party, but this is a classic bull trap -  Bitcoin is going to crash in the next couple days. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:48:54
No I'm good. Bitcoin is too drunk to deal with right now. I'm just watching with popcorn.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:41:08
Can you sell Bitcoin at those atm's?
@_date: 2018-04-12 04:04:51
No worries, guys, it's a bear trap. You will not see a real bull run at least until the fall.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:21:20
I would love to see the bottom at 3,5k - it's the only way it can start another bull run.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:03:01
Why don't you come back to this comment next week? We'll see who was right ;)

If you noticed, i didn't even say fall of which year ��

It's called confirmation bias, and most crypto junkies experience it. Those people also don't understand that crypto can't be seriously considered a "currency" until its fiat value is stable, which is not possible as the market is the only thing that gives crypto any value, and that value fluctuates ridiculously. Crypto gruppies can call you names for talking facts, but it doesn't change anything.

... which is illegal in many countries and most US states above certain small amounts.

" All the bankers and financiers jumping onto the crypto train signal that the bubble is yet to come" - so far, bankers and financiers are only fleeing the field. Nobody wants to touch crypto anymore, that's the current reality.

Sorry guys, looks like you are all using some shitty banks. I travel around the world often and never get any credit card payments declined - i just notify my bank prior to the trip.

Actually, outside of this ridiculous topic, a lot of transportation does rely on internet. Trains will stop working, airports will shut down public transportation will stop functioning if internet goes down - in modern parts of the world that is (aka Westerner Europe and the US)
