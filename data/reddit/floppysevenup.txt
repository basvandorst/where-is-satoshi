I thought positions would be settled at the price of yesterday at 18:00 UTC?
If that's the case USD lenders won't be affected unless the user already had a negative balance at that time.

My assumption is that once the BTC balance of affected users is adjusted to zero and all the positions are settled, the losses will be absorbed by the USD available in the customer margin account and then by the lenders.
Lenders would only cover the losses on the opened margin positions:
If we take an extreme case of a user that has a maximum leverage of 3.3 (10kUSD worth of bitcoins in account, 20kUSD borrowed) and was just above the liquidation threshold (15% of margin remaining) when the site was shut down, his position will be settled with a loss of around 5,500USD
The lender would be left with a cut of 27.5% and get 14,500USD back.
So when the site is back up and the lenders check their balances, I expect that the worst case scenario would be a loss of 27.5% (meaning all the borrowers were using max leverage, were close to being liquidated, did not have USD in their margin account, and got all their bitcoins stolen)
In reality it should be much lower than that, probably closer to 10%.
Bitfinex could decide to pool the position losses and apply the same % cut to all lenders or still apply it based on individual losses.
I guess they'll do the same as for btc balances. If all btc balances get the same cut, I expect usd lenders to have a pooled cut. If everyone is treated individually for btc, then the same will apply for USD.

how do you know an address belongs to an exchange?
for instance you flagged this transaction as 750btc going to bitfinex: [

I answered the same questions back in november

he left BNP 7 years ago, he must be investing with his own money

They maybe realized that they were insolvent only after their blockchain reindexing.
Since they didn't take the double spends into account, I presume that according to their own books, all the bitcoins were there. Maybe Mark himself was serious when he said that he just wanted to suspend the withdrawals for a few days until he realized, after the reindexing, that there was nothing left.

I signed up in april 2013 and I'm on the beta access list since august (I will be invited "Very soon" to use their exchange)
They seem to over promise and under deliver.

Don't expect anything from the support. After 17 emails going back and forth requesting a Country change over the course of 5 months, I had no choice but to capitulate. They're incredibly stubborn and they'll stick to the line beyond logic and reason.
I gave up and opened a second coinbase account in minutes.

Hello, 
Quick update from my side. 
After a couple of phone calls with Boursorama, they told me that due to risk issues with the destination platform (kraken) this IBAN is disabled by default. 
I've been told  I can only make a transfer to this IBAN by calling the customer support and not from the online banking system. 
I guess a few hacked bank accounts tried to deposit money there and transfers were recalled when the client found out. 
Customer support was very nice and understanding though a bit slow to investigate.

I have the same issue as manginahunter. Banking on Boursorama as well. It looks like the ban is effective when you try to add the IBAN to your list, but not if it's already there.

And the market spread?
Yes coinbase fee is 0%, but your coins are more expensive.
Why don't you try instead to see how much bitcoins you can get with 100$, 1000$, 10k$ and then compare?
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:07:05
Tried all the possible ways, even on the mobile app. I got in touch with the support, they tried to add it for me and got the same error message. 
They're investigating and will let me know.

Where do you talk about arbitrage risks in your post?
EDIT: I guess you were referring to this post:

On your account history, if you select your currency (whether USD or EUR) you should be able to see your withdrawal with a "status"
