That’s fair. Even though I think Ver is unfairly represented by a lot of people here, I still disagree with him on things. Every coin or platform has good and bad people pushing it. I think the best idea, regardless of who is pushing the technology, is looking into the technology and getting your own information and doing your own research from a variety of sources.

I'm only 19, and I too was taught to use 2 spaces after a full stop back in elementary school, so as for his age the 2-space reasoning may be a little less conclusive than it appears. Even though my evidence anecdotal, if it can happen to me it could've also happened with him.

Bold prediction there for 2020!

Just got this earlier, first time I've ever been dusted! Looks like they just sent .0001 BTC to tons of people. They might be looking at recent transactions because I got it soon after sending bitcoins to my own address which I hadn't used before then.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:35:00
Oh wow I didn't think those two companies were related at all, but looking at the logo it's pretty evident.
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:23:59
Exactly, they're called cents, not centidollars. There's nothing wrong with calling a µBTC a bit. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:17:51
And just a little bit aroused.
@_date: 2014-05-16 04:22:26
Oh wow thanks! Definitely wasn't expecting that haha.
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:55:16
Unless you have a Visa credit card (Visa debit/credit cards don't count), you have to wait 4 days for the bitcoin to go into your account.
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:43:25
Anyone know if RIT works?
@_date: 2014-06-16 13:49:27
Seriously, it's a perfect example of irony that we can't install a bitcoin wallet because we're jailbroken.
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:08:13
The reason everyone cares is because it used to be banned in the App Store. Now it's not. People are excited because apple is one of the biggest phone manufacturers in the world, so a huge new demographic of people will be able to have bitcoin wallets without jailbreaking.
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:35:55
Exactly. I think bitcoin is going to be extremely successful as a new and alternative form of payment. However I just don't see it completely replacing traditional fiat currency.
@_date: 2014-11-01 01:21:55
THERE'S GONNA BE A BITCOIN ATM AT MURPHY'S? AWESOME.
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:39:42
Yeah, when I first saw the name I didn't think "cool bitcoin wallet," I thought "oh a mix between the PRISM program and suicide. Well that's... huh." I agree though, the device seems really cool. I like the card/hardware device combo, I feel like it's a lot more secure than the trezor concept but not much more inconvenient.
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:16:09
Yeah I just ended up decrypting my wallet backup file and importing it into multibit. The web wallet interface was great and like you said they're really doing a lot, but being locked out of my account at really inopportune times just isn't worth it. 
Also I don't know if they have the apk posted anywhere, I have an iphone so I haven't really been looking out for it. That's actually one of the reasons I was using blockchain, because my phone is jailbroken so I could download their ios app.
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:55:00
Yay New Hampshire!
@_date: 2014-08-09 01:30:40
Not yet, I'll look into it!  
@_date: 2014-05-09 13:40:09
That's actually really concerning, I didn't think of that. What if the company had it set up so that funds would be deposited into the card after some sort of activation at purchase or something? Sort of like how you can't use an itunes card until after it's been activated. That way, you'd end up with the right amount of bitcoins for usd value.
Edit: apparently that is how it works, pretty cool!
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:59:05
I seriously don't understand the point of that subreddit. Do they have nothing better to do than hate and make fun of things that other people are interested in? It's sad.
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:56:52
Yeah I was just speculating. I was only replying to the comment above me, I don't know how those cards work at all. I can't really think of any other way that they would work anyways.
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:33:14
Yeah I found a program to decrypt and re-save the wallet file so I'm just gonna stick to multibit from here on I think.
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:58:53
At least if you scroll down a little there's a bit more sensibility.
@_date: 2014-08-08 20:18:35
This is awesome! I love seeing my state on reddit, and after looking at his positions I'm definitely voting for him.
@_date: 2014-06-16 15:47:23
I know. I just mean that now that bitcoin wallet apps are allowed on the App Store, the only reason they can't be downloaded is because of the jailbreak, whereas before the only way to get an iOS wallet was to download the Blockchain app through cydia. Hence the irony. Obviously the Blockchain app is still available, but not everyone wants to use that app, and it hasn't been updated in forever.
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:06:28
It's easy, just memorize your private key. Let's see, q57bcx... something something something.

I don't mean to diminish the quote because it actually is a really good quote, but I always thought it was pretty funny that that quote discusses people.
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:02:47
It's better than nothing, I don't see any reason to not at least consider it.
@_date: 2014-05-09 13:41:04
That's so dumb, I'd love to have these here in the US. Going through coinbase is a pain with their 4-day wait period.
@_date: 2014-09-28 02:47:58
Seriously, those comments were terrible.
@_date: 2014-06-14 06:37:57
Yeah, I'd download this in a heartbeat if it didn't require iOS 7.1+. I'd imagine a pretty big chunk of bitcoin iphone users also jailbreak.
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:43:30
I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but Glenn Beck really isn't as bad as a lot of people claim he is. Does he have some controversial opinions? Sure. But a lot of people do. It doesn't matter what positions you hold, there will always be people that disagree.
That being said, I used to watch his show a lot when it was still on the air. He would always espouse the benefits of limited government and free market principles. I honestly don't know where the perception of him being a big-government neo-conservative came from.
Well that's just my 2 cents. If you've actually read this whole thing before downvoting then thanks. If anything this just goes to show how diverse the users of Bitcoin are, and that can only be a good thing.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:22:22
Oh wow, definitely didn't expect a reply from the company on reddit! Thanks for clearing things up!
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:09:11
Yeah I'm definitely gonna heed that recommendation haha. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:56:27
Yeah I live in the US too, and that's what ow a thinking. Either way all these cool ideas for hardware wallets are really exciting, I can't wait til they start becoming commercially available.

That's the sound of his plane flying to Dubai.

There's no reason to be such a toxic person, people are allowed to have opinions that don't line up perfectly with yours.
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:16:02
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:32:36
Glad to see that this is the quality content the moderators deem suitable for high standards, rather than those pesky technical discussions where people might get exposed to *other opinions*.

Have you heard about what happened to Evolution marketplace? millions of dollars in bitcoin were stolen.
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:40:37
I bought in at about 900. Wheee!!!
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:23:10
Are we the same person?

Yeah I was wondering why he isn't using bitpay or something...

Pretty much you enter your name in a comment thread, then they have some sort of program that chooses a winner based on Blockchain hashes, and then a winner from the thread is chosen. Then, ideally, everyone who entered donates a dollar to the winner. It's pretty cool actually.
