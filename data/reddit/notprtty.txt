Everything in my shop is handmade by ME!  The TARDIS hats are knit, the Ghost hats are crochet.  My designs and work :)  The amount of time it takes for everything varies, obviously.  The hats you mentioned are probably 2-4 hours a piece.

Well, then gold is clearly a terrible investment.  Not stable at all.  Thankfully no one has any confidence in it.  Thank God we have printed paper money backed by the government to rely on!
(In case no one realizes, that's how people talk to me about the dips in BTC and why it will never last/be a good currency)

Absolutely!  I love doing custom work, and always relish a challenge :)
My only real limits are what people are willing to pay for.  So far, I haven't met a project I couldn't do.

I've found that my humor is too dry, and people tend to read into my sarcasm as being serious and then downvote me to Hell because they don't get the joke.  Then my faith in humanity crashes, and that's no good at all! :P

Ignoring the fact that it's still super up from its inception and has already climbed since the crash... If you dislike it, why are you on the subreddit at all?  Do you also go into people's homes and tell them you disagree with their taste in furniture and television brands?

Already did that :)

There are ones that work for weed.  Vaporizers for marijuana have been around quite some time, so there are some that work like those, for dried herb, but on a smaller scale.  And ones you can use with oil, like regular e-ciggs.  If OP doesn't cater to that crowd, I'm sure a quick Google search will tell you who does.

Way to take that first quote completely out of context to try and prove a point.  We've got a master debater here.
And it's not about being a circlejerk, but if you've already made up your mind on the Bitcoin, and aren't here to learn more about it, your only reason for being here is to talk shit.  Which, again, makes me wonder why bother?

Wait, you mean these two currencies shouldn't be judged by the exact same standards because they are wholly different?!  Mind=blown.

~climbs into cart~  Where are we going?!  I hope it's fun!  I love cart rides!  Wheeee!
