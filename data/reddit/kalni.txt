We have support at 10700, lets see if it holds up this time:

That's not how this works. You can't just draw an inverse plot to argue it's var A falling and not var B.

To each his own I guess. TA has worked for me more often than not (and I mean in the 90%) in my last one year of crypto trading, so I will stick to it :)

If there is a dip at all, it will only be after the next difficulty adjustment which is due in about 7-8 hours.

How is it a mutual fund if it just holds Bitcoin?

There will be a major correction before it manages to reach 10k.

Yes it will work. However, personally I have had issues with sending Bitcoin from my segwit ledger to an exchange. It keeps failing.

As long as you have the seed written somewhere, you can use it to restore your wallet on any BIP39 supported wallets including another hardware wallet or a software wallet.

Fuck you. Yes, I mean that literally.

Some basic things are not gonna change. Any form of currency, be it crypto or fiat is just a proxy for some value attached to a commodity or a service. That won't change even if crypto takes over the whole world. And you get more crypto if you have any commodity or service of value to sell.

Why would a buyer be willing to do that? The only time that would happen is if demand is less and supply is more and right now (and for the unforeseen future) I don't see that happening.

There is no consensus. It can go either way.

Even with 0 interest, borrowing money to invest in something as risky and volatile as Bitcoin is a bad idea IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:41:45
I am new to alts myself and have collected a few Ripples and Ethers here and there. Haven't dared venture into the murky underwaters of other alts as yet. If you don't mind, what are some of these alts which you think might provide better returns than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:43:21
Given the history and volatility of Bitcoin, a 40% correction isn't something that will cause raised eyebrows. Forget 40, even a 60% correction is completely normal.
EDIT: By correction above, I mean the initial dip which could go down to as much as 40-60%, but will then rise again to get "corrected" at a price between the dip and the previous current. The final correction might well not be less than 20-30%, but the dip preceding the correction can go down to as much as 40-60%.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:07:51
tl;dr: There will be dips, buy at every dip!!!!!

This is the BTC sub and I am going to get trashed for saying this, but, "You're making a huge mistake".

Dollar-cost averaging or DCA is the only way to keep investing in a potential bubble while minimising your losses unless you want to risk timing the market.

I have been seeing this a lot in the threads recently. I think there should be a bot for this.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:23:48
I think the comparison is a bit flawed though others are welcome to comment. One shouldn't be comparing all crytocurrencies to gold. One should compare Bitcoin (or some other currency but a specific one) to gold. Each crypto on its own is finite and deflationary in nature and is comparable to gold. 
All the different kinds of cryptocurrencies right now can be compared to all the different metals/minerals/whatever that exist today in the world. But they all have their own values, some more valuable than gold, some less, some virtually worthless. That's the exact same situation with cryptos. Eventually one of them will rule the roost and can take the place of gold and eventually the central fiat. Some other cryptos will also exist and will take the place of silver, aluminium, etc. Most other cryptos will be virtually worthless like many particles in the world today are. 
In the end any of these virtual currencies be it fiat or gold or bitcoin are just proxies to some value attached to a commodity or a service. It doesn't matter what that proxy ends up being (virtual in the case of cryptos), as long as its finite and has consensus.

That paints a pretty dismal picture compared to all the posts, articles, tweets and videos that I keep seeing.

People here are recommending Blockfolio, and frankly I would have too, but of late it's gone to the dogs. Doesn't respond half the time, be it getting the current prices or letting one add to the portfolio. Also, given how it doesn't have any export feature, it would be a pain to migrate to another manager later on. I suggest you keep away from it and find something else for yourself. Learned it the hard way!
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:42:06
Actually futures lets you do just that. Recommend you read up on derivatives and futures and options first!

How dare you SIR! Let it be known, that Roger Ver is a millionaire since before Bitcoin days, in his own words :-/
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:14:42
Yes. BTC is the most popular coin out there but it has already rallied quite a bit in 2017 while ETH hasn't. Even if BTC grows say 10x in the next couple of years, ETH will grow more than that for sure. As far as RoI is concerned its better to invest in ETH than BTC at the moment. Of course there might be other alt coins/tokens and ICOs which gives you monumental returns but if you don't wanna risk too much, split it into ETH-BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:23:40
I had the same question a few days ago and frankly I am still not sure what to do. The majority opinion seemed to be that as long as you buy BTC and immediately trade it for an alt, it doesn't matter what BTC's price is w.r.t. USD, just don't hold it for long. 
Frankly I have decided to stay the fuck out of any coin till BTC gets some stability (and I am not even talking about a correction/crash). By stability, I mean a few days say a weeks worth of, not more than that.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:35:01


How does one go about doing that?

Dude! I am happy for you and all but delete this post and  the image ASAP. Also better to delete your account immediately and create a new one.

It's too late to sell now. It's better you hold and buy more at the dip.

Actually, even if that happens, it shouldn't be considered a good life lesson.

But that's where you have the chicken and egg problem. You won't have more and more people entering the market if adoption doesn't increase, and adoption won't increase till price keeps fluctuating.

This is demonstrably false information. As someone who has gone through domestic airports in multiple Indian cities countless times, you are full of shit. Your passport/ID is checked only once during the issuance of the boarding pass, and your boarding pass is checked only twice, once during the security check and a second time during boarding. Also, the only stamp it ends up having is the one during the security check.
Contrast this to domestic airports in the US which is a fucking nightmare, I wish you would have come up with better comparisons to showcase the red tape in India, of which there is not shortage of (from personal experience).

"Locking" $7000 for 14 years on a speculative investment, with no ability to get out or change tracks along those 14 years if need be, is not called taking measured risk.
