It emulates a digital camera's flash card standard layout (DCIM standard) so it will at least show the QR code for payment once you connect it. You do need a USB-OTG cable for Android or the "camera kit" for your Apple iPad. No app required in either case. If your mobile device is smart enough to let you view HTML files, then you get all the features by opening the index.html file on the Opendime.

I know this pay button seems like simple stuff, but I like to think we've done it next-level style:
- Crypto only but you can price in fiat (USD, etc)
- Super private: our payment flow (hate that word) works over Tor with Javascript and Cookies disabled (Tor browser's highest setting). [although you can't collect email/refund addresses in that mode] 
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:25:03
Few changes to support this use case:
- QR code generated server-side (normally done in JS)
- some directions for user added inside &lt;noscript&gt; tags
- time value calculated server-side (ie. 10 minutes left) instead of JS
The user does need to reload the page.

We need the extended private key because each transaction on Coinkite will generate a new P2SH payment address. Coinkite uses BIP32 to pick a new subkey for each co-signer of the account.

The CK audit report does this pretty well. Shows all the UTXO related to the account and the BIP32 subkey paths for each. Using the xpub you can check those, although not easy.

Cloudflare perhaps is caching? 
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:43:28
We support Tor (at *gcvqzacplu4veul4.onion*) for co-signing and co-signers do not need to login or be Coinkite members to participate in a transaction. So basically we know your xpubkey and not much else.

Sign the message with the key "m"... meaning the top level key or "root master" key. 
You'll have to write some code on the other side when it comes time to redeem funds though (withdraw). There is no way it can work directly in the Trezor based on what I (little) know about how it works.

You'll find our certificate is new as of Thursday, March 27, 2014  . An upside of CloudFlare is they manage the details of this stuff on a scale that is rather mind-blowing. They had advanced knowledge of the heartbleed issue and prepared before it became widely known.

If the key is stored in Coinkite's HSM, then yes, your Coinkite account would have to be compromised as well as your PC. If you use 2FA login (and you should) then that should help.
If anyone wants to start a "fully remote signing" service for Coinkite, they could... Our signing process data is open and doesn't require a Coinkite login. (PS: We'd help you).
Another option would be a hardware wallet doing the Coinkite signing. I believe the ledger folks are working on that already. You'd need to maintain control over the hardware wallet, but the assumption is that's easier than securing a PC.

Assuming you have the xprvkey for M of your N keys, then you just need to find the UTXO for your funds and publish a transaction that moves that to another key.
We list all UTXO for your account (with all the transaction hashes needed) in what we call the "audit report" and that includes multisig accounts now too. The subkey needed (M/x) is indicated in that report as well. Armed with that information, a site like ms-brainwallet can produce and send the transaction you need.
Also for you doomsday planning: we email a copy of the HSM private keys associated with your multisig account, encrypted with Coinkite master key that would be published after we shutdown. (Very similar to what we've always done with regular accounts).

They are 256-bit random numbers from /dev/random. Two of them effectively: an "API key" (identifier) and "API Secret" (the secret part, never sent over the wire). You have to copy them down from the web UI within 24 hours of generating it, as the secret part is never shown again after that deadline.

Coinkite has an answer for "servers are gone" situation but yes more trust is required to use web wallets vs. running your own node.

UTXO are the "individual deposits" which make up your balance. It's public info, and I don't know anything about this specific address except that it's had lots of traffic and so has tons of UTXO.
The services that drop UTXO will lose your money if you tried to build a wallet on them. Speed is also a factor, as always, and the blockchain is big, so some care is needed to quickly serve up all the data it holds.

Hi. CTO of Coinkite here.
I don't like being next to those guys either, but the short answer is: "Yes, the DDoS mitigation is worth it.".
If there was any practical alternative to Cloudflare (ideally based in Canada or outside US at least), I would jump over to it. Cloudflare routinely deflects 400Gbp/s attacks and to do that ourselves is not possible.

BTW thanks for the tip, but it was my bug so here's a tip back: $4 @_date: 2014-11-19 18:46:39
I pasted your xprv key into &lt;bip32.org&gt; and  I then choose: _Derivation Path: Info:M_ from the pulldown. **(important)**
This gave me a pubkey of: `17Jvt5sDNDeE3jPeawJ8n8FyR81jELvQt6` and a WIF of
`L4ui2K7bWrv15Bi8EdNdqKeCKWpCWA5vgqcb8uDTQgcSieB13Umv` which I then pasted into brainwallet.
The resulting signature was:

That's exactly how Coinkite works; we don't make a secret of that. We have to control the private keys to be able to offer security as a service and do things on the server-side without you being present. 
Coinkite isn't for everyone and the best part about Bitcoin is that you have the option of using a wallet on your own machine and truly owning all the problems yourself.

Yes, for the first time, Coinkite does not have all the keys—if you want that. Any or all of the (up to 15!) keys on a shared account can be completely secret to Coinkite if you want. Single-click HSM storage is still an option tho.

I think Trezor could make (and hold) the xpubkey needed, but I doubt that there is a quick and easy way to get the sighashes into it and the signatures back out when it comes time to authorize a transaction. In fact, it would not be good if a Trezor allowed you to sign arbitrary sighash values.
But I haven't studied their API or docs, so might be possible.

We did use Redis on BTCLook.com (now offline) and it *was* hella fast, but also hella expensive. Even after compressing keys and values lots, it was an expensive setup because of RAM costs.

@_date: 2014-07-15 21:49:17
It's technically possible for us to do that, but there isn't any need (that I can see) since we're already tracking all the UTXO associated with your account. Also I think it's probably too low-level for our users.
If the goal is to achieve Coinjoin or Multisig functionality, then I'd rather we implement that at a higher level, so we can provide the same feature to web users.
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:32:09
No, sorry that wouldn't work. This feature uses conventional bitcoin addresses.
I don't think you can use xpubkeys for payments like that; at least, you would need to alert the receiving wallet somehow that a new subpath has been used.

Challenge accepted.
1) When you get a new user, you call Coinkite's BitKit API and create a [payment address]( This would give you a bitcoin address for them to pay into and a Coinkite ref number (`CK_refnum`).
2) Tell your customer to pay into the address.
3) Wait for a webhook call from Coinkite about the payment and/or poll. Let them in if/when they pay. This could also be done with [Pubsub events]( in the user's browser.
4) When they return to your site on another day, ask them for the payment address from previous visit (their wallet would have it) and look up that in Coinkite ([using search]( From there, you can see date of last payment and amount and decide if the visitor is still "subscribed" or has to pay more. Recycle same payment address in that case and start over at 
Problem: payment address is public, so easy to impersonate a paying customer, once you find the transaction (not sure how easy that would be to do). So, another choice would be to use the `CK_refnum` from Coinkite as a user name. It's a short hex string, about 20 bytes.
But still, you'll probably need a database...
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:29:53
I put it there basically as a habit. I feel that many fraudsters on the web are not very clever and/or have weaker technical skills. You are completely right that any potential phisher could just remove that snippet. The nice thing is if they forget to (or don't notice it) then we get a chance to record the details of their attempt at phishing, and protect our customer.
The code in question is as follows, before a few variables get substituted, minimizing and obfuscation:
    if(location.protocol != 'file:' 
        &amp;&amp; location.host != 'coinkite.com' 
        &amp;&amp; location.host != '{{TOR_HOSTNAME}}'
        &amp;&amp; location.hostname != "localhost"
        &amp;&amp; location.hostname != "127.0.0.1"
    ) {
        // This is a trap for phishers, if they ever try to use this file without
        // first removing this code... which they could if they know it's here.
        location.replace('
            +btoa(location.href).replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=+$/, ''));
    }

Coinkite will give you the redeem script for all UTXO associated with the account via the "audit report".
The private keys required to move those funds are either already in your hands if kept the keys when you made the account, or they are available in encrypted form via email. The plan is the key to decrypt those email attachments would be published if we close (probably right here in Reddit).

All great points and issues we've discussed here in the office... I'll try to cover everything:
- we chose a "key storage" chip specifically because it's designed to hold private keys and be hard to read from. It should be among the hardest of chips break, and has a number of protections **specifically** against reading by electron microscope. (I would list them here, but they are not in the public datasheet... sorry!)
- we do intend to use a certificate-chain setup just to contain any possible key-leak damage, but we haven't finalized the granularity yet, and it will probably not use x.509-style encodings. We are leaning towards a single private key for each device, and a 'certificate' that includes the serial numbers from both main micro and the key chip itself. That's exactly what your ascii-art is showing, but with a batch size of one.
- our production system is based on a dedicated HSM that is the only place the (root) factory key exists.
- we already support user-provided challenge values via a low-level, vendor-specific USB command (and we ship the code to check it on each opendime, see `advanced/trustme.py`). Version 2 hardware will leverage that, so that the signed message from the anti-counterfeiting chip can also be verified as "non-replayed".

IMHO there is no way to secure a secret like an API key on a device that's outside your control like a mobile phone. If you're talking about a shared web host, that's really no better.
For Coinkite's API, however, that's not the end of the world: just make a key that is **super** limited.
You can limit the key can only be used to receive, and never to send funds. And/or limit it to just a single sub-account, or limit how much $BTC per hour and so on.
Not useful in a mobile app, but for a web server, the best of all is to limit the API key to a single IP address---the address of your web server backend. Then the key is useless to the rest of the Internet.

1) Not really. With a BIP32-based system like Trezor or Coinkite, lots of different "bitcoin-level" keys are being used.
2) Best practice is a unique key per transaction. Each time you move money out of a key a tiny little bit of information is leaked about the key from the signature. So, in non-tech terms: it's more secure.
However, none of the above has anything to do with multisig, which is the next level, where multiple keys are needed to move the money. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:00:12
The code for Coinkite's offline (ie. browser side) key generation is shared in un-obfuscated style (see [coinkite/offline]( It uses the browser RNG (crypto.getRandomValues) and refuses to run if that isn't available. It also mixes that with some entropy from the environment and of course it's all hashed up nicely.
I'm confident we've got all the bases covered for our customers who use that without debugging the source code. For those who wish to work at that level of detail, I would **not** recommend this tool—instead, you should be making your own keys and uploading to Coinkite only the xpubkey.

IIRC, getting an xpubkey out of the Trezor is a solved problem. However, sending it a *multisig* transaction and getting it to sign it properly is not possible. It can sign a P2PKH partially-signed transaction (of course) but it can't handle the complexities of the P2SH (with HD BIP32) cases on the input side.

I haven't run this, but first thing: `num_change` can't be zero. Leave it out, and the account default for "flex liquidity" will be used. Use "1" if you think there will not be a change output (but good luck getting the math right).
The `num_change` value is described here:

Hope that helps! Keep experimenting.

There are lots of interoperability issues for P2SH HD wallets, and this is the easy stuff... Change addresses, and look-ahead will also cause trouble.
I believe there is a BIP in the works to try to herd these cats, and assuming it's not terrible, Coinkite will try to support it.
No BIP number AFAIK has been assigned yet.

I don't know much about Electrum, so I don't know how to get there from here. It's not hard to do on BIP32.org with Brainwallet for the signing. All free, open source and ready to go in your browser.

Also important: Coinkite wants the signature to be the root key ('m') from your xpub. If you're willing to share your xpubkey, I can debug that too.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:26:48
I agree, this is purely for demonstration purposes. Consider it proof-of-concept with a browser and no setup time.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:44:34
If you press "Print" you can see the format we recommend for safe-keeping and that includes the xpub in full.
For private/security reasons, we show only the first few digits for xpub both there and through-out the Coinkite site.

Yes it's safe to accept zero-conf for small amounts, but you can't make use of those funds immediately; ie. to pay your coffee bean farmer.

We have a FAQ entry on this: See "*Do Coinkite shared accounts interoperate with other vendors*" on [this FAQ page](
BUT. The xpubkey/xprvkeys themselves can be generated/held by any wallet that can sign a short message (and output Base64 of that). In particular, I've done it with a combination of Brainwallet and BIP32.org.

@_date: 2015-03-20 01:57:01
You can use Brainwallet to sign the message (the message is just the work Coinkite and nothing else). However, you'll have to export your BIP32 xprvkey into WIF format first. You can do that at bip32.org and copy to brainwallet.
Any BIP32 wallet should be able to do the message signing as well.

@_date: 2015-03-22 19:52:09
You should be using `1HzytTfctL8TSh7BaNpzaEyB3wjk7xxBjy` for signing, based on that xpub.
That is the 'root' of the BIP32 subkey tree, usually denoted as "m". You can generate that on BIP32.org for example, using the xpub you just shared.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:20:45
I don't know much about Electrum, but in general yes it's a problem to have some keys controls by the wallet (for change, receiving) and others for signing messages and partial transactions.

1) Of course; you don't have to.
2) The offline stuff doesn't have a UI for that. 
I don't know what's wrong with your signature, and everything in those screen shots looks ok. Could you post the signature in another message, so I can cut-n-paste in my tools?

Coinkite's user interface is just like online banking. Pretty easy to use.
You can "audit" us, by exporting a table of all UXTO related to your account. Then using third-part sites, you can look up each of those amounts to make sure they are in the block chain, and even check that the BIP32 xpubkey we gave you can provide the pubkey for that.

The Coinkite terminal works with any bitcoin/litecoin wallet you might have. The transaction times are limited to the underlying technology (and certainly Litecoin has an advantage there).
Coinkite users will enjoy a faster confirmations because we can verify for the merchant that the funds are actually on the way. The blockchain is still used for all funds movement regardless.

No need. Any transaction that removes money requires a "cashier's" card to authorize. Some one could waste your paper, I suppose... or give you money.

Yes, the Litecoin and Testnet coins (for devs) all come from the BIP32 HD keys. The hierarchy is used for sub-accounts and then specific transactions.

(CTO for Coinkite here)
Each coinkite user gets a unique file that is only the xprivkey to their own coins. Each of those files is encrypted with the same key, which is the one we would publish on doomsday. The file contains a [BIP32]( "extended private key" in the standard base58 encoding defined there.
The file is AES-256-CBC encrypted and everyone's version has a different IV (initial vector).
So I would say, keep the file confidential for a rainy day, but no need to keep it *super* private... If Coinkite is closed and the master key is public knowledge, you should move the funds off of those keys just in case your email box was compromised. But you'd probably want to do that anyway to be able to make use of the funds.
Here's an example of what the file looks like:
                                                                                       
    echo "Enter Coinkite master key (hex)"

CTO of Coinkite here.
I see Coinbase as an exchange only (at this point anyway). Blockchain.info is a web wallet, and certainly Coinkite is a wallet in some ways.
However, because our technology is built on BIP32 Deterministic wallets, we can do some pretty neat things: we give you a master extended pubkey that can be used to generate every pubkey we'll ever use on your account. In fact, the welcome email from Coinkite (when you create your profile) also contains a copy of your private key, encrypted with AES-256-CBC. 
You can put that file under your pillow (digitally speaking) and should Coinkite ever be forced to close, we will release the key to that file in a tweet. All former Coinkite users can then decrypt the BIP32 root key to unlock their funds.
We do all our transactions on the public blockchain---no secret "book keeping" here.
During operation, all our transactions are signed by our custom HSM, which is functionally equivalent to a hardware wallet, except at a much larger scale. All private keys for Coinkite never leave our HSM.
Also, Coinkite has a hardware POS terminal (like a credit-card machine in a restaurant) and will be issuing bitcoin-based debit cards.

@_date: 2013-09-21 06:00:04
Yes, Coinkite uses BIP32 HD wallets throughout. In fact, your welcome message will include the xpubkey for the root of your wallet. Your subaccounts and individual transactions are all subpaths of that key.

Just want to add one comment here about cost.
We do support redeeming Coinkite vouchers directly to a pubkey (bitcoin address). There is no need for the CK voucher recipient to use Coinkite or open an account. I think it's fair to say the vouchers are "free to receive" even though Coinkite is a paid service.

A machine which looks the same as a Coinkite machine would not be able to talk to our servers. More likely someone will try to subvert one of our units and change the firmware to mislead users. There are multiple protections against that, including: all firmware binaries are signed, the signing key is in a specialized chip which is resistant to tampering... and a bunch of other measures, if you do manage to get past that.
