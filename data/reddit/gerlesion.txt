What's up with  the sudden dip. I want to sell my wife to buy that dip lol

I like it. I never thought abt that. But it's very true that I tend to trust tech more than human. I always trust Google Maps, Trip Advisor more than locals. And definitely I trust code more than any institutions.

Best time to buy. I'm accumulating as much as possible before the next bull run :D:D

Just want to add that any foreign currency, like USD, EUR, RMB... are not legal tenders in Vietnam. Bitcoin is treated as a foreign currency.

Excellent. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experience.

How do I tell which is segwit address. I just want to send from exchange to other exchange. Are they using segwit addresses now?

Looks great. Thank you. By the way, I have some feedback. * Please pin USD and BTC to the top when searching for currencies. Currently only BTC and ETH are pinned. * When use BTC as currency, the price change doesn't reflect the price change against BTC.

my alts down 20% but I feel much better now lol
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:12:26
Whoever made it... You are fucking awesome!
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:54:42
So anyone already successfully purchased?
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:10:15
Not likely. Probably some whale just dumped a large amount, but way less than 3k. I set stop loss at 9,999 but my order was executed at 9,550. That is insane considering the very thick order book on Finex. I guess there were a lot of stop orders around 10,000 leading to the huge slippage. Got rek badly :((. Learned a lesson today is always use a stop limit to avoid slippage.

Thanks. I saw it earlier but didn't fully understand the impact. So the price pump  is nothing to do with the Chinese right. There is a rumor that Chinese can by Bitcoin with fiat starting Nov 1st. Do you have  any idea abt this?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:19:46
Looks promising
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:47:45
What happened. Why suddenly pumped. Can someone give me a link????
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:44:00
lol best store I've read for a long time
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:12:06
so you think bitcoin can't solve the issue? Or not in the near future?
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:12:03
Andreas gave me great confidence in bitcoin. I live in a place where bitcoin has a very "bad reputation". After knowing his channel and literally watching very single videos of him, I converted majority of my investment portfolio into bitcoin and other alt coins. Bitcoin community is fortunate to have a mentor like Andreas.

What happened to Bitcoin hash rate. Down more than 60% today.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:16:10
I didn't buy  at  $4000$, $5000$, or $6000 because I already all in at $3200  :D:D:D
