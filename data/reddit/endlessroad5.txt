It has nothing to do with private keys. Coinbase reported crypto trade data on people who used their account. Whys that hard to understand. They know what you made/lost on those trades and you owe taxes whether you lost your keys in a boating accident or not.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:34:25
You'll pay a fee when you buy bitcoin and pay a fee when you send bitcoin. Yes you'll need to spend more than 10$.

@_date: 2019-08-26 12:59:32
Maybe that applies to stuff that's not liquid like 401k. It's easy to jump in and out of bitcoin quickly. Theres no way I'd have a substantial amount of money sitting in a savings account. That 1950s investing advice is garbage. DCA and sell part when/if you need. Just report taxes at the end of the year.

@_date: 2019-02-15 13:31:09
I'm not trying to make an argument. He tried to hire someone to kill someone else, laundered money, trafficked narcotics, and computer hacked. And the plot to hire was factored into his sentence. He's where he should be.

Why would you need 5x minimum wage to pay all expenses? Are you paying for school up front?

Transaction fees will keep us from going too high.

Buy on square cash. No fee and you'll end up with more btc for same amount spent.
@_date: 2019-01-10 01:19:28
It does but exchanges also have fiat accounts, even fiat account as coinbase is FDIC insured I believe. So I guess instead of getting out of crypto all together you just buy the stable coin but selling for fiat and rebuying seems same to me. Unless the fees are higher to and from fiat.
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:18:34
