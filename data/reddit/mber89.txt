When many seem certain it's going to 8k or lower, it likely isn't.

This is just the reality of human nature and markets, not delusion.  Maybe you're just having a bad day with your alt bags, sorry man.

I understand the frustration, but I believe they are working their asses off to implement off-chain scaling solutions.  Not fair to suggest they don't care about fungibility.

They aren't done upgrading bitcoin so you have no way of knowing that, but altcoins will have the benefit of learning from bitcoins successes/mistakes.

The only reason I'm glad I didn't get in earlier is so this scenario didn't occur.

If this is what people participating in the Bitcoin reddit actually believe, the recent crash makes a ton of sense.
Educate yourself. Bitcoin is far more than a "brand", don't fixate on price.

You implied that lightning is competing with bch on a transactional basis, when in reality bch is competing (and losing) to dogecoin in transactional volume and utility.  Nobody is falling for your "academic discussion", you are trying to portray lightning in a negative light and bch as some kind've golden standard for transactions...please.
