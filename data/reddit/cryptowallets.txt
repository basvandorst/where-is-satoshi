Yes I read it, I just wasn't sure what happened to all that data, I was under the impression that every fraction of a bitcoin carries every transaction history from the point it was mined. I know now that this is incorrect.

Blockchain.info won't allow me to assign a lower fee, is this possible with another client? The risk of it not confirming seems more attractive then salvaging the 1$

My Service [Btc2sms.org]( allows remote bitcoin transactions world-wide only using SMS, but it requires international texting to the US for user's in inda for example. Also it requires a public key to exit, we are currently working on several off-ramps and features to create more ease of use.
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:43:16
Oh okay, so every bitcoin gets recycled by miners eventually. Is all it's taint is removed in that process?
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:56:24
I just notice that the option is missing, there is still information about it on thier faq: 
They must have removed that recently, sorry to misguide you.

Cool! The more the merrier! 


Time. This have been a one man job for the most part and I work a full-time development job during the day. 


It's a little early to say but earning trust in this community is not an easy task to say the least. But in practice, it's fairly simple for your average person to get a grip on how to use it, I sent some to my dad recently and he was able to send them back without coaching him through the process.


Sweet! I may do so in the future, I have a plethora of ideas for services that could build on-top of this, could always use a good pair of hands.
@_date: 2013-07-14 01:26:26
My service [BTC2SMS]( requires 0 confirmations, no internet or smartphone required. Just meet up pre-loaded, when satisfied with the trade trigger a  send command via text to thier public key or mobile phone number

I just noticed that too, it was heartbreaking.
@_date: 2013-06-13 14:32:32
Currently the confirmation code is the only deterrent against attackers, 2FA will need to be implemented in some clever way to be fully protected.

Thank you to everyone who gave this service a try in the past few months! We've had a long delay in finally getting a solid webpage up until now, and new features with be making their way down the pipe in good time.

So an example of a useful scenario would be if you wanted to buy/sell a local item on Kijiji, in the countryside, and neither party wants to disclose where they live. So they decide to meet up at a public location that may not have an internet connection. The buyer would come prepared with bitcoin loaded on thier deposit address, and when the buyer feels satisfied with the item they would send bitcoin to the sellers phone, the seller can move that bitcoin after 3 confirmations to another phone number or public address completely independent of need for a smartphone or internet connection. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:51:32
Ok thank you for clearing that up!

My opinion is that ripple feels really scammy, can't see the benefit of a centralized pre-mined currency. It's more like a stamp than a currency but the decentralization of power of transaction is what makes mined coins unique and attractive to people at this point in history. I've made a few open source paper wallets for bitcoin &amp; other alt currencies here: 
The only alt coins I have owned is litecoin at one point and currently and small amount of ppcoin. I'm still not sure what to think about them, but as long as they are decentralized I don't have any complaints. Bitcoin will be the gold standard for the foreseeable future but it will be interesting to see which coins gain some steam and add more services available to them. It's mostly the caliber of the community built around these alt coins is what makes them valuable, kinda like bitcoin but without the sexy origin mystery, or fiat dollars.

That's where I'm headed! Stay tuned

From a user standpoint the confirmation code is your only means of protection from attack, 2FA will be implemented eventually in some clever fashion.


Yeah, I wouldn't recommend putting your life savings on this system, but for small amounts it gets the job done.
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:27:04
Wouldn't this imply a lifespan of a single bitcoin? If I send 1 BTC to a clean address for free, and send that to another clean address and keep doing that over and over, at what point would it be impossible to keep doing that where the fee is 100% of the balance because of all the taint accumulated?
Isn't this a huge problem? How is this supposed to exist in the future? 
@_date: 2013-05-29 05:18:49
This should help: 


@_date: 2013-05-27 13:13:53
Really? I may try that out (mtgox) but I'm not convinced it will work, the transaction fee is huge due to micro transactions, this fee seems to be unavoidable even using custom send on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-06-09 20:26:29
I just launched a similar sms serivce yesterday! We are on the same wavelength, but my service is designed to be completely independent of a need for internet or a smartphone, check out the subreddit here: 
or the project thread on bitcointalk.org: 
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:26:33


Thank you for pointing that out! That problem has been fixed (very minor syntax error). The confirmation code's purpose is to protect from spoofing attacks that could move your coins around.


That's an interesting implementation, you may see this in the near future.


Seems like a good idea, this could be implemented quickly.


This will likely come with hot wallet capabilities, where the user can prompt for a fresh address.


All of these suggestions are very good ideas, thank you a ton for all this great feedback! You should see alot of these concepts integrated into the system. Thanks so much again!

I'm from Canada and use Libertybit.com, it's a $2 fee for email interact transfers which is reasonable and only takes a day. 0.5% fee on trades and 2-FA. No id scans or whatever, if your within thier limits you should be fine. It's lower volume than the bigger guys but I'v been really satisfied with the service.
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:12:49

If you have a smartphone you can scan and paste, but your concern is valid. I will have to think of some clever way to accept shortened public keys or something else. I'll throw up a video eventually.

So doesn't this mean that every bitcoin currently in circulation will eventually be destroyed by spending them, so in the distant future it would be impossible to even spend your coins because of all the taint they will accumulate? Is there anyway to convert those pennies back into a $100 bill? Is this the Achilles' heel of bitcoin? I can imagine that thousands of coins (if not more) have already been destroyed this way
@_date: 2013-06-13 23:57:01
My original idea was to provide a bare-bones nearly free service and also provide a premium service at the same time, more options will be added to this bare-bones version before the premium service begins development. The fees will have to increase to compensate for the scale of the network, but in the mean time I don't really mind making next to nothing, as long as I'm converting my dollars to bitcoin I'm happy.
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:16:29

A kijiji/craigslist transaction would be a pretty suitable situation, a price is typically agreed upon before meeting up. Upon the buyers satisfaction with the product the transaction could commence without a need for internet or a smartphone. Send amount control will also come with time.

Anyone can spoof a text, its rather simple, an attacker with knowledge of an account with bitcoins on it could spoof a text with a send command and immediately scoop up your coins to a public key.


That is the ideal solution, I just need to find the time for all these changes, I need to schedule around weekends and evenings. Some serious progress should be made after this weekend. Thanks again! Excellent feedback.

Oh I understand it, it has useful properties no doubt, all of which that can be achieved without its own scammy currency. Decentralized multi-asset exchange is an awesome idea! But attaching the leeching device that is XRP with a weak ass excuse of enforcing 'transaction limitations' yet they hold a majority of the currency and intend to pay for talent with its value. Wake up and smell the bullshit.

No one is forcing you to buy anything, it's all open source.
I do offer transparent printing services for these designs, heck you could even do that yourself but it's pretty expensive to do so. That isn't the whole motivation behind the site, it's fly shit in the pepper. That whole aspect will likely be scraped once the full functionally is added to the site, I just got really excited how they looked once printed out with professional equipment and wanted to share, but that was naive on my part and I agree with your critique. Thanks for checking it out!
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:12:50
According to: 
A transaction will be sent without fees if these conditions are met:
* It is smaller than 10 thousand bytes.
* All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
* Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)
Otherwise, the reference implementation will round up the transaction size to the nearest thousand bytes and then add a fee of 0.0005 BTC per thousand bytes. Users may override the default 0.0005 BTC/kb fee setting, but cannot control transaction fees for each transaction.
How can this be overridden if at all? I'm not so sure that it's possible with my situation.

I look forward to hearing the show when it comes out, I haven't heard of GLDcoin, but Chinacoin has defiantly caught my attention. Once these currencies hit mainstream exchanges (such as in the case of Chinacoin &amp; btc-e) they tend to earn an inflated amount of credibility and it's more than likely exchange operators are offered bribes in alt currencies to add support. This feeds into a pump n dump mentality which reflects badly on all cryptos. I am all for competing cryptos and feel there should be room for innovation, but I feel alot of these really new alts are created purely for pumping n dumping. If you can make money with it all the power to you but it hurts the credibility of the community as a whole and stifles adoption. Maybe I'm wrong but it certainly leaves room for argument that a majority of cryptos are pump n dumps, which might not be the case now but I fear it will eventually get to that point.
