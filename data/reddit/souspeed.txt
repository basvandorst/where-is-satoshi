Thanks for all the work done so far Greg. 
Glad to see you stay focused on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:35:58
Actually it is the other way around.
The cost of mining will move toward the price of bitcoin.
The cost of mining will approach the level where the value of a bitcoin still delivers a small premium in order to keep mining profitable.
The value of a bitcoin is derived from many factors, most importantly the network effect. Without any users there is no value! 
The proof of work (security) derived from mining is only one of those factors.

You will get more orphaned blocks and you will increase the bandwidth requirements leading to less decentralisation.

The reason IB doesn't allow shorting is the risk of a potential short-squeeze when the price of BTC increases significantly.
As a result, ironically, IB does add upward pressure to the BTC price. :)

I'm running bitcoin core on a pine64 plus 500 GB USB harddisk. When the blockchain becomes to big in three, four years, I can swap to a bigger harddisk and copy over the blockchain within a day. 
ROKOS as operating system is all you need, and includes bitcoin core.
This setup has cost me less than 100 USD.

I'm not even sure what you are trying to say?
Price is a function of where supply meets demand.
In Bitcoin supply is known and almost fixed, with a decreasing block reward over time, and as such the price is mainly determined by demand. Now what you need to ask yourself is how does a high fee versus a low fee influence demand for bitcoin. If something is more expensive than before and there are cheaper alternatives, do people want to use it more or less?
@_date: 2016-03-29 05:02:36
What if we increase a fee for using gold? 
Would this increase demand or lower demand for gold and what would do this to the price of gold, even though supply is fixed?
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:30:37
Who would be spamming the bitcoin network to make it look like slow and useless?
Maybe some new competition with their own blockchain in development? 
Guess what there are several with deep pockets who are spending tens of millions on their own blockchain development. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 05:51:31
Your economics are completely wrong. 
The usage of bitcoin is what gives it its main value. Low fees is potentially more people using bitcoin, hence a higher demand and thus a higher price. 
Besides; if bitcoin is too expensive to use, then people will use something else, hence lower demand and thus a lower price.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:39:13
With 25% mining power remaining the difficulty will adjust back to 10 minutes per block after 8 weeks, and then everything is back to normal.
Furthermore; there is no need to include lightning channels in your reasoning for UASF, since it will take a lot longer than 8 weeks before LN will be live on the main chain.

*If someone loots all the toilet paper from the public toilet, is the solution to double the amount of toilet paper stocked each day?*
The reason someone can loot all leftover toilet paper from this new public toilet, is that most of it has already been used by people taking a real dump. 
And the success of this new public toilet, similar to any adoption phase of a new technology, depends on the exponential growth phase, attracting early adopters/majority, which will determine its final success. If these early adopters/majority flock to this new public toilet just to experience shitting themselves, then they will most likely not come back!

If one of your main concerns is decreased decentralization because full nodes requirements do not keep up with the blockchain growth, even at todays' growth rate, then why not focus first on the idea of spv nodes that keep syncing the blockchain until they turn into full nodes?
@_date: 2018-10-13 02:03:21
As always, excellent talk by Andreas about the basics that give value to bitcoin.
Must watch!
@_date: 2016-11-08 11:51:01
Not everyone needs to run a full node. 10000 nodes across the globe should provide sufficient decentralization. 
Once bitcoin becomes heavily adopted, there should be enough universities or businesses that have a vested interest to run a full node. The average user can simply use an spv wallet for their day2day transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-14 11:58:53
Agreed that that the resilience of the network is one of the most important features of bitcoin, and this should be the main priority. 
But please keep in mind that Bitcoin is not on its own. Everyday that passes by without increased utility for bitcoin is an opportunity for competition to deliver something better. And this should not be underestimated.
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:31:41
The average user doesn't trust bitcoin, however they do trust established companies. 
Furthermore; don't forget that there are a lot more companies investigating this new technology and trying to figure out how to get a piece of the pie, then we are aware off. 
You can bet your ass that Apple and Google already have a team assigned. And there will be a lot more established companies looking into this technology the more bitcoin/blockchain advances forward.
It is a lot easier to have existing customers, who already trust your business, trying out something new, then to have them try out bitcoin.
Besides these big companies have the marketing budget, infrastructure, know how, etc., to launch a new product on a global scale. E.g. start a loyalty program to distribute a large chunk off all available coins as a percentage for your spending. This way they tie in millions of potential users from day 1. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 17:41:52
They don't need to manufacture anything, they can basically copy bitcoin if they want. Make sure there are enough users from day 1, and an incentive for miners to join the network. 
Its about capturing the biggest piece of the pie of the potential future blockchain market.
And yes, of course they will make sure that it looks like something new and not a copy of bitcoin.
All these companies will realize at some point in time that this will be a trillion USD market, everybody will want to join in.

If I knew who will become the cryptocurrency/blockchain leader for the next 10-20 years, then I wouldn't be posting here. I would just sit back and wait till I'm rich.
At the moment bitcoin has the first mover advantage, and I'm only pointing out that this should not be taken for granted, but should be carefully nurtured. Or maybe even better, aggressively defended.

There is no network effect yet, bitcoin is still in its infancy.
And ask any average person what they think of bitcoin, and that will show you how much trust there is. None.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:00:42
Bitcoins' blockchain technology is like any other new technology.
It follows an adoption curve, and the first one exploiting this technology and to reach the tipping point/critical mass, will be the most successful. 
This doesn't necessarily have to be bitcoin. 
Blockchain technology is still in its infancy and there is still a long way to go before critical mass.

For some routers you need to first save the settings without the enabled tick box , and then tick the enabled tick box and save once more. Furthermore; please check first via  if your port 8333 is open. At 21.co I believe your node needs to be fully synced before it is recognized.
Your server ip is the internal ip your computer is assigned by your router, depending on the router brand it is something like 192.168.1.xx, see remark from jcoinner.
@_date: 2016-11-05 07:39:09
You can have a node up and running on a Pine64 (30 USD) and rokos OS (free) for less than 100 USD in total, including an external HDD. Just put the pine64 in a desk and let it sync for the first time, it will take a while but you don't need to do anything.
In maybe 4 years time you will need to swap to a new HDD (50 USD) and copy over the existing block/chainstate folders. This will probably take less than a day to catch up. 
There will be even better and faster cheap computers in the coming years, so I don't see the blockchain size as an issue for bitcoin growth / adoption.
Bigger blocks and other scaling solutions are more important.
Furthermore; there is a proposal to create a hybrid bitcoin core wallet, that will start off as an SPV wallet. Meaning you start using the wallet from the get go as an SPV wallet, until the blockchain is fully synced to the network and becomes a full node.  Which is an excellent proposal, if possible.
Fyi., I'm currently running a pine64 full node.
@_date: 2016-11-05 11:55:47
We are currently at 5500 nodes, and 10000 nodes across the world should provide sufficient decentralization. No need for the average user to run a full node.
By the time bitcoin becomes government approved, there will already be so many universities/agencies/companies running a full node, that this will never be an issue.
Besides, why should the average user need to know how blockchain works?
As long as they can use it all is fine.
@_date: 2016-11-05 13:42:02
Yes, credit cards charge up to 3% per transaction compared to 1% for bitpay.
@_date: 2016-11-16 17:24:12
Aha, then its clear. 
Bitcoin is the technology blockchain, so blockchain is impossible to be anything else than bitcoin. No need to worry, bitcoin development can do whatever they want, since there is no possibility for competition, because bitcoin can only be bitcoin.
Thank you so much for making that clear, now I can sleep again.
You do know that for a cryptocurrency/blockchain to be successful, you only need sufficient decentralized miners to secure the network, and sufficient users to give it value. That's all. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 06:19:40

It's simple. If you leave an opportunity out in the open, then you can be sure somebody will come along and try to grab it. Once this has happened you can name the competitor who did and how he did it, but you don't want to have to find out now do you?

@_date: 2016-02-20 22:58:53
Yes, I agree.
Once Core commits to this consensus and adds the block increase to their official roadmap, I will switch my Classic node back to Core. I'm still optimistic and content with the progress and result of the roundtable.
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:10:46
I couldn't agree more, a stable and well protected network is the key feature that sets Bitcoin apart from all the other currencies. You can only mess up once, and then your not the longest running stable crypto anymore! 
Additional layers and on-chain growth will come in due time, once they can be safely implemented.  
Thanks for speaking your mind.

A bcash-node cost is lower since nobody is using it, as you pointed out yourself, ‘fewer transactions’.
The funny thing is that bcash was ’supposedly’ created to handle more transactions, and now they even hardfork to increase the limit even further to 32 mb while nobody is using it.
PS, asicboost is the real reason for bcash existence. (miner monopoly)
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:39:52
Agreed, with all the hassle and politics going on, it is clear that decentralization is more important than ever.
The risk of centralizing the network through bigger blocks, and handing even more power to entities that abuse this power only for their personal gain by keeping the network hostage, is definitely a no go!

If you are really that worried someone might find the paper with your seed, then just be a little bit more creative.

Buy yourself a hardware wallet and memorize the seed.

Just make sure to create a few paper copies of the seed as well and hide these somewhere safe.

Yes, we need a permanent scaling fix.
If we do a hard fork, which is inevitable, then lets solve the issue for once and for all.
Please use a modest growth rate, so it becomes easier over time to add a node to the network.
The yearly technological growth rate is 17,7%, so let's do e.g. 10%.
@_date: 2017-07-06 05:20:30

Segwit + Lightning + constant on-chain growth rate (Luke Jr)
I do not have a twitter account, so I cannot vote/reply.
However; it would be nice if you can add an option like this to your survey. The current survey doesn't look for compromises, but instead creates different camps.
We are all aware that we need on-chain scaling sometime in the future, and any hardfork should introduce a permanent solution, such as the BIP from Luke-jr.
However; this BIP in its current form is to extreme to get consensus, therefore I propose a more modest version.
Remove the optional block-size decrease, no need to cap lower than 1 MB, since this is also not the case today and causes to much resistance for this BIP.
Secondly; use a more modest growth rate, e.g. 10%, keeping the growth rate below 17,7% will make sure that over time it becomes easier to setup a node. Which is exactly what we all want.
And lastly, activate the growth rate sooner e.g. 2020. Two years should be more than sufficient for all nodes to upgrade.
The 10% growth rate will ensure that the network becomes healthier overtime anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-10 09:00:02
Bitcoin is a store of value as well as a currency, although a volatile one.
Over time when bitcoins' total market cap increases this volatility will decrease, similar to a small boot bouncing up and down on the ocean, while an oil tanker stays relatively calm.
