Sadly? You can still cash out *with a profit* as of right now if you really wanted to.

Go grab some, it's really not too late.

It's actually 21 million

We would have much, much bigger things to worry about than any form of currency.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:13:25
If you really want to why not take out half (your initial investment) and then hold the profit?

I can't believe that I had to scroll to the literal bottom of the comments to see this. Thank you.

I got some at $3990 yesterday and saw it briefly hit $3975. Just gotta be quick.

I'd set up a payment channel with my coffee shop.

Email them and let them know that you were forced to use Coinbase. Seriously. The same thing happened to me and then I got approved ~1 hour after sending that email.

It will generate a seed for you - no need to do it yourself.

I would say that you absolutely should but do some research of your own first. Also check out they have some helpful guides/resources.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:28:59
You're good. Your money and wallet are fine. This isn't really about that.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:58:29
All users

Gemini too!

I think I had it &lt; 10GB

Lightning has BOLTs (similar to BIPs) for their specifications  Various implementations are working together to standardize.

Yup, totally fake, better just go ahead and send it to me so I can throw it out for you.
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:34:17
Yeah that's Dorian

If you play around with a vanity address generator you'll quickly realize that creating an address with more than five or six chosen characters would take hours, 8+ would take days. It's still good to be careful, of course, but no need to be too too paranoid.

Bitcoin Cash dosen't have the immutability that Bitcoin has with segwit. It could theoretically be done but not nearly as safely.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:15:35
Samourai wallet does not yet support segwit, though they're working on it.

It took me about 5 days to sync the mainnet on an SSD
edit: using --nolisten during the initial sync seemed to speed things up a bit
