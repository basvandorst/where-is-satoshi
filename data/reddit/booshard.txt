We take no profit or money even for logistics, website, etc. The only overhead is payment processing. I.e. Bitpay, PayPal 2.3% and Stripe. I also cover the wire transfer fee out of pocket
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:00:44
Thanks! I will post photos of our next project with the money you tipped.
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:36:54
I'll do that. We can make it optional but suggest people fill it out. It could be complicated if the donor anonymously sends a significant amount (5k+).

I'm heading home to visit my family for a bit next month. I'm bringing back some laptops for a rural Computer lab. They shall have their internets :-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:44:22
Big thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:18:58
Appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:09:49
Thanks. Actually it was Reddit who suggested I add bitcoin donations. So thanks back to you!
@_date: 2014-12-05 05:30:12
p.s. I'm still a bit of a bitcoin, reddit and imgur noob. So I appreciate your candid feedback (the good and the ugly..)
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:11:14
We don't impose western culture, religion, food, etc. That's not why we are here. But we do provide nutrient education. Instead of eating too much rice, we encourage whole grain that they already grow in their gardens. Buckwheat, millet, corn, etc. I'll check out the link tonight, Thanks a lot!

@_date: 2014-11-20 02:29:38
Cheers. I'm going to start sifting through that site to learn more. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:45:45
Would love to know. For my next project I will have another r/bitcoin sign made from the kids.
Should I watermark? Any ideas? 
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:08:58
We engage the community and local altruistic organizations to carry out our work. I focus on guiding the ship, advising local organizations, approving new projects and fundraising.
I am a rotarian though. So I fund many Education and Healthcare projects for the Rotary and Rotaract clubs across Nepal. My organization takes no profit and gives no salaries. 
I'm a former button pusher for an investment bank who gave it all up for the kids. I'm happy to answer any of your questions. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:47:17
We will. And I'll make sure everyone knows exactly how these tips are being used.  Thanks 
@_date: 2014-12-05 15:37:37
Cheers Liz! Appreciate any feedback you have to make the process smoother for the donors. Please pm me!
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:26:14
Cheers. Drop me a line with any other info you find. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:57:58
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:44:48
Thanks! And appreciate the suggestion. I'll take care of it on the site tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:49:21
I chose replying to all the PMs over sleep after all. ;) It was a pleasure to share with everyone here. Can't wait to see everyone's comments when they see what more than 30 dollars can do out here! 
I'm still coming up on the bitcoin learning curve but I'll also update this subreddit as I see bitcoin expand out here also. Hopefully soon too!
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:49:54
I'll follow them and keep up to date. Appreciate the link. Thanks for donation tip!
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:38:17
Tron1977, thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-05 14:26:35
GOD DAMN IT REDDIT I LOVE YOU!!!
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:48:52
Cool. One buddy has a paragliding company. He gets exposure to people from all countries and prefers to keep his cash pile in USD to protect against the nepali rupee volatility. Bitcoin sounds like the better, easier and more liquid answer :-)
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:58:22
I will be visiting home next week. If anyone is in the midwest and would like to meet / hear about Nepal / brainstorm ideas on how to improve my work / share your compliments and complaints.... send me a PM. I'll be near to Chicago. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:33:04
You're right. To prevent reuse of my photos for illegitimate purpose, I'll add in my username with the next r/bitcoin shout out. Thanks! Edit: and yes, tipping is awesome!
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:08:02
Hey, Thanks a lot! I've seen very little presence of bitcoin here. A couple local buddies have tourist business here. I'm going to help them get hooked up once I finish getting my head around it.
Atm, I'm still learning. Bitpay helps automate the process for me and I pay out of my pocket for the wire transfer from our US account.
Ideally, I convince a local currency dealer to get hooked up so I can get the money locally. What do you think?
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:52:16
Thank you
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:54:16
Thanks !  Im quite excited to have my next project entirely funded by this thread. A rural scholarship costs 60-110 usd per YEAR! We've already received enough from this thread to keep a kid in school for a year thanks to r/bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:20:21
Yeah, you're probably right. But I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts. It's awesome to share the cause with all of you. I got mad love for all yall. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:44:06
I'm a bitcoin noob. I'll get it added to the website tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2014-12-07 14:50:19
Appreciate the tip. Thanks a lot! More to come.
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:28:31
I've updated the site with the EIN on the donate page and footer. For your record it is 46-0989661. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:30:16
Yeah, no shit. Amazing!! Thanks for your support and followup. 
I need to keep all of you in the loop on the projects done with these funds. What's the best way? Replying to this thread won't notify all the donors. Most enjoy their anonymity so email distribution is not possible. My only option is to post new threads and also encourage users to follow us on fb if possible. Thoughts?
edit: yes.. I'm a reddit noob. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:37:47
Thank you. Next year I'll be starting some income generation programs for the parents of the children we help. The ultimate graduation for me would be for them to get off my scholarship and continue their education under their families own Financials.
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:18:41
Thanks yo
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:27:58
Thanks. You all are awesome! My next projectS I'll make entirely funded from this thread. Pictures to come in a week or two! 
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:18:10
Agreed! Cheers!
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:45:14
Every bit counts. Appreciate the thought! 
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:40:50
Updated the word project to the plural form for you ... ;-) 
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:57:04
Any specific questions I'm happy to answer. I'm am open book 
@_date: 2014-12-08 01:17:39
A shout out to the reddit community!
@_date: 2014-12-06 03:32:16
Well, this thread ended with $2000 USD in Bitcoin donations! I can't thank you all enough. These funds are enough to keep ~30 children in school for an entire year. I do not want to pollute this subbreddit with fundraisers and charity posts but it is a pleasure to show the Reddit community exactly what they helped accomplish :-) Photos and updates to come. Thanks to you all. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 03:02:43
Nope. It's def not. Do you think most people would prefer anonymous donations? It's nice to have names/email so I can send donation confirmation letters because they are tax deductible in the states.
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:45:51
I started the Foundation because I couldn't find a transparent and accountable charity I could volunteer for. If anything I do smells fishy, just tell me and I'll explain. Thanks for the donation :-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:43:39
And Namaste back to you! 
@_date: 2014-12-05 14:49:48
Grateful to, thanks joojo!
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:34:55
That's my pleasure. I'm in this for the kids but I also get a hell of a kick from helping donors understand how little it takes to help
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:19:41
Many thanks :-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:46:35
Dhanyabaad !  (Thanks!)
