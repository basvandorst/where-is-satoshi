I am one of those who believe in the Bitcoin concept but still driven by the profits and investment. 
My stake is &lt;1000 £ - so no fear of losing out as I can afford it if I lose it. So no FUD or no FOMO either..... enjoying the ride. 
By the way Cliff High says that his linguistic predictions indicate around 60K for the Bitcoin by end 2018 :) ...
Happy bitcoining everyone, peace.

Guess what Mr Buffett said as golden words...
(((Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.)))
His best investments are those which he bought for cheap, the companies did well and he held for long time generating compound interests.
There is no rocket science here guys. If we believe in bitcoin and distributed ledger, just hold and don't panic with these rides. These only add to the fun.
If you are in a hurry to get some profits, I stress, LEARN trading. LEARN / Study and Master the trading. Only then get into it otherwise you are fighting against bots and your chances are slim.
For rest of us, happy HODLING... (take profits occasionally though ;) )

@_date: 2018-03-26 10:21:28
Those who bought at ATH are lesser in proportion than those who have been accumulating from 1K, 2K, 3K and so on. Hence if they sell at 8K it is still profits.
On the positive note, a dip down to 7800 is very possible but if it acts as a pivot and price jumps back, this will be a very positive sign for a bull run. Call it rubbish but this will be an end of a correction (wave 2) and start of the wave 3 in the life of the BTC.

Good option... ��
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:41:11
[Not a financial advice but just my research based on few TA specialists]
If it pivots up from just under 8K (7.8k most probably) with a clear green candles and confirmation, this might be the last best chance to buy. It is the start of wave 3 which is normally the longest and never the shortest of the 5.
It is just prediction as many others. no need to get agitated, just do your own research and make your own decisions.
TA is only good when markets are left to do what they want to do, in the case of BTC, we all know that there is too much FUD and influences hence TA is lesser relevant. 
But I will be buying more at 7.8 Pivot if it happens. Thoughts welcome...

@_date: 2018-03-18 10:06:47
Get ready for another dip, after achieving 50k in 2018
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:41:34
Your explanation makes sense but I have a question.
What about the pressure on common people (due to FOMO) to buy in. We are told that there are 1 million people joining every 12 hours and they are all prospective buyers. Add on top that the technology is developing and we are seeing adoption, improvements and developments in the blockchain industry. 
Sooner or later it has to burst. The top lid can't keep it in. It might take a few weeks or perhaps month but this steam is cooking and there is only one way in the long term - that is UP.
I respect the fact that corrections and retracements will also happen which is a good thing I believe. So 20K to 9K is one decent correction and I think it is good for BTC in the long run. 
Any views welcome.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:16:54

This is why just HODLING is not a good advice always. Although I know many newbies advocate HODLING.
The best thing is to take a slice of your profits out while still leaving some if you believe in the project. If you don't believe in the project and it is a pump and dump kind of coin then cash out and take your profits.
(not financial advice mate, just my personal experiences - good luck)

Don't be a glory-hunter, you never know when BTC is taken over by some other capable coin.
If I have  50 bucks to spend with no fear of loss, I will go for big multiplier potential. Many small caps have better odds than BTC. Take it or leave it but this is the reality. it is low-risk-low-reward vs big-risk-big reward.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:42:55
I tend to agree but then sometimes we want to gain profits as well hence make the things worse for ourselves.

@_date: 2018-03-29 18:15:16
1) Don't sell unless you need money for more important and urgent matters.
2) Buy more at dips only if you have faith in the botcoin, can afford to lose the investment and it is a part of your overall investment or trading strategy.
3) Avoid this sub reddit for advice on crypto (at least nowadays)

Because I invested low to moderate amounts and they are not critical to me, the big margins are the key for me. I don't mind if I lose everything but I will really be upset if I miss some big multipliers.
Hence I am playing big risk / big reward game with mostly altcoins (I know people won't like me here on this sub-reddit as I am not in BTC).

Do not ignore Fibonacci. It is a reality. 
I have seen price actions and pivots (loads of them) which hit the algo (algorithms and retracements) numbers very closely. SO yes, 6832 is not the same as 7000 in the world of TA and algos. 
If you want to know more (specifically related to cryptos), I suggest you watch "trading devil" on youtube. He is a legend and will convince you that algo numbers exist.

I hope someone might help me here related to UK Capital Gain tax.
On Bitcoin, we have to class it as capital gains tax but then there is a tax free amount of £11,300 each year.

My 7 hard-earned tips for newbies in the crypto space (from 3 months of experience)
1) resist FOMO and only buy at the crash - even if it means you have to wait for weeks (what goes up must come down so wait patiently)
2) the small cap coins with small price tag have bigger risk but bigger multiplier as well. If you want stability and low risk, go for top 5 inc. Bitcoin, if you want multipliers and big rewards, go and hunt for good $0.001 and $0.01 coins (be careful though as they carry bigger risk)
3) Don't just HODL - do take some profits when you can. HODL what you truly believe in. A bit of TA and swing analysis don't hurt. Mix the two together and diversify your investment strategy.
4) Euphoria and all-time-highs are not to sit and watch. Stick to your strategy, know what profits you need to take and act. BEFORE it comes down again
5) Don't disrupt your life. Know how much time you are going to give to crypto everyday.
6) don't invest an amount which if it halves, takes your sleep away. Invest carefully. Small investments of $10 and $20 are fine to start with. No shame in it. In fact, small investments are best FOMO-KILLERS.
7) &gt;95% advice in crypto space is just people's opinion. Try to find and subscribe to those 5% who know this space much better than others.

@_date: 2018-03-19 14:17:25
I am the same, just a bit more biased towards a dip...
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:22:08
I think 8.5K is a decent support, otherwise it would have easily slipped to test &lt;8K this morning. It is currently touching around 9K.
Having said that, don't forget that we are still in the bear run so things are generally bearish. But I personally feel that this bear market is getting weaker and weaker and we may start seeing the real signs of bulls in the next few weeks. 
The trouble is that this market is so emotional and based on so much of FUD and people's perception of it. Hence all TA and educated guesses are just guesses only. You have to wait and watch and find clues by reading/listening to crypto-gurus.
good luck.

Most of the ALTs are tightly linked to the big daddy's movement (Bitcoin). 
What is the point to TA the smaller coins if they will more or less take the same swings as BTC?
Conclusions (happy to be corrected)
1) Market of ALTS is highly dependent on computer trading while the volumes are low like nowadays. It is difficult to fight with bots on ALGOs.
2) BTC chart is the key and that is mostly run by the bots as well. The only ray of hope is NEW PEOPLE, NEW MONEY and increase in interest in BTC which will supress the bot trading.
3) You will mostly lose against the bots in bear markets.
Happy bitcoining.... (good and constructive criticism welcome)

I am surprised that you said that it started in the garage. Just Google Fibonacci and see how widespread its use is. It is surprisingly applicable and valid in trading and stocks.

I understand what you are trying to say but if you look for true facts, there is no such thing as true fact. It is our consciousness, awareness and beliefs which make it a fact in our eyes. The other person has the same fact differently understood in his eyes.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:12:58
what was that ? :(
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:30:16
I think we will close Monday at +11K today, what do you think?
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:03:08
+1 (although it is a pump ) ----- only to be dumped.
Something needs to be energetic in this RED sunday evening ;)
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:19:36
Don't give them your money to play with then... no offence mate just saying in light mode... we have chosen to play this risky game...
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:35:28
cheers. I was doing some research on bots and someone with 15 years experience in trading said that in any market do expect up to 60% of bot trading as a given.
this means that trading is big in markets. Hodlers normally have a chance when they are patient. The moment they dip into swing and day trading with little knowledge, they are more likely to get burned.
Just a tip for relatively new-comers. Hope it helps.
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:39:40
Good Morning from Europe, this fine Saturday morning...
Anyone who agrees that we have started the wave 3 of Elliot wave and our next target should be 11.5K ? (stiff resistance at 9K to break)
Or perhaps a correction to 7.8K then up for 11.5K to complete wave 3?
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:33:45
I can understand your point but for gains (for all inc. holders and traders), would it not be better that traders incline towards more hodling?
The way I see it (and sorry if I am wrong) is that traders are messing the whole thing up :) because of their small gains. Please correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:13:52
You think g20 can make that much difference? I doubt it mate. I think the bear pressure is to much and general interest has dropped...
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:00:50
some pump happening now guys,, touching 8900 with some high green candles on bitfinex,.,, hope this is a genuine organic pump :))))
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:05:40
me too,,,,, charts saying, it will be a dump tomorrow ;)
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:44:39
I like the source of the prediction :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:16:19
what happened?
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:27:17
[not financial advice] but hold tight, this is wave 4 of elliot wave, can go up to 9.5K at which point it will reverse back and wave 5 (final wave) can go up to 13 K. This is establishing as a strong pattern. 
If you don't trust me, watch trading devil on youtube, he is a master in reading charts.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:44:37
You are right, in stable markets, trends work better. With volatile markets like BTC, this is extremely difficult to gauge and time the market.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:17:25
the dip is tomorrow mate, I think you are alright.... watch out for anything between 6.5K and 6.9K (the charts say which we all love :)
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:58:50
Yes, I guess you are right.... I need to get my basics right ;) ..... Bitcoin was too fast for me to get into the world of buying and selling. I need a catch up with the basics. Cheers mate...
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:38:52
If we summarise this price movement, am I right in saying that it is basically a fight between HODLERS and TRADERS?
Hodlers will not sell and their buy orders will contribute relatively more. Traders will sell at profit and their buy orders will cancel out mostly with their sell offs....
So in essence, we need more buyers which are HODLERS?
Tell me if I am missing something or is there a bigger picture. I am not saying one is better than other, I am just trying to understanding the GREENS and REDs in relation to the Bitcoin price. Cheers,....
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:03:01
Tip - think about it.
Don't get emotional and greedy with profits. Know what percentage you are going to take home as profits and sell at that point. Now if it goes even higher, doesn't matter. Don't get emotional about it. you have already made your profit.
Decision and discipline is the key.
Hope it helps.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:50:56
at moment, buying is a bold decision mate :) - we are all watching the movie ----- the falling knife ----- :)
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:54:47
I will buy the whole bitcoin :)  - and then sell it for 64K before December, LOL
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:15:42
The pressure and momentum of buying (buy wall) is greater than the downward trend of selling (sell wall)..... showing bullish movement and price jump.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:17:03
we need to be at 13.8K by end feb to hit the CLIFF HIGH's projected 64K+ by end of 2018 (possibly 100K) :) :) :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:54:06
I bought this ticket for circa $1000 - cant complain, enjoying the ride. Though disagree with your second part, Bitcoin might be the king, might be the kingmaker, some other alties are going to surprise in the future.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:19:04
source of the news/prediction is always important :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:04:10
First comment :) is it ?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:27:30
but 3/4 of 2018 is still ahead ... :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:26:16
what was that :/ ?
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:08:21
not today but many people are saying it will dip to around 6500 in the next week.
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:11:27
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:08:37
some pumping guys, crossing 9K now ..... hold tight....
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:30:38
BTC is not out of the bear movement at the moment. Hard fact but true. 6K to 8.2K does not mean that we are in the bull.
Real bull will be if we break 10K for a couple of days consecutive (ish)... 
Just my two pence. Play carefully, it may go down and test 5K/6K again.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:06:12
this is bold ..... good luck mate.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:30:11
Always a correction or reversal after 5th wave,  hence will dip down. 
If at that point it is still bull run then a new 5 wave pattern starts and it keeps going up after a small dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:47:24
if money is not urgent or important for any other matters in your life or others life, then wait.... and don't sell in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:49:51
[Quick Poll] A quick survey to see how much investment do we have in BTC, for readers of this subreddit.
I will give my response after first response by someone else (if we get it). 
Choose 1 of the following as of today:
A) Zero investment in BTC
B) Less than $300 invested in BTC
C) Between $300 to $1000 invested in BTC
D) Between $1000 to $3000 invested in BTC
E) Over $3000 invested in BTC
There is no hidden agenda here, it will be good to gauge the profile of the readers here around BTC. There is no shame if you fall in category A or E, it is all relative.
Let's see how many can be bold and open?
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:54:29
good luck mate....
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:50:41
See..... 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:05:19
high candles, reaching 9K :) .... 
 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:26:25
just went past 10k, big sells at 10k ------ but overall bull momentum will go through it, i think tonight it will finish above 10K.... let's see

Low volume mate, let's be realistic. Might do sideways most of the day.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:25:08
100 percent go up mate. 
Just zoom out the chart.  ....
Money always travel from impatient hands to patient hands.

How about landing on moon with a tractor ?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:25:47
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:22:06
So are you saying that when bitcoin drops out crashes, is dominance increases?
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:31:48
good point..
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:28:49
30 minute candle//// LOL //// 
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:10:39
3% remaining on mine :) - we probably bought around the same time ish...
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:33:08
I am with you generally but crypto and bitcoin are part logic, part nuts :)
The fun is in the language of the common people and understanding the sentiment of the people who are traders or normal investors. It is a great mix of people here and whenever you are feeling down due to bitcoin, come and spend some time here, you will be kept entertained :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:50:15
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:21:53
clever world mate, it is the survival of the fittest. Praise them for their skills. They didn't threatened someone to buy at ATH :)
It is the people's own mistake. 
(I also made that mistake to buy high to some degree but I don't blame anyone else for that. i take it on the chin, learn from it and move on)
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:42:36
If you need money, break even and sell some or all 
If you believe and don't need money urgently, don't waste you four months for nothing.... So hodl.
Your call...
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:00:05
So being so bossy.
The same bots who buy also sell as well. Now think hard on this.
Bitcoin can jump big numbers if new volume enters with passion.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:26:14
7.7 K - this is a proper pump now....
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:38:49
Depends which TA experts you listen to.
A good TA expert will never say that he/she is 100% on anything. It is a game of probabilities and managing risk. As long as you are significantly more than 50% correct, you are classed as decent enough TA expert as you should be practically profitable.
If you are close to 80 to 90% correct most of the time, this is great and we should all try to listen to that person. Marius Landman is one such expert who in these circumstances cleraly said that it will not go below 6.5K and the only way is UP now. Let's see if he is correct or not over the next few weeks.
100 % correct TA never exists. It is just not possible. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:41:09
8690 and falling :(
Any guesses folks for the bounce?
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:52:49
when volatility reduces and gains are like 2% and 3% .... 5 to 10 years old and more....
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:36:14
I wish I am wrong but always keep the possibilities in mind mate. What goes up comes down.
Parabola's don't happen every day. They are rare. 70 percent of the time, markets are in correction. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:46:28
You don't know what I am doing so stop making guesses.
By zooming out, you realize that peaks and troughs are normal part of this game irrespective of which asset. Hence one doesn't feel anxious when BTC drops by 200 pounds. It is just normal.
I am not predicting the future, I know the future. BTC will be over 100,000 in a few years, so get in and stop resisting ��
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:47:01
I am contemplating the famous saying "be greedy when there is fear in the market" ....
So simple yet so unnatural to act upon...
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:49:16
thanks mate. definitely holding me too. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:24:32
well if it is cryptos, tesla is no good, it has to be a lambo. Green apple colour for me :)
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:04:28
in your dreams mate, it is already 9 years old and selling for thousands....
what is stopping it to live another 9 years?

Is he staring to the charts or the moon?
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:01:27
First comment?
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:36:58
9k is thinking he used to be 19k, so he feels devalued.... We just need to encourage him ��
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:40:24
it is very common that all time high shorts are followed by whales just crushing the trend. This weekend can be a surprise.
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:34:35
Agreed, lol (law of attraction)
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:58:48
I am not talking about past performance. I am saying zoom out and then it will be easier to trust the future.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:30:31
perhaps both :)
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:20:39
Markets work in cycles. Period.
Don't lose your faith if the correction now takes us back to  mid to late 7k as extreme correction to the recent run from 6.5k. 
If that happens and it pivots from there, it will be a good buy opportunity for traders.
For the rest of hodlers like me, anytime is a good time to buy ��
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:55:53
there are only so many successful crypto money makers.... they are all in already...
Plus they know that blood is not enough, they are waiting for more blood...
The negative sentiment and nay-sayers will always buy high and sell low and then sit outside moaning about the scams. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:57:33
and I did exactly opposite (FOMOed) - saw the 6700 and jumped in with a little amount :( now looks like the overall sentiment is bearish and it might go down further.....
human psychology is powerful, we go with emotions and that is exactly what we shouldn't be doing in trades and markets. thanks for a good reminder for all.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:00:52
My hands are itching to throw more money in but I am resisting.... because some people think it will go to 5K... I doubt it, I think this is the bottom.
Wish someone could confirm logically?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:48:58
Bitcoin won't go to 1000.
Yes you are right that generally BTC is the daddy king and all ALTs typically follow the trend.
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:14:44
me too.. we will go to the moon together.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:57:21
Nice, 
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:13:43
phooh.... that was like a PHD in charts... good stuff but not for a lazy Sunday afternoon, too much to take in. It will be what it will be :))
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:00:52
We always said that we will double test the 6K support which we never did. I think we went around 6.45 and bounced back. So let's see.
I am not seeing ALTs going down with the same pace as they used to though. Interesting. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:23:33
3 times rejected on 30 minute chart - 9K is proving to be difficult. I am still of opinion that not enough momentum to break the bear trend fully. Although we are trying..
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:19:57
See how resistance becomes support, doesn't matter which market, the rules are generally the same.
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:10:09
This has been proven wrong recently. Don't know about the future but for time being, ALTS have moved up much quicker than BTC. 
I am down 30% on my BTC portfolio and only 6% on my ALTS - all bought at roughly same time.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:19:27
won't last long my friend, keep watching.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:03:11
Surprising that this time altcoins are pumping without bitcoin increasing proportionately or significantly.
Any thoughts on that? 
BTC dominance slightly reducing as well...
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:44:57
2 months max but likely to be within a month
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:01:32
why so confident?
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:25:03
According to some analysts (don't ask me who), 6550 is the bottom folks. It is not going below that number. Solid platform is forming around this number.
Take it or leave it. You have been told :)
All predictions are out-of-backside so make your own decisions :)
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:31:38
valid point.
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:09:44
Everyone watching space to break the critical resistance level, 9.2k...... if it breaks above, it is positive momentum continuing which is a good news
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:12:14
I am a HODLer and optimistic on long term but let's face it, the bear trend continues. No need to fool ourselves around with small ups and downs.
I keep my stance that we need more lava building, more adoption, more development, more pressure from people and more people waiting on sidelines to enter.....
So far that pressure is not big enough to break through.
But the question is that will that pressure be big enough to be sustained and take us to all-time-highs again in 2018?
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:49:35
the bottom was 6.5k, it will not happen again... it is only going to go up now. this is what Marius said.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:51:41
great feedback. do you still have faith and belief in bitcoin and cryptos in general?
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:34:12
Agreed, my view is that after this correction, wave 3 will commence which for sure is the most productive for trading generally. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:58:53
LOL, what a response to Indian FUD, Tim Draper said that Bitcoin should be the national currency of India (not Rupee).... 
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:15:10
Important point reaching around 7.6K. We need to break it, and stay around 8K consistently to come out of this short term bear trend.
If we go down from here, it is not a good news unfortunately folks...
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:03:28
Think win-win.
You get the tech. I will keep the money :) Let it grow. By the way Mcafee tweeted and increased his prediction from 1 million to 3 million per BTC by 2020 :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:27:58
It is not pump and Dump of a selected few mate. Most of them are up and showing positive growth like a start of the bull run. It is unusual in my short experience because I have always seen them linked to BTC closely
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:18:02
Because there is a lag sometimes and other people have commented literally in the time between you writing and submitting your response.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:59:43
exactly, and you know what, every single successful crypto money-maker I have listened to, they are saying that best buys come when there is blood in the street.
They call it accumulation phase.
And still what do most of the people do, buy when euphoria is high :) but I guess this is a zero-sum game, someone has to lose to make other win. 
They key is study and skill.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:51:02
Great feedback. but here is the key question. you need to have believe in the tech/asset behind.... do you have that belief in bitcoin or cryptos in general?
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:11:28
For those who rate fib retracements, 5500 to 6000 is 78.6% retracement and very possible here. 
Anything below that will mean the next level which I don't want to mention because I know I will be shot for that. :)
