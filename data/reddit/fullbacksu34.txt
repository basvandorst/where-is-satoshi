Nope, nothing like that, just a group of regular business people

Yes, there are 6 of us and each and every one of us has some kind of business, for example I have real estate firm and my sister owns couple restaurants and motels, two of my friends have strong IT firms, we have decided to buy some Bitcoins while price is lowish... if you know someone who can sell them to us we can depending on amount go about 5% over price.

Bitcoins, we would pay them all in 500€ bills... we have already purchased 250 BItcoins and paid in cash as well.

Exchanges don't trade that many Bitcoins and even these that do they have sky high fees... most of them want you to deposit money on their bank account days before they are to transfer you Bitcoins. not to mention it's really tricky to send that amount of money to some random account especially in EU, I have had problems for only 50 000€ before, they almost closed my account...

I will give you my bank account and then you try to get it from exchange witout IRS banning account or overpaying too much... Besides it takes ages to trade over exchange.

Anywhere from 15 to 500, it's not only me but I have friends that would also like to invest in Bitcoin.

we have to notify bank at least 5 days before we come to raise money from bank... if you sell Bitcoin for cash and you want to save money on bank your client has to give you scan of his ID card and signature in order for bank to believe you that you haven't stole any money

I can't find anyone from LocalBitcoins who would sell that many Bitcoins, I'm planning to buy 120 tomorrow
