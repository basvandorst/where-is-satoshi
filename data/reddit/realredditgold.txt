If you think about Bitcoin as a finite resource which has been discovered by only a small percentage of the planet, you don't need much of a crystal ball or much of an investment in it to see a pretty special return. 
It's easy to calculate how much has been produced and how much is left to be produced. Even now we are at around 17m bitcoins of a total of 21m ever, so devaluation through future mining is a limited concern. 
The real driver is the user base - if that expands, the market value of each coin has to expand as well, even if it experiences extreme volatility day-day. It has by far the best brand name recognition of any coin, and that is why it will accelerate in value faster than Ether or Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash or whatever. Once it reaches critical mass (as defined by Karel Cool, look up his work on CM) there is unlikely to be a reversion to zero, even if there are technical issues that need to be solved along the way like the recent size of the blockchain.
I am up 1200% so far in less than 2 years, and even if it bumps and grinds I will just hold it. At that rate it genuinely has the chance to outstrip any other asset I hold, including Berkshire Hathaway, and thus form a significant part of my long term wealth. 
If I am wrong and it does fail, well, I only bought a few BTC, so no biggie. Can always buy pizza... But in my opinion it is an asymmetric asset - small investment, limited downside, stored value, potentially enormous upside.
