That's why I love the "view all" page at CoinMarketCap, because it puts the ups and downs into a bit of perspective (% change over 1h, 24h, 7d)
Are there any other websites that take that even further?

One of the problems being in a stuck position is that you can't use those funds to enjoy the ups elsewhere in the market.
Hold or take a loss are your only plays.

You probably do, but you should calculate what your average purchase is so that you have a good sense of where you're really at. Buying on a regular basis has surely worked out great for you since then, good for you.

You're absolutely right that it shouldn't be used as the main savings vehicle for the average person. 
But if you reconsider for a second what savings really mean, and recognize that short-term saving and long-term saving are different animals, then the picture looks different. 
If a nuke hits anywhere tomorrow, people will be stepping on each other to move as much of their assets into currency as possible. And not just "cold hard cash" or "I need silver to barter with" but just as a temporary safe haven while the markets go through wild swings. Get out high, get back in low. 
Normal day to day, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a wealthy person who doesn't keep a serious chunk of their assets in cash. I mean it's called liquidity for a reason! 
If you have to sell one of your houses to buy dinner, you're doing something wrong! :) 
Currency may not be the best asset class for growth, but it sure does have utility beyond it's growth potential.
