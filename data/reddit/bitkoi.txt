This urge people have to store incredibly sensitive data with a fingerprint acting as a pass-key is so naive. I cant think of anything less secure than a fingerprint. We don't live in an age where fingerprints are guarded secrets. The first rule of secure passwords is to not write it down anywhere, i cant think of one object that I use that my fingerprints aren't plastered all over it. convenient? yes, secure? hell no. I might like to use it for my username, that I could see, but a password? no way.

  Well, if they desired control of this "dangerous currency" and had the processing power for a 51% attack, then hypothetically they could. But I still find this highly unlikely, bitcoin isn't important enough yet. I of course see it as revolutionary and game changing, but with the minute percentage of money laundering and drug purchases done with bitcoin vs USD i think its not nearly as much as a priority as we might think. If anything they have some sort of database for collecting public keys and figuring out who created/uses that address. Maybe in conjunction with a strict monitoring of the blockchain.

well, they could be counterfeited but it would take immense (like impossible amounts) of processing power and a expert level of code/ understanding of the bitcoin protocol, but the blockchain would likely correct this in time. And all it would really allow is double-spending of previously owned bitcoin.

Fuck that. Ideas like this are for people who don't believe in bitcoin's core ideals. how about we protect ourselves and not allow another opportunity for fractional reserve banking. I'm not a huge fan of inflation Kthanks.

Fair point, but there were dozens of posts similar to yours and opposing yours flooding the first ten pages yesterday. Me and most likely others went on a downvote slaughter of all china related news yesterday. It was more than covered in one thread. It would be nicer in the future if when important news came we made one thread and posted both negative and positive opinions about what happened. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:29:34
thanks, I'm glad a discussion started, I've been studying the white paper today and the more I read, the more elegant bitcoin seems.

oh so you think good sir, but I was homeschooled, then went to a private school that took pride in their self sufficient nature. The FDA is irrelevant to me because I eat out of dumpsters.

It actually made me start browsing too. As a graphic designer It is hilarious how shoddy it was. That made it effective somehow.

There are plenty of reasons that people would want non reversible transactions, for example I'm a pretty prominent man in Nigeria and it's proving quite difficult to move my massive wealth from my home country and if the money I need in USD from private lenders for the transaction fees gets reversed I could be killed for treason and trying to move my money. Not to mention not being able to move my money, Bitcoin has solved this issue for me.

who would want to trade BTC for paper?

No. Simply no. we dont live in a society that has been trained to effectively keep biometric information secret. It has been proven to be not very secure. On another debatably more important note bitcoin users enjoy bitcoin because it is not tied to our identity on a blockchain level. Sure most of us arent sketchy and dont mind providing an ID and the such, but making the recording of my biometric information tied directly to my private key makes even me feel like bitcoin would not be the currency for me. All in all when people feel the need to "just change one thing about bitcoin" they are likely looking for a really low transaction fee version of banking. I dont need a cheap bank. I like bitcoin, at the cost of a bit more caution and more focus on security, we have a peer to peer payment system. Bitcoin is already ideal for me. The best protocol for security is to store bitcoin securely.

not to the supporters of bitcoin. Bitcoin was not designed as a new stock market, government has SERIOUSLY mishandled (maliciously) our currency to the point that bitcoin was offered as a deflationary alternative to our decaying USD. Do you know what bitcoin really needs? governments to leave it the FUCK ALONE.

psh, their inability to do anything in a competent manner makes me put this concern low on my radar. They take advantage of technology we make, can't remember the last time they invented anything effective.

I personally think an intermediary to bitcoin is poison. any possibility of introducing fractional reserve banking to bitcoin is hell.

Soo soo wrong. Citizenship is important. If we offer services to people we need to ensure that every service that is being used is being used by a taxpayer. e.g It’s theft if a cop protects a non-citizen.
EDIT: I'm all for free borders, if the government doesn't offer any services to their populace.

Its not, people jump around. Bitcoin is one of those things that everyone likes to endorse. People put it on a huge pedestal and then eagerly look for a negative. Dumb people explaining it to dumb people and grab one headline and run with it e.g 
* "PEOPEL R BUYING CARS WITH INTERNETS LULZ" 
* "CHINA BANS BITCOIN" 
* "OMG OMG PEOPEL HACKZORED THE BITCOIN CUZ PEOPLE LOST THEIRS"

Because me and other users feel that bitcoin escrow still violates the key ideals of bitcoin. People need to realize that transactions being irreversable is desirable. The only problem with that is the fact that credit cards etc. are wayy too easy to reverse. The problem is on the credit end, not on bitcoin's.

set it all up offline, and before you switch to online do some simple encryption yourself i.e cypher or just letter/number shifting in a memorable pattern. then hop online and print (only if internet access is required to print) keep in mind that printers can record previously printed info. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:26:19
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:32:12
that could be done on top of bitcoin, on a vendor level for sure. I thought people were discussing escrow being built into EVERY bitcoin transaction. that would be unsettling as it gets closer to centralization.
