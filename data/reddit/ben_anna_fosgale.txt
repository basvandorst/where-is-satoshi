It's not the size that's the problem, it's the bitrate.  A new format is required because a new codec is required.  H.264/AVC just isn't good enough for 4K.  The PS4 couldn't even handle the read/write speeds required for that.  So unless Sony snuck an H.265/HEVC decoder into the PS4 and didn't tell anyone, any 4K Bluray support on the PS4 would have to be done by software decoding.  And the PS4's hardware might be beefy enough to handle that, so it's possible it could support the new format.  But that's only if they avoid making any changes to the laser tech required to read the discs.

If posts like that were welcomed here, it'd get annoying fast.  You should have posted to Although the only posts that *are* welcomed here are fluff news articles and links to people saying positive things about bitcoin (along with annoying memes and price posts).  This is basically the default sub of bitcoin, so complaining about its content is like complaining that posts on aren't funny.  is at least more informative.

I don't blame you.  The sidebar (and this sub in general) is a mess.  Just pointing out the lesser known subs that are easier to get into.  can be a bit of a "yacht club" as well, since mining bitcoin is no longer feasible for beginners.

I stand corrected, I guess.  But if you were going to fake emails to back up your false claims, shouldn't the emails, I don't know, *actually back them up*?
Anyway, that Forbes article pretty much confirms that the emails are real but OP is delusional:  "While we're keen to actively engage with Wallet users to help inform and shape the product, there's no change to our position: we have no current plans regarding Bitcoin."  Mystery solved.  We can all go home now.

If I run a legitimate business but one of my employees sells drugs on the side, am I funding an illegal operation just because I pay him wages?  Why should I be concerned with what he does as long as it's not on company property?  Do the feds have the right to seize the company car just because it was in his possession?
Can bitcoin even be considered "funding" without recognizing it as a legal currency?

Not quite.  Bluray was far superior to HD-DVD because it had almost double the max bitrate and storage capacity of HD-DVD, but it has no place in the future.  It can't handle 4K at all, and it doesn't even support 1080p at framerates above 30.  (Most films are still filmed at 24 fps, but the new Hobbit films are 48 fps.)  So those features will require a new format.  Sony's supposedly working on it now, and there probably won't be a new format war, and of course it'll be backwards compatible and they'll just end up calling it something like "4K BluRay", but it'll still be a new format, and you'll need to go out and buy new hardware to play it.

Nobody thinks you're lying.  We think you've deluded yourself into thinking you're important because some upper level Google employees responded to your emails with noncommittal corporate speak that *at best* indicates that they're taking Bitcoin seriously and have a legitimate interest in exploring possible ways to incorporate it into Google Payments and are open to suggestions from their userbase, which *is* significant and noteworthy, but you're trying to sell that to us as if you have confirmation that a solid plan in the works and that you're a part of it.

What are the latest estimates for that?  I remember hearing ~0.3 BTC per GOXBTC a while back.

That's totally the point.  Ulbricht's supporters were campaigning for jury nullification.

Interesting.  I've seen countless studies analyzing spam, but they're always about the content (phishing, porn, pharmaceuticals, nigerian prince scams), or comparing the ratio of spam to non-spam emails sent across specific servers, or the determining the effectiveness of spam filters.  I've never seen anyone actually analyze where the spam is coming from.  I'd be curious to see if any major websites are more guilty of these leaks than others, as it'd say a lot about their security measures and/or bring to light any shady (and in some cases illegal) sales of email lists.

Off topic, but do you really use unique aliases for every site you give your email to?  And if so, what does your spam folder look like?  Seems like that'd be a good way to track down which companies are selling off your personal info.
