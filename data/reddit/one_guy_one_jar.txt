How come posts about Bitcoin rising aren't criticized for being optimistic euphoria, but I always see posts with a negative outlook as "spreading FUD".
If anything is spreading FUD, it's people complaining about others spreading FUD.

God, is this really the top comment? There is NO DOUBT about the evidence in the Ulbrict case, anyone who has followed it objectively knows this. It's open and shut. He kept a fucking crime journal. 
If you guys want to argue that it is unfair that Ulbrict was sentenced for so long, or that the laws he broke are inherently unjust, fine. That's perfectly reasonable. But to argue that the facts of the case are fake and that it's some huge conspiracy makes you look like delusional idiots. is the butt of so many jokes because shit like this is always the most upvoted comment.

Posting links =/= reliable. And 2k karma is practically a new account. 
Anyway, I didn't mean a dig at you personally. I just notice every time BTC crashes there are tons of posts like this. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:34:57
I don't think they print money if that's what you're saying. How do you think the majority of merchants accept Bitcoin? They do it by instantly converting it to USD through an exchange. Which is a financial institution.
Fiat and Bitcoin can both be exchanged without a financial institution. But the reality is that both rarely are. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:47:26
If you think any of those exist in the US you are either delusional and/or have no grasp on history.

It's hard to take this seriously with so much hyperbole. Also, isn't it ironic for this start up financial institution to claim that bitcoin is independent from financial institutions?

Yes, literally every transaction has a party on both ends. For every bitcoin sold someone has bought it. 
This is just another stupid "now's the time to buy!!111" posts that pops up after every BTC crash. I'm not sure if this is from people trying to convince people to buy to retain value or people trying to give legit advice.

A person can only be sentenced within the sentencing guidelines of crimes they have committed. It's not like you could put someone in jail for life for jaywalking even if you had lots of bad information in the sentencing phase.
In other words, Ross can only be sentenced within the bounds of the crimes he is convicted of. The judge has the authority to decide where in that range he will be, and can consider whatever information he wants.

Jesus Christ, for real. 
There are plenty of unlicensed exchanges out there. No one is forcing you to use Coinbase. Why is it shocking that an exchange that is voluntarily being licensed would have to comply with regulations?
Also, this is probably the first real "this is good news for Bitcoin" stories in a long time. A legitimate exchange based in the US is the most positive thing to happen to Bitcoin in recent memory.
Blargh.

Because he's lying, most likely. No one, not even the very wealthy, hold that much in cash. (unless they are really, really bad at managing their money. But as someone who sees the personal assets of wealthy people often, I've never heard of it)

This is semantics. If someone said "I'm going to invest in a bond fund on the stock market" you wouldn't correct them. It's pedantic.

There is already a Bitcoin ETF. 
The exchanges and "the stock market" is pretty synonymous. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:04:09
I've also never held crypto, was a frequent posted on and a general Bitcoin naysayer. I think Bitcoin's value is close to 0. 
That being said, I said the same thing as you when Bitcoin took measure hits back in 2013. "Objectively in a freefall" doesn't mean shit with Bitcoin, is has bounced around wildly. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:33:48


You're absolutely wrong about this. Many, many retail investors are not going to use unregulated exchanges. Especially after so many highly publicized exchanges going under, like MtGox.

Holy shit, dude...

It's because these marketplaces are one of the biggest drivers of Bitcoin. The US dollar doesn't take a big hit when a Nigerian prince steals someone's money, but Bitcoin does when one of these markets collapses. Silkroad is one of the biggest reasons Bitcoin is a thing.

Not sure if he's a troll or just stupid. I'm leaning towards just being dumb and mad.

I noticed it really starting to get bad early this year. Now it's completely gone over the edge. I unsubbed early 2013 but still check in when there is big news.

The issue with bitcoin isn't that people are worried about their bitcoins being stolen or hacked away, but whether the value of the bitcoins will hold.

I don't think so. I've been coming here for about two years and have been noticing a steep decline. I almost RES filtered it last time BTC made a big jump because of threads like this, but it calmed down. Now it's the same cycle over again. The entire front page is all posts of people patting themselves on the back and hardly any actual news or information. With the big influx of people coming in now that BTC getting a lot of press and the price is soaring I can only assume it'll get worse. I think it's pretty much the fate of any sub that gets 50k+ users. Users go up, content goes down. 
Anyway, I don't want to be the "boo-hoo this sub's quality is bad I'm leaving" guy. Shouldn't have made my post the begin with.

@_date: 2013-12-18 10:03:24
I don't see how anyone who bought in the last year is any different. Bitcoin's value as a currency is 0. Why would anyone want to use a currency whose price is so volatile? The only people who are buying bitcoin are those trying to make money on it. And, as far as I'm considered, anyone who bought it in the past year is more of a speculative gambler than an investor. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:51:30
It's not that you're trying to educate yourself. It's that you've received a superficial amount of knowledge from reading a wikipedia article and felt qualified enough to give a PSA to others. Price manipulation in financial markets can be very sophisticated and giving others advice about how to avoid it despite not knowing much about it yourself is foolish.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:06:15
Learning about finance and economics is certainly worthwhile. I'd encourage you to go beyond wikipedia, however. Primary sources and scholarly articles are also widely available for free. If you're interested about price manipulation more I'd suggest reading [this](
I started writing about some specifics about where you were wrong but decided it wasn't worth it. There is a lot of wrong and a lot of opinion stated as fact.
