Just calm down and continue using Breadwallet. They're the good guys.

Not really. You are screwed if you are just "HODLING". Stop trying to hold back tears.

Yes, I'm denying it. Now move along troll.

Somewhere around $2400. But only if the dip is stable &amp; it's showing signs of increasing.

"Concerns" lol. Because the filthy politicians of India aren't earning any "Black" money from Bitcoin transactions. Hence they want to tax it now.

The point is, just "hodling" till the end is a very bad strategy, when you see a good price and bitcoin is going down, you just sell off. Buy back later. That's what I meant by hodling will get you pennies.
Obviously I am going to reinvest again. Just not yet.

@_date: 2017-10-05 18:06:47
Probably the best advice so far. Will hodl, thanks!
