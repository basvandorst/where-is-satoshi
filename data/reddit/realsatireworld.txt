I am glad you thought it was funny! Thanks friend :)
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:47:23
Thank you! I try to make a new one everyday. So far I have stayed true to that. If I don't, just send me an angry message :)
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:02:48
Keep things in the currency people are most comfortable with and have bitcoin work behind the scenes. See a couch for $384 USD, select pay with bitcoin. Pay. Done.
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:11:16
Really sorry guys! I'm coming back in 2 weeks with a fresh set. My med school apps are busting my ass and taking up almost all of my time after work. But I am almost done with them :)
 
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:29:00
Thanks for the laugh :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:42:23
Thanks so much! I think you are the first to send some to the website address :) virgin love. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:45:46
Haha. Thanks for giving me another chance :) And I guess you are right, I cannot skip the whole medschool thing just quite yet. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:37:28
Hurry. Running out of time.
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:42:14
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:58:33
Haha, that made me laugh. I accidentally spit out some of my water I was sipping on. Time for tea instead. You are too kind :) 
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:45:28
NO. thank you ;)
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:37:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:13:55
Gumball appreciated. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:06:28
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:18:48
Are there any repercussions to increasing the block size? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:41:25
Yes. That is correct.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:12:16
Missed you too :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:59:57
Haha. No, but I like to hear the opposing views too. I have guarded enthusiasm.  
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:27:30
That's interesting. What do you mean more specifically?
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:32:45
Valid points all around. I guess I'll just keep doing my thing. Creating comics.
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:50:45
90k. yea right. i'd say it is safe to say that 90% have walked on.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:49:10
Those 2 coins helped me get back on my feet.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:29:19
Dammit, I would still be poor. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:13:02
Don't prefer ios :)
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:35:19
Very good point
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:41:51
If it hasn't offended someone, then it is probably not funny. More craziness to come :)
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:59:52
Well if Nov. 9th is a close call, we are going to have a hard time keeping up with December numbers :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:26:30
post it
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:20:08
Feels good to be back.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:09:55
Haha. Comics so disturbing you will actually want to go back to work. Thanks for the upvote :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:40:51
Thank you very much!!! You keep hitting me up :) I feel like I need to take you out for a beer now. Let me know when you are free.
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:28:24
I will be sure to do so. Thank you again!
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:35:07
oh shit. My bad. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:42:50
I may have gone too far this time.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:48:40
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED LAST NIGHT? ;) lol
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:43:21
Comments like this make me smile. I am happy that I got a laugh out of you. Thanks for the kind words.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:43:36
I tried 1234mark...it works
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:35:58
totally bro
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:53:34
damn. I am still waiting on mine
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:55:51
You will be missed :( stop in every once in awhile.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:31:31
Thank you very much! I'll take any donations :) and it looks like you got a pretty good tip in return ;)
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:08:24
Haha. That made me laugh. Glad you like them. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:21:58
started only a month or so ago and has a community of almost 40,000 redditors and raised 30k for Jamaican bobsled team over the weekend. 
This is an alt coin many would have like to stop.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:47:50
Haha. Thanks :) You have all been very supportive. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:47:44
Honestly. I find it more fun to draw different types of violence than the Bitcoin guy's dick.
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:02:17
Thanks! I am glad I finally made one you liked. If I remember correctly, your last two comments were a little less than flattering ;) haha.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:34:13
dorian is not bitcoin creator
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:10:06
I almost imagine they would be the type to reject it. They are usually pretty quick to shut my account down. I was surprised they let my purchase through. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 02:56:57
Hey! I know you from my last comic. You were busting my balls then too ;) 
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:09:54
@_date: 2014-04-24 00:06:23
OK. I tried. It's on the front page, but not my best work. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-04-17 00:13:58
sauce: 
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:05:39
Thanks. May I have another try?
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:40:45
Because in his posts on the bitcoin forum he uses impeccable English. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:15:01
I am not seeing that. Hmmm. What browser is that with?
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:53:38
Well a program that you set to try and spend those coins right when you go to purchase may be a good investment then.
Also, I love coinbase, but I thought the idea was to give control to us. If 15 years from now coinbase is this powerhouse and unless you have an account with them you can't make a purchase at kmart, that would suck.
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:44:53
replace that second 'i' with an 'a'...alcohol is the culprit
@_date: 2014-03-17 13:47:47
Thank you for the continued support! You are much too generous. I put the site together and drafted up a few new comics over the weekend, as promised. Hopefully, I will be able to update with a new sketch every day or two. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:52:12
Thanks. More shit to come.
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:24:31
and r/dogecoin has 56,000 ;)
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:51:47
Thanks :) for that
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:17:09
+2 dogecoin
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:07:54
Sorry about the quasi-comic guys. I spent all the free time I had set aside yesterday to draw one up reading about sidechains. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:56:18
I can't thank you enough. That means a lot to me :) thank you again for the ongoing support. You are a great person.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:33:09
Thanks! Glad you liked it. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:05:28
I know! That was crazy awesome.
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:19:32
I don't think 2% is negligible. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:11:05
Do you want to make out then instead?
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:44:17
Thanks! I'll keep trying to beat this new standard. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:52:01
That might be too simple. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:46:46
Thank you for that! Makes me smile to know you liked it  :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:57:24
Don't worry buddy. I'm gonna get you some professional ass worthy of a write home. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:11:39
Thanks again cap :) you are very generous indeed. I will be making another full one soon. I just got caught up in reading about sidechains yesterday. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:47:37
I will upvote you, even if you didn't upvote my comic ;)
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:33:13
It depends, will this help bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:04:40
I know. I missed a opportunity there. I thought about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:10:04
That would be great! I'll aim for it, thank you for the support.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:58:07
What qualities are you looking for? What would it entail?
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:09:21
There already is one. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:14:32
I'll be back in 2 weeks. Working round the clock to finish up med school apps. Sorry! 
And the critics, I love them! Shit, most of them are funnier than my comics.
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:52:18
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:11:40
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:50:48
Long answer: No. But it might make a good sidekick. Litecoin, take a hike.
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:11:22
You tell him!

no, by bank rolling them. basically betting with the house.
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:28:02
Sorry, my fault. From now on I will keep race, gender, socioeconomic class and cryptocurrencies out of my comics.  
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:07:24
thanks :) luckily, I am still packing my v card
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:41:51
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:10:35
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:17:59
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:31:10
Thanks! Given your username, this comic must speak to you on a hole different level.
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:14:33
Haha. Thank you. I put it together pretty quickly. I hope it doesn't have too many issues. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:53:24
Here. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:39:05
That is completely true. The final touches is where all the time is. I really just wanted a very basic page to hold my comics if someone were interested in seeing the rest. So it works for that.  
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:41:43
Thank you kind Shibe :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:59:06
Thanks :) I appreciate the kind words!
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:01:39
Do you want me to make you a comic?
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:04:14
Thanks :) at least you liked it. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:21:56
Haha. This comic really backfired. Actually, the entire joke was supposed to be hinged on that stereotype. Peercoin was just the pseudo/distractor punchline. I wanted to make a very subtle, tongue in cheek joke leading up to what readers would think was the closing punchline with Peercoin. Then I was hoping they would briefly think that I chose blackcoin almost unconsciously to represent a thief, then realize that the entire joke was poking fun at the blatantly stereotypical situation. But I think I may have expect too much :) lol
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:04:55
Thanks! I will.
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:35:28
JC Penny and Barnes and Noble would be good as well. Your first good hit doesn't have to be a grand slam. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:40:31
nah. i have coins to buy ;)
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:01:16
Sorry, last doge one for awhile. I'll give you a sneak peak at the next:  
@_date: 2014-04-24 00:09:03
It is a comic. Not asking for your coins. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:11:57
He does have that cute smile ;)
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:41:27
fear the doge. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:52:34
Yep. That is true. I need to make a white serial killer joke ;)
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:57:31
market cap of 920 billion dollars.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:48:26
Glad I could make you laugh! Makes my day.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:05:29
I did not know this.
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:09:39
Thank you for the donation my friend! 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:04:37
Say I am Kmart selling everyday things...I just want a percentage of transactions that may not go through if I am accepting zero confirmations...1% or 0.0001%. Or a reason that nobody would try to double spend while buying a $300 microwave. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:37:00
I know that got that market nailed.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:38:24
Haha. There is not a topic on this green earth I will not lampoon. Give me a whitecoin, yellowcoin or browncoin...I have pages of jokes for those too. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:00:42
We don't know if he actually said that and we don't know why, if he actually did. Quoting people out of context is the easiest thing to misconstrue. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:43:38
Haha. After your comment, I thought I needed to pay the proper respect.
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:27:59
Good idea. Might take ten years to afford any of them. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:40:23
I want one.
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:17:14
Haha. I know this has been known since the dawn of time. I was looking for a dollar amount in gains they might be looking at. It was a discussion with a friend. Thank you for providing no new information here.
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:44:07
I haven't been one to shy away from sensitive topics in pursuit of comedy. I am glad you feel the same way. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:00:55
This is making me so hard
@_date: 2014-01-15 01:32:55
It can sometimes take quite awhile on cryptsty...I have had longer. Trying to buy some dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:50:33
If they used that route would they be taking on any risk if the market fluctuated? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:56:36
Understandable. I will see what I can do.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:17:40
Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:04:24
He kind of looks like a Tim. lol. I could see that.
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:37:32
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:45:42
Makes you feel alive right?
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:16:41
props to them for having a sense of humor.
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:15:51
Haha. I know. That is what it seems like ;)
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:18:05
Thanks. I'll keep trying ;)
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:49:43
Very true. Very true. I retracted my statement. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:51:40
It is not like a grabbed a photo of her just waking up. That is a televised interview. lol. And everybody has that 1 or 2 good photos.  
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:38:01
Perfect. Do you have a thing for professional chicks regardless of physical appearance? Cause there are plenty out there. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:46:55

@_date: 2014-04-17 13:24:02
Very well put. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:10:54
Thank you very much for the support!!! It is greatly appreciated :) 
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:34:19
Hmmm, it doesn't look like it showed up. Not certain what happened there.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:58:18
I am selling my virginity
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:14:53
link to site?
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:38:32
Thank you so very much omen2k! I will be sure to keep them coming, my pleasure. If I ever slack off, just send me a message to get off my ass and make more :)
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:38:45
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:53:13
The elite always pound that regulation meme. Stability comes with widespread adoption, not regulation.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:38:37
Very nice job.
@_date: 2014-12-23 03:37:31
lost lots of value. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:57:22
haha, good one.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:15:57
Hahah. Well that is really the best I can expect from you. I'll take it :) missed you too 
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:24:17
I will have to find a spot to fit them in :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:27:44
no regulation
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:13:32
Thanks for the support my friend :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:24:52
all hype. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:39:28
I tried to make them funny. Sometimes I take it too far. It is all in good fun! :) sorry if they came off a different way.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:45:31
Hahaha. I have to keep you guessing. The chubby will return I promise...but when you least expect it.
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:50:47
This is what I have come to notice too. So true.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:31:07
Whatttt? I was just thinking about making one.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:15:09
Just finished my med school apps. Glad to be back :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:16:10
If he is not the Satoshi, it is messed up. Give me your house address and legal name.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:10:58
Nope. Bitcoin just announced that it is a bad time to buy.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:18:45
Thank you sir. I needed that ;)
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:20:23
Thanks. But I already know what circle jerk vertcoin subs think. That is why I asked to bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:12:14
Thank you much :)
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:17:24
Always trying to make them better. Thank you for the support!
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:20:25
Thanks for the tip. I will have to look into that. Yea, I didn't want to flood the site and have people waiting just to have the image load at a snail's speed. 
And you make a great point about the CSS buttons instead. Also, I do need a first and last button. I keep forgetting that I am starting to acquire more images. I still think I only have 3 or 4 up there.   
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:32:32
I'm interested. Give me the info. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:56:27
That was what I was thinking too.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:42:28
Thanks for the tip! I will keep trying to make them better for you. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:21:40
I am glad you liked it! :) Thank you very much. I have an address on the site  and thanks for the donation. I will put it toward hosting costs. Always helps :)
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:04:21
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:05:24
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:34:21
I like it. But gonna need more than asic proof to drive people there. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:29:41
I hope so. I had to go for it. lol
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:48:11
Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:53:24
I like you. I have enjoyed this conversation. Not something I can often state here. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:05:37
Poor Winklevii. I don't know them to be douche, but I can almost see it. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:17:31
Haha. Thank you ;)
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:58:47
I love dorian, seems cool. I kinda want to chill with him. Build some shit together. Good thing I know where he lives now.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:57:31
There is too much rampant misinformation in journalism to take every story you read as categorical truth.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:08:03
There is always room for satire.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:54:59
Yea, I thought it would be fitting. Doge is always smiling. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:42:22
Much comic. Fun. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:37:57
Long time no see. How's life?
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:36:43
Thanks foxshibe. You are a good person. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:53:54
i don't understand. am i suppose to donate btc?
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:55:10
I can think of a better way to spend 1 billion dollars. Spend 1 billion dollars to disrupt a 10 billion dollar industry with the hope that an alternate won't replace it after?
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:07:55
CRASH CRASH CRASH! then we buyyyyyyy. I may be tipsy. I only buy bitcoin when I am drunk. helps me buy moreeee
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:38:27
He most definitely did. Thanks for the +9000 ;)
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:44:58
That's how I feel. I had been watching bitcoin for a while. Cheering it on. But I started getting dulled by the ups and downs...you know makes you care, throw some money in it. But not too much. lol.
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:43:32
Thanks Joey :) Oh sweet, more gold. This is exciting. You have to pull some funds out of cold storage just for me? I feel like a burden. lol.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:51:30

To da moon indeed
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:05:09
Haha, that is a much better caption. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:22:07
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:05:59
That's what I am talking about. Now call me a dirty slut.
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:13:47
Why thank you :) I am glad I was able to land one. Hope to make you laugh again sometime.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:04:56
Thank you :) more to come
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:30:13
So what you are saying is invest in gambling sites
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:12:04
Yes! I got one.
@_date: 2014-04-17 04:07:28
Chemistry. And that was with ~105k in scholarships over 4 years. School. Pshhhh.
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:12:17
Thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:12:54
Thank you for that!
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:35:06
Hahaha. I almost commented on the "1" roll for fun ;) but I was happy to get anything. It was very nice of you to come back and double tip! Thank you :) 
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:39:12
I will look into setting up a tumblr as well if that is what people want. Sound good?
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:08:19
THAT IS A LOT OF TEXT
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:52:11
lucky guess ;)
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:07:05
Right indeed. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:52:59
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:05:04
Good, I got a laugh out of you! Thank you for the tip :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:05:21
Storybit! It is you again. Should I still apply to med school? ;)
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:20:07
Thank you very much! I am happy to help with the laughs! I will keep them coming :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:43:49
Dorian is some random kickass asain dude who didn't invent bitcoin. We should do more funds like this.
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:39:04
That other comic with the poorly drawn, stick-figures is a douchebag though.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:42:01
That's great! They should buy some bitcoin then ;) lol
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:05:52

haha. Without the redbox I am lost for days. I get it now :)
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:27:26
They allow for easier prosecution. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:02:18
I am so hard right now. Is this real?
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:04:40
Thank you! I will keep rolling them out.
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:56:17
The easiest answer, that is quite effective for those who like flashing lights and comparisons, is comparing bitcoin to the internet during its initial stages.
For example: 'Bitcoin makes it easier for con artists.' So did the internet. Never before has a nigerian prince scammed so many people.  Then just cut and paste. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:52:12
sell your btc elsewhere then. stick around a little and you will see why that is the case.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:38:24
Thanks for the support :) as long as I make one person laugh. I am happy.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:46:52
I agree. It is pretty gross. I threw up twice while drawing it.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:38:35
Thanks for the tip! I recognize you from my last one. You are a good tipper :) Keep being awesome.
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:02:28
nevermind! 
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:43:54
I try for everyday. So today ;) Usually 12pm high noon EST.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:05:06
That is often true. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:32:13
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:17:11
why do people keep talking about bitcoin like its so popular. i swear its a bunch of internet forum goers who own it and really noone else. They mention bitcoin as many times as possible because they are scared if they dont it will disappear. Maybe its because the price keeps dropping?
I think I saw this exact comment on CNN about bitcoin. Have an open mind for once in your life.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:00:48
Wikipedia donations now!  Do it :)
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:48:59
doge is pretty cool.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:01:45
"Cool dude. Thanks for letting me know how you felt about closing your PayPal account."
"Thanks for letting me know. I was getting worried that only I knew about bitcoin."
"Thanks for letting us know what your dad thinks."
You sure do have a lot to be thankful for ;)
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:19:48
spend your btc at overstock and tiger
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:35:22
Thank you very much :) I greatly appreciate the tip. I am glad it made you laugh. I will be sure to update with new comics often!
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:37:10
Thank you! They are lot of fun to make. I am applying to med school this year :) so I am not certain if this talent will come in handy there, haha. But I will be sure to keep the bitcoincomics alive for you guys!
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:57:38
Seems like a nice guy. Just can't run a company for shit.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:31:29
You can do better. She looked straight out of the movie 'white chicks'
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:42:45
Haha. I enjoy a good roast. +1
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:48:16
dogecoin power house.
@_date: 2014-02-22 02:52:14
then buy more tuesday?
@_date: 2014-01-01 00:51:51
no. everybody has different motives. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:41:27
Very sorry :(
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:28:13
It must be a slow day if people are upvoting this. I have one of those too ;)
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:05:39
When anything big happens, knock offs and knock off services stampede in and are able to make some money riding off the "newness" of it and the media coverage. This is completely normal. The public is excited about it. They want to make their own. Get rich quick. Get famous. Whatever the reason.
Then the bubble bursts. And it continues its ascent as a useful tool and not a ticket to wealth. Much like the internet in the late 90s.

@_date: 2014-02-24 18:08:24
That isn't stupid. That is unbelievable. Seems fishy.  
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:02:12
Dammit. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:41:37
My bad :/ 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:39:15
So...you don't like the comic? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:41:25
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:14:27
Felt like forever. Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:05:52
So he is still setting on 500k btc? is this true?
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:43:50
'can I hack your twitter?' haha. hilarious.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:51:42
Well, I don't know if all 17 are hilarious. But at least 13 or 14 of them. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 01:29:12
2015 is very ambitious for FAA. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:43:10
Did I push it too far?
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:40:03
If those little fluctuations bother you, next year you might really have regrets. It is hard being a person who fixates on regrets...there is no easy win.
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:48:19
 yeaaaa
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:40:27
Thanks for the push :) I will keep making them.

You're right. But this is not that.
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:51:06
hehe. my bad. just having a little fun :)
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:47:41
He kept millions of dollars in a hot wallet? That seems excessive. But that might be right.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:53:01

I agree. Pure, plebeian trash. But I still have fun making them :)

like it
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:16:38
Of course they do. They don't want bitcoin. They got the us printing press feeding them.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:37:15
Just having fun.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:56:08
not now.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:06:40
I see. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:11:37
OK. do you accept dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:25:38
Thanks! I will :) 
@_date: 2014-01-15 01:04:54
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:30:54
This is my way of saying thanks to him ;)
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:36:13
I have a galaxy s4 and I don't even use fancy. But apples crippling of innovations like bitcoin will eventually bring them down. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:58:15
sent 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:03:50
Thank you so much!! Yea, I am trying for one sketch a day. Hopefully I will stay true to it. All the positive support really keeps me going. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:53:51
Thank you! I will keep it up if you would like me to :)

I know. It gets pretty crazy. Am I disturbing the peace too often? lol 
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:02:57
Exactly :)
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:09:56
I am happy to see you too!
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:45:39
Valid point. I thought of doing one panel. But in a joke the rides mostly off a 'shocker' factor it is sometimes best to have a lead up. But that is up for debate. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:42:57
that good kentucky bourbon. count me in.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:16:31

Good news travels fast ;)
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:07:48
What more could I expect :) Thank you for yet another tip!
@_date: 2014-04-24 00:07:42
Too bad it only downvotes comments :( 
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:42:06
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:58:15
Thanks! He let himself go. lol
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:13:32
i don't get it?
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:08:00
NO! This is my experiment. My precious. Get away.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:21:22
I am not certain how reliable that would be, but that trend could point in an interesting direction.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:52:32
corgi! yesssss. just what i needed ;) Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:17:43
ohhh noooo

my ferret memorized my private key 
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:26:54
Good point. I don't know where I will be next. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:52:27
But the comments on CNN told me to buy tulips 
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:24:00
That looks familiar ;) nice job
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:35:09
It is just a joke :) Nothing more intended. I poke fun at bitcoin as well.  
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:48:21
Haha. Still waiting on the second erection? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:11:32
Thanks! I do have a website where I host them all :)
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:22:31
That is completely true. Didn't get enough coverage in that department.
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:19:20
Not really sure yet. I thought the community would probably just start giving them names.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:47:22
Well, that may be the impression for most here. But I could not blame her for printing that info if he is the real Satoshi. My only concern was if he weren't.  
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:30:03
Fuck you apple. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:31:31
I understand where you are coming from as well. Blatant promotion of altcoins on btc subreddit does get annoying. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:04:11
I'm in bitcoin to laugh and love.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:54:14
don't you have to wait a month before you can access all 10 for instant? right now isn't your limit 0.1 instant /week? I might be mistaken...
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:04:38
Thanks :) geez I guess I rubbed the wrong nerve with a lot of people on that one.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:18:45
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:24:39
Too soon?
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:29:46
haha. i know. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:58:59
Thank you so much! I am in shock :) I will put this toward the hosting cost of my site dedicated to bitcoin and cryptocurrency comics. Coming soon!
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:13:14
Sorry. I let my cat make this one. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:37:14
I am surprised you wrote something other than "buy, sell or hold?" haha. I am just kidding. Sorry you don't find them funny. I'll try harder. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:05:04
If it is Satoshi himself, I cannot condemn her. However, if it is not him...she fucked up. Publishing his information and putting his family at risk.
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:05:01
So you are that person. Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:23:54
Don't gamble. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:50:37
I agree. All 500 posts of his are impeccable. He then goes to write a review on Amazon and forgets basic grammatical rules. We really have no idea how long she was badgering him, long enough for him to fell the need to call the police and utter a few sentences to get her to leave that may be misinterpreted out of context. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:01:31
You predicted that one spot on. I think I opened the box. I am glad you liked my other ones :) I didn't know how this one was going to go over, decided to take a shot at it.
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:52:56
Haha. Nice!
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:52:55
The site is live now  Let me know what you think! I would love to hear your input.
And I had not heard of that site actually. I have really only been on the bitcoin scene for 8 months or so...I may have missed it. But it sounds pretty funny, it is a shame they took it down.
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:06:47
Fine. No more word play. Every single one is going to involve violence, blood and shit.
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:52:34
Incredibly funny? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:23:43
He was making an argument for whole number coins, albeit maybe not founded, and it so happens that dogecoin is the most successful of them. In this instance, it was perfectly fine to draw a comparison. It is like being in a forum for US dollars and not expecting to hear any comparison to the euro.   
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:20:49
Welcome to the club. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:08:02
Awww thank you. Just for me. Is that target?
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:04:37
Awesome! Glad I won you over. I'll try to keep making them better ;)
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:27:12
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:29:31
Haha. I am glad you could see past the shocker to the witty. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:50:27
mmmmm tastes good. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:45:19
Follow the one simple rule: don't put in money you can't afford to lose. actually, just assume you already lost it. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:59:20
Other than purchasing btc, I am not doing anything business related. That may have.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:51:19
Thank you very much! I am feeling like a good brew. This will work :)
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:40:52
I'm not doing too bad myself. Thanks! See you around :)
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:47:01
Thank you my friend!
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:43:53
Not really. They charge 0.1 BTC. Which is $80 right now.

Oh, I am sorry. Maybe this one will do it for you 
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:51:04
Buy a little doge too. Nothing you can't lose though. There is a great community over on r/dogecoin. Very generous and kind.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:13:01
The more the better. Keep hitting slapping your bitdick across the public's faces until they get it
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:27:31
Nothing wrong with a little stimulation ;)
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:33:14
Med school apps and job. Won't stop coming. Barely have time to hang out with you guys here. 
How have you been?
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:45:27
Thanks :) yea. Everyone really likes that one. It was very fun to make.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:42:15
do it
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:40:29
Every once in awhile I have to do the shocker one. Sorry :/ there will be others not as graphic.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:09:33
But I thought bitcoin was for buying one whole weed on the velvet road?
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:32:09
That is very true. I added the ellipsis in the original title because it kind of made sense. But not really anymore. I will cut it next time :)
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:17:07
Dorian for president
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:56:15
Yeaaaaa :) I should start making them just for you! 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:03:55
Swing and a miss. Sorry. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:16:08
I really wanted to make this a full four-panel sketch, with a punchline and the works, but alas I ran out of time. Glad you still laughed :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:27:22
Nice work! I like it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:39:12
Are you the CEO of Chicago Suntimes paper? Great paper 
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:36:40
With only 4 upvotes...I might have to go for shots
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:54:13
Thank you for that! Very kind :)
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:12:05
And I moved from Detroit. Just my luck. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:55:30
no speculators. lol
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:46:04
He didn't reply. Do you want to make out instead?
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:01:50
Thank you too. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:03:28
Had to do it. Thanks.  
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:00:37
Hug accepted. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:49:42
New here? It takes months, if ever, to get money out of mtgox.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:47:47
This guy should be the spokesperson against bitcoin. That would be so great.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:50:11
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:58:41
He didn't update the billboard frequently enough to catch that dip.  
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:58:48
It is really starting to push the quick part. More like get rich...eventually.  I'm so sad.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:47:37
This is a bitcoin stretch.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:49:12
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:59:44
I'll throw a hand in. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:06:21
Sorry, I know. I have to do that. Coming soon!
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:57:59
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:40:57
Before doge existed some people were arguing about wanting whole numbers and now that doge exists they think that is their "proof" that it works. I can't blame them for wanting to back up their argument with that. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:15:35
Back in 2 weeks! Med schools apps are a bitch. Sorry!
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:04:54
figure what out?
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:08:31
You shall not be made into a barbarian on my watch!
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:45:17
All in good fun. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:24:13
Haha, that is what I hear. Thanks a lot :) I will be sure to pick one up. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 11:04:07
I'm still around. Just a whole lot busier these days. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:13:10
Insanely busy. My free time is pretty much reduced to zero. But I am loving it so far. First year down, three to go. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:14:17
I couldn't resist. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:31:34
a lot of altcoins do eventually lead to dead ends. this doesnt change the fact that the altcoin market has bullish and bearish periods, where many of the coins get pumped 5-10 fold during a bull market. the T&amp;C 20 basically is a quick way to check how the altcoin market is doing. catching a bull market in altcoins and getting out before the bear market can be huge. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:26:40
ethereum and ripple dominate the coincap index and they dont even necessarily reflect movements consistent with the rest of the altcoin market. seems less useful for trading the altcoins between $5mil and $100mil market cap. The T&amp;C 20 is designed to represent this altcoin market. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:21:42
Coins that dont reflect the movements of the altcoin markets aren't included. Ripple doesnt trade like an altcoin. Ethereum is large and is basically its own asset class as it got significant wall street attention over the past year. Litecoin doesn't really have active development, etc. What coins do you think should be included? 
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:21:48
I agree. And a more timely release this time. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:39:13
If you can tell me a good way to do coke with btc I'm in. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:18:07
I feel you. Been playing with my x4. Need to ramp it up. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:47:05
I'm going to go grab those dollars and buy some btc. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:24:44
First I am seeing this. Pretty cool actually. I'll have to play around with it. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:48:07
Would you like me to make another shitty comic to spice things up?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:03:07
it is the circlejerk culture. sorry.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:35:34
it was short, but to the point
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:10:50
Honestly, I agree with your analysis. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:18:59
haha, niiiiiiice
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:39:38
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:14:20

@_date: 2013-12-13 08:37:13
stablecoin...if it can actually make more anonymous transactions I would consider that a benefit. And that is a big if.
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:06:52
10% is a little steep. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:31:32
...as a currency. not investment.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:05:01
on my buy/sell page it says I can buy 10 per week. then below that it says I can buy up to 0.007 BTC instantly. I don't know why.

@_date: 2013-12-07 06:52:44
simplicity. simplicity a must.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:12:24
nope. if one person is wrong about one thing than every person has to be wrong about another.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:27:02

@_date: 2013-12-18 23:05:11

@_date: 2013-12-12 16:17:18

playing the CJ card. not cool.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:42:02
May I just have one. I would appreciate it ever so much.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:48:04
perfect. thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:31:04
I have a similar fear. I am worried that it might not pose enough real world benefit to most people for them to want to use it.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:14:40
yep. crashed.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:08:13
sarcasm. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:45:30
thats good
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:05:12
there are 6 users in cryptocoin right now. i assume i would get a poor response. oh well.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:59:52
