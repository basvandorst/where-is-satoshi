I was actually holding the btc for him and wired his investment back to him.  I assume he was able to withdrawal it all, that was 2 weeks ago.

My friend in Greece just cashed out all the btc he had because the economy is ready to crash.  He is more concerned about surviving now than making an investment for later.
The drive in price will come from China, etc.   Greece is just what everyone is looking at as the pin on the economic crash grenade.

I hope they slice him up and sell the pieces encapsulated in clear resin to reclaim lost funds.

Or experiment with negative rates.  It is on the board...

Tsiparis is just buying another few days.  Chances are it wont pass wednesday (btc will jump up like crazy!)  and if it somehow does get ready for chaos and violent riots in greece that will eventually break it anyway.

My feeling once it gets momentum there is nothing that will stop it anymore.

Puts good pressure on ASIC technology to improve, which benefits more than just bitcoin.

What we need is an already existing atm provider, like the ones in gas stations, to take on bitcoin atms as well.

I think the real benefit is that you will be able to pay for things with bitcoin that you could not before.  What comes to mind is car insurance, utilities (although i think some services already exist), rent,...

Well considering I have ACH'd thousands into my bank accounts via exchanges for the last 2 years, the taxman never noticed.  Unless you are converting $100,000+ a year you are probably never looked at.

Still higher than it was a few weeks ago, I imagine it will work its way up again. 500 was too high not to.

I got bales of bitcoins

I don't see any roadblocks in the way of this rise...

because 1000 was an inflated price from MtGox manipulation.  300 is still undervalued though.

Today I learned that for some reason the original branch closed my account and issued a cashiers check out to me, which should be arriving in the mail.  The teller at my branch couldn't figure out why anyone would do that, and were unable to call the other branch as they are not open on sat.  I'll know tuesday what happened.  At least it was not identity theft and they are sending me my cash.
