@_date: 2019-03-14 14:25:33
If I see red, I buy. If I see green, I sell. Very simple, not complicated.

@_date: 2019-04-26 12:30:54
Flog it all on gdax or coinbase pro they call it now. Set up a limit sell order.
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:20:00
i did buy the dips, when there is red on the streets, reach into that pocket and get some cheap coins and wait.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:24:57
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:06:31
pretty much. if anything i'd lose the hardware first way long before i forget my coinbase deets.

In Brazil they cut your hands off

@_date: 2019-04-08 17:18:18
I got 2-3 bitcoin on an old IDE drive somewhere. I don’t remember the seed or mnemonic or anything. I just know it’s on this IDE drive which I still have somewhere.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:49:32
+20%. i'll take that action.
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:17:44
a lot of people tell me, when there is red or blood on streets, buy like a motherfucker. so i did. i see why they told me that now.
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:04:52
nice to see it at these numbers but i dont think it will sit at these figures for long.

@_date: 2018-11-23 11:33:29
It’s not looking good bois 
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:23:24
It’s just a pity everyone on that ship has died of drowning. So then you have a floating ship with nobody on it. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:04:42
I’m just going to HODL. it can free fall all it wants. I ain’t budging. I’m going down with this fucking ship. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:36:06
When there’s red, buy buy buy 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:57:43
Not sure either. It’s a fork off bitcoin. Looked at the growth and it’s shit to date. +50% growth for the year? Fuck that. It’s -40% down for the month. If you think it’ll skyrocket great. Now would be the time to get in on it. But it’ll be a slow burner and you’ll probably see +50% but it’s not worth it unless you got like thousands to put into it. Risky. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:23:56
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:42:31
I’m looking ...
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:37:18
Let it fall, I’ll be there waiting.. to buy them fallen coinz 
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:51:47
Buying every month. I actually have and am using btc. If it uptrends or partially moons great. If not then no big deal. Just means my limit buy orders actually fill. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:12:35
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:12:05
Strike up a conversation about cryptocurrency and see if there is any interest. That or trip the breaker in the house regularly when he’s at work to see if there is any reaction (if hes smart, he would have automated them to strike back on and automine but we will see) you could shit all over crypo and say yeah bitcoin is shit its downward trend and keep drilling into him, tell him eth block rewards will be halfed etc see if he bites lmao
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:00:27
Hodling is key 
@_date: 2019-01-31 14:50:53
It’s a scam that’s what 
@_date: 2019-01-07 13:32:30
Holy shit look cat in space 
@_date: 2019-01-06 12:08:51

@_date: 2018-03-31 16:59:23
Just hodl what u got already and wait for it to bounce 
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:39:50
Haha no bitcoin for you thug. I was the only one who knew the pass and I don’t use finger print scanner either 
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:59:31
1 year. I’m not wasting that much time in it. I’d sell all my coin for around 20k 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:02:48
Okay so that’s why it shot up. I thought there was a bug or error 
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:56:52
It’s all a dream 
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:32:23
It’s not a quick game. It’s a long ass grind. You might be looking at years. Still better than nothing right?
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:45:36
Fudtastic 
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:42:00
I am on such a hang. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:48:21
Fair enough point yes the uk is ok for prices but electricity is quite expensive 
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:54:09
It’s not even tryin lol 
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:54:50
Do you now? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:31:44
Och okay I’m new to this sub - I see there is some fud about so need to read some more 
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:56:03

Ignorance trumps impulse
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:34:19
When it first came out in like 2010 -2011 time I remember mining some of it on my gaming computer and had like 1.2 coins. They were worth fuck all. It took ages to obtain too and I thought nah this is bs. How much of a twat do I feel rn? Haha 
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:29:55
Yep all my open limit orders will auto sell so there is no action from me heh 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:31:03

@_date: 2018-04-13 22:23:05
Total fucking bullshit FUD. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:31:22
Advertise it and force it down their throats lol 
No. I think positive awareness is key .. crypto gets a bad rep imo 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:40:16
Up for the FUD!!
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:54:12
If it wasn’t mt gox then what else would you have done? Boat making? Would we expect to see you in gpumining? Haha
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:44:38
Why not? You don’t have to hodl you could sell rn. Are you prepared to sell it at whatever price it is now or would you prefer to sell it when the price is higher? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:59:13
Yeah I’ll believe it when I see it 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:32:13
Yeah if it keeps going up but there’s nothing stopping it from sinking again. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:38:53
I’ll take 3 for $1k
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:45:07

@_date: 2018-04-13 15:39:52
You’ll be dead long before you get one whole bitcoin out of that lol unless BTC drops to like $5 along with difficulty slide lol 
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:56:54
Just buy the coin man. It’s faster 
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:01:26
