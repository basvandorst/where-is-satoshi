The math really doesn’t matter anyway cuz you don’t actually profit unless you sell higher than you bought.

“I stand by my comment that 1 day old crypto users should first educate themselves, then invest!”
This comment I don’t have a problem with.
It is the negative attitude in your first comment and especially the words “you are not welcome” that I have a problem with.

9% of your earnings across an entire lifetime is a huge difference lol. Especially when most people don’t get cancer or anything else that requires hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.

Same reason I’ll never use PayPal again

I would’ve supported you if you had offered polite and constructive criticism instead of being an asshole. 
Your original comment makes it seem like you think bitcoin is a gated community and you’re the rent-a-cop at the entrance.
You don’t have the right to tell anyone that they are not welcome.

Every country has to pay for shit like this...
You either pay up front for it or you pay for it slowly with your higher taxes. 
The difference is that you pay those higher taxes for a lifetime even if you don’t use the “free” healthcare that you’re paying for lol.
