The fundamental problem with the Foundation, as Jim Harper will attest to, was the lack of experience managing a nonprofit organization coupled with limited resources and too many priorities.  I can see why Jim wanted to dissolve it.
Coin Center, MIT Media Labs, CDC, and the Digital Currency Council have already filled many roles that the Foundation could not.  Perhaps, the Foundation will redefine themselves in way that meshes with these more successful organizations.

I think Jon has a point.  If we can move past this "inflation" paradigm and all the negativity that many in the bitcoin community have with it, I believe to keep micro-transactions feasible in the future as the block reward continues to decrease, there needs to be some block reward "floor." The idea of a floor is to reward miners for mining blocks so transactions with small amount of BTC will be confirmed and the miner receives some fixed compensation for this service. What should the floor amount be? I suggest a fixed number of BTC that keeps the annual inflation rate no higher than 0.3 to 0.5% which will asymptotically approach zero over the long term since the floor amount is fixed. This calcs out to less than 2 BTC per block. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 03:00:37
Agree.  It seems like they are hiding something.  Too aggressive? We just reached the 1 MB limit.  Raising the limit does not mean that all of sudden 3, 4 or 5 MB are going to start appearing tomorrow, and if they do because of all the new traffic, this a problem long-term bitcoiners like myself would love to have.
@_date: 2015-06-17 00:19:43


They prefer 8 versus 6, 7, 9, or 10 MB because 8 is a very lucky number in Chinese culture.
Also, (according to The Cointelegraph), the Chinese miners also esoterically claim:
1)" Chinese Internet bandwidth infrastructure is not built out to the same level as that of other countries."
2)"Chinese outbound Internet bandwidth is restricted, which causes increased latency in connections to Europe and the United States."
3) "the pool operators claim that not all Chinese mining pools are ready for the jump to 20 MB blocks. Because of this, they fear that an increase to the large size could lead to a high rate of orphan blocks."

Maximum block size should not be decided only by the miners!  They are free to size their own blocks.  If they want a larger block to collect more fees, then miners should upgrade their mining equipment and internet infrastructure.
Update: Blockss 386520 &amp; 386521 are empty, so the miners do have a choice on the block size they mine and the transactions they include!

The lesson learned here is bitcoin is like cash. Once you send it over the network, it's like handing/mailing someone cash. If it goes to the wrong person or wrong address, there is no way you can reverse it without the cooperation of the receiver.

Adaptation for any software protocol is important for long-term sustainability.  Fortunately, time is on Bitcoin's side at the moment, and the block reward versus transaction fees issue is years off, allowing for much more debate, discussion, and analysis.

Mike Hearn made a branding mistake when he stuck with "Bitcoin XT."  Should have changed it to "Bitcoin 8XT" to further encourage Chinese consensus in coordination with Gavin's 8 MB max block size concession.
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:13:11
Yes, I agree with the incentive part.  How secure would the blockchain be if bitcoins were only worth 50 cents?  The hashing power would fall dramatically!  The bankers are thinking they can get a free ride using the Bitcoin blockchain as a distributed asset/transaction ledger and only need to spend a few mBTC each time they want to post something on the blockchain.  Hence, they could careless about the price of bitcoin as long as the blockchain remains secure.  To them, it's just a token to use to access the blockchain.  Of course, if they develop their own oligarchical blockchain technology, it won't be decentralized and open like Bitcoin, because they will want control over who accesses it and who mines on it.  How is this any different than Ripple?

No one can fault Gavin for trying to reach consensus.  He worked hard at it and for a long time.
Lets face it, with such a large, diversified, and dispersed community consensus is virtually impossible.  The most anyone can hope for is to have enough of the major players and community leaders on board to compel the rest of the community to comply and a majority is then achieved. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:17:39
Core developers are not the only Bitcoin stakeholders.  Consensus as applied to Bitcoin is a vague term.  A better word is needed because the community is too large to reach a consensus on just about anything.

Good question.  I would take look at Litecoin and NXT.  You want to get in early because as the block size debate rages on, there the risk of another major BTC sell off as stubborness seems to be the prevailing mode.  Most likely these coins will not drop by nearly as much and could even increase.  There's time to do a lot more research.

IMO, I think the Betamax comparison, while not the most accurate, makes the point that any new technology has to innovate as the market begins to use it.  Satoshi could not test market Bitcoin nor is he around to see how the market is using and reacting to the technology.  In a few short years the Bitcoin protocol is going to become fossilized because of all the apps being built on top of it.  The community must seize the moment very soon to make core changes to the protocol as Andressen and Antonopoulis have suggested.  Block size increase, reduced confirmation time, reduced block adjustment time, putting a non-zero floor on the block reward as a mining incentive, etc. should all be discussed and debated.  What will kill bitcoin in the end is the community's lack of unity and will power to innovate and update the technology.

Up voted. IMO, there should be a floor in the block reward somewhere between 0.5 to 2 BTC as a mining incentive to sustain microtransactions and serve as an insurance premium for securing the blockchain when transaction volumes are lower than expected.
The resulting BTC "inflation" would be less than half a percent and diminishing every year.

I tried to remove Coinbase from using ACH on my checking account.  After a long discussion with the bank rep. on the phone, I was told the only way to remove any company that can automatically use ACH to debit or credit your checking account is to close that account!  There is no way to stop them from debiting your account in the future.  All you can do is a charge reversal if you detect the activity in your account (which is not free of course).  If you detect the debit a month later after it has cleared, the bank will attempt a payment reversal by requesting the company to reverse the payment.  In other words, you have very little protection from a company taking money out of your account after you stop doing business with them.  Good luck!

75% is too high for such a diverse, global community who have not too much in common, come from different cultures and continents, speak different languages, and have different educational backgrounds.  The UN would not even function if a 75% majority were required in the General Assembly.

Except for the same old fear mongering about loss of decentralization and hard fork blowups, I thought there were some insightful points (governance model, stakeholder's concerns), but I have to admit I am not much swayed by his arguments that increasing the block size is a quick fix (Where has this guy been for the last two years?).

I like what I read so far.  I believe the minimum spec for running a node is a great idea for evaluating the effect of protocol changes on the network.  In addition, the spec should not remain static.  As improvements in hardware speed and capacity as well as improved internet bandwidth develop over time, the spec should be revised to reflect this improved performance.  It does not need to be based on the latest state-of-the art equipment or the newest ISP bandwidth offerings, but should not be based on equipment and bandwidth services that are more than 5 years out-of-date either.
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:55:58
I thought that was a great negotiating strategy by the Chinese miners.  Highball the consensus percentage to 90%, which is utterly ridiculous and then accept something like 75% which still gives the Chinese miners veto power because they control more than 25% of the hashing power.

You will have to wait until viabtc mines its next block or their one after that to see if it worked.  Their hashrate is around 7% of the network so it may take another 10 to 15 blocks before you find out.
Another miner may confirm it before then so you have nothing to lose.

+1 Bitcoin is a long way from disrupting cc payments and gift cards.  Americans are also not a representative worldwide sample.  As an American, I agree that Bitcoin is a pain-in-the-ass to use for face-to-face payments, of course, this was never the intent of Bitcoin.  With respect to internet payments, Bitcoin has some niches: micropayments, donations, web services, and international payment to small businesses are a few examples that come to mind.  Because there are no chargebacks with Bitcoin, cc and Paypal are going to continue to be the preferred method for consumers when making internet purchases for the foreseeable future (IMO).

No it won't.  Legitimate money transfer companies (other than WU and MoneyGram) have had trouble for decades with banks over banking services! So much so that FINCEN had to step in a few months ago and issue a clarification on their position on the usefulness of money transmitters.

I wish these journalist and techies would do a little bit more research on the origins of money before launching into their exposés on how crytpocurrencies are the next revolution in money.  They always seem to start with "barter" as the first means of exchange, which intuitively seems true, but there is no historical evidence to support this claim.  In fact, the use of some form of money goes back thousands of years and was the predominant means of exchange over barter in recorded history.

Agree with most of your comments.  Criminals were also early adopters of automobiles, pagers, mobile phones, and, of course, TOR.  Just because a new technology can facilitate criminal enterprises doesn't necessarily mean it should not be further developed.  As far as a "need case" for Bitcoin, remember, what was the need case for smart phones?  As mobile phone technology further developed, the "need case" was created.

Hopefully international competitive pressures will keep the Google's, Cisco's, and Intel's from capitulating to DHS's call for encryption appeasement.  Would you buy a CISCO router if you were a foreign government or foreign multinational knowing that CISCO meets regularly with DHS to “promote information sharing and cybersecurity best practices?"

A little PR and education with LE can’t hurt.  But keep in mind, cops like it when others do their work for them.  Just look at what Apple is going through right now with all the LE requests for iPhone access.  My concern is the Alliance becomes a deputized forensic service for LE.  They may not provide help on solving specific cases, but some of the Alliance members could use this as a marketing/business development opportunity for selling their forensic services to LE.

Yes, it is change being returned.  The bitcoins in a user's wallet are a collection of different transactions.  When a user sends bitcoins to  a receiver, the wallet will either combine different transactions or pull the bitcoins from a single transaction in the wallet and then signs and sends those transaction(s) to the receiver.  As a result, there is almost always some BTC change coming back to the sender.

To keep micro-transactions feasible in the future without the need for centralized clearing, there may need to be some block reward "floor" in the coinbase.  The idea of a floor is to reward miners for the service of confirming micro-transactions. What should the floor amount be? I suggest a fixed number of BTC in the coinbase that keeps the annual inflation rate under 0.5% which will asymptotically approaches zero over the long term since the floor amount is fixed.  This would still be "deflationary" in an economic sense.  We are a decade away from this becoming an issue.

Well funded firms like Coinbase with lots of VC money behind them don't really fail.  They either IPO or are bought out by an actually profitable business. In Coinbase's case, it most likely would be either a bank, a money transmitter like WU, another financial services company including hedge funds or private equity.

Their prices are even higher than Coinbase's/GDAX's even though they charge no fees. You would save by buying bitcoin on Bitfinex, Gemini, ItBit, or Bitstamp and paying their fees than by using Circle (unless you have to pay wire transfer fees). Also, Cirlce behaves a lot like Coinbase and closes accounts without warning or little to no due process. The more sophisticated bitcoiners stay away from Cirlce and Coinbase. Let the newbies, timid, and impulsives have Coinbase and Circle.

There are so many other options out there nowadays that more serious Bitcoin users should consider Coinbase as a last resort. Their customer service isn't the greatest. Bitfinex's is much better. Their buy prices are higher than most exchanges even after fees. They act like the PayPal of Bitcoin by reversing trades and basically have no type of appeal or dispute resolution process. They only thing I believe they have going for them, and this applies to US customers only, is their access to the banking system's ACH, which results in very low fiat transfer fees.  You can also buy using a debit card, but you will pay an extra fee for that service, too.

Then why was there a fork in blockchain?  If it were a softfork then there would be no fork by definition.

IMHO, dealing with decimal fractions and large numbers when it comes to pricing is difficult for nongeeks.  This why for example, most companies will split their stock price when it gets too high to make the stock look cheaper and more appealing to buyers.  There is human psychology to consider in how people perceive numbers.
I always thought and would like to suggest that merchants and others start pricing in mBTC. Instead of the price of a cup of coffee looking like 0.0101 BTC, it would read 10.1 mBTC.  Now something that cost $400 may look like 1010 mBTC, still not too large of a number for people to handle.  BTW, current price of one share of Berkshire Hathaway is $173,320.00.
