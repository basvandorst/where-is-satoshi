I'm a bit confused. I'm in Russia right now. I can't access bitstamp, for example, without using a VPN. 
I thought it was banned. What's the current position, then?

I'm only here temporarily, so I haven't bother investigating too much. I assumed it was Russia blocking and not the other way around, but... I'll check.

You're assuming, I think, that privacy means more blockspace, but that is not always true.

Awesome channel, awesome video. Highly recommend
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:41:06
Honestly, for 0.03 BTC, absolutely.
The most important part is having a seed in a secure place. Those words are effectively your money.
Software wallets are pretty safe. If your phone gets stolen, lost, or broken, you use your seed to recover your wallet.
If you lose the seed but still have your phone, you can create a new wallet, write down the new words, and transfer the coins. If 
The bad stuff is if both situations happen, or if someone steals or knows your words. Then bye bye coins. 
Same thing with a cold wallet. It just has the additional security of being totally offline. Your phone could be hacked or compromised.
Imagine that you have a malicious app that records the screen and sends it to some dude. Then your keys are compromised and your money is gone.
But I think this threat is pretty low. You can also delete the software wallet after writing down the words. Then, your only problem is if the phone was compromised in that moment.
Anyway, in my opinion, use a software wallet for anything less than... 500 or 1000 USD.
Just don't leave it in an exchange. That is very risky. Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:22:01
Dude, you can understand how Bitcoin works without reading the source code. Source code is needed only if you need to know how the ideas are implemented.
Go watch the video the other guy suggested. Then you'll understand the basics of how it works. Then go on from there.
In my opinion, the implementation of the ideas is not as important here.

@_date: 2019-07-03 07:00:05
Huge difference. A centralized blockchain has an owner, that can probably modify the the history of records, like in a common database.
With Bitcoin's decentralization, no one can change it. It's absolutely immutable, due to the fact that so many people "control" it and it needs consensus. Basically.

@_date: 2018-09-13 16:25:20
My concern is not only aesthetics. It's easy of use. 
I can generate interest in bitcoin among my friends if I have an incredibly user friendly and fast app. As secure, private, and awesome as Samourai Wallet is, I don't think they give me what I'm looking for. 
I just discovered that Bitpay is hostile to bitcoin, and that's why I'm looking for an alternative... But the app is as close as I've found to what I'm looking for.
I don't think utility is incompatible with aesthetics and usability.

@_date: 2018-09-13 14:01:18
Thanks, that's cool. I feel like there's still a lot of friction to eliminate, though. I'll give it another try. 
I want something like this:
Address book -&gt; new address -&gt; enters and and scan QR
Your friend:
Receive moneyy(shows QR) 
And I mean, that QR can be that payment code instead of the real address, right? 
For me, that would be ideal, but I know that the technical side of it might be hard. But as an user, that's what I want.

To summarize:
Every miner is trying to solve the same problem. The problem gets more difficult with time. If too people try to solve it, you have less chances of being the one that solves it. 
If it becomes not very profitable, some people would stop mining, so mining would become easier for the miners that remained. 
It's a bit paradoxical,  but I hope it helps.

I have no idea about the sport thing, but it's a matter of getting familiar with Bitcoin first.
If you want to put your money on Bitcoin, you'll probably need an exchange. There you can buy Bitcoin with USD, EUR, or whatever.
Then, you should move them to your wallet. If your Bitcoins are in an exchange, you don't control them. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. 
You usually buy "big" amounts of Bitcoin in-chain. That's as opposed to Lightning Network. You could buy directly on LN, but I don't know if there's any place where they do that. 
You can always put Bitcoin from a "normal" wallet into your LN wallet. All that is within BlueWallet. It handles both kinds.
It's very important that you understand how to back up your wallet and keep it safe.
If it's more than... 500$, I'd buy a hardware wallet. Trezor or Ledge are the most popular.
If you have doubts, ask me ;)
Cheers, and welcome
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:19:30
As far as I know, BlueWallet doesn't allow to take funds from LN to a normal Bitcoin wallet. I guess they'll include that sooner than later. It's due time.
However, there are services that do that. It's linked in BW itself:

I'm happy to see them add stuff. I used it once to pay for my sim card abroad with BitRefill, and it was the best use I found for BTC in my real life.
@_date: 2019-03-06 10:15:45
It's, in my opinion, a necessary middle step.
It brings the opportunity to pay with BTC in mainstream places. That's good enough for me by now.
Adoption and all.
It's not perfect, but still a big step to become mainstream. General Starbucks clients don't know that Bakkt is behind this and that Starbucks gets USD. They don't care. They might see a cool new way to pay and get interested in Bitcoin.
I welcome this.

You shouldn't keep your money on any exchange. On the contrary, you should keep it in your wallet.
For a small amount, an app like BlueWallet is more than enough. If you buy a few hundred dollars, I'd buy a hardware wallet.
Next steps... Depends on what you want to do.

The only problem is buying Bitcoin.
The other day a non-bitcoiner friend agreed to receive my part of the dinner in Bitcoin. She downloaded BlueWallet, and I made a LN transaction.
It took basically no effort at all.
She thought it was really cool and wanted to buy some Bitcoin herself. I told her, but honestly, it's a but of a hurdle. I investigated BidQ, but you also need to make an initial deposit, which is not very newberry friendly.

The most popular hardware wallets are Ledger and Trezor.
Hardware wallets provide the best security and control, but software wallets are also much much better than leaving your coins in an exchange. There are a lot of software wallets out there. 
When your bitcoins are in an exchange, you don't really control them and bad things can happen (closed account, hacked site,etc - IT HAPPENS).
There's a popular saying around here: not your keys, not your bitcoins.

Well, I haven't read it all, but seems to miss the point.
First, it says that LN should look like a mesh, and then:


Well... No.
And also it's as simple as this: it's not supposed to be like that.
What if there are 1000 super big nodes, 10000 big nodes, and a million of small user nodes? What's the problem? None.
They seem to be looking at a pure mathematical solution, when reality is very different.
Routing is NOT a "perfectly solved problem". It's a solved problem for the current network and its immediate future. Optimizing for further scale now is not very intelligent use of resources. We have this network now, and it works, further scaling will come later.
Same thing happened with the internet, if I'm not mistaken.
Of course it's not going to be a pure mesh network. It doesn't make sense in this use case. But that's not a problem in reality. Specially because nothing stops you from running your own node.

Keep in mind that your bitcoins aren't stored on your computer, and neither are your transactions. They are stored in the blockchain. Your wallet has the keys to access them.
That's why once you've broadcasted your transaction, you can turn off the computer safely.
It's also why you can send money to your ledger even if it's offline.

Wallets are just software. Apps. Anyone can get one. Go to Google play or app store and download one. You don't need to sign up, you just get it.uip
You can store your bitcoin there, for example.
Exchanges are other thing. Think about them as normal curency exchange places. You need to be 18 to trade USD for BTC.
There are a few decentralized exchanges, like bisq, where you can buy bitcoin anonymously. You can also do it directly face to face with someone that wants to sell. Or get paid in bitcoin directly.

I love paying with LN. It's really a great experience, even now that the UX is still a bit raw.
Used BlueWallet and had no problems whatsoever. I love that I can pay  small amounts, like 0.03$ in this case.
I'm sure that this is the future.
@_date: 2019-02-25 09:04:00
Yeah, but then you wouldn't learn about wallets and holding your own keys.
@_date: 2019-10-01 06:40:11
I'm not an expert, but as far as I know it's bad practice for 2 reasons:
If you reuse your address, people can see how much money you are getting (privacy breach).
If you reuse your address, there's a slightly higher chance that someone could crack your private key. I think. And I think it's ridiculously small.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
In your case, I fail to see how any of those 2 should concern you, so I don't see why not.

Bitcoin is not comprable to MySpace at all.
MySpace is/was a company, a website, a product.
Bitcoin is a protocol, a network, infrastructure.

I disagree.
I have a Ledger. A cold hardware wallet. I can connect it to my computer and do a transaction. The computer is connected to the internet, but the keys don't leave my wallet. They can't.
This could be integrated in a smartphone. Imagine a super small Ledger connected internally to the phone. It's more or less the same, right?

For $100 I wouldn't bother buying a hardware wallet (Trazor, Ledger). I'd use a phone wallet with a backup.
I'd only get a hardware wallet when you have around $500 or so. But that depends on how you feel, of course.
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:36:45

Yep, thanks for clarifying. I was in a bit of a hurry.
It's still very early, and it's custodial, yes, but it's the easiest way to use LN right now.
It's far from ideal, but I don't mind having 10 bucks in Lightning to mess around and then have some more money on the (non-custodial) in-chain wallet
@_date: 2019-12-25 16:02:15
Yes. I meant that it's OK to trust for that kind of money. Like we do with cash. But with LN we don't have to, so it's even better.
@_date: 2019-02-22 09:21:23
That's sweet. I bought one.
Amazing experience using Lightning Network.
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:56:12
I like the app so far! Amazing job! I do believe that this will be big once it implements loop.
Some feedback:
When making a payment, it'd be cool to be able to switch between fiat and sats.
I don't like the fact that I need a PIN. Is this only because I have no screen lock? (I know, I live recklessly). 
I guess I can use the top left icon to get some on-chain BTC to this wallet, right? That is not very clear.
@_date: 2019-02-27 08:51:00

It has nothing to do with Internet Browsers. Those are applications, not protocols.
3G, I'd say it's a better comparison. However it's different. By the way, 3G, and even HDSPA, uses the same old mobile GSM network, but with upgrades on top (soft forks, you could say, heh). Only with 4G companies had to upgrade the network to make it more internet-like.
Of course that could happen to Bitcoin, but it's not like it'll just get swallowed by an altcoin that does something better overnight.
And also, there's a big difference. Bitcoin is software. The hardware it runs on is basically irrelevant. That means it's much much easier to update and evolve than changing a ginormous amount of 3G antennas. Phone companies needed more speed, so the updated GSM until they reached a point where a hardware change was needed.
That's not exactly how Bitcoin works, but who knows.
@_date: 2019-02-14 08:34:50

How does it work though? Who owns this? How do they get a discount? Do they make money?

Store a copy somewhere else. Plastify them. No need to spend $100 on a fancy system or waste time engripting stuff.
@_date: 2019-12-25 13:39:57
Well, yes, LN is the future.
On chain provides trustless payments, which is amazing for online purchases, but in stores, with low value goods, it's OK to trust.
Like if they give you a $100 bill, you might check its authenticity, but you don't really need to do that with $1.
Cash also needs trust in those situations, so I don't think it's necessary to move from only store of value.
However, LN is better than cash and base layer bitcoin, of course. It just needs more adoption, development, and support.
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:20:15
I just sent you 1000 satoshis just for the thrill. This tech is really great. I can't wait to see the development!!
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:08:53
Your point about decimals is a bit weak. You can use whatever unit you want. Bitcoin units I are actually satoshis, so nothing has to be changed. Most wallets let you see your balance in BTC, satoshis, or mBTC. There's absolutely no problem regarding this.
About waiting... Well, for a normal "grocery store" transaction, 0-conf is good enough, and it doesn't take 30 minutes.
Also, lightning is really working already. Of course adoption is low, but the tech is basically here.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:10:09

I'm sorry, but I don't think your comment makes sense. I don't know if it was satire. Sorry if this is a woosh:
Everyone can afford bitcoin, regardless of the price since you can buy really small fractions of bitcoin.
You could buy 0.001 BTC for about 5$.
Also, BTC price can't be regulated. The USA government doesn't have that power. Bitcoin is global and free money.

It was a bit slow because it was the first time the clerk did it and was a bit nervous.

What I didn't like was that I had to type the amount of BTC to send after scanning the address. Is there a way around this?
I'd like a lightning-like invoice. But with lightning, I sometimes want the opposite: a way to send BTC to someone without an invoice. Are these UX problems going to be addressed or is it an application layer problem?

I'm not an expert, but I don't think there's an alternative to PoW that is as good or better.
Also, I don't have the link, but there was an article around here that said that a big chunk of Bitcoin energy consumption was from green energy, since it's cheaper to mine where the energy is produced, and mining is geography independent.
It was around 75%. Even if it's much less, it's good.
If bitcoin miners buy the green energy surplus, maybe it'll actually support the industry of green energy. Obviously I'm not saying Bitcoin helps the environment, but it's not as bad as it seems.
Also, note that Bitcoin's every consumption is not linear. We don't need to spend more energy to secure the network, even if we have 10x the volume.
I think Lightning Network is a very good solution, since it uses the main Bitcoin network for consensus when needed. I think we should have only one POW network, and have sidechains and layer 2 protocols for different things.

I'm not an expert, but I think the technology is there. It's just that there is no real use case yet that justifies diving into that.

Other redditor replied, but in case it's not clear:
When you create a wallet, you write down 12 or 24 words. This ARE your keys. Additionally you can have a pin or password.
If you have the words, you can download a compatible wallet software and recover the wallet with your money.

Bitcoin is more like the internet (or TCP/IP) than like MySpace of Facebook.
It's a protocol and a network, not an application on top of it.

I think Bitcoin is more inclined to behave like that.

I think he meant optimistic from the security point of view.

The Lighting Network, basically. Moving most of the transitions to layer 2 would reduce the congestion. Also more segwit adoptions, and new technologies.
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:37:53
Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Forget about LTC

Honest question: why is he an idiot? 
If you say there's manipulation, doesn't that mean that the price will fall soon?
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:44:52
The answer is hodl.

I understand your point about "not being ready for Bitcoin", but... no one will lose customers because they don't accept bitcoin, if no one accepts it! So I guess right now, I think it makes sense to exchange directly.
I am not too well versed in this (see: this post), so I'll try to lend them a hand in the name of Bitcoin :)
Thanks for your perspective, though. I really want to know first-hand experiences!

I use Bitpay because I think it's very user friendly, specially to do transactions between friends, and that's why I use it the most.
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:19:23
Can you explain what that baggage is? How is it better than doing it with 2 services?

I remember that Elon Musk did something like that with an ETH smart contract... But I don't know if he followed through, or was just a joke or whatever

But as far as I know, Microsoft's ID thing is not meant to be a system to identify Bitcoin buyers. It just uses the ledger as a tool for the ID system.
Immutable distributed data storage seems like a good use case for Bitcoin, as long as you can pay for it...  but I don't know. 
I'm not an expert.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:37:03
More secure than money? What does that mean?
Bitcoin is less counterfeitable than gold and fiat. It's easier to move and transfer than gold.
It's inflation is known, unlike fiat.
It is open, borderless, turstless, and decentralized.
That the advantages of bitcoin vs gold and fiat
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:04:17
Spend and buy, I guess!
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:39:25
You can always charge the equivalent in fiat. That way, the price in bitcoin changes, but the fiat price is the same. Rates can be updated every day, hour, hour whatever.
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:47:43
Thank you. I was hoping to get a bit of a discussion about bitcoin apps, but you're actually the only one with a serious answer. 
Mycellium seems to be capable of what I want, indeed! I wish it was a bit prettier, with material design and all that... But the functionality seems to be what I want. 
Thank you!

Lightning Network
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:54:25
But there's nothing wrong with it, right? 
I am definitely not into that, but it seems like these girls were given a choice, and they were treated kindly... So... What's the harm? 
(I haven't seen the documentary, so my information is not complete and I might be wrong)

I don't know if you are joking or not.
I obviously can pay by cash, but sometimes I don't have the right amount. In groups, most of the time someone doesn't have the right amount.

Never heard about Cool Wallet S. I, personally prefer to choose one that's widely tested and has stood the test of time.
However, I'll check Cool Wallet as soon as I can, to see if they're doing anything interesting.
@_date: 2019-05-01 19:43:20
Great!! It has to be in lapps, right?
I'll keep in touch!
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:14:29
Lightning Network works pretty well. It works really well.
There's room for infrastructure improvement, but it works today.
Download BlueWallet or Eclair and try yourself!
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:31:48
Different use cases.
I have a Ledger with my savings, but BlueWallet to have money to spend easily.
HW = Bank
SW = Wallet
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:00:26
Then, you need to make an international transaction.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:24:03
Sadly, BlueWallet doesn't let us set a custom expiry for invoices, so yours expired before I could pay.
Satoshi is the minimum unit of bitcoin. Like cents for a dollar, but you need 100000 to make one bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:57:41
I heard that there are exchanges that are LN native. But I don't remember which, and I don't know if they are good.
But that's the idea.
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:38:42


This is the most stupid thing ever.
I hope that people are tired of Facebook controlling their lives and don't trust them with their money. Buy who knows.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:20:40
I'll try to help you. You really seem a bit lost.
When you set up a wallet (a phone app, for example), you get your keys. They are usually 12 English words. Well, they are encoded like that. If you have those words, you can restore your wallet in another phone if you lost yours, or something like that.
Those keys allow you to control your bitcoin. Never give them to anyone or write them in a website. Never. If you do, you'll lose your money. Those words are the key to your money.
That's why we say you don't own the bitcoins that you have in an exchange; because they have the keys and you don't. You can ask them to move them to your wallet or to someone else's, and they will do it. But... You can't be sure. That why we say "not your keys, not your bitcoin.".
You can withdraw them from an exchange to your wallet, where you 100% control them.
I recommend hardware wallets if you have more than... 500$ or so. But it's up to you.
The good thing about hardware wallets is that they are always offline, but if you plug them into a computer, you can easily transact with your bitcoins without compromising the security. It's pretty cool and easy.
Ask away if you don't get something!
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:25:32
Because it's very convenient when you need to do transactions.
Might not be your case.
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:48:36
I like this idea!
I am developing a lightning app with small payments and I'll see if I can integrate this.
Is there anything I'd have to do to be featured in this app once it's finished?
Thanks, this looks like a good step forward!
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:46:19
Georgia, the country, is much obliged!
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:59:41
I don't know if that's technically possible. I think 1 sat/byte is the minimum, but I'm no expert.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:22:13
You got it right. Your public key is (simplifying) your address. You can share it with anyone, free of risk. Not to buy and sell, though. You use it to send/receive bitcoins.
Then you have your private key, these 12 words, that give you access to the address.
I'd recommend downloading BlueWallet. Simple and nice.
If you want to learn about Lightning Network, which is a layer over Bitcoin that makes it scalable, fast, and cheap, you can create a Lightning Wallet there, and send me an invoice for 1000 satoshis. I'll send them to you and you can mess around with them.
Sounds scammy, but it's just a super small amount of money than I'm willing to give away.
If you want to learn more, I'd recommend videos by [Andreas]( 
Anything else?
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:35:07
I have been reading a bit, and it sounds like a very... cool wallet. I like that there are other competitors!
It's a different approach, and it appears to be secure enough. However, I tend not to be risky about this. If I were to buy one, I'd wait a bit until they are proven reliable and trustworthy.
It seems like a more convenient wallet for everyday use, but charging it is a bit more inconvenient than just leaving my Ledger in its place. I usually hodl, so Cool Wallet is probably not the best for me. But I'll keep an eye.
Ah, their promotional video is beyond stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:47:58
This is still a bit too complex.
I think a LN solution should be developed to send money to your contacts with that app. Better yet if it's a standard that can be adopted by many apps.
Is this technically possible without compromising security or privacy? Is anyone doing it?
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:25:00
What's not 100% ready are the apps, the UX, etc
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:53:52
Never saw that. That's absolutely hilarious!!
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:01:47
It's a bit stressful, and a very good question.
You DON'T want to write it down in a note in your phone. Absolutely not. That defies the purpose of having a hardware wallet. They steal your phone (or "hack" it), and you lost your money.
Usually, people write it down and store them at home, safely, and make a copy and store them in a different place, in case of fire, or something like that.
If you lose the seeds, but have your hardware wallet, you can still move your bitcoins to a new wallet (phone, for example), reset your hardware wallet (it gives you a new seed), and move them back there. Unless, of course, the seed was stolen, and the funds were moved before you could do that.
If you hardware wallet dies, there's no problem! That's what the seed is for! You buy a new one ms enter your seed. Your money will be there.
The private key is directly derived from the seed, and as you see, it's very very important!!
It's not silly at all!
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:39:36
Not 2048, but 2140. It's pretty certain, too, not something that some people estimate.

The risk of accepting a 0 conf payment for a few drinks is really low. I feel like you're more likely to accept counterfeit fiat money.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:42:04
It's irrelevant if you buy a portion or a whole coin. "Whole coin" is not actually something important.
So, if you want to buy, this shouldn't stop you.
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:52:38
7% fees. Ouch. But the idea I'd cool. I might try if it's easy enough
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:19:20
This seems very interesting, because it seems to be using Bitcoin in a different way, and using its bests capabilities!
But I don't understand how it works, to be honest. Can someone ELI5, please?
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:32:29
Double spending is not cheap. No one is going to go through the hustle for a small amount of money. It's not that big of a deal.
Much  less common and much harder than counterfeit money, or just running away without paying.
It's not a real life problem. I've paid with BTC with 0-conf in a phisical store. No problem.
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:39:30
I love Bitcoin, and technology in general but.... I wouldn't abandon my friends and family if my country forbid Bitcoin.

Ah, yes. My bad! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:27:25
The thing is, you never know where the lows are.
8000$ could be the lowest you'll ever see it. Or it might go to 4000$ and then up again.
The easiest way is Dollar Cost Average. Just buy periodically regardless of the price, and wait.
Don't invest recklessly!
@_date: 2019-05-19 07:51:37
2% of BitRefill, in my experience, is 2% of their price, which is usually a bit more expensive than the flat. But I think it depends on the service.
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:39:40
I bought a Ledger Nano S yesterday.
Do I have something to worry about? Do I need to check something?
