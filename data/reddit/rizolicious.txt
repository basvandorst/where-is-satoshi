Breadwallet which I use is on the bitcoin.org risk so that puts my mind at ease. 
However, as mentioned earlier is it best to buy now even though its high to take advantage of the upcoming fork next week?

I should mention I use iOS.

Found the answer. Thanks for the link!

You sound like an advanced expert on the topic. I will take your advice.

Perfect, thank you!
Is Bread for iOS a sufficient wallet to claim the Bit Gold afterwards?

Look into GDAX I think it is called which is a partner of Coinbase but it’s lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:24:15
Yes, or £.

It’s all good learning about the product, but it’s difficult to learn how to take advantage of it. I’m not a week deep and know a lot more than what I did but I probably don’t know 5%. Yet it’s hard for me to get involved in the ‘advantage’ side when it comes to making money as it’s difficult to learn the rises and dips.

Well I’m in it for the long haul and I have no interest in trading so I don’t know what I was thinking! Apart from trying to be a smart arse haha.

I read a lot of times not to keep them in the exchange, so I made sure I moved them to a wallet. 
If I buy more from Coinbase in a week or so or at the end of the month, do I just do the same thing and transfer to the wallet to join the current amount there?

Can you elaborate on this? I haven’t my bit in bread but as a newbie that flew past my head.

There may be, there may not be. 
I’m waiting also but waiting for a drop is a dangerous and probably dumb game!

This looks sweet, definitely will check this out. YouTube is a minefield from 1 vid to the next so this layout is perfect.

It’s just trying to learn how these dips work and when is the best time to buy to get the best value etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:13:54
Yes this is what I mean, trade or sell whatever bgold I receive to get more Bitcoin in the end.
