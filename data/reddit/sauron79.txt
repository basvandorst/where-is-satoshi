But USDT is more prevalent right?

You're an OG so you have no sympathy from me!

Accelerated in terms of timeframe or value?

I heard that Root Stock was getting a lot of attention at Consensus. Is this project generally well regarded on this sub-reddit? And is it expected that it will increase the value of BitCoin?

Are you 100&amp; BTC?

For people who were here for the other bear markets… Does this feel worse or better this time? Are you less/ more / equally worried?

Only thing I don’t understand is how the address sent the BTC without actually owning it first. Within the same block, it both received and sent the same amount of BTC. It didn’t have it before the block was mined, so how was the send and receive in the same block?

Sorry to hear that.  
  
Were you using a PC or a MAC?   
  
I heard MACs are immune to being hacked like this?
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:36:40
Thanks. What's the best antivirus software I can get for a MAC, any idea?

I like the history and lore....

Has that 2015 email attributed to Satoshi (saying Bitcoin should not be forked) been debunked as fake? I see it continually shared on twitter by alt-lovers as some kind of sign that Satoshi thought BTC was a failure.
