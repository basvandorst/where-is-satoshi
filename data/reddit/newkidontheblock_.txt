Hello. I installed bitcoin core node and synced the whole chain over night.  The chain is now in my appdata folder. Can i move the chain to another drive?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:11:57
I did and it works. I deleted some files from app data folder in windows and accidentally deleted exodus folder from there haha. Got it all back, so i can confirm it works.

”The Ledger Nano X has a 100 mAh battery. The device will last several hours in use and a few months when idle on a full charge. The battery can be easily recharged by connecting the USB-C port to the USB port of a laptop or desktop computer with the cable that's included.
Also indeed, there will be a possibility to attach a keychain.”

Checking a trillion combinations per second, and running continuously for 40 years you'd go through 1.261×1021 keys. That's one sextillion, 261 quintillion! Sure sounds impressive, doesn't it? It is, but even so, you'd have made no progress... that rather impressive number still only amounts to about 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the keyspace.
