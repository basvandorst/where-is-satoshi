Sorry this is happening to you too!
Yeah, they conveniently left out of their post that they ignored me for 6 months.  Apparently that counts as "actively engaging"?

Stopping trading has nothing to do with stopping withdrawals.
I initiated a withdrawal 11 months after they stopped TRADING.  Withdrawals were still enabled when I initiated mine.  I am not requesting any special treatment
They have a duty to return people's property.
And yes, refusing to return someone's property until they sign away their rights is absolutely coercion

I won't, thank you! There is nothing stopping them from continuing to fuck me over after I sign it, and then sue me if I try to talk about it.
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:29:25
Will do! Send me a PM now please so I don't forget to update you
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:28:33
Yeah I'll be sure to let you know!  And I'm with you, but hopefully something will happen.  Or at least it will put enough pressure on them

According to the NDA, it says nothing about it only being enforceable if they send me money.
If I signed the NDA, I wouldn't have been able to post about it on reddit.  The NDA itself is considered confidential

Thank you for your support! I'm excited to see what boston pd says when I file the report

Theft is theft
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:38:38
Thank you!! There is absolutely nothing stopping them from continuing to fuck me over after signing the NDA.  And then I wouldn't even be able to tell the crypto community what poloniex is doing
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:56:30
"take customer complaints seriously" and "actively engaged with this customer" means ignoring me for 6 months until I file a complaint with the Massachusetts attorney general?
Which you seemed to have conveniently left out from your post.  But I'm not surprised to hear just more lies from you.
Stopping trading of a coin has nothing to do with stealing other people's money and not allowing them to withdrawal.
Withdrawals were enabled when I initiated my withdrawal.  It is absolutely possible for you to send me money.  I proposed you either send me my money, or we come up with an alternative resolution, or you continue to ignore me and I file a police report.
There is no reason to sign an NDA.  There would be nothing stopping you from continuing to fuck me over and then sue me if I try to talk about it.
If you want to go ahead with the alternative resolution I suggested, then let's do that.  Without an NDA.
You are openly admitting here that you are refusing to send me my money unless I sign an NDA.  You realize that is illegal, right? Yet you have admitted to it right here
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:59:48
I did, thanks!
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:33:45
Thanks for all these links.  It's quite crazy they have been able to get away with this.  This needs to stop
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:36:57
I will be! I'll be sure to update!
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:34:56
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:37:46
Thanks for the link!

What they stole from me absolutely has value.  Just because it isn't traded on poloniex doesn't mean anything
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:04:42
Actually, they are the ones in possession of my property so it is their responsibility to send me my money.  I can't be responsible for something I am unable to do myself.
It absolutely is coercion to refuse to talk to me unless I sign a legal document.
I would be an idiot to sign it.  As nothing would stop them from continuing to fuck me over after I sign it, and then I wouldn't be able to do anything about it
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:33:16
yeah it's definitely more than $25.  And I'm also just very principled as well.
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:35:58
Yeah I really assume they are running on fractional reserve or they wouldn't try so hard to get me to sign an NDA before telling me what the fuck is going on with my own property
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:01:41
I think they are doing this because they are running fractional reserve.  Why else would they demand I sign an NDA when I ask for information on what is going on with my money?
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:57:57
thank you for your support! It's crazy they openly admitted in their post they are refusing to make me whole until I sign the NDA.
That is criminal coercion.
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:58:26
Their own post will be their downfall.  They have admitted they are holding my money until I sign an NDA.  That is criminal
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:00:03
A different crypto
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:34:26
I can't wait for when they all go down for it.  Will happen eventually.  Those early days of crypto are over
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:36:37
Why try to coerce me into signing an NDA?  There is nothing stopping them from continuing to fuck me over after I sign it, and then I wouldn't legally be allowed to do anything about it.  For a year, at least
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:32:45
Thank you so much for the kind gesture! But I couldn't! If poloniex doesn't do the right thing I'll go to the cops first and see if that works.  If not, then I'll sue personally each employee that handled my support ticket, John Brown (their compliance officer), the employees at Circle that ignored my emails and knowingly allowed fraud to happen on their platform, and then Circle and Poloniex as businesses.  And I'll sue for legal costs, as well as damages and interest.
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:37:48
No, you don't have to offer trading for every alt.  But that doesn't mean you can illegally seize other people's property and then ignore their attempts to retrieve it for 6 months
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:38:57
Thank you!! I'll be sure to update
@_date: 2018-10-28 04:35:30
Hopefully they will finally face consequences this time.  My messages with them are pretty damning.  It's clear coercion
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:38:50
I'd say at best that's what it is.  At worst it's clear cut extortion.
We'll see what boston pd says
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:00:48
stopping trading has absolutely nothing to do with stopping withdrawals.
Withdrawals were enabled when I initiated mine 7 months ago
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:01:09
and withdrawals were still enabled when I initiated mine 7 months ago!
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:26:02
Because I shouldn't have to sign a coerced NDA in order to receive my money
Also, there would be nothing stopping them from continuing to fuck me over and then sue me if I try to talk about it.
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:02:14
Their explanation leaves out they ignored me for 6 months (and they claim they "actively engaged" with me)
Their post also admits they are refusing to make me whole unless I sign an NDA.  That is illegal
