45 minutes from Selma to Buda, maybe, but not SATX proper to ATX proper.

Bullshit. I live in Pf and have no problem making it into Austin regularly to enjoy the culture there.
This is elitist hipster nonsense.

Drove 130 to SATX twice, still not quite 45 minutes, even playing fast and loose with the already high speed limit. :-)
But man oh man is it more enjoyable than being crammed in on 35!

Going green doesn't require or imply going cheap, nor does a lower cost imply a more environmentally-friendly product.

Agreed, but this is hardly the case even outside of reddit.

They do if they comply with federal reporting requirements.  :-P

If your concept of wealth and poverty includes opportunity, I guess.

But did the train leave on time? :-P

Wait, I thought that matters of licensing were mandated by the Constitution as the purview of the states? By what right do the feds preempt this?

Going to? Are. I think a bank in Sweden recently decided to stop handling cash at its branches, apparently all that security and controls are expensive.
Let me repeat that: a bank is no longer accepting cash.
The war is here.

Government of shit.
Just to save everyone else the Google trip.

IIRC, Nordea was the one I read about before, but apparently they are not alone. :-/

You're suggesting that the poor are now poorer because it will be harder for them to obtain something they didn't have in the first place.
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:12:55


Is there an instance of this happening ever? 
@_date: 2013-05-31 13:07:26


That's certainly an effect, but that's not how poverty or "being poor" is defined. And that is defined as lacking material possessions or wealth. One cannot become more lacking of material possessions that one never possessed in the first place, simply because those material possessions have become harder to obtain.
The only way that kind of logic works is if you believe that all individuals have pre-existing claims on all things everywhere, hence why it was called "some socialist bullshit".

His closing sentence suggests to me that he may have no clue what an actual payroll process is like (i.e. that there are usually multiple levels of review before payout).

Because you're refuting an argument that OP didn't make. OP never said that bitcoin is primarily associated with crime.

No, I think he's saying that the back accepting the deposit creates both an asset for the bank ($100 cash) and a liability ($100 owed to the depositor).
