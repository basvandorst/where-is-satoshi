I'll bite.
Years ago, before I was a trader, I was a professional poker player.
Poker, like trading, isn't a complicated game: bet good hands, fold bad ones, repeat. Here's the truest quote I know about the difference between amateur poker players and professionals:










In addition to emotional control, there's "one weird trick": risk management. A professional poker player takes the small edges and ekes them out over time. A statistically significant sample for an online professional poker player is \~50,000 hands. Pros refer to themselves as "grinders" as they wield their tiny edges from hand to hand. If you go broke, you can't win with your tiny edge. Risk management keeps you in the game.
Trading is similar to poker. To quote billionaire trader Paul Tudor Jones:


***Technical analysis doesn't predict the future. Technical analysis identifies and quantifies risk.***
That's why [most TA looks like nonsense]( people are using hammers for brain surgery and wondering why the patient keeps dying.
There's less risk when you use TA as it's supposed to be used:
* bet with the long-term trend (EMA's, trendlines, chart patterns)
* enter with price momentum, not against it (oscillators)
* use stops (trailing, volatility, structural, OCO's, limit, market)
* only risk 1% of capital on any one trade (flat, pyramiding, spreading risk across markets and trades)
* use smaller positions in high volatility (ATR, Bollinger Bands)
But, there's a problem.


Good trading is *unsexy as fuck*. That's why good trading doesn't catch on. It's the eating your vegetables of the financial world.
For example, today was a good day for me. I made \~6%. Professional trading is [nothing like this r/wsb post]( where he made 50% in a week. However, that dude and the rest of r/wsb will be broke "eventually" and I'll keep on truckin'.
Here are stats from my last 100 trades (an unspectacular sample across 20 markets in crypto/stocks/forex):
* Win/loss: 44-58 (43%)
* %/trade: 0.07
* %/win: 1.01
* %/loss: -0.64
* %: 6.98
Notice the win rate? Sub-50%. But my winners are bigger than my losers which allows me to make money. Typical trend-following system. It's common for professional traders to have below 50% win rates. I repeat: Technical Analysis is used to limit risk, not predict the future!
*Without risk management, Technical Analysis is useless*. Here's a [free PDF of the turtle trader system]( It's a great introduction to how professionals trade and how you should think about TA.
[Here's a great trend-following system]( that's simple to learn. I programmed it to work with TradingView ([code here]( It'll work across all markets: crypto, stocks, forex, etc. (It looks better with bars rather than candles.)
The 3 EMA's are an elegant design:
1. The long EMA acts as a trend indicator. Which way to bet?
2. The medium EMA paired with the long term EMA acts as an oscillator. Is price accelerating in our favor?
3. The short EMA acts as a volatility filter. Gray = sideways movement and neither long nor short would make money, so stay away.
I use this system on the 1H charts. It's enough to make a trade every few days on each market, and I follow \~20 markets. You can use it on any time frame.
Your position size should be: (Account Size \* 1%) / (2 \* Average True Range / Entry Price). For example, for an account with $10,000 trading TQQQ at the end of today on the 1H charts: (10,000 \* 0.01) / (2 \* 0.65 / 61.39) = $4,722. Divide that by the share price (61.39) = 77 shares. This is described in the turtle trader PDF as "N".
(Note: you may adjust the ATR to fit your risk tolerance, 2 works best in my experience. Your stop distance in this case is 2\* ATR = $1.30. Your stop being hit will lose 1% of the account.)
Expect to win \~40% of your trades with this system. Many will be small winners and small losers (1-2%). A few will be big winners (5%+). That's professional trading. Boring.
I typed this up to see if I could make a clear, concise, and convincing argument for TA. I can't. Real trading takes work. I fill out my orders, spreadsheets, and watch my risk levels all day just to knock out a percent or two. While I wait for my trades to move, I read r/wallstreetbets to wonder "What if I just ignored all my risk control? ... Oh yeah, I'd be broke."
EDIT: Thanks for the gold!

So much this. When I took computer science, we were learning C++ when all the jobs were in Java. By the time the curriculum changed, all the jobs were in .NET.  
  
By the time a professor incorporates crypto into the lectures, it's already obsolete.

100-1000% returns are really high for an index fund too.
