I believe you are confusing market socialism with a social democratic mixed economy.

Take care to not fall down then. But what's so weird about socialists?
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:17:26
It doesn't contradict SOCIALISM. I'm talking about COMMUNIST SOCIALISM, or non-market socialism in general, which is mostly against currency, or for some sort of labour voucher, a money-less gift economy or some state controlled money.
Although maybe you should argue the matter with an communist socialist. I'm pro-market.

Forgive me for not understanding the lingo you just made up. You seem to be describing communism, which people call communism, not communist socialism. That just sounds weird to me.
Yeah, its redundant.


We aren't there yet.


So you think communism should wait for full post-scarcity/working is unnecessary technology?

I should say is mostly people that dislike social democrats for being capitalist. But I agree Bitcoin seems slightly contrary to the taxation requirement of social-democracy, although [Bitcoin wiki]( itself says it would not prevent taxation.

Yugoslavia is a valid example for you?

A few lines on a wiki is what protects them from TLAs? I'm surprised.
But yeah, taxing Bitcoin would be a non-trivial matter. Maybe we start taxing physical things more. No idea.

But it said right there. "Bitcoin clearly contradicts **communist** socialism"


This sounds weird, what variety of communist are you talking about? Anarcho-communism or Marxism-Leninism or something else?. Also, I fail to see the contradiction between the stuff you are talking about and Bitcoin, distributed autonomous corporations won't need money?.


I smell a transhumanist here

To be somewhat simplistic, that's why (which hates power structures, including for that reason) dislikes/hates EDIT: don't think all socialism is state socialism!

As nice as that would be, Bitcoin clearly contradicts communist socialism, so I don't think so. The discussion is mostly about the market socialists.
