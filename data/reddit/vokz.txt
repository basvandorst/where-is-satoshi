 - This is a weekly chart of bitcoins
 - Daily chart that provides a closer view of the weekly chart
 - Today's intraday chart demonstrating the majority of volume in the 60-90 price range. 
* In my trading, value is generated by the time spent at a level. For example, the fair value of a Steak per pound may be in a range of $6-10 because the majority of the days at the market it's selling at those levels. However, if tomorrow steaks are selling at $15/pound, then it's selling at a premium. If it's selling at $1/pound, then it's selling at discount. At premium or discount, price usually spends a short amount of time before reverting back to "fair value" inside the $6-10/pound range.
This week and day is historically the highest volume trading day of the history of bitcoins. The majority of the volume today was transacted below 100, in the roughly 60-90 price range. Value is clearly rejected from the 200+ area. If the fair value of bitcoins was &gt; 200, price would have been able to generate decent daily volume at those price levels (by holding gains for several weeks above 200). 
Bitcoins dropped from 260 to lows of ~50. That's roughly ~75%. This is not healthy in a uptrend. I don't care what caused it, unless buyers can push price clearly back higher next week, then the fair value of bitcoins is not &gt; 200. Even if MtGox gets DDOS'd or whatever, a strong bull market would have had the liquidity (willing buyers waiting) to stabilize market prices. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
I, too, was looking to buy bitcoins. But at the ~50 level (Back when they were 100). Bitcoins seemed like a very healthy uptrend. Maybe rallying a bit too fast, but UNTIL the market demonstrated obvious weakness there was no reason to stop buying. And the last few days, it showed that buyers are unable to quickly buy the market out when price moves lower. I was a willing buyer at lower prices if bitcoin buyers were able to generate value at higher levels BY sustaining prices at those levels over a period of days and weeks. I'm uncomfortable being a buyer if we wipe out the last few weeks/months of gains in a couple of days.
Trends reverses in either 2 ways : a break away from large concentrated value, or a climatic price/volume reversal. Simply, if one force can breakout a market from a known and accept fair value OR if price discovery ventures too far beyond value (and thus reverts back to it). The bitcoin market experienced the climatic price/volume reversal.
I know a lot of people will believe that bitcoins are now "cheap". News/media is hyping bitcoins. Everyone is buying bitcoins. Mtgox is queued with ID-verification and whatnot. Keep in mind who is on the opposite side of your trades. Who's going to be left buying if everyone already is? In my view, bitcoins will officially enter a bear market if buyers fail to quickly re-buy next week.
* I have no position in the bitcoin market, nor do I plan on taking any positions.
