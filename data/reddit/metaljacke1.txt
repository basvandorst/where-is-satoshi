Well we saw this coming: centralized exchanges adopting politics into their business model.
Dumped my Coinbase account. Good riddance.

Who gives a fuck about the finance and banking world. It's good to know now to avoid Kraken.

“Incoming recession”? 
Have you looked at the numbers? 
GDP high, employment high. 
Might need to stop reading the tabloids.

If the markets are flashing red then why is the Fed raising rates when they left them permanently at 0 under Obama? The fed typically do not raise rates unless they believe the markets can handle it. That is until lately. 
Every time the fed has raised rates under Trump, the markets reacted negatively. They don’t give a shit. The Fed is trying to brute force a bear market. How you can’t see that is beyond fathomable. 
You’re wrong about unemployment as there is zero evidence that corroborates your statement while conveniently neglecting that the federal reserve of Atlanta is attributing the low participation rate to an aging population. [source]( 
[Consumer confidence highest since 2000]( 
So all the excuses you’re fussing over to just shill FUD are baseless.

Debt is depreciated via inflation so it isn’t much of a factor when measuring economic output. Hence why economists use GDP and not debt as an economic indicator.

All the FUD in here.
