Wanting to check their power is supporting them?

I thought the point of lightning is that the payment channels are off-chain and the txs are only recorded on smart-contracts that settle when the channels close?

If wanting wealth parity between early adopters and necomers is your thing, I think you’re going to be disappointed in any case.

I’ll check that out. Thanks.

That’s where you lose me.

Holy shit. That’s a *huge* burden to place on the avg person.

I said making bitcoin replace fiat is all that.  Usurping them need not mean replacing them.  Their legal monopoly is the problem.
Your anarchy boner is showing.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:12:33
It still works.  Are the fees really high? Yeah.  That’s how supply-and-demand works.  If I’m a customer, that’s something to consider.  I may not want to make small transactions while the miners are gouging.  In that case, I’ll use fiat.  By doing so, I’m saying, “Hey, it costs too much, so I’m taking my business elsewhere.”
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:57:32
And what I’m saying is the urge to make it replace fiat is irrational, unnecessary, and detrimental in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:59:20
That’s puts me a little more at ease, good to know.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:12:00
Thanks very much for this. This isn’t so much over my head now as it is up to my nose.
The only way I can conceptualize this is without all the anthropomorphic metaphors.  I assume that all the activity, off- and on-chain, will be done with very little human agency, even less than now.  I also imagine webwallets and exchanges basically acting like banks, e.g. me telling Bread to send *$x* in BTC to Starbucks, and Bread finding the cheapest/shortest Traveling Salesman route through its other clients to achieve that.  I may be waaaaay off on this, but it actually doesn’t sound too bad or too foreign from what already happens with a traditional debit card.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:46:18
You seem pretty knowledgeable.  Can you explain how LN will work seamlessly?  Because it seems like I will need to fund channel after channel after channel just to function.  A channel for my landlord.  A channel for Speedway.  A channel for Starbucks.  A channel for my utility company.  A channel for my mom.  All of which must be funded and monitored.  Not to mention parties/vendors that I don’t habitually visit or use.  The way I understand it, I’ll have coins all over the place, and even funding the channels in the first place will require deposits larger than what I need to spend.  This just doesn’t make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:54:49
No, I’m trying to understand why this supply-and-demand dynamic is seen as detrimental.  That’s why alternative currencies  exist.  That’s why you should WANT multiple currency options.

A couple questions:
1.) R is being passed by the nodes in the opposite direction that H is.  The way I understand it, if Carol gets R, then the funds in her custody are released to Dave and R is automatically sent to Bob, who then uses R to release funds to Carol and then sends R to Alice to get paid lastly.  What happens if someone discovers R out-of-turn?  Could Bob discover Dave’s R, pull the money from Alice and not pay Carol?
2.) I don’t see how this solves fees or decentralization.  Having a large number of intermediaries implies accumulation of fees.  Getting money from Alice to Zach will be quite expensive...*unless* both Alice and Zach have channels with Bob.  So at first it makes financial sense for all the users to use Bob.  When virtually everyone is using Bob, Bob can charge all he wants.  And that’s not ever  considering the sheer amount of metadata Bob has exclusively over everyone else, which is something they addressed casually like it’s NBD.
3.) Isn’t it possible for one the nodes to have fewer funds than necessary when the funds they are encumbered with get pulled?  What happens if Carol spends down her balance before the expiry?  Isn’t the blockchain supposed to prevent that?  Seems like using the blockchain to prove she owes more than she has after the fact is too little too late for anyone trusting her.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:56:13
Yeah, it needs work.  But the urgency is bizarre to me, and everyone seems to think it’s a problem urgent enough to ram through fixes that defeat the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:39:12
Right.  Deciding not to spend because you think it will appreciate and because the fees are high is a rational decision.  And the fewer txs resulting from these decisions cause the number of txs to decline, meaning that the fees will too.  We’re already seeing this now.  I don’t get why this is an issue.
As far as current levels of centralization, the fixes only make it worse.  You can have a decentralized, trustless, deflationary currency that is at times expensive to use, or you can have fiat that’s cheap, flimsy, and untrustworthy but easy to use.  You can also have both.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:52:15
So you’re ok with only being able to transact in bitcoin?  Isn’t that the problem now?  I can only tx with fiat as it continues to become worth less.  It’s able to do that unchallenged bc it has no viable deflationary alternative.  Why is the reverse scenario better?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:00:26
IMO Bitcoin should first and foremost be for value preservation and hedging fiat.  I see no problem letting the two currency systems compete against each other for users.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:15:01
How? Everything I’ve seen acknowledges that it’s not completely trustless.  If I have bad info, educate me.

This is a comment I left above.  Wanted to make sure you saw it in case you have the answers:

But couldn’t Dave claim that he never received the required funds promised by Alice?  It’s his fault, and I’m not sure why he’d do this, but from my perspective it seems possible.  All Alice knows is that she paid Bob and all Carol knows is Bob didn’t pay her.  Now, the way I understand it, after the expiration, since 100% cooperation didn’t occur, either everything is voided and no change occurs or the blockchain gets informed and someone pays a penalty, is that right?


Can this be done in such a way that as many end-users as we are hoping utilize it can understand it and not compromise it?
And as for question three, I should have asked if Alice can over extend herself, since she’s the one initiating this string of contracts and her timelock is longest...
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:36:14
That’s a possibility, but in my ideal world, fiat would continue to survive as a cheap option, and crypto wouldn’t replace it so much as compete with it.  Deflationary currencies based on the value of the underlying commodity have their own problems.  That’s how we got stuck with fiat to begin with.

I’ll check these out, thanks.

So the initial deposit is on chain.  But after that, the movement of coins from party to party are off chain.  But isn’t that only for unidirectional channels?  When you add parties bc you don’t have an open channel with someone, that seems like a problem.  Furthermore, I take issue with *depositing* coins in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:02:45
I can see that point on valuation, but I disagree that it’s only a processor in a world where the two exist in tandem.

The media bias is apparent.  All my push notifications simply say “Bitcoin Collapses.”
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:28:47
Every bitcoin story teaser starts off like,
“Bitcoin.  The Internet money used to buy drugs, sex, and child porn...anonymously.”
“But are criminals now finding new uses for the embattled cryptocurrency?”
[altered voice] “I said, ‘Hey, man, for bitcoin, I’ll kill anyone you want.’ 10 minutes later, I was $10,000 richer.”
“Tune in at 10 to find out in our special report.”
