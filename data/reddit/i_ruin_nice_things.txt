Gemini is good but the price lags awfully.  I’m banned from coinbase for an ACH cancellation and I couldn’t sell the peak last time bc Gemini was $4k behind.

Pay the $25 fee to wire money in 2-3 hours instead of an ACH transfer.  It's how I handle large buys if I don't have funds in my trade accounts.

Definitely not a data lag, just lower volumes.  Sucks bc Kraken, Bittrex, etc all have the lower price too.  GDAX is the only place to trade at these prices right now.  I'm about to have my girlfriend create an account and verify it so I can trade again.

Don’t be a prick

Gemini is where I do my trading and it's consistently been about a half day behind GDAX...which I'm banned from using because I placed a bank hold on an ACH transfer once.

I tried to cancel a transaction I made within 30s of making it because I didn't realize it would take them an entire fucking week to get me my coin.  They refused to refund and I had to call my bank to force a Stop Pay for that transaction.  Cost me $30 for the Stop Pay and then btc tanked $300 over the next week...and now I bet I'm blacklisted from CB...OH WELL.

I have high hopes for it, but I'm skeptical the bull run will continue.  It's definitely trending the same way the 2014 did and despite getting over the Segwit hump, I worry Segwit could potentially be just an internal fad.  That said, the past year has been huge at growing Bitcoins name, influence, and significance in pop culture, so we'll just have to wait and see.

Same thing happened yesterday, it slowly dropped while doing minor corrections up to +$150.  Not worried at all.

HODL is a stupid meme.  If you are a confident trader, selling high and buying low is the name of the game.  I sold at 4100, and I see this going below $3k easily.  Then I'm going to buy up all that cheap cheap coin and make some serious profit.

I've read other reviews that say they are an awful company.  Just buy your Bitcoin through an exchange and then transfer it to your Breadwallet.  It's cheaper than 1% for sure.

Not sure, check out their website.

I'm in the middle of debating whether i should sell now and buy that "inevitable dip".  I do think it will dip with uncertainty just before Aug 1, but how much has yet to be determined.

Which time zone?

Mining with a single 1070 is going to be fairly inefficient these days.  According to some forum posts it can achieve approximately 250 MH/s.  When input into a mining calculator at Bitcoin's current price and factoring for power consumption, you will be operating at a loss.  Even if you get free electricity (college dorm), you still only make $0.07 a year at current difficulty.

Never heard of it.  Most people like the Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets.  Or, Breadwallet or Electrum for software wallets.  I'm not familiar with many others.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:12:01
Is Breadwallet a safe place to keep my coins during this time?  I have my recovery phrase  written down and safely stored.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:11:35
Airbitz has a slow and fairly shitty interface.  I recommend Breadwallet over that.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:14:29
Could mine ethereum with those.  You'll still see a return and the price will stabilize soon.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:07:36
And then the chain splits and it goes back down for a little while.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:20:51
I'm looking forward to it.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:45:36
In a hardware or secure software wallet.  I keep mine in Breadwallet for iOS and have my keys written down and secured.
