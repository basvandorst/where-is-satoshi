IRS: I'm not here to hide from anyone. If I ever sell BTC for fiat I'll pay capital gains. If held longer than a year and converted to Fiat then I'll pay them 15% of the gains (I have records). If they don't like that then fuck them and I'll await them to contact me.
I can't speak about EMP stuff, but I do know (or strongly believe) that the next 18 months are going to suck. The fed is screwed...stuck....can you imagine if rates on the 10 yr hit 4%?

yeah. My story isn't crazy exciting like "The Wolf Of Wall Street". That's for sure, haha :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:48:53
Fair enough, my friend. Fair enough.

in a few years time the interest on U.S. debt alone will be nearly a trillion a year.

I would say about 20%-30% of my savings.
Fascination with the technology and greed.

Thank you for responding, but I don't wish to do this. It is what it is. People can believe me or think it's all made up. To be honest though, if someone were to make it up it would be more fun to do it with something like 5,000BTC ;)
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:51:41
I understand what you're saying.
I just don't want to fire up electrum, import wallet, etc etc just to prove a point when it's not necessary for me to.
I promise you I'm not lying though. The story could've been much grander if I just said 7,000BTC

So essentially he works for a company that feels people are idiots and can't manage their money.
No wonder he dislikes Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:44:14
Cool, thanks man.
I care enough to make this post and share information (cause I'm kinda bored) but not enough to do the signing message thing. It's not insanely important to me what people think. (still enjoy seeing their thoughts/opinions though)
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:07:40
I've been there and while I think it's kinda fun and silly I don't understand why it exists :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:37:12
See my response in Bold above?
That's all I'd like to do at the moment, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:44:51
oh, okay.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:29:19
That's cool. If I show you one of my main addresses would you like to donate 1,000BTC? Kinda joking but kinda serious. I'd use it to better my life and others around me. I'm a straightforward guy.
Thank you for reading.

Why are you in China? I used to live in Turkey at one point (taught English for a while) Talk about JET LAG! :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:26:18
Yeah, hindsight is 20/20. If I would've bought when I first read of Bitcoin I'd have 10,000+BTC.
Oh well, it is what it is. I try to be spiritual anyways, and I'm gonna die either tomorrow or the next day or the next etc etc so I try not to stress :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:38:25
Thanks man, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:10:10
First off, love the website, haha.
Second, if I do buy it I'll do it from somewhere else (privacy reasons) Thank you

As the story goes today even, most people who end up having a WHOLE Bitcoin or more will be few and far between. Most people in the future won't even truly understand how much BTC they have such as ".000000123123 BTC". Instead they'll just see in their future BTC wallet "You have $30 worth of BTC" :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:18:55
Fair enough. I was looking at Top 500 of BTC rich list and I was guesstimating I'm in the top 2,000-3,000 people?
I dunno, just a guess, could be way off.
Anywho, I'm excited about BTC!
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:21:22
I guess a healthy amount of Jealousy if true? :)
(far fetched, but ya never know)
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:36:18
**I don't know if this counts but here is when I moved a good amount of it from one wallet into more than one (for security reasons)**
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:47:44
more of a "what if" question. felt there was no harm in asking a little question :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:11:48
I feel the value will come back up, I don't know how quickly. BTC is like BitTorrent...you can't stop it now that it's let loose.
I don't know/understand the whole China story. All I know is it's in their citizens best interest if they don't clamp down TOO hard.
