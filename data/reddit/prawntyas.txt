You’re the only person that cares that you were right.

I think you meant ‘the value is whatever someone is willing to pay for it’

There is more than one way to define the word ‘value’, one of which is ‘*the material or monetary worth of something*’
In the context of my original comment, value = monetary worth, not ‘the regard that something is held to’

FWIW iOS has come a LONG way since the 3GS

Perfect! Cheers man, time to sell!

We’re not talking about a picture of my deceased mother though, we’re talking about bitcoin and how much money it is/was/could be worth. You’re cherry picking words and interpreting them to suit your rhetoric.

Can someone stick an extra zero on there please?
Thanks in advance
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:09:59
Yep, that's generally what happens!

Get yourself a hard wallet. Ledger or Trezor are considered to be the best

I’d like mine to be worth $10m please.

I’d crack on mate, it’s a 14 hour walk! Probably make it just in time for breakfast.
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:30:58
Nah, it’s just a massive dog house. Cost him $1m

Hey Bart
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:17:54
It is
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:27:08
I’d convert for 72 BTC
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:41:15
Nah, sometimes something happens. Today wasn’t one of those days
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:36:35
Surely it depends on your reason for holding bitcoin then? If you simply hope to make a profit then sure it’s an investment. If it’s for the technology/ideology of bitcoin and profit isn’t your goal then it’s not.

It’s fine, they turned it off and back on again

1.5k is a lot of money in anyone’s book. Don’t overstretch yourself man, only invest what you can afford to lose!
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:13:11
I know, flash sale and I don’t get paid until Friday!
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:45:58
Yeah, I can make guesses too
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:45:39
Why assume op is American?
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:08:23
Ah shit.....er...I mean 1BTC = $10,000,000

Try crypto.com. Ignore all the Visa card crap, it’s a decent app for just buying and selling.
However if Coinbase is for you, there’s no real reason to change

Ok here goes -
The market will continue to be too volatile and unpredictable to make accurate predictions. Also as the market is still relatively new it’s too early for there to be any trends. 
How’d I do?
