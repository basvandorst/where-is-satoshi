with 1 sat/byte this thing is NEVER confirming and i don't want to wait 2 weeks till it drops from the mempool if it drops at all 
i'm very frustrated now this was supposed to be a simple transaction 
btw i'm not a noob or anything i have been into bitcoin since mid 2012 an OG miner but i just happen to have made 1 mistake and this is the first time i get a transaction stuck in the past 5 years of being with bitcoin 
but seriously if i was a noob and this bs happens i would probably be running away hard and fast this is broken broken broken !
also core wallet , what a shame you shouldn't really allow a transaction with 1sat/byte to pass, i see a lot of noobs making this mistake !

but the trezor got other coins too, if i restore the seed it will restore all the coins into electrum right ?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:28:24
yes but the transaction kind of disappeared from my trezor wallet interface after like half an hour of being unconfirmed idk if that was the transaction malleability thing kicking in or not so not sure if i can spend the unconfirmed coins or not !

he helped me do a CPFP, much appreciated buddy and thanks for your time !
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:22:09
i tried but i can't really understand either, so CPFP i need to spend the unconfirmed amount from the recipients wallet (which is also mine) with a big fee is that it ?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:56:32
just to make everything clear, the transaction came OUT of my core wallet and went TO my trezor
which one should i try to import into electrum to try and increase the fee or do the child parent thing ?
thanks for your help

i have seen a guy here confirming the transaction for somebody who were in the same situation as me using the transaction ID, i believe he was a miner and included the transaction in one of his blocks, i would really love if that guy can help me too :(

yea i'm trying to avoid that :(
but if it's the only way what happens once i import the seed ? what do i do exactly on electrum to make this transaction move !!!
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:10:40
core is shut down for 3 days now to prevent re-broadcasting but today i ran out of patience, wtf !!!
this is very broken how do they expect bitcoin to gain mass adoption if something as basic as being able to make a transaction is failing so bad, i know i made a mistake by not double checking the fee area but seriously why did the core wallet allow a transaction with such a low fee to be broadcast, that is a broken design ... wow, also i heard that membool was "upgraded" earlier this year to withhold transactions for a whopping 2 weeks, i can't wait this long !
