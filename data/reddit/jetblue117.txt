So if MMM is a ponzi, then it should grow exponentially and crash very shortly. No? Based on growth can someone guesstimate how soon?

Just wondering what protection I have that you won't have my private key? Maybe I just don't understand the process but wouldn't you have access to the private keys because you need them to engrave the card?

I was able to earn about $1 USD/ hour taking surveys on bitcoinget.com.  That was pretty cool. I save it up and give it out to friends and family after making them download a wallet. I transfer a buck into it so they learn and play with bitcoin. Spreading the gospel!

Yes, if China is so scared of capital flight, then why not ban Bitcoin?

I'd love to see this data updated with today's numbers. Unfortunately I'm not talented enough to compile.

I see it a little differently, I see Bitcoin as the protocol or underlying Internet. Just as internet companies went out of business, many Bitcoin "companies" will try and fail but the underlying protocol, (Internet,Bitcoin) will always be around and thrive.

Looking for a high quality Bitcoin ball cap. Not the cheap nylon models with plastic adjustment. Something all cloth with cloth elastic or slide back. Similiar to golf caps. Anybody have a lead!

I paid the .99 but couldn't watch. Said the format was not supported on my IPad.

Can someone explain to me how things like deeds, birth cert, and other things are recorded on the block chain? Are they just written into the comments when Bitcoin is transacted? Thanks
