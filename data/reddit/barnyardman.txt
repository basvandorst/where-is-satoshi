An ETF needs to cover a portion (like a bank needs a portion for cash withdrawals).  That doesn't mean 100% coverage though.  If an ETF gets approved and a bunch of people buy into it they will need to back a portion of those with real bitcoin, but they make their money by selectively entering and leaving the market (read manipulating market).   An ETF is not necessarily a "hodling" security.

That isn't how the dictionary defines sound.
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:54:26
The strength of your arguement is that from reading that specific definition, and ignoring any other definitions, you are right.  I'm saying when you use definitions other than your SINGLE sample set, your argument falls.
Try subbing out the word you are defining with the definition.  If it doesn't fit in it probably isn't the one you want.
"If a tree falls in the woods does it (make a noise that a hypothetical person could hear)" vs "If a tree falls in the woods does it (create vibrations in the air that me or someone else physically hears it, and understands what it is).
One of those is unnecessarily long and convoluted, the other makes sense.

If two people are in a room and a tree falls, one person hears it the other is deaf.  Does it make a sound?  
Does one person being able to hear it and the other not mean it only made 1/2 the sound?  
A sound is the physical interaction, not the sensory perception of that interaction.  Wind can blow on a tree even if you don't see it.  A sound can shatter a glass even if you don't hear it.

So you believe that things do not make sounds unless you physically perceive them.  You're talking about a different thing than the physical sound, you're talking about an individuals perception of that sound.  There are a ton of cases where things make sounds that some animals/objects can perceive and others can't.
Can a microphone hear sound?  It reacts to it, creating current.  Does it need a recorder to "perceive it"?
If a leaf is overturned and must turn itself to reach for the sun, has it "perceived the sound"?

@_date: 2017-02-14 16:15:12
It assumes that people will abandon fiat.  Look at Venezuela to find out why that isn't going to happen.  
Why would someone in Venezuella care that BTC is 10,000 if they can only buy .00001 BTC.  How could "each person buy just one" then?
It also ignores the fact that 99% of the world doesn't keep a bunch of money stored away.  Money is used to live week to week or day to day, so the idea that some dirt farmer is going to be hodling BTC is sort of ridiculous.
If they made a $10,000 bill I'm sure "everyone would want just one", but that doesn't mean that you can give one to each person with no consequences.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:45:29
Yeah, you're picking one definition from one dictionary to fit your argument.  When you look at other dictionaries they say "can be", because the fact someone hears it or not does not affect the physical activity.
Again, you are trying to use the psychological definition of sound instead of the general definition.  You're misconstruing "hearing" with "sound".
I don't know how many times I have to repeat this for you to understand.
You are using the word to describe human activity, not physical activity.  You are using the word "sound" to describe a physical event, and then using the word "sound" to describe a physiological event. 
If a tree DOESN'T fall in the forest and one of the people around hears it, did it make a sound?  No, because if an unbiased observer were there, that had no effect on the natural world, it WOULD NOT CHANGE THE SOUNDWAVES.
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:32:02
No, they aren't the same.
So the question is if the 10k in tax offset is more or less than the bonus you would get from investing by yourself, which is a taxable investment instead of tax deferred.  This is after the question of "will btc outperform other investments", which we're assuming to be the case.  If the price goes down, pure btc investors would be able to claim their losses for the year they sell, gaining a tax break 401k wouldn't get.
If you haven't maxed out your 401k then there is a strong incentive to invest to the max to get the most back tax wise, and if the options are 401k in the stock market or 401k in btc, and you're already assuming btc will outperform the stock market then this makes sense investment wise.
After you've maxed out 401k contributions for the year, then you could invest additionally in BTC, but if you have that kind of income you should just invest in the stock market and retire.

Just because something isn't 1:1 doesn't mean it has no value.

I think the idea that a large organization would go after individuals is silly, but I think that until market cap gets above a certain point the entire economy is susceptible to someone like the CIA using a fraction of their budget to take over mining and use targeted attacks to basically gain control of the network.
They might not steal coins directly, but they can certainly control how easily certain people could use it.

This guy is delusional if he thinks active money management is a good idea with altcoins but not bitcoin.


You don't want to live in the real world then, because bitcoin can never replace fiat.  This is pretty much common consensus among actual economics research.  It isn't realistically possible without rebuilding the entire world economy.  If you think "bitcoin is doing that" look at the world market cap vs the btc market cap.


Good thing you missed out on that 300%+ return from selling 2013 and buying 2015. Or the 50% return from the drop in 2016.  Or the 50% return from literally two weeks ago.

3/4 is being an SEC approved entity, it doesn't relate to bitcoin as a whole.  That being said, the biggest advantage of being approved as an ETF is the combination of 3 and 4.  People can use tax deferred money to invest in this vehicle that they weren't before.  Whether they do it directly or through a managed fund isn't the issue, you're splitting up the real "big deal" to get more clickbaity list items.

5.  There are already derivatives available, but they aren't provided by this ETF.  I doubt the fund will provide them either.
6.  How is this different from 3/4?
So of 6 things, 3 of them are the same thing broken into three sections.

That post about the guy not investing more than he could afford to lose was such a relief to me.  I came in before the ETF decision and asked if people were prepared for potential losses and it looked like people were oblivious to the idea of it plunging, or that it might happen more than once.
We might see a lot of drops like this over the next few weeks, as I suspect a lot of real money (read many millions) was wagered on the result of the ETF and if life truly repeats they will pull the majority of those earnings out to make other bets and each time it will hit the price.

Cryptocurrencies come in three flavors:
- currency (like bitcoin. Meant to replace the dollar, yen, pound, or at least compete with them)
- use tokens (like golem or storj, you trade the token for the service)
- fundraising (bunches of ethereum based coins), where the coin is essentially a share of stock.
All crypto benefits from increased coverage.  Even an article talking about bitcoin vs bitcoincash gets both names out into the public.  Investors come in all flavors, some like lots of risk for big reward and are looking for the next bitcoin.  Some just want safe returns.  
The main power of bitcoin is their user base.  People are already heavily invested in bitcoin and it is hard to cut losses in something you believe in and harder to take earnings from something that you see potential growth for.  There are some other options that do the same tasks and better; options that can manage their base better and options that manage their development better.  But bitcoin is already there.  Sure dash COULD make it to 5K.  But bitcoin already is there.
As for diversified investments that is the way to go.  Bitcoin could completely fail tomorrow.  But something will take its place.  Crypto is not going anywhere, but plenty of established groups have been evolved around in the past.  If bitcoin misses a crucial thing that the public ends up NEEDING bitcoin could drop significantly.  But that is true of literally every coin, and if you stack up all the risks vs potential earnings bitcoin is pretty attractive.

Also, taxation is not robbery no matter how much you want it to be.  They are words with specific definitions.  Taxation is used to cover communal needs.

Should someone be "free" to just dump their nuclear waste in your yard?  Should you even be allowed to have a yard?  You need to take a realistic look at your beliefs, compare them to the REST OF THE WORLD and see if you are truly capable of affecting change.  
As an addendum, I don't think you understand the world as well you think you do.  I think you have a rough understanding of concepts like psychology and economics, but not nuanced enough to extrapolate into other areas.  You sound like a person that believes crystals can affect people's "energy", because you know that prisms can split wavelengths of light.  You apply a detailed concept to a broad problem, which doesn't work.

Yes, because VISA is the only credit card company because they are the largest, right?  And other card companies have failed, so clearly only VISA has a successful business.
Bitcoin is not the be all end all of economics.  It can fail just like any other coin.  The question isn't if every coin will live, the question is if you split the money on researched vs a complete index of the market.  It's misleading to say the index failed when it is the shitiest attempt at an index.

See this is the problem.  You don't know what words mean, and instead of using a colloquial definition for a community you use a made up one that only you understand or believe.
Profit is the gain in utility from shared work.  Two people have to mow a yard and cook a dinner.  If they both do the same work they put out X work for Y return and Z total effort.  If they agree one should mow both yards and the other will cook, they finish faster and the job is easier.  They get X work done Y return, but at less than Z effort.  There is a net gain from profit. You assume that people working for a profit are losing something.  That is the opposite of how the WORLD views profit.  
I'm not saying you need to change your viewpoint, I'm just telling you that you're using arguments that don't hold water under any scrutiny.  If the argument falls apart when you actually define words commonly you haven't made any point.

Motive- Money:  Ransom the train station kiosks.
Motive- Cause Distraction:  Activate rebate on all electronically controlled machines, sprews money out, riots.  Stops all the trains midway, so they need to evacuate tunnels, block path until power returns.
Motive- Terrorism:  Reschedule trains to meet on junctions, have as many head on collisions as possible.   Aim to do it under downtown.
So this guy has noticeably killed anyone, but that isn't to say he didn't use this an opportunity to go forward with a more destructive/valuable hack.

There are basic needs every human needs.  Even smaller than the road, the sidewalk.  How do you pay for that?  How do you verify every human that USES a sidewalk PAYS for it?  
Having a security guard checking for tickets every step you take doesn't sound like freedom to me.  That sounds like corporate fascism.  I understand that this is your opinion, and you are entitled to that.  But it is unreasonable for you to expect people to willingly give up their freedom of day to day life because you aren't willing to pay 30 cents a year to maintain sidewalks (Even if you don't use them), because the breakdown in society is worth MORE to you than that 30 cents, and because a guard on every sidewalk costs 60 cents a year instead of 30.  Beyond that, how do you control abuse of the system?  You can't just wave a wand and say "buy tickets" and expect that to replace every function of a government.
Communities exist for utility.  The fact that you don't want to pay your fair share is fine.  But individuals don't decide communal values, communities do.  Unless you can convince the majority of people that the government (or a replacement for their utility) can function with no tax base you're just pushing air.  And you're not going to convince anyone of that by being a jerk to people with reasoned responses when you get challenged.

You would have a few options.

2.  Instead of private wallets, have a government wallet.  Do all taxation/benefits through it.
It all depends on the size of the nation though.  If the United States were to try to switch to BTC it would destroy the network.  But a nation of &gt;100k could easily do it and monitor every transaction.

I don't see how the risk is compounded by mining.  Equipment costs are not something unique to crypto mining.  If you're only investing 500 dollars you're not going to be effective mining, but large investments are still wildly profitable by traditional standards, and will continue well beyond cost of equipment is recouped.

Mining with projected values doesn't mean your at a loss, you've just combined the management and mining portions into the same department.  It can more efficient than mining bitcoin just to sell and covert to bitcoincash because you think returns will increase more on that side.  Plenty of people mine lbry still over cash because they expect lbry to recover more than zcash in the midterm.

They are already dubiously legal in the United States.  They edge very close to the legal definition of money, which is reserved by the federal government to exclusively be the Dollar.
The point I was trying to make is that even if someone thinks they are going to hide their money as BTC the government will likely know.  Are they concerned with someone with 5k, no.  But they will go after people trying to hide drug money, terrorism funding, etc.  They may not say "we knew about it because we secretly monitor all the blockchain and darkweb" but instead use it to find people to track and monitor individually via warrant.

That's my whole point.  How do you change it without a fork, and since you have to fork what does that do to the entire economy.  Is it really worth a 50% cut in total value to stop their 20% leech?  
I think every proposal so far has a strong chance of destabilizing everything, particularly mucking with parity between exchanges (as areas of the globe are likely to have similar payment systems).  To me this leads to centralization more than anything the miners are doing.
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:53:36
Because you can't force the end systems to adopt, and it fractures the economy.  If 1/2 the places that took Bitcoin now don't take "your bitcoin", because it has forked, what happens to the economy?  It collapses.  Even minor changes can have devastating effects to forecasting, which in turn has devastating effects on price stability.
I'm not saying these changes are mathematically impossible, just statistically improbable.  If you have some idea that isn't going to require more people to act against their self interests in order to pass it than we have now I'd love to hear it.

It's a variable cost at that point.  Yes it technically costs "more money", but it isn't 25-50% more like people are implying.  The whole benefit of AB is that it provides that 20% benefit without the 20% additional material cost.  If it truly affected price this way you would need a 40-50% increase on efficiency instead of 20%.


Again, that cost is already done.  They already designed it, already tested it, ALREADY MADE THE CHIPS.  It would cost them significantly more to go back and remove it.  
If you changed the entire protocol so AB was a negative effect they STILL wouldn't remove it, because you don't HAVE to use it.  It literally costs them more to take it away than keep it now.


So you mean there is no noticeable difference.

@_date: 2017-04-06 16:23:36
The game is already started, and Bitcoin is built on the premise "if you're going to change the rules MOST people have to agree".  They make up more than enough people to make it so MOST don't agree.
If you want to change the rules now you have to restart.  No person in a winning position is going to actively try to change the rules out of their favor.  And when the game has money on the line, even the people BETTING don't want to change the rules (unless they're losing).

I don't hate the technology, but it is misleading to say it is for "average users" when average users have at best the same amount of Bitcoin as the total cost of the machine.  I'm also very much against the idea of encouraging base users to expose themselves to that much cost when the risk is negligible.  It's a 75 dollar insurance policy on your 100 dollar VCR.
Of course, if you're in the top 1% it's completely different.  But 99% of the user base isn't in that 1%.

It already is easy.  The barrier to entry isn't that someone can't store their 200 dollars in bitcoin, it's that people are telling them they need a 100 dollar wallet to store it.
We should be preaching effective use policy, not "most secure".  If you have less money in Bitcoin than your phone costs, I don't see what the issue on storing it with your phone is.  It's like buying a firesafe in case someone steals your car.

Charging 100 dollars for a pointless service isn't catering to the dumbest idiot, it's fleecing the dumbest idiots.  500 dollars is well over the amount the average user has in Bitcoin total.  Can you imagine an accountant recommending a safe that costs 1/5 your total money to anyone?

The difference is getting a return right now (to pay for manufacturing overhead, variable costs, factory overhead, machine deprecation, salary, etc etc) vs getting a POTENTIAL return down the line.
If I give a toddler a dollar each day, the opportunity cost of just saving it is infinite too.  He will always make more money by not spending it.  But that means that for the rest of their life they can't spend money.  That is a huge cost, even though the returns are "relatively infinite".

Where is the huge boost in empty blocks that ASICBOOST supposedly has?   When you make a claim you're supposed to back it up, not just say "figure it out".  
Think of a company like GE vs a guy making washers in his garage.  One company will have a much higher accident rate, but it isn't because they are inherently more dangerous.  They just have a lot more employees, and thus more chances for accidents.  Scale matters, and ignoring it and treating miners with 20%+ hash power the same as a guy with a single GPU is foolish at best.


Adding the capability costs nothing.  They already had the design and were already making chips.  At that point it's like asking if you want to use FTDI chips or serial programming.  They are different boards, but the difficulty to create them is exactly the same.
Regarding power, you should be testing them equally.  You want the power consumption of Bitmain chips vs other chips WHILE USING ASICBOOST or NOT.  If their competitors have chips that perform equally well why are you picking them out and not the others?  
Finally, from an engineering standpoint we shouldn't be discouraging novelty.  The faster we get hashes the better, because while it shows bitcoin might be less resilient than we thought, it improves computing as a whole for the world.  Black boxing it and hiding exploits is pretty much the antithesis of bitcoin.

If the math is really as easy as everyone is saying to prove this why won't a single person show any math?


Again, I'm not on any side (well, maybe the truth's), but how are you backing this up?  Do you have any experience in manufacturing custom chips or boards?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but even artificially increasing the hashrate increases difficulty, which makes security stronger not weaker.
ASICBOOST is gobbling up the easiest hashes, leaving harder hashes for future blocks.  Harder hashes are (obviously) harder to derive, therefor more secure.

There was a guy that lived on Twinkies for a year, that doesn't make it a good idea.
Getting paid in BTC is like imposing a 10% fee on your self.  You can't buy most things with it.  Most landlords won't take it.  Grocery stores won't take it.  Gas stations won't take it.  So every one of those transactions is 10% more because you're double converting.

So pay 11% fee to get bitcoin, or 3% commission for yen.  They don't even want this to work.
BTW, this is less than 1% of transactions as far as TPS. So to say it is a test would be extremely disingenuous, as the results will be nothing like if everyone in Japan tried using it.

I'm not saying bitcoin isn't a good investment, but if I had millions of dollars already I wouldn't be risking it unnecessarily.  What benefit do you get vs 100% safety of bonds, and at that point bonds are enough to pay for all your living expenses.

I'm just trying to point out that the real money knows what is going on.  They likely either have someone directly on pay-roll or as a consultant that is directly involved in Dev or rather close with the Dev group.  That they would have 50 million invested but not know about Bitmain is pretty silly.
As for the average user with .1 BTC, they will always behave chaotically, but they will also behave in a Gaussian distribution with massive changes in public sentiment being the driving force not technical analysis.  People with 50 bucks in BTC aren't the ones panic selling yesterday, it was people with 1+ BTC.


I've been telling people to diversify.  Even if I were directly involved with Dev, and knew what decisions would be made beforehand I wouldn't be 100% invested.  It just isn't safe.  Users will migrate to another coin(s) if Bitcoin can't adapt to the user base.

Fees are totally fine right now, I don't see what everyone is always bitching about.  I sent 500 dollars for 70 cents the other day.  That would cost over $20 with moneygram.  Anything that is "time sensitive" can be done with a sub 1% fee, and anything that isn't can be done for virtually no fee at all.
Personally I'm against the use for daily transactions.  Coffee shops should use real currency, and if you need to send someone money they can just withdrawal cash after they send bitcoin.

You can't cherry pick one year and say "It will always be like this".  If you only have &gt; $500,000 your choices for increasing your money like that are exclusively other alt-coins.  BTC can't increase like that or the economy would collapse.  If everyone thinks BTC is worth $1M then no one would spend it bellow that.  That would destroy a $30B economy.

Anytime I see a post like this I ask myself "Do they know the true cost of a UASF?"  and the answer is almost always no.  They think it will be seamless, that no one will leave the market from "their side", and that the other side doesn't have a big enough market share to affect anything.
You want to see a mass exodus from the market?  Do something reckless with a potential for a market wide collapse and watch the big money run.  17k BTC being shorted is going to be a fraction of the amount of capital that runs.  I would put the cost at 2-5 billion dollars, and after that happens there is a reasonable chance (greater than 10%) of the whole economy collapsing as another alt-coin gets adopted.

Why would any wholesaler do that?  What is the incentive to sell at &lt;1/4 market price?


Because he is setting up a fantasy that you can sell your house and move to the desert and make money.


There is harm.  His claims make it sound like you can make literally a magnitude of money more than is realistically possible.  Plenty of people just lost their houses from investing in the peak of the crypto bubble.  People should be evangelizing sound, safe, realistic investments.  And if you want to make some wild claim, it's on YOU to back it up.  (you in the hypothetical form, not personally you).  
He hasn't done it outright on the forum, but this guy has all the traits of a scammer.  I don't think bringing him to the front page of Reddit is a good thing for the community, be it /bitcoin or /all.  I think if myself and others didn't call him out it legitimizes his claim and will increase the chances that others will fall prey.

Capital gains (like with selling btc for more than you paid) are taxed when you sell the item.

Bitcoin is a safer bet than alt-coins, but alt-coins will have a better return.  Ethereum and litecoin are both doing pretty well this year both with &gt; 9x returns.  Bitcoin has also done well, but not as much as those two percentage wise.
Those huge jumps you see in Eth and Litecoin are from the coin "catching".  At this point they may continue like bitcoin (so 90x returns) or they could crumble like so many other alt-coins.  There is always a new coin to that will gain like that.  So you can either gamble and pick one (or many) alt coins, or put the same amount into bitcoin.  Bitcoin will be safer, but if you put that same money in ETH last year I doubt you're complaining.

Emerging markets only stabilize when the hit public saturation, when people leaving the market are immediately replaced by people joining.  They don't mature as in "get older", they mature as in "become stable".  The fact that 1/4 of people thought to suddenly leave and weren't replaced means that BTC is woefully under saturated.

Nobody has really fought a case with the "like-kind" argument, so no one knows.

It means that 1 miner pool has gone active on BIP91, you need 79.9% more to fully activate.
If nothing activates Bitcoin could fork, price for both forks could be 0 to 15k.  If this activates, you still might have a fork and both prices could go from 0 to 15k.  There is no "safe move" except pulling out right now, there is no guarentee that any of these actions won't fragment and cripple the economy.
In the case of the fork your coins will either split or go to whichever fork the holder sides with.  In some cases with a split you'll get even coins on both forks, but the danger is that one side will be abandoned, and any transactions from BIP91 activation to then could be wiped out.  
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:22:59
No one is questioning if you're making money, but are you making that money "mining bitcoin", or are you making roughly 95% of that holding onto new equipment and selling it later?
Nothing wrong with seeing a demand and milking the market, but let's be honest with how you're making money.  I make 8-15 dollars a day, I'm on the grid, and I mine alt-coins.  For that money you could get 90 GTX1050ti and be mining 120 mh/s on each one before any modifications.  That's over $110 a day, AFTER lbry crashed (was $150/day last week).
So you're profitable, but not from mining BTC.  And not as profitable as you could be compared to other routes.

Because your 16,000% isn't applicable anymore, with the market established you can't possibly get those returns from ETH let alone BTC anymore.  You're only going to get that from new coins at this point.  
In the instance that you bought and have them from 5 years ago, hodl.  But if you're a new user you don't have a chance to buy ETH at .005 BTC anymore, and you can't get BTC for $600 a piece either.  That method of thinking isn't applicable to anyone else.  People don't HODL the dollar anymore, because it isn't going to change as drastically.  They invest that dollar.
Because my original response wasn't to you, you narcissistic ass? The math for 16000% return comes out to investing before BTC hits $1.
Pick one and hodl it.

My "high frequency" is on a magnitude smaller than them.  My setup basically does this (with some various indicators to verify trends)
1.  Hold what I have.
2.  Sell it if it drops 5% and trend switches (so don't sell if it drops but still has positive growth, ie: small corrections from previous jumps)
3.  Wait for 5% confirmation of trend reversal
4.  Buy back.
Whenever it does a large trade it sends me a notification.  Other than that it just fills in liquidity to the market (buys a little on small dip, offers it just above price to encourage growth and vice versa).

The value without speculation inflation.  The collapse this month was caused by more people speculating than using the service.  The fact that we went from overbought, to correcting, to over-correcting means we're in the same boat again.  A stable price is the cornerstone of an economy, rampant inflation or deflation are both bad for the community even if they make money for speculators.

No.  I'm telling you it isn't.


But you can't spend the money on mining that you spent on BTC and vice versa.  Splitting it into two groups diversifies, but it will never increase your return (one will always be better, or equal. never both better)


again, that is after the price change.  The idea is how much BTC will you have before it doubles from mining.  If the number is less than you could buy upfront, after gains through the period, you have an under efficient investment.
Beyond this you're double exchanging with mining like this, the hash rate for LBRY and BTC both matter.  As market cap increasing hash difficulty will also increase for both.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:38:29
What percentage of mining power would they need to be for that to be effective?  Let's say they split their power 50/50, half to destroy the chain the other half to mine the other chain.  
That puts them at 8.5% in the pool.  Let's knock off 3% for their supposed 15% advantage.  Now they are at 5.5%, perilously close to 95% consensus level.
They have to either completely abandon the other chain to fight this, and it doesn't make economic sense for them to just abandon millions in revenue.

Why do you hate this argument?  Because it's true?
Give me your electricity costs and a miner; I'll show you how you're going to make a loss compared to just buying BTC.  If price drops drastically the ROI drops, not rises.  And difficulty only gets harder as hash rate increases.  You just can not mine if you pay for electricity anymore (and make more than just buying direct BTC).
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:12:22

I think the big issue is going to be distinguishing tokens as real vs scam now.  Some of them are real products that are scammy (or at least redundant and unnecessary), and some of them are vaporware that would be amazing, and some of them are real products that have real value.  
But they all look almost identical to the average investor.

exchanges work on the dynamic between users.  We use them to connect the users, and pay a middle man fee because it's hard to get in touch with 100,000 people to sell your $200 BTC, or to source 100,000 people that have $200 to sell because that would take forever.
They make essentially a commission on each sale.  I think Coinbase has a much more connected user base though, and news travels fast amongst its users.  They could handle the usage if it weren't all directed at the same time.  It's a stampede and 3 people are trying to fit through a 1 person door.

Actually, I offered him 50 bucks to just take a cell phone picture.  He had exactly the same motivation for that as running his S9 for two days.


Agreed, he seems petty.


This is not the first time he has made these wild claims to have people question him.  If I say the moon is made of cheese it isn't on other people to prove me wrong, I'm the one trying to convince them.
I'm all for people trying to spread ways to be more efficient.  If you have a good tax evasion method, post it.  If you know a way to get AB efficiency on other miners, I'll be the first to upvote it.

The canned responses from Coinbase work 80%+ of the time too.  The vast majority of transactions go through without a hitch, or are flagged by automation.

When fees hit parity with what they should be the mempool will go away, but fees will stay stable.  If users could set their own fees they would all decide to just barely cut the system, which gives no transactions but builds up that mempool again.

Right on, staple prices have stayed low relative to inflation.  Bread might cost more as a loaf, but flour, milk, rice, and eggs have gone down (again, relative).  
Additionally, the types of bread are much more diverse (we can still pump out 50 cent loaves of white bread), so the $6 sourdough you got is raising the relative price of other breads.  People wouldn't dream of spending 6x the normal price for bread in the 20's.

At this point the fees for the 1000 transactions are already paid.  Your wallet is already consolidated.  If you were to spend the total, it would be one input and one output.
Is that not how it works?  If you had to pay fees based on where your BTC was ONE TRANSACTION AGO, it would make the whole system fall apart.

You should protect your assets.  You wouldn't send 50k in cash overseas to a guy to watch it for you.  You wouldn't put 5 million in cash in one bank either.  These are both issues 99.9% of the world will never experience.

Because they aren't just "sitting there", he is one of literally millions of people that have accounts, and the fact he fucked up the 200k transfer means their automated service didn't catch it.  It's going to take time, and frankly they are really fucking busy.
This amount of money is never going to just be "credited to his account", that is ludicrous.  The banks are probably having a hard time believing he overnighted 200k then didn't realize his mistake for 2 weeks.  I know I wouldn't just hand over that kind of money without due diligence.

They made a program that saves your ID/account and loads it into the sql call for the billing sites, very fancy.  Not worth 12%.  
Hell, I can get 50% of that functionality with Firefox and a single bookmark, at the 2-3% the companies actually charge.  12% is twice what a safe return is.  That is predatory.  If a stock broker came up to you and offered guaranteed 12% each year you would call the SEC.

Option 1.  They spend all their hash power on this UASF.  Result:  They control the soft fork.  They're off the main fork, who gives a shit.
Option 2.  They split their hash power evenly Result:  They just cut profit by 50%, and the result is a fraction of the hash power on the new fork. Bitmain isn't 75% of the hash pool guys.
Option 3.  They ignore the soft fork.  Result:  There is no "attack".
If there is no profit, long term or short, why would they do it.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:17:32
Before I get into a long argument about probability and hash rates, are you even mining bitcoin or some other crypto?
(the ti is the most profitable, and I've seen 7-10 as the figure.  You have one.  The 1080 is much less efficient.)

So they are a second layer to poloniex?  I have ETH that auto converted to BTC at 1.5 eth/btc ratio, is that what you mean?  or my STR that got sold off because it dropped when BTC recovered?
I still don't understand what use case demonstrates a 12% fee.  12% is Credit Card level APR, not bank convenience fee level APR.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:08:36
Because you're affecting the current price based on speculation of the future.  It doesn't hold a fair market value for actual investors, it loses representation of its real value and you have massive drops like last week where the asset has a value substantially lower than the price.  It's untenable in a functioning crypto economy.

They provide a redundant, unnecessary service and charge multiple times what the standard industry rate for said useless service.  Sounds like a scam.

I can go to my ATM and get cash for free.  Or another banks ATM and get it for $2-4.  And the fact you have to load the card means they have that BTC already.  If that company goes under, how do you get that BTC back?  What is stopping them from freezing your account just like this dude?

1.  You can replace the land, it's called buying land.

It's a bad reference because it pegs the price of a "unit" so low that the fee becomes a substantial portion of the total cost.
I'm fine paying 70 cents to move 2-3k around.  Anyone buying BTC in 3 dollar portions with fees where they are is a god damn idiot though.

First of all, Apple Pay is a 2nd-layer service for fiat currencies.  It might as well be Visa Pay or Mastercard Pay.  Same thing.
BTC isn't built for 2nd layer services like that.  Something like Ethereum already took that market niche, and it will be a generation before you get the community to add drastic changes like that.  BTC will continue to grow and be a foundation for other services/alt coins.  That is they market niche they have.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:19:50
Because I have a job and don't need to find a scam to get people to give me money for nothing?
Which of these is easier:  Setting up autopay on those individual services or setting up autopay on Prism and linking those services to Prism.  
One of them takes a bunch more steps, and THEY CHARGE YOU FOR IT.  I don't care if I can scam people more efficiently, if I have issues with them doing it why would I want to do it better than them?
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:59:52
How will you buy them?  With BTC?  So, because selling them is such a silly idea (because it grows in value, but somehow isn't inflation after you adopt it for money?) you'll buy them from a hypothetical seller.  
So again, how do you buy their $500k investment if you yourself refuse to sell?  Can you continue to use BTC at that point, when the average user would have a fractional bitcoin and the transaction fees would exceed their spending amount?

No, it's a fact.  Overall, the price of ETH and BTC are linked.  Look at the graphs, they look identical except where there are chunks of BTC moved over to ETH, where the changes are proportional to each other.

I don't think Satoshi necessarily "discovered" capitalism and utilitarianism.


Do you people even read the other posts?  Either it is anti-fragile, or Bitmain is "destroying the ecosystem", it can't be both.  You can't say "Greed is built in, it helps it" and then turn around and say "Those miners are being too greedy, they're destroying it".
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:01:49
I use coinbase because they have a nice GUI for price watch on ETH/BTC/LTC.  They get slammed with requests constantly, and many people reload assuming the stream isn't working.  This kills the servers at high load.
They are built and designed to operate at normal usage.  Today was a "black friday" type event, with a 1/3 price swing.  That is not normal, and outages should be expected.
This is why "hodl" is dangerous.  You should have a sell off point to protect your investment.  Why people think BTC is suddenly different than literally every past investment I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:07:03
You mine eth and trade it for BTC.  Think of it this way, you can mine 1 nickle an hour with BTC, or 10 pennies an hour with ETH.  You mine more value total, even if the total coin is worth more.
If segwit passes how much BTC will you have?  Is it more or less than .5 btc (at the time segwit passes)

Everyone saying they don't have enough electricity has never dealt with a power company.  You think they want to sell LESS power?

If this gives them access to funding for both solar and for the mining equipment, they might have a chance (assuming they can max out the solar to get 0 cost energy like China).
That being said, this is 5 years too late, and they should be looking at a federal 2nd layer service instead, where you can pay taxes/fines/fees/etc.

A realistic price for BTC doesn't vary 10-15% in a day.  Can you imagine if Apple stock dropped $15 and rose $20 daily?  Price fluctuations like that are indicative of speculation, not market utilization.

What would be the point of that?  They don't get any fees then, and that is becoming the focal point of miner income.  Finding an empty block means they could fill it if they wanted and make more money.  I think you're just spreading FUD for no reason.

At 20% over a day takes less than a week to go to 0.  Fast growth and fast decay are both problems, I'd gladly trade the hype for a realistic price point.

ETH is GPU optimized (ASIC don't really work with it), so you'll be a "top dog" in the mining pool instead of a little fish in the BTC pools.
After 3 months, you are broken even then right?  So the question is will the price of BTC rise more than you would mine in that time.  Where as if segwit passes, and you have 2k in BTC it may be worth 5-10k afterwards, more than double the investment.

@_date: 2017-06-17 19:26:15
OK, so you are not mining BTC at all then.  Which is fine, I frequently advise people to diversify.  You're mining LBRY (I think its distributed storage?  Can't remember of the top of my head), and then exchanging it for BTC.  So after segwit, when the exchange rate goes from xLBRY/yBTC it will be xLBRY/2yBTC, which is drastically lower.  Your difficulty doesn't need to change at all for your returns to diminish greatly.
