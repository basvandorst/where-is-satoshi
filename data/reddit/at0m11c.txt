So Coinbase is like a FIAT bank?
What is the chance that Coinbase would do a exit scam. Can you compare Mt. Gox with Coinbase regarding the security, it feels like coinbase is taking much bigger measuers to store our crypto safely?

I mean in the future when maybe bitcoin is mainstream how will the average dude store his bitcoin/crypto. I cant see that everyone will start having recovery seeds locked up somewhere. 
Lets face it the casual folks wont probably use an offline wallet. 
I mean if everyone started to have there seeds at home there would soon start to be people that break into peoples houses searching for there seeds.

DOLLAR COST AVERAGE
As you get better and better u could 
dollar cost average 80% of your stack and trade the rest.
But for casual folks dollar cost averaging is the way to go I think.

Finally, need to buy more at cheap levels.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:58:28
RSI is high. ~5400 is a critical level.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:55:29
5400 is a interesting level. The RSI is also pretty high.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:11:31
Yes i know it looks very good, but i mean if one can make some extra money in a short time that is why i ask if you guys think it will dip a little after the fork, but yeah i will probably hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:18:28
Not really, just if someone has experience about fork and what could happen, yes i know there is better places to search info at but i like to have many sources.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:18:10
Ofcourse, everything is possible in your dreams.

Dollar cost averaging.
We will probably see some kind of correction in the near future.
But we could go higher, this is bitcoin after all.
