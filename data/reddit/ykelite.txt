Having multiple issues with CEX.IO Withdrawal again.
They sent the wrong wire instructions to my bank and caused it to be returned to them. This is after waiting almost 20 days for them to start to wire. 
I requested for them to resend the wire with the proper instructions and they have not replied at all. It's been over a week.
I initiated a new withdrawal and have not heard back in over 1 week. 
I've asked about this multiple times and have only gotten automatic replies back. 
They seem to be in a constant state of backlog.

Received a generic email saying that they're backlogged. 
No timeframe given.

I already issued a ticket. The only reply so far is that they're working on, are backlogged, and can't offer an ETA.

My bank does not ask such questions. If the transfer was unsuccessful cex.io would let me know that my bank does not accepted transfer. But I got a clear message that withdrawal was successful.

I tried LakeBTC as well. No luck there either.
It looks like they're only using their "LakeBanker" system for transfers now. What this means (as I understand it) is that they have third parties that can take care of the transfer for you. They make commissions on this. The problem is that you end up waiting forever for the LakeBanker to be assigned. I've been waiting for 2 weeks now. There's no way to control this process or to expedite. All emails go unanswered. 
I haven't tried it on GDAX yet - hope there are no problems there...

I did it three times. Please provide me an email address to send my ID, I do not believe that it is a good idea to make it public here

This warning is inaccurate and misleading. If they would tell int he warning that it would be wise solution to postpone transaction it may take days to transfer your bitcoins it would help. Warning says that we have delay, not complete transfer collapse. We have many other options to transfer BTCs.

Update: My Chase account just updated with a pending wire. It took 4 days to get to this stage.
