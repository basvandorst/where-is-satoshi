Yes, the opponents are devs who have much bigger stake in other systems(alrtcoin, sidechain) other than bitcoin  or devs who have little stake in the system. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:29:37
Well said. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:59:40
Only if people don't need one. If you are running a full node yourself, it's not free, right? 
We have full nodes surplus now, too many people are running full nodes.  That's why it's free.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:31:36
I see fee rising as a breaking point.
About the bet, i'll bet 100BTC that you can't get your txs into next block with current fee (0.00001BTC) at the end of this year if we don't raise the blocksize hard limit.  
Will you take it, or are you the chicken shit?  
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:00:27
I think it's the forking. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:13:56
Exactly. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:22:52
Even with 100KB blocks, miners will still join a pool to save conf&amp;maint costs. That's why pools rise in 2011, not 2015. 
You have problem with miners cooperate within a pool and call this centralization?  
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:34:04
This is bullshit, even there's only 2 full nodes, it's not like paypal, they can't fake your transactions, they can't steal your money, you can always bring up a new nodes if you're pissed off by them. Will bitcoin be so centralized that there's only 2 companies be able to run full nodes? I doubt that.   People stop runninh full nodes  just to save the cost,to be more efficient,  what's wrong with that?  You can't force people not to trust other people. @_date: 2015-06-01 00:29:43

When he brought up on mailing-list, nobody endorse it, even his blockstream guys. Gavin and Mike have pointed out it's unnecessarily complex and pointless. 
Kind of stupid to bring it up again.  And it's reckless to think Bitcoin QT devs have the power to let the whole ecosystem to change every piece of software. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:53:51
Most are calling for more "fee pressure", means doing nothing before users complain &amp; leave, except Gavin &amp;Mike .
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:45:51
Fee rising have never happened in bitcoin's history, so yes, it is a breaking point.
The Bitcoin Core recomended fee has dropped to 0.00001BTC long ago, but yes, most people pay more due to lazyness of wallet devs or generousity.
How about if the limit raised, you pay me 0.5BTC? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:58:28

@_date: 2015-06-09 03:27:44
I mean financial incentives.  
And the other 4 core devs (except Gavin) are indeed calling for higher fees instead of bigger blocks, they want fee pressure, so they are idiots on this topic.

Decentralized pool never grow big, you know why? Efficency.  Stop selling this fantasy. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 09:53:21
Nope, core devs are not in charge. Obviously the opinions there are quite different vs business circle.   
As the businesses getting more and more mature, sometimes i think core devs are not that important than the early days, and the structure of core devs team is outdated, need some new blood.  
@_date: 2015-06-14 10:03:54
Offchain companies are not competing chains because... they are not chains?   Of course, sidechains are new chains, it's good to experiment things, 1GB blocks, all kinds of crazy stuff,  but still, you need to make bitcoin mainchain users uncomfortable (by limiting blocksize and pushing up tx fees through the roof) to bootstrap your sidechains.  This IS conflict of interest.  That's your Blockstream's dirty plan.  
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:50:53
I don't know and i don't care, it's not my choice, neither are yours.   I just want bigger blocks so the tx fee can stay low and don't push users out.  
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:20:05
When Satoshi and Hal start working on bitcoin, there're only two nodes.
What's keeping nodes afloat is not small blocksize, it's users. And you 1MBers are pushing users out. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:56:48
I don't think this proposal can be adopted by other commiters(no hard limit), and i think it's just jgarzik switching camps, quite a political move, to save his "core dev" title.   
But i'm glad it happened.  
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:38:25
So what? It suggests that my equipment is not catching up, and i'm not suitable to run a full node while other people and business can (they are forwarding it).  I should upgrade my equitment or stop running full nodes and use SPV wallets or crowdfund a full node.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:30:52
At least the number they published is not fake, right?   
Hope you can hold your billion customers safe and comfort with supportng 1MB blocksize.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:20:34
It's silly to have two type of blocks to seperate users apart, that totally diminish the network effect. Adam Back is a fool on this. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:07:21
What about remove the hard limit? 
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:49:45
Straw man? No, doing nothing at this breaking point makes you supporter of 1MB blocksize.
@_date: 2015-06-14 10:08:12
By keeping bitcoin's blocksize at 1MB, that's even better for sidechains.  
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:00:48
It is necessary since Sep. 2014
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:49:31
It's delayed through every full block, and it'll getting worse and worse.  I bet you'll be able to make txs with 1BTC fee, forever, because there're not enough idiots who would outbid you, they'll just leave the god damn chain and switch to another cheaper one. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:42:10
What kind of new apps worth the wasted electricity?  Let's imagine. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:15:34
You can't encourage people using full nodes, but more txs can.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:59:14
Even 20MB is not enough for settlement, let's go step by step, core devs are not better at seeing the future,  or they have been mining along  Satoshi and holding it through 7 long years and made a lot of fortune now. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:30:09
Of course, if i need one. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:12:36
Exactly. And outsourcing full nodes is not centralization too, it's just more efficient, free choice.  @_date: 2015-06-01 15:29:13

@_date: 2015-06-04 01:00:11
@_date: 2015-06-14 13:17:24
Bitcoin's security comes from economic incentives, by limiting blocksize, you (blockstream) are limiting the economy, thus weaken the security.    
I'm tired of arguing with you, who have a conflict of interest on this subject.  You just will do anything to keep blocksize at 1MB. It's really a waste of time.  
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:20:57
Edmund Edgar responds:






Running a full node is not a casual behaviour for lazy users already, so i think we should stick to the Nielsen's law, give bitcoin the biggest growing room. This is already very conservative.  
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:03:03
Every full block is making users waiting longer. We should be worry when there are dozens of full blocks in a day, because users' experence are pretty bad then, and it's getting worse and worse. We are already here.  
I don't like core devs treating users like shit. I really hate it.

Nope, he was talking about EXPERIENCE, there was none 20MB  full block experience, maybe none in the coming years even if we raise the limit to 20MB.   
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:16:05
The blocksize hard limit is still 1MB

@_date: 2015-06-02 01:17:38
Are you describing a DoS attack or a mining competition? 
If it's a mining competition, it's fine, if most miners are in China, rest miners should find a way to connect to them, or find a way to compete them out.
 If it's a DoS attack, i think James has made it clear,  relay nodes can set a soft limit and just stop relaying them. What use of a block if it's not propogate through the network?
That's the same reason why they won't pull a 51% attack and why they won't keep making smallest blocks only contain coinbase tx - they can do these atracks NOW with a blocksize hard limit.   Because they have a business to run.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:12:36
Exactly. And outsourcing full nodes is not centralization too, it's just more efficient, free choice.  @_date: 2015-06-04 02:50:07
1. Cherrypicking blocks found after approximayely 10 minutes:  Every block is approximately found after 10 minutes, that's how bitcoin work, unless you want to change that. A full block is a full block, no matter if it's found in less than 10 minutes or more than 10 minutes.
2. Excluding "spam","dust" txs: You can't do that, they are REAL txs.  Just like you can't exclude SatoshiDice txs, they pay fees, and maybe they're willing to pay more than "legit" txs, how can you exclude that?    What about the huge amount of "dust" txs that 21.co will bring to the network?   
This is a biased analysis.  
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:29:08
You are not mining, you're playing a toy, that good old time has passed.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:06:10
Not if we remove the artificial blocksize limit. But to some people, maybe it IS overvalued.  @_date: 2015-06-02 07:35:48
We should remove the hard limit and set a configurable forward blocksize limit if there's a "compromise" there in Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:12:23
Timestamp is not accurate. And the txs rate is not constant.  
@_date: 2015-12-04 02:26:31

@_date: 2015-06-10 17:03:24


Yes, but you are trusting that party to do the verify for you to make sure that other people are not cheating. You are outsourcing that ability, only shrink "nobody" a little bit. Human cooperate, without trust and cooperation, we are doomed. 


I get your point, using a full node is more important than running one, but i don't see why businesses would run one but don't use it. 
And i argue that not every nodes are equal, the more used one Is more meaningful than the less used on, so personal nodes fading away is not a big problem, they are still using other  full nodes.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:14:53
We must go somewhere, 20MB is just a limit.  It takes us 7 years to reach 1MB, i don't see a limit raise will change much. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 01:42:44
No, they just want enough "bandwidth" for bitcoin users to migrate to sidechains, and 1MB is enough for migration, and small blocksize is a great incentive for user to migrate.  
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:56:30
I think it's going to be ugly for GreenAddress's customers when their coins are holding on chains that no merchants accept and nowhere to sell.  Hope you can ease your customers' nerve.   
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:29:19
I don't reject, others simply won't hear it from me. If most nodes don't set a soft limit, then i have to accept that - that's what people want.  If most nodes set a limit and stop forward blocks bigger than that limit, then the small-enough one will propogate fastly through the network and has a better chance to be in the longest chain. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:02:24
Did you read Mike's response to Adam Back?  
Adam Back maybe a good crytographer, but his argument doesn't make sense. I don't respect nonsense arguments.
By "other committers", i mean sipa, nullc, vladmir, jgarzik.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:22:03
If core stick to 1MB limit or anything else less than 20MB,  and one reckless miner mined a 20MB full block to be a milestone...
You can always switch to XT, that's all XT's about, a choice. 
Why no BIP, no pull request first:  Gavin said he won't make a pull request unless he get other committers' consent. Basically, there's none. But Gavin believe it's the right way to go(me too, most of businesses do), so XT is the final answer after 3 years long vetoing.

@_date: 2015-06-09 22:24:38
That's still turning users away.  20MB is doable now, i don't see why we should turn users away instead of raise the blocksize.  There're competition out there, Bitcoin's leading position is not solid, so we should do our best and never turn users away.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:10:42
Becareful, this is the guy who invented DAC concept, and crowdfund huge amout of BTCs by that shitty concept.  
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:46:53


Totally agree.


I don't agree with you on this one. The difference between bitcoin and gold is there are 500 more competing altcoins, what seperate bitcoin from them is the network effect. With 1MB blocks, you are pushing users out. There will be no network effect if you push users out.  
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:47:55
FYI, this is an altcoin developer &amp; holder.  
@_date: 2015-06-21 02:03:39
There are 2 weeks grace peroid for the rest to update, if they don't, it's them who are forking.  
@_date: 2015-06-14 00:16:54


Not scaling but competing chains, if most users lock their bitcoins and move to sidechains, the main chain will slowly die and sidechains will flourish, maybe one sidechain will be mainchain (with bigger blocks), so they are competing chains, limiting bitcoin will help bootstraping sidechains.  
@_date: 2015-06-19 09:59:36
Replace-By-Fee is a horrible horrible idea, it will destroy most 0-confirm usecase today (which has acceptable risks),  it's an attack on bitcoin by altcoin developers.  
I will dump my coins if it get adopted.  
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:53:40
Then bitcoin must have been really big, really important. And i will time share a full node, and it will be a profitable business. Maybe i'll run one, make some money.  
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:52:05
But says even 1MB is too big.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:43:10
I think everyone is almost only paying attention to their own txs, even if he's running bitcoin full node as his wallet.   So using a web wallet does not reduce the attention he's paying, it only reduce the less important thing you mentioned: full nodes counts, machine verification.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:26:09
They are miners and techies with no stake, of course they want their work to be easier.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:59:17
I see why you are small and niche, which means bring less value to the ecosystem.  
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:10:50

@_date: 2015-06-08 19:48:01

@_date: 2015-06-11 18:49:21
You did complain about the bandwidth and the inconvenience of running a full node at blockstream, and said that  most businesses are outsourcing full nodes, so i think it's reasonable to say that blockstream is CONSIDERING outsourcing their full nodes.  
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:45:50

Useless if Bitcoin Core keep 1MB blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 10:33:48
Stop throwing your "Bitcoin is a O(n^2) network" around, it's simply not true, nobody will pay everybody on earth.  
Once sidechains get big, even you cut off the peg, the sidechains may live as an altcoin, that's not true to offchain.
Anyway, sidechains are competitors to bitcoin, compering for users, competing for resources, competing for developers, competing for eyeballs, so Blockstream supporting  1MB blocksize limit (jgarzik is not now) is a very very dirty play.  
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:35:49

Now they are arguing that nodes without inbound connection are as important as others, "because bitcoin is not bittorrent", though i remember that back then most devs agree that nodes without inbound connection are  almost useless to the network, how convenient!

Hmmm, if you have  business nodes, you should try harder, that's how businesses work.  If you have a personal node, you should evaluate the pros&amp;cons of running a node, make your decision.
After all, the bigger blocks are propogated through most nodes, that's  consensus.

I think bitcoin is still in a stage of desperately finding its real use case, and the currency is the latest and gradually realised use case. Speculation maybe be the main use case now, but as we run out of techi-libertarians, speculation is more dependent on other use cases. Don't push any use case out, please.

It's dropping mainly because many people switch to lightweight wallet.
People only run full nodes if they need it, you can't force average joe to run a full node even with 1MB limits, it's too bothersome.
Who need to run full nodes?  Businesses. So we need more businesses and we need to grow.
Maybe in the future, small businesses won't be able to run full nodes, but they still need it, how so? There will be businesses to run full nodes for them.

So why not raise the mainchain blocksize limit, and then you can creat your favorate 1MB sidechain, maybe it will become the mainchain when big blocksize chain fails.   
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:53:45


That's false claim.  1MB block is  enough for people to migrate to sidechains, the more crowding it is , the faster the migration.  
The while point of sidechain is to take advantage of bitcoin's network effect aka bitcoin's users.  The more incomfortable users on the main chain,  the happier users on the sidechains.
If blocksize gets bigger, innovation will happen on top of bitcoin , instead of besides bitcoin aka in sidechains.  
Is that right? @_date: 2015-06-09 13:46:16

@_date: 2015-06-20 05:45:11
Exactly. Blockstream keeps arguing that  bigger blocks are good for them, because SPV proof are somehow large.  But keeping blocksize small are even better for them, because it generates txs overflow which will be much more helpful for the flourish of their products, while 1MB is large enough for people who are forced to dump bitcoin and move to their solutions.  
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:34:20
So if there are 72 blocks full and 72 blocks half-full in a day, you think it's ok for users to wait for 1-12 hours to be confirmed?

A full block is  a full block, there isn't a blockchain where distance between blocks are always 10 minutes +- 10 seconds,  so the statistics are biased.  It biased the situation, make blockchain look like less full and the situation less urgent.

I think bitcoin is still in a stage of desperately finding its real use case, and the currency is the latest and gradually realised use case. Speculation maybe be the main use case now, but as we run out of techi-libertarians, speculation is more dependent on other use cases. Don't push any use case out, please.  
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:02:47

So how about let's make it easier, shrink the blocksize hard limit to 56KB ?  
I know there are tradeoffs here, all i argue is the tradeoffs  should be made by each nodes (and it will), not a central planning group.
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:21:47
I think there're already widespread agreement on blocksize raising? But some devs keep saying they generally agree, they agree generally, but doing nothing.  
So fork is the last answer.  Maybe in your opinion, it's not a widespread agreement without your blessing?   And it's ok to put bitcoin network into an unchartered FULL OF FULL BLOCKS situation?

Come on, you must have considered outsourcing full nodes, since it's so inconvenient.  Many "Big VC backed" companies are already outsourcing node operations, and you never considered it?  What makes Blockstream so special?   Maybe you should tell us, so we can have more business full nodes in the future, to decentralization.  
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:44:20

The interesting thing about the debate is:  all the altcoins devs want yo keep  bitcoins blocksize small and "safe".   name it.  
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:08:01
Please confirm. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 10:03:17
My point is, a full block is a full block, it delays confirmations, it makes users feeling bad.  By cherrypicking blocks, op excludes a lot of full blocks.  Average block size means nothing, when average blocksize reaches 800KB, users feeling will be pretty bad.  
Empty block doesn't make user feeling better, but full block definitely make users feeling bad.  So every full block should count, or the statistics mean nothing.  
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:41:34

Exactly. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:17:45
For most end users, it's just not cost-effective to run a full node, according to , even blockstream is considering outsourcing their full nodes.  I guess we need more businesses which can cost-effectively run full nodes.

@_date: 2015-06-11 14:56:40
Checkout 's recent post, and is basically saying the same thing:  "Using one full node is more important than simply running 1000 full nodes without using them".

If the transaction volumes (no the blocksize limit) are that big, i'm sure there will be more businesses be willing/able to run full nodes, because the economy is 20 times bigger than today.  Of course there will be some amateurs dropping out, so what? It's natural , it's evolution.  
@_date: 2015-05-20 10:13:51

I disagree with Cohen, when transaction overflows, every bit increase make a difference.
And i think you worry too much about decentralization, even with 10GB per block today, it's still affordable to many companies, it's not  such a rocket science, it's just we don't have that many big businesses today.   And if we've reached that size today, i'm sure there will be more full nodes than (7000). It should be businesses who run full nodes, not geeks.   
1MB block size will stifle  the economy, when transactions overflowing happens, we will be a joke. 
I'm not interested in stalking you nor pushing you out of reddit.  It's just so interesting that you want bitcoin to be a decentralized joke by supporting 1MB blocksize (or weaker edition of it).There must be reasons.

Sure, if they  receive the big spammy block first and they don't think these kind of blocks hurt their business(bitcoin price, future fees) much, they'll do that.  But as clever as you, i think they can figure out it's quite bad for their business, so i think they will reject it  :)

Because he's not a fool as you are? 
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:12:37
Full nodes should only be ran by whom need it.  As more transactions ticking, there will be more businesses which need to run a full node, the resources needed to run a node will be sum up in their business plan.  
I don't worry about personal hobby nodes decreased by Services like GreenAddress.  But it seems GreenAddree do not worry about their actions&amp;consequences, but worry about other businesses' (introduced in by more transactions room &amp; business oppertunities) actions&amp;consequences, so i think they are hypocritical on worrying about decentralization.

@_date: 2015-05-08 14:11:47
You have the illusion that whatever changes  "core" devs merged into the "bitcoin core", it will be ran by the vast majority of full nodes,         just like you have the illusion that if the "core" devs don't change the 1MB blocksize limit,  the vast majority of full nodes will do nothing to hit the wall and let the disasters happen.  
That's why you see no difference between the coins limit and the blocksize limit.

@_date: 2014-12-22 00:12:27
Are you sure it's the scarcity of blocksize make fees happen,  not the investment from miners (supply) and transacting needs from users(demand)?  Do you think it's possible for miners to work for free? If not, there will be fees;  If yes, why bother? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:40:22
Then i guess it's a good business to spam the blocks, and it's good for the mining industry, and it's good for the bitcoin economy, right?    If killing bitcoin is profitable for miners, they will, and they can, at least for some period of time.

Trust is hard to earn and easy to destroy for businesses, unless you are in monopoly. Ask Bitstamp.
I see you don't trust businesses, but you are eating foods they provide, so basically you are betting your life on their good behaviour. Don't tell me you are relying on FDA.
Bitcoin has to accomodate the demands as much as it can, or it will die or replaced by other chains can do better.  Business is not that horrible, sometimes i find it more truthworthy than most individuals.


I should clear it up, by "banks" i mean "bitcoin banks,  businesses can always be their own bitcoin banks by running full nodes themselves, with 0-rely on bitcoin banks.
Individuals with enough resource (enough to acommodate a global transaction network's full nodes) can always choose to run their own full nodes, be their own full banks.
Individuals without enough resources can give up some security and enjoy the services that businesses provide -But still in control of their own private keys. And along technological progress, maybe oneday they will be able to run a complete full nodes of a global transaction network, who knows, no one imagine we could have wikipedia in our pockets 20 years ago.


It's not businesses' fault,  with gold you have to trust 3rd parties to transact even if you are businesses with resources. Come to bitcoin, there's choices for businesses and  individuals with certain resources.  
It's the situation now: The bitcoin core is almost runnable for everybody now, yet few people's running it because lack of interest(profit),  yet here'are many capable businesses and individuals out there not running the full nodes because bitcoin not big enough,  they don't bother to run it.
I say we boost the economy first, better across the globe, eliminate obvious obstacles.  Then even governments will need 51% to enforce a bitcoin rule.

They can remove it,  but the rest of the nodes (users/merchants/wallets/exchanges) won't (and it's not because "core" devs won't), so it's pointless.
It's all about how the users do and what users need.  And most users want bitcoin to scale/live/can-kicking.

I don't understand, why people hate big capable miners?  It's a open business , fair play ground.  Compete!   Just because you can't (actually you can by joining a pool) then it is somehow evil?   
My point is, if miners are spamming, maybe it's a source of value.  If it's not,  miners won't spam.    I think miners are  in align with bitcoin businesses/hodlers, more than some coredevs.

The centralization argument is false.  As transaction volumes grow, there will be more people/businesses be able/willing to run full nodes, so more decentralization.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:04:29
Because what you mean is, nodes decreased by us, that's ok, it's still a decentralized network, at least we add 1 more business node;  It's not ok for other businesses (introduced by more txes room) to decrease personal nodes and adding their business nodes, that's centralization, that's dangerous.

Does  exchange  rate matter here?

If it has fees, i think it's ok. If it's zero-fee, i think miners will kill it.
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:09:29


People choose to centralize, the key word is CHOOSE. That's what happend to full node counts in the past couple of years, most wallet users CHOOSE to use SPV wallets. You cant blame users, you cant blame growth, instead, if it's not because of growth, there will be far less business nodes.
 If the risk/cost of centralization supass the cost saved by centralization, they will decentralize again - one way or another,   they still have the choice of decentralization. Bitcoin is information which is the most uncontrolable thing in the world.
I think that's ok, that's enough.      
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:20:19
Just use THE  blockchain. It's ok as long as you pay fees.  If we have 1TB full blocks today, and fee is only 1bit/tx, miners will have  100k BTC in fees everyday, i'm not worried about nobody will mine &amp; run full nodes.  
@_date: 2015-05-07 07:53:24

@_date: 2015-05-05 01:46:11
It is possible, but it will be rejected by the community, and they will lose money, thay's the whole logic.  
You think if the limit is removed, then the mining community will wait for/accept whatever size blocks? You are being naive.  Even with 1MB hardlimit,  there were still time when most miners reject blocks bigger than 500k, it's called soft/market/dynamic limit.
So, can you tell me again how bitcoin work ?
  
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:56:49

It's their cost to transmit / store the huge block , right? Also risking being orphaned because it takes too long to peopogate through the network.  Anyway, what's the benefit for them?   If he want,  he can include no transactions too, strangle bitcoin to death, but most miners don't do that, it's not in their best interests.  
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:19:23

@_date: 2015-05-07 12:17:17
There's incentives to centralize under 1MB too, how do you suggest to fix that? Litecoin want to decentralize mining, miners always find a way yo "centralize"(be efficient).  Instead of worrying about mining pool centralization, I don't see it a problem as long as investors care about bitcoin's price.

Maybe because you are big miners then, and you are small miners now (you didn't invest much)?

Bigger blocks means bigger economy, means more capitialized miners, not necessary less miners(maybe less incapable miners) and more centralization.  And i think richer miner is more honest than poor miner.  Poor only leads to  more evil. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 09:03:52
Well said. pm @_date: 2015-05-04 07:39:32
When bitcoin transaction volumes/ economies grow, there will be more businesses be willing/able to run full nodes, and more decentralization.
If we keep blocksize as it is and bitcoin spreads across the world,  there will be few people be able to make onchain transactions, most people need to use offchain transactions, they don't have choices at all.   Bigger blocksize give people choices.  
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:18:11
Yes, as a hodler, you should support it , or there's no reason to hodl.  
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:43:19
Business hodlers are for bigger blocks.
Big hodlers are capable of running bigger block nodes if they want.
Small hodlers do not bother running nodes already.
Who's obsessed in everybody running their own nodes? You Decentralization Extremists.
You guys sort of have problem in trusting free market aka free choice. If people want to run nodes they can, bigger block nodes is open for everybody.  If they are not capable, they can delegate to other people.  
Food is more critical than money, yet most people are not capable to grow/produce their own food, Do you think it's dangerous?  You see how ridiculous to ask everybody to be able to run their own nodes?

@_date: 2015-05-05 01:07:50
If we get to 20MB, there will be a much bigger economy, hence more miners/competitors, not less.   
Big miner is not bad miner, as long as it is a fair play.

If small companies like yours are able to run a full node at a small cost of budget, as we grow, more businesses like you who HAVE to run full nodes WILL run full nodes,how decentralized it is!  
What's your definition of decentralization?  Every Home PC?  Every PC since 2000?  Or every mobile phone?   Maybe we should shrink blocksize limit to 10KB to make it possible to run full nodes on every smart phone? That's more decentralized.

@_date: 2015-05-06 08:44:14
Even if it is true, at least they are still decentralizing the network, keeping a full copy of the bitcoin history, for their own benefit.  As long as they are profitable, they will keep doing that. I think that's still more robust than nodes ran by amateurs -They come when prices are high, go when prices are low, totally unstable.  
We need/will get more business nodes.

As you said, miners may fill the block with self-made zero-fee transactions, just like they can exclude all the transactions and make a coinbase-tx-only empty block, what's the benefit?  If  most miner don't make empty blocks, they won' t make blocks full of garbage either. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 12:17:33
I think they have two options: Sell as GBTC or redeem as BIT, and the later one does not require a 12 months lockup ?  also paging @_date: 2015-05-31 13:44:19
@_date: 2015-05-07 08:40:13
Sure, if mining industry is acting against most users/businesses best interest, users will just dump them. The same rule apply to "core" devs.
Mining industry rely on bitcoin's prosper, no less than "core" devs, what makes you think they will act against bitcoin's prosper?
Mining industry is more decentralized than "core" devs. If there's something centralized in bitcoin, it's "core" devs. 
I really don't understand the hate  among the "core" devs.
Why worry so much?  
@_date: 2015-05-05 03:18:41
Short-term miners bring short-term problems, and they can't outcompete long-term miners due to the cost, and long-term miners will protect their long-term interest by rejecting spammy blocks, so it's not a big deal.  
And thanks, i'll read it.

@_date: 2015-05-05 21:41:35
Totally agree. We should remove the hard limit and let nodes make their own soft limit. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:45:14
Nope, miners still require some fees despite the block is not full.   Not every transaction without fee can confirm quickly.

Can you redeem 1 share?
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:07:43
So, you are proud to see us hitting a wall of backlog?  Proud of pushing users out beacause of your fabulous long term vision which most merchants and users disagree with you?  
It's natural to consume more resources to run a full node as transaction volume grows, what's wrong with that?  If it's not because of bitcoin's fast growing(short term), you guys in blockstream can't even raise $21M.  Unless you see this a negative thing and think we're growing too fast.
Do you think we'll have less nodes than 6000(now) if the network transactions hit 1GB/block?  I doubt that.  If you cut personal nodes(wallet purpose) out, do you think we have less nodes than 2011 ?
Your only valid-ish argument is "This kind of growing will increase centralization thus destroy bitcoin", and i don't agree with that too.

For average users, you have to chose a full nodes to serve you.  As a business, you don't need to trust anyone if you run a full nodes.  
Compare to financial system today, we still have a finite currency,  businesses so not need to rely on banks, they can always run a full nodes.  For average joe, it's not feasible to run his own full nodes, and it's too troublesome to run it.

By concentration you are suggesting most current full nodes will quit, but i think as the economy flourishing, there will be more businesses joining and running full nodes.  So it's dynamic expansion, not concentration.

The question is: 
Will most users/businesses  run full nodes with a modified coins supply? No, they want the scarcity of coins supply.
Will most users/businesses run full nodes with a larger blocksize limit?
Yes, they want to scale and don't want a disaster.
The only thing matters is users' desire.  Do "core" devs have any say on this? Not much. They should follow, or  they'll be forgetted.

Their argument is that raising the limit is not solving the problem (ultimately), instead we should let the limit be reached and let transactions overflow and been dropped.   
By doing that, we will create a market where users competing on fees and drive those low-fee 'spam' transactions to another sidechain or offchain systems.

You are assuming in 20 years later, miners are still solely living on fees, you don't know that as bitcoin grows huge, just like you don't know many free things on the internet.  With small blocks, bitcoin is doomed. Is that what you want?

and we are not even close to that.
if we run above 1MB and the network keeps dropping txes, it will be a disaster, and a huge damage to bitcoin's reputation?  is that what you want?

The question is: 
Will most users/businesses  run full nodes with a modified coins supply? No, they want the scarcity of coins supply.
Will most users/businesses run full nodes with a larger blocksize limit?
Yes, they want to scale and don't want a disaster.
The only thing matters is users' desire.  Do "core" devs have any say on this? Not much. They should follow, or  they'll be forgetted.

If this is not a quota, then what is a quota ? 


That's right, if users want to do 2MB legit txes every 10 minutes, then 1MB blocksize limit is pushing users away, that's ridiculous.  And we are approaching that case, and some people still say: let's keep it, let it be full and see what happens.

Decentralization is never well-defined, so is consensus. Core use decentraluzation and consensus to defend their arguments, but never bother to define them.  
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:59:23
Most users never run Bitcoin Core client currently with blocks smaller than 1MB, 
many users don't even hold their private keys - which is far easier than running a full node.  
So, do you mean we should kick them out because they don't value bitcoin correctly? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:45:30
I agree! though it has nothing to do with "fair".

So in your opinion : blocks propagate slow is not good, it will give big miners advantage to push out small miners; blocks propagate fast is not good , it will give big  miners advantages too?  Maybe it's big miners bad?

There's one thing called priority, right? 
@_date: 2015-05-04 07:27:42
 Why we have fees today? The block is not full?  Fee argument is the weakest argument against  bigger (or unlimited)blocksize, yet someone is still using it. 
Offchain txes is not a solution , it introduces the needs of third party, which bitcoin try to eliminate.  You know what?  If blocksize keep at 1MB,  most transactions will happen through 3rd parties, that's a nightmare.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:59:01

Then they should disable their blockchain infomation service, because it make users too lazy to run their own full nodes thus hurt decentralization. That's what i'm talking about.

Miners don't run nodes way back 2011 when blocks are smaller than 0.1MB (glad we still have 10x room back then), pools do.  Pools are already capable of processing 20MB blocks.  I don't buy it.
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:28:01
I think miners care about funding more Than “core devs”, and they are more worried by not raising the limit.

Most of the changes
are just small modfications, see the +/- lines are almost the same.
I'm already not running Bitcoin Core, and many important nodes are not running Core from the begining (Coinbase, BitPay), but miners are.   The false impression that Bitcoin Core committers are irreplaceable stopped some  miners moving away from Core.
The CEO of Blockstream Austin Hill said we owe committers “loyalty" in Davos.  I did a lot with bitcoin, all for my own good. And i think everybody should.  If someone says he's doing for the public good,  he's a liar.

Be careful, your transactions might be considered spam by "core" devs, which is ok to not be confirmed.   
@_date: 2015-05-07 09:43:04


Price can't be controlled, saddly :) Though it's an important factor of mining incentive, and of course it is aligned with users.
Transaction fees can be increased in two ways: using more, paying the same;  using the same, paying more.  You are suggesting the later.  You see how anti-market it is?  
Miners will charge users(or even better,  charge for free, like most web services today, who knows) to make a profit, don't worry for them starving to death.
Miners will act in their own interest (bitcoin's security/prosper/price), which is aligned with businesses/users.   Don't worry for them  robbing users to filthy rich.

No big deal, though i doubt you can count a full hundred thousand lines of code.  
Bitcoin Core is just one project, and the core committers are just mid level managers of this open soIrce project.  They are not our boss, and they can easily be replaced.  
I always think contributers of  open source project should code for their own good (profit or self fulfill), if  they think people owe something (loyalty or debt) to them, they should quit contribIting immediately.  
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:16:25
but i guess some developers are making excuses to NEVER upgrade 1MB blocksize limit ,like it's too risky, there's not enough conscious , in order to pump their sidechains/offchains/bitcoin2.0/scamcoins whatever.

Sorry, Adam Back has nothing to do with the past 6 years work.    And honestly,  it's the enormous number of entrepreneurs who build the ecosystems around the mainnet who brought us to where we are now. The Core devs did little since Satoshi left,  they haven't even changed the 1MB limit which Satoshi put there.  If there're something good, i think P2SH and database switch are two, the former one was completed by Gavin and the later one is Hearn's idea and prototype.   
Core devs are not as important as the community (especially some miners) imagined.

This hard fork could be planed  way back when it's not so close to the limit and not so intense like now, but you didn't do that, and you don't even want to do it now.   
Don't pretend that you want to raise the block size,  if segwit is not softfork-able (which are more dangerous and messy than a hard fork).

So miners shouldn't compete?  Weak mimers should survive?  That's socialism.
If miners act against users' best interest, users can always fork them out, or use another hash algorithm. Bitcoin's value come from users.

I think the difference between bitcoin and democracy is, it's not that easy to get away from the democratic decision, but you can easily leave bitcoin if you don't like it or make your own altcoin,  it's not coercive. 
If you want to enjoy the network effect of the economic majority, you have to follow the rules of the majority, even if it's constantly changing.   
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:32:28
The only difference is the user experiences are better in 8MB chain.
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:16:48
If it (removing the 21m coins cap) is what the majority users want,  it will happen, if it's not and 51% miners pushing for it (just like core devs pushing for keeping the 1mb cap), then the economic majority will fork them (SHA256 algorithm) out, just like bitcoinXT forking Bitcoin Core devs out right now.   Consesus ia defined by the economic majority, not devs. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:08:46
Actually, Blockstream is the divisive one, they think bitcoin is their bitch, turns out it's not.  
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:53:07
Exactly. But some devs think they are in charge, miners can't be trusted, merchants can't be trusted, users don't know what they want, only some devs know the right path.

Users will complain, businesses will get nervous by losing users (maybe not GreenAddress) and switch to Bitcoin XT , because Bitcoin Core will never raise the blocksize.

@_date: 2015-08-19 01:30:30
On the contrary , the fork which means several devs (the most centralized part of the ecosystem) cannot act against users' will is most bullish thing ever happened to Bitcoin.

It's nothing but a distraction, because it will never be adopted into Bitcoin Core.

Hi Hector,
BIP 100 isn't currently implemented. I guess we'd put together some more concrete thoughts if and when it is coded up.
My initial thoughts are that I prefer BIP 101 because:
The BIP 100 voting mechanism doesn't seem fully thought out. A majority of miners can always win any vote because they can just orphan blocks that contain votes for something they don't like. So the more complex approach doesn't seem really robust.
But that'd require special code. If most miners just adopt the defaults, then it's possible for a minority of hash power to drag the block size down to nearly nothing. 
It's quite common for miners to just accept whatever the defaults are, regardless of whether they make sense. That's why we still see 750kb blocks sometimes when the network is actually backlogged (XT fixes this).
I think the reason is that miners, not unreasonable, assume the Bitcoin Core developers are selecting default behaviour in sensible ways. Alas it's not the case anymore, because they feel choosing opinionated defaults is "centralising". This is why the XT manifesto specifically states we will pick defaults as we think best.
The BIP100 default is 1 megabyte. Thus by default miners would be voting for no change. However what we need is change!
It gives miners additional power to modify the system for no obviously good reason beyond "some miners are saying they'd like more power". Miners are not the only stakeholders. Users, merchants, exchanges, etc matter too - if not more!
The upper limit is meant to be a kind of DoS limit, to stop troll miners generating giant mega-blocks. It's not meant to be a stick that miners can use to beat important but voteless economic players.
There's a risk that someone comes up with a business plan like this:   we will build a giant ASIC farm in the middle of a desert at the end of a piece of string and tin can (i.e. no bandwidth). This will be super cheap because of abundant land/solar/wind/whatever and the lack of bandwidth won't matter because we can just drag down the block size limit to ensure tiny blocks.
This would of course hurt the entire ecosystem for their own short term benefit, but BIP 100 would let them do that with just a small amount of the overall hash power.
Miners have just one job: order transactions by time. They shouldn't be doing anything else, and arguably, people already freak out about the concentration of power in the hands of big mining pools. BIP 100 would make this issue worse.

It's not full and its cost is zero, in your logic, this shouldn't happen.  
What i really mean is there are fee market already:
Marginal-fee transactions ALREADY compete to get into a block, even at the current average block size of about 300kbytes. See  for a nice graph (uses JavaScript to draw the graph).
Why do you think that would stop being true with a larger maximum block size?

That doesn't make sense. I think only few people in the world hate sound money and benefit from manipulating the monetary system.   And huge nodes with many people connecting to them is far less dangerous than offchain-txes-servers with alot of people relying on it( mtgox etc, if you keep 1MB blocksize limit, there must be plenty of them), even on the regulation risk. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:52:26

Micropayment channel isn't that magical, it only combines several micro payments into one transactions.  These payments must happen between the same two parties in a relatively short peroid of time.  It can reduce the txes volume a little bit, but not much.  You can't be serious to think that it will keep blocksize below 1MB if bitcoin flourish.

How about no lockup time like the original chain, is LN capable of doing that?  
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:34:33

  90 deposit   9 reserve  81 credit
  81 deposit   8.1 reserve 72.9 credit
1000 deposit 100 reserve 900 credit
In the end, banks create $900 credit out of $100 reserve with a 10% reserve rate.   
@_date: 2015-09-08 10:07:29
No, i was forced to use LN, according to small-blockistans, so how about eliminating the lockup-time and keeping it safe like the original network?  
@_date: 2015-09-02 04:05:32
Sure, but XT do give miners a vote to activate the big blocks, it's not a sham as you claimed. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 23:38:20
there's no backing
@_date: 2015-09-19 01:15:27
Hub-and-spoke network tend to centralize, due to cost and network effect. So what's the point of lightning when we can simply raise the blocksize limit, miners will still be profitable and fees will be much low.  
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:44:33
Nope, banks lend out money they don't have, aka credit.

@_date: 2015-09-20 14:46:42
Lightning is not what blockstream built for, and it's not created or worked on by any "core" devs.  
I'll argue that lightning is not an decentralized scaling option, because hubs, not like bitcoin full nodes,tend to centralize due to network effect. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:55:02

Gold/silver coin is not a good medium of exchanhe in morden world, if you insist.  
Free market votes for FRBs because the failing speed is too slow, keeping coins are expensive, proving yourself as a full reserve bank is hard so the difference is trivial.   All these are due to lack of good medium of exchange that people can transact without third party in a morden world, store/carry cheaply,  do accounting easily etc, right?    
In simple words, we can't live without banks before, we can now.

FUD!  We need to scale up, or we are doomed.

Quite the opposite.  Increasing the blocksize will allow more people to send bitcoin peer to peer, thus more decentralization.

This Willy Report thing was the most popular mis-interpretion in bitcoin history, sometimes i thought it was intended to be mis-interpreted.    BItcoin price shoot up because of China, and shoot down because Mtgox created and dumped 650K fake coins.  So mtgox actually deflated bitcoin price.

These stories demonstrate one thing: gold is not a good medium of exhange.  These FRBs keep failing and people keep losing their life-savings, after that they keep depositing in banks, because they really can't transact without banks.  I don't know why BOA change its policy, but the fact that people can't transact without bank (so not so much withdrawl pressure make the con run longer) make this advantage (safer) trivial, but i'm not sure that's the whole story.

I disagree, full nodes are not equal, a full nodes with faster connection and faster HDD (eg blockchain.info nodes) is much more important than a full node that are running by hobbist who are complaining about the bandwidth consumption and disk loads.   By mandating a gradual increasing MAXBLOCKSIZE , we cann't grow faster than that size, which is absurd.  Growing the economy is the only sound way to increase full nodes.

yes, you do? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:00:40

I don't know why should average joe be able to run full nodes? What's the point?    Is average joe be able to mine now? As long as bitcoin full nodes is open to run, it is ok, if it is too hard for you to run, it's a good thing, bitcoin is flourishing, it's your problem, deal with it.

@_date: 2015-02-07 09:22:07
Sure there will be banks, and there will be FRBs, and FRBs will keep failing (like mtgox).  the key difference is people can transact without a bank. Bitcoin will be easier and easier to hold yourelf, if you don't want to hold yourself, there will be 100% reserved banks which will be less likely to fail, just like exchanges with proof of reserves after the mtgox collapse.

Value is subjective, if people want it , then it get a value.  Why people want bitcoin ? It's scarce, no one controls it, it's international, it has near-zero fee, it's pseudonym, it has no weight, you can transfer it all over the world in seconds...
