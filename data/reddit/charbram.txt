Yeah, wtf?

It would have to be external since he’s accessing the Internet. And who the hell leaves a trading bot running with no remote access? Especially when you can throw an OpenVPN server up on a raspberry pi fairly easily.

Bot Farm?

There is another way FYI. Get rid of mining and have every participant in the network perform consensus operations before they send are able to one transaction. It’s always been weird to me that only a small part of the network performs consensus.

Quality comment.

Well, yeah, but that's manual AF.

And this is why Lightning Network is doomed to fail in my opinion.  May be unpopular to say around here but I think it’s a bad solution.

That probably would have been a better comment then.

The Ripple method sounds like it will not scale either. What happens with the trusted servers get over loaded?

I have seen much worse examples. Good try though. Can’t wait for your next comment.

So what do you think about the DAG based coins like IOTA and RaiBlocks?

Who are the best minds?  And how much experience do you have evaluating software engineers?

No, each wallet has an address and then a top secret private key. In the paper wallet you would record both these numbers manually and then you basically have your wallet.

Is there a gif version of this?
