Why post anything on reddit?  Why did you reply in this thread and what goal do you hope to accomplish in doing so?  Such broad based questions could be asked of anyone that started any thread of any topic.  People like to share and discuss with others that have similar interests.  If it doesn't do anything for you just ignore it.

You have to keep/find your trade history, calculate gains and losses, report it on your tax return and then pay it.  The math can become a bit tricky if you start buying and selling incrementally.  You have you have to carefully look at cost basis and which cost flow assumption you use.

He made a relevant comment and contributed to the conversation.  Your response is pretty stupid by comparison.

You can transfer from GDAX with no fee.  So you can get coins out of coinbase without a fee but first must transfer to GDAX.

How are you going to prove that to the IRS though?  You can't just say hey I lost my crypto and write it off.

"Worth it" is a relative statement, no one here can answer that question for him.  My point is investing a small amount is no more or less worth it then investing a larger sum.  Your comment reads like the small value makes it not worth it whereas if he had more money it would be.

If you wanted to buy when the price rose to x price you would use a stop order.   Stops are not shown on the order book, when executed they are just market orders triggered by a certain price.  
If you used a limit buy at a price higher then the market it would be triggered immediately and be treated as a market order.
You don't see buy orders at 21000 because no one is offering to buy at 21000 when people are settling for less than 20000.  You would just be giving away money.

Mutual funds generally distribute captial gains and income at the end of the year.  It is a taxable event even if it is immediately reinvested into the fund.

Its not a matter of maximizing value but managing risk..  Securing a good sum of money for his son's future and investing it in a 529 will pretty much guarantee that there is something there in 17 years.  But in 17 years those 3 bitcoin may be worth millions or they could be worth nothing.  He isnt willing to risk the potential loss when it comes to his sons education.  Its not all about bigger numbers.

Chewing through a wall at 20000 takes less $ then it would to chew through the same amount of coin spread from 20000-20300.    People selling under the wall just miss out on that much when the wall is breached.  It really doesn't make a difference one way or the other.  In the end if people think the coin is more valuable then the wall they will buy it up,  if not then the wall stands.   It doesn't really harm the ecosystem imo.  In fact breaching a large wall gives confidence in the price.  Rather then just jumping above and below it for a while.  Half the time the walls get pulled when it's obvious it's going to be bought through.

Who is we, and what evidence do you have to support that?  Sounds like another hot take with little to no actual basis.

Hey guys I don't like seeing certain things so if we could just change the rules and sticky this to inform everyone that be great.  Lmao.  This post is more irrelavant then the ones your complaining about.

All you can see on GDAX is limit orders.   Essentially people saying I'm willing to pay this much and others saying I'm willing to sell for this much.   No limit buy orders exist above the current market price,  similarly no limit sell orders exist below the current market price.     
For example if you were to place a limit buy at 21000 while the current market price is sitting around 20000 your order will be instantly be filled.   Keep in mind a limit order is saying I want this price or better.   So your limit buy at 21000 is going to be filled at 20000.
Same thing with a limit sell at 19000.  It will instantly trigger and sell for 20000 in this example.

No problem I did a doubletake when I read it.

The sum of money is irrelevant.  There is nothing wrong with making a small investment.   Not everyone is willing or able to buy whole coins.   That's why investments are compared by %, everyone is playing with different amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:50:11
It went cancel only for a bit then they just wiped it.  As of this post the order book is empty.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:09:11
You would use a stop buy in that case.   You cannot view everyone else's stops.   Keep in mind a stop is executed as a market order.  So if the price really spiked quickly your order might execute at a price well above your stop price.

It has nothing to do with "learning experience."  The point is that everyone has a different amount of $ that they are willing to invest based on a multitude of variables.   The amount of money your coming to the table with is not what makes it worth it or not to play.   The odds are what make it worth it, the odds are the same whether you bet big or small.  Returns are measured by % for a reason, because it gives you a value independent of the $ invested.   Investing is about getting the most out of your money relative to your risk tolerance.    There is no such thing an investment that is too small or too large.
In your case of wanting "easy cash" again it doesn't matter if you have a lot or a little to invest.  The return is just as "easy" regardless of how much you put in.  Sure you won't make as much $ with a smaller investment relative to a larger one, but your going to substantially more then if you invest nothing at all.  
There is always going to be someone betting bigger then you,  that doesnt mean you should just stand on the sideline.  Frankly there is no such thing as fast easy cash.   You either play or you don't, there are no free lunches here.
I'm not trying to argue your decision, that's a personal decision that is entirely yours to make.  It's more the about the perspective on investing that I am commenting on.

Think about this.   Why would you need to sell to USD in order to use another exchange?  Bitcoin and other coins can be sent from one exchange to another, as they were designed to be used as a currency.   Converting back to USD to move exchanges would be a slow and potentially expensive way to do it.

Exactly if demand always equaled supply like he said the price would never change...  It's kinda scary how many people that comment so confidently on these topics when they very obviously don't understand basic economic principles.
