Yes, there will be no immediate financial incentive. But if you want the utopia that bitcoin can bring, you would lend in order to create the economic activity that comes along with lending. This could be the make or break reason whether bitcoin wins or loses. Are there people who out there who aren't in it for greed?

First and foremost, interest is a hedge against inflation. You lend me $100 today with my promise to pay back that $100 at a later date. That $100 paid back at a later date will always be "less in value" due to inflation, so you charge me interest at whatever rate. That rate is because you truly don't know what inflation will be. Take Venezuela for example.
Because bitcoin is inherently deflationary by principal, this relieves the necessity to charge interest. The value of 1 bitcoin tomorrow will have the same if not more value than 1 bitcoin today. No necessity to charge interest unless you are a greedy bastard.
On the economic side of lending, if there are lenders willing to charge little to no interest on a loan (because hopefully they aren't greedy pricks) why would one choose to obtain a loan from someone charging a high interest rate. That type of competition will lead to an economy of lending where little to no interest will be charged.

You naturally brought us to the solution that I think you were searching in your OP. Clearly, we realize that there is still a huge necessity for credit bureaus and how credit 'worthiness' is to be determined. One of the largest factors in lending money even today is mainly determined by your credit score. Because the blockchain (and bitcoin) is transparent (capable of being audited), this would create the necessity to completely re-evaluate how credit is determined. Scores will likely become more precise at determining an individuals ability to repay loans.
