I'm advocating that you should receive 100% of your money. But you're saying you'll accept 65% and some IOU's. There shouldn't be any freezing of anyone's assets but the CEO's.

Texas resident here. Bitfinix doesn't store Texas residents cash. They're require you to open a second account with Tether where you can convert your cash  into tethers and then transfer your tethers to Bitfinix where you can't then convert your tethers into BTC. And if you want to cash out you do everything in reverse. 
If Bitfinix can be so easily hacked then I imagine Tether is even more susceptible considering your money sits in either cash or tethers. 
The hassle of jumping through hoops just to trade really turned me off on the whole BTC thing. 
I'd rather focus on trading forex where hacking is less of an issue and I could sleep comfortably at night.

This article is bullshit. Traders are not at fault and should only be ever stand to lose 100% of their investment by *investing* not by hackers. What if the hackers return next year or next month?
I don't see how users should lose a single red cent. They don't deserve it. BFX is completely at fault and should receive 100% the blame and repercussions for this attack.

Yeah I'm thinking of going the safest route and trying to cancel/delete my account. I mentioned in another post if I had to trade any currencies I feel much safer putting my money in the forex markets.

Most app today at least have a modern UI. I came across this app on my own recently while looking for wallets and was put off by the old look. I wouldn't be too concerned with someone that *looks* as sketchy as this app does.

That's what I was afraid of.

Those BFX tokens will begin trading at $1 and will become nearly worthless in a matter of minutes.

Because they only check for malicious code. Routing transactions to a personal account isn't anything that would arouse suspicion.
