"This study shows that humans can average around 2.5hrs/day of focus, the rest of the day is creating and accomplishing other tasks and not being productive."
I don't agree a quant is good and better in some case but not better than a great trader especially to found inside information and make new partnership.... Fine for private task not for manage money. The best manager in the world doesn't use Quant. Ex : Paul Tudor or Steven Cohen it's only Inside Information, Money  and Smartest guy to win.

Read all my comments into this post. We don't make the same job and obviously we don't think in same way. 
More information : 
It is a meticulous and highly dangerous job (money transfer, security agent are part of the job) we are talking about millions or even billions of dollar and not 5000$ on a Ledger Nano.
No one here is trying to make him spit money through a phising.

For me too... No sorry Inside Information but if you go to your branch and ask your banker he'll certainly give you the same answer.

For your trading which pair do you trade? Best liquidity go with the pair  BTC/USDT in Binance. If you want leverage go to Kraken. If you want perpetual and Future contract  go to Bitmex. You can also use Bitstamp very safe and you don't have any limitations for withdrawal in your Bank Account, the only problem in Bitstamp you can't margin trade.

All these guy are billionaires or and multi millionaires. Bitstamp it's a legit exchange with big partnership like Swissquote.com it's like one of the older big exchange without margin or futures.  Arthur take long position in 100% he's insider so he know when buy when the volume into the platform grow up he can read the pattern a long time ago a story about bitmex show that inside the company employees make inside trading....  For binance same things in worse..... CZ  and all bots programmed by his dark team control the market. We are in a no regulate market. If you have money or information you can make what you want!
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:02:48
The important thing is the amount he wants to invest, many are in the business without knowing much about Bitcoin. As long as it goes up, they're happy.  But I understand a lot of scamming in this environment. If that's it, one Ledger Wallet will do the job.

No no no you don't have the good mind. If you don't trade then create a cold wallet so buy and hold. Actually you have good opportunity to trade. 
Bitstamp is better you don't have limitation about withdrawal and Swiss Bank like Swissquote.com using the platform for his customers.
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:02:39
Binance have a great volume with the pair BTC/USDT you can easily and rapidly  buy or sell your Bitcoin. Because it's USDT aka Tether the price was more volatile than BTC /USD  compared to Bitstamp for exemple. So you can make better trade depend to your skill or your Bot Strategies. You can margin into Binance so if you have 1000$ you can add X3 to your actual amount so 3000$. The margin is very poor compared to Bitmex or Kraken :
Kraken : 
For Bitmex you can read : https://
Tutorial : 
Concretely with this contract you can in maximum(x100) so  buying 10 Bitcoin with only 0.1 BTC. It's extremely dangerous but if you are good very very profitable.

Do you know the story of people that buy Ledger On Ebay? Seed was previously seen and people losing money. Why make any risks for 20$?

Here is his post:

Here's where we find out how he was scammed.  The scam Ledger Nano (bought on Ebay) came with a "scratch off" paper, to reveal the seed words.  With a real Ledger Nano, the seed words are generated by the device.

Low liquidity. If someone have 1 million and leverage to x10 into a air coin with a volume of 40K$ per day the shorter himself can't be sure that he earn one penny. Too much liquidity is like a ponzi : you need to wait someone to put more.  I can manipule the market too easily. If Bitcoin is still a lot speculative you can't play with margin for air coin. 
You put thousand dollars, OK I come up with 10,000 and you're dead instantly. The actual volume ratio will also be too much of a mess.You might not even have time to see your order being carried out before you're dead or even 300% of profit ��������So bot algorithms recommended.

Lol Linux too... Many attacks against Unix,Debian,Linux,Ubuntu Infrastructure in 2019.
Use an open source OS with Tor nods and don't connect into internet. Then buy a lot of USB Keys encrypt the Full Drive with 3 differents algorithms (with an open source software) and put your passphrase into. Make again a second encryption with pgp with an other passwords. Don't use Ledger,Trezor or something else for storage. 
When you want to deposit use monero before to make a trade. You have now "fresh" Bitcoin. Keep in your mind that Bitcoin is not untracable and Privacy. Monero can give you the possibility to hide your wallet ammount and your full BlockChain historic.
And yes, even you have the best virtual security if someone want to rob you, he will use factors such as your friends, family and even torture to get to you information. In the end, all its security is superfluous.

Binance with credit card(10$ per transaction) No KYC under 2 btc per day.  You can trade to Kraken too  or using ShapeShift.  You can buy scan of real ID and create an account with them. In 2019 you are a lot of possibility. You can still also using localbitcoin and contact directly the seller. You can go to Bitcoin talk and found someone to make a real deal with you ( I can make the same for you) but I understand that a lot of people don't trust anybody into internet and in your case i would have done the same. Going through an escrow is always very advisable.

Do not look for a past / future correlation on the stock market and especially on cryptocurrency you have no coherent pattern. 
It's mostly the: okay, a conglomerate of whales decide to pump or dump the coins and here it goes up or down. All it takes is a few million. Bitcoin is not to be outdone. Always the rich who win if you can get the same state of mind then you will win too! 
It seems you've forgotten the time between the end of 2017 and 2019: 1 year and a half without much volatility and the dump is not even over for altcoins. no confidence. Even if it goes up if you need liquidity you can't afford to wait so long in such a speculative market when the dow jones doubles at the same time when the stocks are doing +400% you, you lose or make 10-15% on an unregulated market so without protection against hackers, stealers or even scammers.
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:34:44
