I respect you man, Bitcoin is a piece of History and a step into the Future!  
Think about it this way... People get loans for Houses, cars, hobbies, purses, shoes, watches - the main thing is doing what makes you happy, and if that's owning 1 BTC then do what you need for it!
@_date: 2019-07-10 09:42:05
what happened yesterday was yesterday, give me Bitcoin today!
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:22:50
300k for you is a risk, its clearly not a risk for him if he's on reddit talking about it
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:09:21
if youre happy thats what matters, but i'd just spend my money on actual bitcoins not mining miniscule amounts. But atleast you're happy - right?
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:20:27
Yup, imagine the price of BTC in those days - you could miss out on a good price.
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:47:48
New Coinbase rules, that deposits take 5-12 days to clear. Unless youre playing with over $1k is it within a few hours. Switch to another exchange IMO.

All my fiat in is Bitcoin, unless i need to buy something immediately i convert it - simple!
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:42:17
I was going to buy a ticket to Thailand but then Bitcoin went past $4000... HODL!
@_date: 2019-03-12 10:33:20
The same way you turn goods and services into Bitcoin?  People buy Rs-gold all over the internet for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:05:34

Future technology says it tried but couldn't find any - resulting in a meteoric rise in btc :( ... no cheap coins this time lads!
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:58:08
you don't go on news or anywhere talking about what you don't know.. this is a case of a smart person pretending to be smart.

What a time to be alive / We're always the last ones to hit them milestones!
@_date: 2019-08-31 19:14:14
I earn then convert to Bitcoin and forget about it and then earn more to reinvest. Spending my money on what i want for me is buying more Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:49:32
no question, no second guessing - we are over $10k.
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:53:40
you're not wrong!
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:50:50
you'd have to be some special type of fool to even give any of this crap any energy.
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:11:05

How about get a job and gamble your earnings instead of someone else's. OP is such a scam sob story anyways.

@_date: 2019-08-06 08:04:17
We're always the last ones in the top currency list to hit those milestones but at least we did! congrats lads!
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:56:13
Unfortunately, your statement means nothing and holds no weight.
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:02:00
Dude, when you're trying to pull out hundreds of thousands and the bank can only protect you up to 80k spread across all your accounts, i think i'll just spend the Bitcoin when it's time to 'cash out' because it will have far less implications then turning it into dirty fiat toilet paper!
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:11:56
Nice lines, cool colours.
@_date: 2018-06-22 08:36:42

@_date: 2019-06-22 19:52:17
less then $4 mined a day on that machine and thats before factoring faults, Best off buying the BTC and HODL.
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:48:55
I think buying Bitcoin is a good idea
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:54:30
I just came back from the year 2020 and right now im stacking sats.
@_date: 2019-02-11 07:39:22
Up or Down, life would be boring without Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2019-02-16 02:29:26
I've been Dollar cost Averaging so much recently that Bitcoin has turned into Money in my mind

Hal finney is the only name i want to hear other than Satoshi - everyone else is a fraud.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:04:30
Invest in a Ledger or Trezor Hardware wallet, then transfer all your coins onto your newly generated seed.
Then you have the Ultimate investment.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:53:20
if you bank transferred then its a 5 day wait for fraud checks, as soon as they implemented that I went right back to LBC.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:09:34
Time to get back to work buddy. Better luck next time.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:57:58
Go all in! Nothing else matters but stacking sat's.

@_date: 2019-04-02 07:08:45

This totally is me with a twist, 'Whenever BTC seems to be going down, I buy weed to make myself feel better and it always goes up again.'
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:38:28
LocalBitcoins, Bisq , Peer to Peer, BTC ATM's
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:01:04
in 2019 Even LocalBitcoins does better then coinbase, you can try Binance and Kraken aswell. if youre cool you'd use bisq
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:35:26
