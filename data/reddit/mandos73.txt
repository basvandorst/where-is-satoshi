Janurary 26th Totals
Pool, btc earned, daily average hash
2 Antminer S9's on each pool
ViaBTC 0.00285025 27.778T
Antpool 0.00271224 27.00TH/s
All s9's report average hash of around 13.8 in the Status Tab of the miner and all of them have about the same reject etc. but what each pool reports is a bit different.

Its Obvious that Antpool and Viabtc are the top 2 I tested, Slushpool being the worst. I will Now stop SlushPool, F2Pool and BTC.com and place 2 Miners on VCT and 2 on AntPool

ViaBtc is the best bitcoin pool in my testing.. Antpool is second place, F2pool and btc.com are 3rd... Slushpool is the worst for profit...
