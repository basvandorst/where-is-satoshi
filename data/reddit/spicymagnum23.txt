Lol yeah this was just a joke about manipulating charts, I guess it didn't land. Ill take a look further back tho to see what you're saying. Thanks man

Isn't this a BS shitcoin? Just a bunch of randos cashing in on the name B2X

My dad is a financial advisor and he says it took him forever to understand, but a short/simple example would be:
A farmer needs some $ to raise his crops, so he enters a contract with a buyer: the buyer gives him $ now (an agreed upon price for the crops, guessing what they'll be worth at harvest) and the farmer must deliver the crops when they're grown.

i thought futures are deliverable contracts. like eventually the contract concludes and the BTC is delivered to whoever owns it for the agreed price

The ISPs would still be governed by FTC and antiTrust laws, plus the fair internet practices, without NN the legal framework regulating fair practices are the same as with NN. 
So, in terms of the ability to interfere with cryptos no but there could be volatility from people getting freaked out/excited

You know what I see one that chart... Higher highs and higher lows.

I'm a noob myself but I think that since nobody can seem to come to a consensus the coin isn't legit. I imagine if this was a legit segwit upgrade then everyone would know it and there's be consensus. Instead I heard they premined like 2 million coins, lol smells like a shitcoin to me
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:43:02
I guess so. What's the expectation if it's legit, regular BTC dies and B2X becomes king overnight?

They def did. I put in like $20 worth and won't be getting it back. It's been a while since the URL 404ed 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:20:48
Gotcha, thanks for the heads up

Life saver

Did the snapshot not count as the fork? 
My plan has been to wait until I think this run will break and dump my BTC into the most inversely correlated coin

Thanks a lot. I think I'll still have to see on Monday (when we can talk to a compliance officer), I bought the coins in CoinBase with a debit card and I believe our bank accounts can be monitored so long as I stay at home. 
Either way, so glad Ive tried crypto. Can't wait to see my siacoin skyrocket

What do you mean? We're in New Jersey, US
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:50:47
Will do. Now that I think of it, even a Ponzi would let me withdraw. Unless I can find someone to corroborate the site I'll just pull
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:04:48
Update, compliance dgaf.  Thanks everyone
