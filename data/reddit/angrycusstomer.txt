I did mention about the “other” stuff like Defense which is called bombing of mullahs. Lol that’s really the only thing your income taxes are paying for.
All roads are not funded by your income tax. The tolls pay for the highways constructed. The funding comes from vehicle excise tax and road taxes which are based of your car not your income. If income taxes paid for roads, you’d have 1000x better roads.
Elementary school? Most people are home schooling because of how bad it is becoming and those who can afford it are being sent to private schools. 
“What about those who can’t afford health insurance and don’t have a house”
So basically you’re saying the only people who actually use these tax benefits are those who don’t pay taxes to begin with. The rest are expected to be forcefully milked and denied proper facilities worth what they’re paying for.
This is exactly why I’m against illegal taxes. 50% goes to people who don’t pay taxes and the other 50% goes to people who use my taxes to kill millions of people around the globe. What’s left for my own self? Nothing I essentially get nothing for what I’m paying for on top of being triple taxed for all the services I use and GST. Fuck that. Want to tax me? Tax me for what I use period.

The bank run government already is starting to crumble. They NEED US to keep complying with their system to prop it up and keep it running.
If we choose NOT TO, they will crumble on their own. All we need to do is give it a little push by choosing to go 100% cryptocurrency and have your local retailers adopt cryptocurrency also. Stable coins if you must at first.
Then STAY OUT of the fiat system. Do everything you can to keep the value of goods in cryptocurrency. Sell your own stuff in crypto only. Get paid in crypto.
Choose to opt out of this cronyism. Choose to be free. Choose to not be a slave to fulfill government bonds.
As more people do this, cryptocurrency value goes up and it becomes easier for you to purchase goods in cryptocurrency.
Keep up the good habit of keeping everything valued in cryptocurrency and what you need used in stablecoins like DAI.

All of that you’d have to pay for. Tolls, public transport tickets, ambulance charges etc.

“Utilities” you don’t get free energy you pay per kWh. Water isn’t free either paid per gallon. Unless you are saying the air you breathe is provided free by the government! Airport services paid for my airport taxes. Trains by train tickets. So what utilities do you really get to use free from the government? Lol. Internet? Hello you’re paying monthly. Phone bills also. 
Medical bills most tax payers use private health insurance because what the government gives is shit.
Schools? Well hello college fees.
You’re paying taxes to pay more for “public infrastructure” that your taxes were used to create.
The only true thing your taxes are paying for are the pockets of war mongers and funding R&amp;D of bombing mullahs.

Their sanctions don’t seem to be working or deterring countries from continuing to trade with US sanctioned countries though. Apparently other people are now creating even more new payment systems to outright ignore USA govt.
If the people could anonymously trade and maintain their anonymity, with others constantly giving helpful tips to newcomers on how to stay anonymous, how is govt going to even put fear in people if they have difficulty even catching anyone? 
People shouldn’t be so afraid to encourage others to be anonymous. Make it hard for the govt to attack us. The harder it is and the more expensive it becomes for the government to take a stance against us, the less likely they will. Prevention is better than cure. Never give the govt the benefit of the doubt because they sure as hell don’t give you that.

Key reason why we need to expedite decentralised lending and have one particular strong decentralised exchange allow for high volume trading that can not be targeted by the scummy US regulators that are trying their utmost to kill of freedom of investment.
Currently anyone has any knowledge on decentralised lending? Also rather than focusing on purely bitcoin decentralised exchanges I believe that ALL crypto communities need to work together to first resolve this issue of the US regulation overreach. Have all communities band together to make a decentralised exchange successful first.
We can’t attack each other while a bigger threat is looming. Stop this GoT style throne wars. Winter is coming. We need to kill the Night King.

Bodyguard also acts as a guardian for your kid to ensure they don’t get caught up with bad influences.
Even in first world countries you have drug gangs recruiting kids from schools to do their bidding. On top of that the kid bullies won’t dare to fuck with your kid when he flaunts that he has a bodyguard.
Also the body guard can go and personally buy nice food for your kid during lunch hours, and also be at the school gate waiting to collect your kid for you immediately when they are released or stay and wait for them to finish their after school activities.
I bet you never had the luxury of one growing up. Because clearly you don’t know how nice that felt as a kid. I know I miss my bodyguard. I grew so fond of him. He’s retired now.

That’s easy for smaller stuff. If your wealth are all in bitcoins you already have the best performing asset out of govt reach.
For uses, car for instance, just rent cars instead of buying it. You also don’t get locked into a depreciating asset.

Search away I’ll say fuck the IRS. Barter trade your bitcoins and make it hard to trace your whole stash by obscuring it through monero. This is a must for any cryptocurrency user.
Also do not buy from FIAT stores and encourage them to accept crypto directly. If they are scared of fluctuations ask them to accept stablecoins like DAI.
FIAT businesses accepting bitcoins can also obscure their trail like they do cash. The IRS does not have the Human Resources to attack all small businesses that accept crypto

Banning hasn’t stopped people from selling drugs on tor via bitcoin. Therefore it will be pretty easy for services to accept bitcoin online without being traced back to the business owner. Especially since btcpay is now creating a system on tor. Also with the safenetwork reaching its alpha phases, setting up truly anonymous decentralised websites that no NSA/FBI can ever identify you with will be available fairy soon. No one can ever take down that website forever as well. I don’t see how governments can stop these online services from accepting bitcoin and spending it anonymously.
Physical Goods might be trickier unless the seller can find means of goods forwarding without giving away their identity. That said with smart contracts it will be possible for trustless sales of goods where you don’t need to know your seller and just purchase the goods from an unknown source (like you do presumably when you buy drugs of tor, I wouldn’t know)
Sheeple will be sheeple. Let them have Libra spy and control all their money. We can’t save everyone after all. That said people underestimate the ability for people to continue using bitcoin even though it is banned. Back when bitcoin was not recognised, you could still find willing services that accept payments in bitcoin. There will always and forever be ways to go around it and one could argue that it will only get easier to skirt the authorities as most activities go underground and become untraceable via monero, being hosted on the safe network and all communication are encrypted by decentralised entities that the IRS can never subpoena. Heck I don’t remember the last time I paid my family mechanic. He just does our repairs for free because we do other favours in return for him. Same could apply for people accepting bitcoin. They could appear to offer you a service for free and I’d pay them in bitcoin. The govt will be none the wiser about it.
I wouldn’t laugh at their inability, rather I would laugh at their stupidity in wasting precious resources that they already lack direly on trying to suppress something that is inevitable.
I’d say that the ONLY way they could succeed is to pass a law that bans anyone from even thinking or planning to create new technology or systems that provide any form of privacy or anonymity to the public and any form of currency or anything that can be perceived to be of any value without being approved by the government. That anyone can not be allowed to even produce any goods either that can be of value without the permission of the government.

IRS is the enemy. They clearly are because they are structuring taxes to hurt cryptocurrency adoption.
Also they didn’t facilitate the creation of bitcoins. They do not deserve to get taxes until they make the taxes traceable showing exactly that cryptocurrency taxes are not used to prop up the banks or fund wars. Have all crypto taxes recorded on the blockchain and shows where it is spent down to the very cent. They expect us to report our taxes that way, the IRS will be more than capable of doing the same.
If the IRS does not do that, do not pay your crypto taxes because it is illegitimate.
1) obscure your main holdings with monero.
2) create a separate new wallet for spending with the link to the main wallet broken with monero.
3) buy from stores accepting crypto directly and discourage FIAT use.
4) for cars, rent cars that accept crypto payments.
5) trade on decentralised exchanges and stop using centralised exchanges like fucking coinbase. Get your crypto friends to convert also.
There is literally NOTHING they can do to us if we create our own economy run on crypto. Money is power money is everything in the world today. Take that away from them and we can live free.

Until there is proof of intention to commit those “other crimes” you’re talking about, anyone is innocent. 
Tax evasion is a “crime” which does not put peoples lives in danger so I totally advocate for it. Especially since it’s the only way that you can effectively vote the actual policies and government you want into power. Or at least signal to them to do better.
After all the mentality that your life and everything that exists belongs to the government is perverted. The govt taxes are allowance given by the people. Allowances can be taken away if the government is naughty. 
With fiat we have less ability to do that. But with bitcoins and monero, that is our power and our right. We created the crypto world. We use it as we please. We have the ability to PUT the government IN THEIR PLACE. It would be foolish to not use this power that we have created for ourselves while we can and have the upper hand.

If you’re talking about false accusation of tax avoidance, well they can freeze your “assets” but if you’re in 100% crypto they can’t do that cause you have no assets they have access to freeze.
You need to be more clear on what you’re trying to argue about here.
Also the choice to stop funding bank bailouts and terrorism will get increasingly easy and it will be nearly impossible to catch the people choosing to do so.

This is why you have taxes used inefficiently and people who abuse it getting richer and richer to the point they control everyone’s lives and everyone is but a wage slave in their monetary system.
When given the ability to extract yourself out of this ridiculous system, only fools will choose to remain as slaves.
We don’t need the government to pay for things if they’re so inefficient. We just do it ourselves.if my city council is bad at fixing roads and it’s killing people, I just fix the potholes out of my own pocket and I sure as hell won’t pay taxes for that money spent fixing the pothole. I’ll deduct from my taxes what I’ve spent on the pothole whether the govt likes it or not.
Society will still function without a government. Not everyone needs a “leader”. Only cattle.
In today’s world, what we need is accountability and transparency. The government is supposed to just be a system that logs down what the people want. The people decide what they want. If human govt can’t effectively log down the wants of people because of corruption and corporate politics, then computerise the system. Get rid of these old bags of saggy meat sitting up there.
If they won’t do that it just means they are trying to oppress the majority using the monetary influence of minority. There is no democracy in this.
And that’s where the majority has the power to take the monetary influence away from these minority by using cryptocurrency that is censorship proof.

1) set up an anonymous marketplace that does sales based on escrow.(already available)
2) host such a website on a anonymous decentralised  platform such as through IPFS coupled with Tor. Or soon to be available SafeNetwork(default anonymous non IP traceable website and decentralised)
3) sell goods there and deliver using an app that allows for verification of received/delivered goods. Escrow is automatically finalised.
4) Government can’t catch goods seller.
5) make a self pickup locker for goods to add a layer of anonymity for buyers as well.
6) better yet is if someone could design an identity system that gives reputation yet ensures your identity remains private. That way if there are government agents who are working to catch users of the system, those particular accounts can be flagged and less trustworthy clients can be rejected. To penalise and make it hard for government agents to conduct espionage.(flagged accounts due to government espionage will be revealed publicly for everyone to trace transactions and identify all related accounts on the blockchain and thus make it even harder for govt agents to hide amongst actual users)
I don’t see how the government can enforce the ban of bitcoin use generally nor make people fear being caught in such circumstances.

If you’re that rich, live as a king in your Asian nation. You don’t need to ever ever travel to a declining western nation. There’s nothing much to see anyways. Culture in the west is overrated. Just some old buildings that they over exaggerate to sell to dumb tourists. 90% of the time locals walking past don’t even notice the buildings.

Besides, if you made so much money running something like Tether, just travel Asia if you MUST. Again it’s overrated having travelled myself.

Exactly imagine the scenario with a KYC crypto exchange! You’d need to give everything to them, and then risk your funds being frozen even if you weren’t hacked.
That’s why say NO to centralised KYC exchanges.
Go for decentralised non custodial exchanges where YOU control your own coins. Less risk of being hacked because there no central exchange for hackers to target. Each hacking attempt will have to be individually targeted and the more people use their own custodial wallets, the less chance of you being targeted. Also nobody can freeze your accounts. Especially if you’re a USA citizen, your greedy government can never force anyone to freeze your assets.

If majority of your assets are in crypto anyways there’s nothing they can do to seize it even if they come knocking.
If you spent millions converting to FIAT you’re not a true crypto fan anyways and if you get rekt by the IRS you deserve it for selling crypto out for scummy FIAT.
If you wanted to buy million dollar stuff overseas, use crypto directly and the IRS won’t be able to know what assets you hold anyways. Even if they do eventually find it it would cost them millions to flush you out it’s not worth it for them unless you’re doing hundreds of millions lol.

Anyone who goes on margin is bad especially shorters because that’s trying to push prices down when you don’t have the money. They did not buy the coins to sell it and yet they want to sell something they don’t have. The idea is to have cryptocurrency become the new norm either way. Fiat doesn’t lose value because one coffee is still one coffee. The only thing causing fiat devaluation is inflation created by banks. So yes, shorters are evil. Nobody sacrifices themselves to make things cheaper for others that’s ridiculous. There really can’t be a way to paint shorters in a good light. They deserve to get rekt. What drives usage should be technological development and the knowledge that government issued currency is untrustworthy. Besides cryptocurrency doesn’t need to be in round numbers. Real world value will scale the costs accordingly to decimals. Shorters are just scaring potential users away due to their own greed. They want to push the prices lower for an easier entry for themselves.

Exactly why I believe there will be an age where the elites will lose trust in governments and instead form a group together with private funding to fight the government that’s supporting socialists (as socialists gain support from the lower echelons of wealth in numbers) which will lead to segregated societies and cities which selectively exclude/ban people of a certain status and then will need military protection from those terrorist/extreme socialists who would use government physical force to try and confiscate wealth from the elite.
I believe that eventually that is what the socialists aim to achieve by forcefully taking wealth at an increasing rate on people who have achieved a greater standing than them aka the top 1%. The French Revolution they always say is inevitable if they continue to be denied is just an idea that they are planning to pursue anyway once enough support is garnered against the top 1%

Doesn’t matter what we were talking about. As this is reddit my view is also allowed and based on how you’re portraying your close minded and discriminative view towards a minority, I can safely say that you are exactly that type of a person to be nasty and bigoted towards other minority groups when it suits you. You may not be a bigot to lgbt or a sexist but that’s only because it would cause you unnecessary problems in society today specifically if you were known to be one. But if you could get away with it you would. What an ugly person you are.
You still don’t realise how disgusting you’re coming off as. Your “I’m here to steer people in the right direction because they have different views from me” is exactly the same things those homophobic people say. Oh I’m a pastor and I’m here to steer you away from the sin of being a homo. Or oh I come from a good white American family and I’m here to steer you younglings from the wrong path of marring a partner of colour. That’s just disgusting.
Oh that’s easy to explain, I realised a long time ago that most people who are into homosexuality are weak, and have weak arguments, they don’t like the truth, they deny the truth, so I’m here to point them in the right direction.
Oh that’s easy to explain, I realised a long time ago that most couples who are into interracial relationships are weak, and have weak relationships, they don’t like the truth, they deny the truth, so I’m here to point them in the right direction.

Margin people are just crafty crooks wanting to steal profits from each other. Theoretically a shorter is as what you say but in real life that never happens and 99% of shorters are in it to gain from losses of others. They’re the worst kinds of margin traders out there. Also the way shorters call it “just business” when they kill a company for their own greed that just shows why it’s a cause for celebration when one of these evil does suffer.
Shorters cause more losses to the genuine investors who actually support a company or product.
Also my opinion stands to where people in economics doing margin trading, every one of them are crafty crooks who have low morals so I’d stay as far away as possible from them and will continue to deny them an opportunity to profit from me in any way possible. People like that do not deserve to have the good things in life and I refuse to be one of those contributing to their success :)

Could have been phrased in a much better manner. I know that bitcoin will be here to stay for a long time, I’ve been around long enough but that doesn’t mean there’s only one coin to have 99% of the marketcap. There are other legit solutions being looked into but the sentiment for bitcoin to have its value is simply because of its age and historical success in leading the space, and echo chamber of store of value. However I agree that so many other new coins are scams 1 out of a thousand will be legit.

So basically all blockchain tech including bitcoin is impossible to be unstoppable because it utilises the internet which is basically centralised via T1 nodes and satellites. Is what you’re saying.
To have a truly decentralised internet, we need to illegally create media communications devices and deploy it without government approval and hope that they don’t shoot it down.
Therefore cryptocurrency/blockchain is useless because it’s sole purpose of being decentralised is a farce by your explanation. Let’s all just adopt virtual bank issued currency and not own anything of value shall we?
Also all money/properties/assets are not owned by you. They’re a lease to you through your lifetime and can and at any point be taken away from you should any government feel like it by fabricating false accusations. Or “alleged” reports which the US law enforcement is based upon. Alleged status is sufficient.
That said I’d rather die and be a suicide bomber than subject my entire century worth of life living to not actually own anything of worth and In fact have worked my whole life as a repayment to a government entity which does nothing but subjugate me.
 My life does not belong to the government. I do not live my life to work for loaned assets. And I refuse to believe that we can’t truly be unstoppable by the government. If they can stop us, they would have already.

Why a new phone? Well you should ask yourselves that. Can you afford one? No? Then go and get a better job first before you think about investing in anything.
How is it going to change adoption? I’m just a person like many other. I can think and believe in something doesn’t means others like you will. To each their own and that’s what makes me more successful than you. Imo it will help adoption as everyone owning a new gen phone will by default have a cryptocurrency wallet ready to be used. Wechat being by default installed in most android like HTC/Huawei made it outshine whatsapp in the global Asian market. Crypto wallets will beat Apple Pay/ Alipay/Wetransfer as each individual will control their own money and it’s impossible to sanction. That’s just my opinion.

We will know how much money is circulating either way if money is cryptocurrency. Because every token that exists in a blockchain, is known.

Treat it differently because the government has done nothing to support or improve crypto to crypto trades and in fact tried to downplay and kill it.

Diplomatic relations are forced because they had no options until recently when China and Russia came up. Things will turn sour for the US real quick if they keep up your high and mighty attitude. The younger generation have no obligation to listen to the US.
I’m not kidding when I said prime ministers have openly said that US double talks and US hypocrite invaders vs China rich businessmen. Google it and you’ll find the video.

EU is buckling and ignoring US threats to sanction. France has agreed to begin relations with China. Germany has ignored US sanction calls and deal with Russia. Turkey continues to buy arms from Russia amid calls for sanctions and swore to send Russia military aid if US dares to attack Venezuela using military force.

Also in most countries, roads don’t need taxes from the government. They make money for the government on top of taxes we pay. Most highways have tolls that reap more money for the respective states than the cost to build and repair it. After 30 years it should have well paid for itself and yet they do not remove the tolls.
Small roads are often maintained by council fees you pay living in your home.
Public infrastructure water and electricity, you’re paying your “supply fees” and those companies are making money via the infrastructure that they provide you. If the government did pay for those, The electricity suppliers would not be lobbying against renewable energy users and forcing them to pay “supply fees” even if they were fully off grid efficiently.
You are effectively already paying for almost everything out of your own pockets and giving the government money. On top of taxes paid to them which are often used wrongly without transparency. 
What we want is just to know that at the very least money from such a revolutionary technology that lets us record things on the ledger, is not moved back to a shady and untrustworthy tax system that is not transparent, which then uses our revolutionary tax money to further suppress the revolution.

You can claim it that way but as far as Asia is concerned the west has been the invaders throughout our historical teachings. Maybe US history taught in schools are skewed to glorify your invasion as “saving” countries from Russian influence. But the rest of the world who were subjected to such atrocities by the west do not think so as evidenced by our teachings of history within our region.
When leaders of the Asian region mention that the west through their Christian crusade has invaded countries throughout history, your leaders say that the Asian region are antichrist and antiseminist as an excuse to brush away experiences of the victims of war crime.
Suck it up lad, your opinions won’t change the facts that people have lived through and experience the consequences of the western invasion and theft of resources via taxes during the colonial era to which this current day, the colonies have yet to compensate the invaded countries. You guys are thieves, conquerors no less but thieves and invaders who subjugate people wherever you go. Today it’s used via economic suffocation which leads to military “help” to democratise a sovereign nation. 
But people are waking up to your evil plots. People are smarter and have access to more information. You can try to censor it but, cat is out of the bag. The time is over and the only way you can stay in power is to declare war on the world and everyone who will not submit. 
If Russia was indeed so horrible and more so than the US, the Asian region would not so willingly associate themselves with the Russians. Fact is they haven’t caused more harm to us than the west. Have not and never will. The Middle East suffered even more at the hands of Europe and the US. Basically the world suffered more in the hands of the US. The only people worse were the Germans, facist Italians and Japanese. But right behind them are the western ideology of invasion of another sovereign nation not only through politics but military.
The only people detached from reality are those sitting on their high horses feeling it’s right to impose policies on sovereign nations claiming they are the only saviour to another country and that the country’s opinions do not matter.
Edit: I believe from the news I’ve read, Russia is only advancing its military in response to threat from the west. If the west weren’t so insistent on demolishing Russia and invade Russia through military might, Russia would not have to keep up with the arms race. And Ukraine is basically an inside installation of US pawns to cause issues in the region for an excuse for NATO to get closer to Russia. Just like what they’re doing with Venezuela. And Ukraine has fared worse since US intervention. Every country associated with the US who isn’t a Christian white country has fared worse than the US.

Thing I find funny is, how is it legally my problem if the cryptocurrency is on the exchange when I have no control over it whatsoever? I don’t have the wallet key, I don’t have the access to that wallet. I was not promised access or compensation to the cryptocurrency either in the event the exchange was hacked so effectively I do not own any cryptocurrency even though they took my identity. I wouldn’t be able to take those coins either if they refused to give it to me. So how does the coins belong to me when clearly I have no authority over something nor possess it? I only gain control over it when out of goodwill the other person decides to send to my personal wallet the coins that I request for. Nobody can force or change the blockchain even if I wanted the coins and the other party won’t give it.
You can’t just say that a sack of drugs belong to someone else when it’s found in your possession even if you have the identity of someone else.
In fact the ceo of coinbase for instance could just take all the crypto in hard wallets and keep the passwords with him. Get sued to bankruptcy in FIAT and still it doesn’t matter. Go to jail for 10 years and come back out a richer man and spend the coins as he likes via direct crypto sale. Who’s to stop him or confiscate the coins when they don’t have access to the password? Prison torture is illegal so as long as he refuses to give the password the coins belong to him.

Nobody gives a rats ass about diplomatic relations because those are fake and can change very quickly as seen by how the USA backstabs their allies through threats of sanctions. Today’s allies are tomorrow’s enemies like Turkey. You need to know the sentiment of the population. That doesn’t change over decades. But whatever keep being ignorant of how Asians view the west as evil vile conquerors and hypocrites.
Don’t make me laugh about moral high ground. The west have none because they’re hypocrites.
Duertete Phillipines PM 
Malaysia side with China 
Indonesia with China 
Indonesia with Russia military
Thailand is and has been with Russia
India has always been with Russia and has ignored US and bought more S400 from Russia
Myanmar was sanctioned by the US they hate the US.
North Korea notoriously sided with China.
South Korea are turning to China-Russia too.
Need I say more? The smart western nations will start being part of a world order that doesn’t recognise western especially USA dominance and tyranny. You I can see will be the last to realise your popularity dwindling. By that time it will be too late. You’ve made yourselves too many enemies and choose to ignore past sins and continue to commit these sins and by hypocritical about it. Asia dislikes the western hypocrisy. The few countries that like it are Singapore Australia, New Zealand. Japan is a victim of US subjugation but they will come around soon enough when we help empower them again just like South Korea. All the while China and Russia continues to help others who hate the western hypocrisy rise out of their shell and truly speak what they feel about the hate towards western hypocrisy. Too long has the world been oppressed and threatened. The smaller countries are scared to voice out in fear of invasion. the people hold that resentment. Now as a united front we can speak our mind and tell you we won’t accept it any longer and we will trade free.
Like I said you have one chance to stay in power. Start world war 3 now and bomb all the nations. Otherwise, the west will truly and finally lose its imperialist control of the world.
Hey look even NYTimes admits that more people are starting to like China over USA and moving towards China. The world is changing people realise they don’t need to be afraid of the west anymore. So now they side with the one they hate least. That however is inaccurate because in truth we truly love China more and we have an innate anger towards western colonies for keeping us 3rd world countries in Asia and colonising us. We still remember because we were taught history. We will always remember what evil the colonies have done to us.

Does this mean that any bitcoin shuffled through wasabi is guaranteed to have their trail obscured? How much more anonymous is it than monero? Is it enough to say fuck you to KYC regulation?
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:07:33
Yes. Stand up fight and fuck these control freaks. If they are going to try and monitor the bitcoin network for every transaction we just move to base layer privacy coins. They make it illegal? Good luck on them for trying to find out who’s using anonymous decentralised packets of data when they couldn’t even effectively trace physical drugs and drug lords.
Have new politician parties run for presidency with the goal of liberating cryptocurrencies. Funded by charitable DAOs that deal directly with merchants anonymously to promote the party without needing the party to receive the funds.
I find that the governments of the world will be hard pressed to fight utility of free money from so many angles(merchants, consumers, politics, legal autonomous contracts) on top of spending resources chasing down people who constantly further facilitate development of tech and code to obscure cryptocurrency trails for the sake of privacy.
Only way they can do that is to take a gun and point it at every citizen who opposes them and decree that any political party in support of anonymity is treasonous. Even then the people will rise up and fight. They’d have to shoot their citizens and cull us to stay in power. 
The end for them is neigh. Bitcoin is just the beginning.

All easier to be recorded on the blockchain via anonymous identity but lump sum value calculations. Also, Businesses will then have control over market data and can sell it to data analysts rather than have their customer data taken for free anyways through platforms like Fabecook and Google. At the same time governments will have a harder time orchestrating market manipulation such as housing bubbles to profit off their citizens losses.
Businesses that lose money will still lose money no matter how well you baby it. They’re just not adopting good enough business practices and due diligence. Same goes with people into crypto that don’t know how to keep their crypto. They will lose their money no matter how you regulate the market. That’s the free market and that’s what business risks are all about. 
As if the most profitable businesses that started in Africa has a shit ton of data to go through.

You talked about expenses being deducted as tax returns. Same concept applies to trade in a business. How hard is it to understand that?
Your bitcoins used to pay for said insurance, at the time of payment the bitcoin is valued as such so you deduct as such. If your business purchased goods to sell, the difference in price from bitcoin cost to sold goods is your profit which is taxable. You should pay that tax if you are claiming your tax reduction for it. Otherwise you will be paying tax on the whole amount of your goods sold because essentially your cost is 0 dollars if you do not declare the cost of your bitcoins to purchase the goods. Do you still not get what I’m saying?
Tax free bitcoin purchase of goods are only applicable as the end user in most cases. As a business, if you are buying goods in bitcoin to sell the goods in fiat, you had better declare the cost in bitcoins and pay the taxes on profit or else you will pay a heftier tax based on cost free pure profit goods sold. If you bought goods in bitcoin and sold the goods for bitcoin, well that’s a different case because unless the goods are tracked by govt, bitcoin goods trade are generally not linked to govt agencies, unless of course you’re in the business of import/export.
Of course I’m no tax consultant but this is the gist of what I understand as a consumer. 
So why aren’t more businesses strictly trading in cryptocurrency especially privacy coins? Honestly it will save everyone a lot of trouble if suppliers to end consumers all use it.
Also whether you claim tax returns after using bitcoins or fiat for insurance costs won’t make a difference in a case of being an entrepreneur because your profit is still taxed based on your sales in FIAT. What you do want to use it for though is for things that can’t be claimed for tax deduction and be tax exempt

Lol keep being delusional and accusing me of being factless when you’re the one with no facts. I speak from experience with regards to Asia not liking US policies and it’s interventionalistic attitude.
My facts revolve around the fact that majority of the world has chosen to partake in the one belt one road initiative with China including Russia and chose to ignore the western narrative that it’s a threat to national security simply because that ideology of “only the west can be in power and save the world and every other super power are evil” is backfiring in them and people realise the west are the evil ones and has been throughout history.
Keep spouting nonsense that Russia and China want to be global monsters when throughout history they have yet to conquer any country. Economically they are power houses and lead by example but nothing more.
The west is waning as should be and France should give the African countries who are still under their colonisation independence in this modern world. Oh wait weren’t the west no longer evil conquerors? Or does the French border extend all the way into Africa?
Oh and Asia truly hates the west. They just want to take back the money they were robbed of from the colonies via modern day business practices. Once Asia is done with you, you will be left to rot as a 3rd world country and there’s nothing you can do to recover because you lack the population. This isn’t a claim, it’s evident with the numerous prime ministers around the Asian region talking against western practices in the Middle East and choosing not to side with US at the U.N. in regards to intervention of Venezuela. The PEOPLE hate the US and will side with China any time over the US. Only countries in Asia with the US are those who have no where left to grow economically like Singapore/Japan/South Korea and are afraid of emerging markets. Every other country is just taking advantage of US or outright hates them like Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar, Thailand, Philippine? Or did you not know that the prime ministers of these countries have said they would side with China over double talk US(Duertete Phillipines)? Side with Rich China over Invader US(Malaysia and Indonesia)? Myanmar hates US because they used to be sanctioned by the US(which failed because many people are rich today cause they ignored US sanctions on Myanmar)? Pakistan are called a terrorist state by the US you think they like the US? India has chosen to be impartial in choosing China over US. Thailand is ramping up military prowess thanks to the help from Russia. 
All these and you think people the vast majority of living human beings in the world like the west? Get a reality check. You are few in number. You conquered to enslave the majority. It’s time the majority rise to the occasion to fight the evil tyranny of the west and they are doing just that.
Hah keep talking crap and living in ignorance of your evil doings you hypocrite. The world will evolve and people will fight against you. There’s nothing you can do to silence people like me besides starting a 3rd world war. If you plan to do so, better do it quick before the majority of the world unites against you. Time is ticking.
Edit: this is not including the Middle East which notoriously hates the west. Even the Arabs once loyal friends of the US are ditching US policies in favour of the one belt initiative.
What about Latin America? You made enemies of some of those with the largest population. Mexico. If you were in such good terms it wouldn’t be an issue for the Lima group to allow US to intervene with military might but they only recently rejected the US. So there you have it, the vast majority of the world does not like the west and particularly the US and it’s allies. Only a small group of people are causing so much scorn in the eyes of the greater majority of the world population. We only deal with it because we were forced to does not mean we liked it. Now that we have emerging options true colours will show. Thank god for Russia and China letting other regions emerge. Looking forward to India, ASEAN and Africa being emerging competition to the western political sphere creating a truly equal world for everyone. Fuck the west.

If there is neither on the blockchain, then the tax is illegitimate. Especially in an industry that came to be made to keep governments in check.

Your news are fake. Of course I ignore those in light of actual real world interactions talking meeting and mingling with almost every person out here in Asia. That is not just random comments. It’s the general talking to any public person on the streets I meet when I travel to countries sitting in Uber. “Yeah those nasty Americans, such hypocrites” yes most of them say that. Most like China and Russia rising to the table and balancing the world powers and economy. 
What you think is real news does not exist in the real world. Yours is the fairy tail. Sadly even if you were to travel Asia and ask people about what they think they won’t be truthful to your face and fear being rude. It’s only something they would open up to you if you’re non western. Because if you’re western you’re not deserving of our true opinions of you.
You’re not in touch with reality because you’re stuck in your pitiful country and do not bother to know the world works with or without the US.
And you’re the one ignoring the fact you’re still evil colonists. You still are holding countries as hostages and colonies while preaching about freedom to others. Hypocrites. Hypocrites. Hypocrites. You are shying away from that I can see. That is not Russian media that’s a well known fact that the west still retains it colonies.
It’s time the west faces the music. They were too oppressive for too long. You’re only fortunate Asia has yet to force repayment for the crimes and raw materials and riches stolen from Asia by the colonies. Hopefully Latin America realises that sooner than later. Africa is already starting to realise it and side with China more than US. So many decades of Western rule and Africa never flourished. A few years with China and the people there are doing much better. Of course they will side with China.
Here you have even Latin America suffering at the hands of being “close to USA” when China has helped their economy grow giving all their people a better life. This is no Russia media mind you, it’s Australian news. A quote from the article, China has given more money than the USA or the U.N. to the Latin American economy. The US being so “righteous” and such a big economy could not even help their neighbours. Right only help them bring democracy when there is oil am I right? Disgusting filth.

Oh suck it up. They chose to become poor if they choose to offend me and get fired. Most people become poor without a job and it’s not easy for someone to get a job after being fired from your last company.
Getting replacement for the skills? Well machines do the trick. Soon blockchain and ai will do the same to even more. Employers give opportunity and employees should appreciate the opportunity given to learn.
Don’t like it? Well git gud, have some savings to start a business and be your own boss. Otherwise, my wishes will always affect the reality of my employees. Be it directly or otherwise.
Did I play the role of a boss right? Ha ha. This was just a response to someone who insists our wishes are irrelevant and that our lives and struggles are a futile effort and everything is indisputably ordered about by the government. If it were so, then the human race being dominated by AI and cyborgs would actually be better because at least there’s no corruption occurring and it’s a fair world for all humans.
Edit: also in reality, a boss CAN make someone poor. Take a doctor for example. If that doctor is looking to be a specialist and the hospital (not even a boss) just a senior/superior wills it, they can make it impossible for the doctor to EVER specialise in the entire nation with a few strokes of a pen. Same goes to house men who hope to graduate as a full fledged doctor. Their mentor can ruin their entire career just as easily. That will keep them poor for quite a bit I’d reckon. Especially since it costs doctor undergrads a whole lot of money to study it on top of the insane costs to sit for specialist papers. Any doctors are free to correct me if they think the medical registration process isn’t at all like what I described. This is especially true if you’re a female vying for neurosurgery. Free will? Just pray you get the accreditation sooner than later.

If you list the bitcoin at the price of trade, what is the problem with showing the the government the cost of your trade to be deducted from the tax base? Unless of course you are trying to obscure your cost to evade taxes then that isn’t what I’m supportive of. You should reduce taxes where you can but not evade it when it is due. Even if you bought goods with bitcoin you should always keep the record of it when tax men come knocking because you need to show them you’re well within the law of tax exemption for the purchase of goods with bitcoin within the threshold.
Also for goods with no cost paper trail, historically tax men still value it based on market value of the goods so you can still value goods that way.
If you wanted to evade taxes then you shouldn’t be clamining tax deduction/returns. That’s stealing money that doesn’t belong to you on top of evading taxes.
If you’re talking about privacy between business and private holdings, you can always separate your actual holdings from a trade account. Change the net profits post taxes to monero if you would like to keep your business trail from your private holdings to avoid public nosy people.

What’s cringy is that the govt wants to tax cryptocurrency but REFUSE to put the tax trail on the blockchain for transparency on all taxes paid. They don’t want to be accountable for where the money goes and how it is spent down to the supply chain.
If they want to tax crypto, they MUST have all tax spending from crypto tax recorded on the blockchain first. Until then nobody using crypto needs to pay taxes from profits on it. They are entitled to anonymise their trail via monero.
There needs to be a movement. Tax trail on blockchain or anonymise your crypto.

Not necessarily. You can know you’re working for Facebook but if Facebook is owned by an anonymous person, and the employment is done by a contracted created by an AI, which updates you what your job is, you’re essentially working for the AI and the profits go to the anonymous owner/token holders.
It’s the same with ICOs at the moment. An anonymous ICO can be held where token holders can still hold the securities. Is it illegal? Yes but who can stop the contract if it is self executing and developing? If the contract hires people and pays employees via anonymous voting of the token holders, and the product is successful, nobody can police it. Nobody. Because who are you going to go after? Lol the contract creator is someone you can’t physically apprehend, the token holders are kept anonymous by the contract created, the employees receiving the payments are paid by an anonymous source and in a untraceable unstoppable currency, the product made is hosted on a decentralised unstoppable network, customers interacting with it are guaranteed privacy. What can they do?
Just remember theDAO. It was not anonymous but creating an anonymous one would essentially stop any authority from being able to do anything.

If you accept hard cash you are guilty of money laundering. I wonder how that even works lol.
Who will know if the business is accepting crypto from anonymous wallets when both business and consumer wallets are anonymous? How will they pin an anonymous wallet to a particular business?
How will they know if a particular delivery is sent if the delivery service itself is anonymous and the sender is anonymous? You could have any rando pick up a parcel and courier it via Uber for instance. Many people deliver goods via hailing an Uber. Uber is centralised but future services can be anonymous.
When there’s a will there’s a way. War on drugs failed, that’s physical delivery cash that can be stopped at the borders. Crypto can not be stopped and the transaction is basically immune to censorship. The government can’t stop it even if they want to.
If even the services/business are managed by AI, they can’t go after services/business anymore. It becomes increasingly harder for them to catch those involved. If enough people do it, they will eventually run out of man power to regulate it especially as their currency weakens and their ability to pay lessens.
What we need are to have more people Brave enough to be part of the revolution. Be part of decentralisation and developing decentralised businesses, autonomous programs and hosting services. Make it impossible for any corrupt power hungry entity to target any one person.

Every other country has only reclaimed their land from Western colonies so far. Except China who isn’t colonising anyone, but creating their own land. Which is different to colonising and refusing to give independence to those colonies. No matter how you spin it. Eradicate and give ALL colonies independence before you talk about Russia being evil you hypocrite invader!

Besides, most of these exchanges do KYC via digital submission of documents online. Someone else could have hacked an exchange/other KYC sites stole my documents and used my identity on the exchange. And the law is stupid to make the burden of proof mine. The exchange should be the one that proves undoubtedly that I submitted those documents and not someone else. See the loopholes?

If google were run by an AI and ceded their control to it, and not disclosing any of the stakeholders, yes they can avoid reporting to the IRS because those people are no longer identifiable. Because the person running the company is above the law because it is an AI that does not exist in the physical plane. Servers are decentralised worldwide and can’t be seized. The govt can’t do anything.

Because others do it that means the west are justified in doing it to a greater extent over an even longer stretch of time throughout history. Exactly what you’re saying.
Also, besides the west the only other countries that have attempted to follow the western example is Japan. Russia from experience has not disturbed other countries that had no interest in attacking Russia. You keep mentioning Russia. Maybe it’s because the west has failed to conquer Russia time and again and has attempted through numerous ways and still failed. Russia retaliates by only choosing to give the west a taste of their own medicine? They have yet to invade the world or do something the west hasn’t already done numerous times first.

Better yet, the AI is the employer who generates the contract for the employee based on what the online business requires at that point of time.

Why would you demand tax return when taxes are not charged for crypto direct to goods transactions below a certain threshold?
You only need to pay taxes if the value of goods traded in a single transaction is above that threshold. Check your local laws. 
Most countries cryptocurrency is not legal tender nor is it any form of asset. Therefore it is valueless and untaxable. It is only taxable as income when you sell it for FIAT shitcoin. Unless of course you live in USA Unbelievably Shitty Arsehole.

Bitcoin hit ATH at 20k because of individual investors the last run. It was never because of institutional investors so we should not give them credit for it. After the individuals started wanting in on cryptocurrency, the institutional investors saw it as an opportunity and a threat that individuals will move away from them as thus have been trying to get in and at the same time suppress the market to give them enough time to do so to eventually control the cryptocurrency world via hostile takeover.
Institutional influence are never good for individuals because then their gatekeepers like SEC will make it impossible for the individuals to survive without their institutions. Which is why I support OP and believe we should not be advocating for institutions. We should CREATE OUR OWN society. We got to 20,000 without institutions having a pathway into cryptocurrency. These institutions are the ones forcefully devaluing our currency. We should outcast them so that we escape their nasty grip.

It should be made available when an elected government is available. Not to an interim president. Especially when there is dispute between the legitimacy of either party at the moment where the international community is also split on which person is the legitimate president.
For US to dictate which of the two is legitimate, and hand over a huge sum of money that way, it is undermining another sovereign state’s right to elect their own president.
The board of directors should be the citizens. Not the bank holding the funds by your logic.
My logic is, the people of Venezuela should have been the one to elect which of the two gets the money. Not the custodian. Which a smart contract would be able to facilitate a fair vote transparent to all and immutable.

I did not say they broke laws with sanctions. That’s their right. They broke the law by choosing to confiscate funds from Venezuela and deliberately choosing to gift it to a particular person in a political position aligning with their views and interests. That is external political interference.
If they confiscate funds they should have chosen to keep it until another election is held. Rather than picking someone of their choosing. That is political interference and funding of a political figure. Something the UN has stated in the meeting is against the laws and were urged not to do.

The difference is if it was coded onto a smart contract where each individual Venezuelan has an identity on the chain and can vote to have the funds released this would not have happened. Money would not need to be put into the hands of a foreign nation and Venezuela would not be undermining their sovereignty more than it already is.
The solution is to have a blockchain identity system where all voting cast is transparent and linked to the individual themselves.

You can’t use bots because for identity, each vote is linked to a single existing person that is currently living and over the age of 21. There is a known number of citizens at any given time and bots won’t make any difference in such cases because each individual only gets to vote once on the particular issue. You won’t need a microchip either. You as a person is all that’s needed.
From a crypto standpoint I stand by votes because that is what it is supposed to do. Empower the individual. If one could think they are more suited to tell others what to do and can make decisions without anyone being able to stop them, you get Trump shutting down the government for 35 days.
The people who have chosen to leave brexit were trolling and have learnt their lesson to not troll on matters of importance. If there was a fair voting mechanism, someone could put in a vote to vote again. It is due to the people in charge who did not allow a revote. Wherein if this was done on a blockchain if the majority wanted to vote again, a new poll can be made.

How can node operators bypass this and be anonymous? Is there some way of running a bitcoin node without being detected on the internet or is there a way of running a node without using the internet?
I was under the impression that it is impossible for any government to stop any individual from running nodes. But this is going to stop people from running it because they can be traced and held accountable(I’m assuming via IP address). Wasn’t Blockstream Satellite meant for this situation? Where government is trying to stop bitcoin nodes via controlling the internet. However, to receive and propagate a node, what are the things a bitcoin node operator needs if they don’t use the internet?
Also, is it possible for the government to track down each node to the individual running it currently if said individual does not want to comply and obtain a license. How will they do that? What if the US government decided to also make a new legislation requiring all US citizens to obtain licenses so run a node under new counter terrorism laws? Under the pretence it’s necessary to regulate and see who in the US is allowing Iran to bypass sanctions through their node and apps running in their node.

You claim that Russia should not be independent and should be invaded by USA and NATO. You claim that Asia should be subservient to USA that’s imperialism. Russia sanctions are unjust and were aimed to cripple Russia forced by USA into Ukraine in 1991 which caused Russia to fight back. Recent sanctions are only a reaction to a long war and the citizens are angry obviously the new president is not anti Russia and in fact takes a better stance with Russia than the previous USA puppet. The same way previously colonised countries will always choose to hate the west and USA. Asia will never be willing to be subservient to the west. If they were forced to, they will forever remember it just like they do now and hate you for it. 
Stop with your futile attempts to ignore reality that US is more imperialistic and have one of the longest history of invasions alongside its western allies. It further displays your hypocrisy. You should be the one to stop with your pointless comments.

Fake stimulation bonds and QE goes beyond stealing from current customers. They steal from future unborn children. Stuff of nightmares.
Thing is the younger generation sees through this bullshit and will not honour said bonds. You can bet the unborn children won’t either. We didn’t sign up for it before we were born. We won’t honour something we didn’t agree to that our dying grandparents forced upon us. What can you do if we don’t honour the bonds? Lol

Unless you’re either poor or incapable of spending within your limits, you would understand how liberating it is to live on your own cash rather than living off credit loans. Sucks to be you.

The NYAG themselves said so until they seized their funds.
Basically it went like this
NYAG: you got 1:1? Where show me.
Bitfinex: yes I do. It’s  in Panama, UK...
NYAG: not anymore you don’t!
Bitfinex: hey give it back!
NYAG: who’s going to make me? You’ll have to get it from the feds! What can you do? Hahahaha!

All I care about is the false propaganda spread by the US that every other nation is evil and that they are the only good countries that deserve to lord over others.
YOU are the one fixated on Russia when Russians have barely any grief with Asians to begin with. YOU are the only one here who uses Russia as an excuse to pilfer invade and strangle countries that are not Russia. Russia invade country? More like NATO invading Russia. Who the fuck are you to decide whether or not a certain place belongs to a country or not. You’re just another human being run country and we refuse to acknowledge what you recognise.
The world needs people other than USA and it’s puppet states. Asia needs to be independent of US. Asia needs to have its own sovereignty. And the Asian people are happy to have both China and Russia joint with South East Asia create its own coalition. Soon that will happen.
I’m more than a tourist. I’ve been a tax resident on numerous Asian countries lived and mingled with the locals there. They pick China and Russia. Stay ignorant if you want to. Asia could care less.
@_date: 2019-05-02 10:26:01
Sure stay in denial. Just because people don’t like the US they’re weirdos. Whatever lol. Like I said Asia could care less.
I guess you were confused with what I said anyways go back re-read and it might make sense. Russia isn’t invading anyone. The USA however are. And you apparently don’t know that the USA and many other western countries have colonies. If that’s not invasion then you’re mentally challenged.

Despite attack and declaration of war on crypto space from NYAG and illegal seizure of funds from bitfinex , bitcoin continues to persevere and rise against the constant FUD of mainstream media and banksters. Defy their shorts and liquidate them! It’s time we brought the war to them and end financial tyranny!

You’d be surprised that most 3rd world countries have better facilities and luxury estates than the USA near the city areas. Only times you experience less than 3rd world services are when you visit the remote villages which are often still better serviced than Alabama as a whole. Living in the USA isn’t that great anymore. Times are hanging and the USA hasn’t done much to keep itself attractive.

War against the banks! War against the banks! 
1)Withdraw your cash and buy cryptocurrency if they don’t allow online purchase
2)Accept bitcoin directly for merchants
3)don’t spend or convert your bitcoins to fiat. Only use it for direct goods perchase.
4)only pay your govt fees using FIAT don’t convert crypto to fiat if you can avoid it.
5)win when all cash is given back to govt and you are able to live off crypto directly without converting to fiat.

Don’t need it to be worth shit. Only need it to retain its value for 15 minutes while I transfer it to another wallet to obscure the trail. Dumbass! Lol 
Acid got to your brains that you can’t think rationally or plan things? Oh wait this 15 year old just outsmarted you. Acid really damaged your brain cells
Also as people realise the importance of financial privacy and invincibility of monero to censorship, price will increase as btc value increases. A rising tide lifts all boats.

Right so basically what “researchers” claim is that 2% of volume at 10B daily volume was real. So this price rise where volume traded is 30B must be true that only 2% is real.
Smh don’t let the banksters and paid finance researchers dissuade you and lie to you that bitcoin is truly gaining world adoption.
There is no way that “fake volume” exchanges would deliberately raise volume in line to actual market demand percent for percent.
“OH MY GOSH VOLUME IS INCREASING WE NEED TO FAKE MORE TO MAKE SURE 98% VOLUME IS FAKE”

Or maybe I’m just financially sound and spend within my limits. I do not own a single credit card and will NEVER own one. Home loans? Never bothered with one and paid cash for the houses I own. Sucks for those who couldn’t live life not worrying when the next paycheck comes to pay off debts.
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:10:16
Sure they do. Or do they use credit cards to buy luxury goods and then not repay on time only to incur 20% interests.
That’s besides the point. People rely too much on the current banking system and get hooked so bad they can’t ever escape and in turn drag others into that debt cycle. Gone were the days of responsible borrowing and lending which now revolves around scams by the fed which not only sells credit worth our lifetimes but the lifetimes of our children and grand children.
All that and even then, the money we earn to repay them are no longer ours to freely control either and can be confiscated whenever. Sure when do we draw the line? When can we truly own what we worked our lives for? Well maybe you’re one of those average plebs who doesn’t care less about these things because you don’t have a choice. And you don’t care to try to make it change for you or your children either. Rather you’d like your children to be in deeper shit.
Edit: the unbanked have survived being unbanked and have their own assets otherwise they’d be dead. Why should they mortgage their assets for fake credit created out of thin air and debts owed by future unborn children? Might as well sell their assets for something that has value and they can still control it.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:37:48
Reading comments like these I feel bad for those people who rely on the banking cartel to dictate when and how they get to use and withdraw their life’s savings
Edit: I don’t need the banks have never needed banks and credits and loans are all scams. Want a home and car I’ll just buy cash or with cryptocurrency. Live life with what you have. Not what you “will have”
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:08:32
Because they told some of the funds and NYAG acted too quickly to seize it and tipped bitfinex off to move as much as they can out of NYAG reach. Which is why NYAG is going public about this to go after the remaining. NYAG wants it all. Not just 26%
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:46:23
