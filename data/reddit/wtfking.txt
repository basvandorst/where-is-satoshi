You're not wrong, but when speaking to a mass audience it's better to give something tangible to the audience, which tends to be polarising. In this case, acknowledging the multi-faceted nature of a large organisation only weakens his points and disinterests/confuses the general viewer.

We will need rules, restrictions &amp; law, but we'll do it all on the Blockchain, that's the point of Programmable Money - Smart Contracts. Distributed Consensus not only makes the financial institutions irrelevant, it will make ALL institutions irrelevant.
Once we codify useful common law in "2.0" projects such as Ethereum, we will have a **passive &amp; elective** way to just *ignore* old government. We don't need violence or anger.
It's beautiful.
The only thing the States is doing with these moves is discouraging innovation within the States, but it doesn't stop anything, Blockchain companies will just appear somewhere else, which honestly is probably for the best.

Well, middlemen services are necessary for mainstream adoption and transition, but they are an intermediary step. Nothing wrong with suggesting or using them.

The contracts pay a fee per step ( [read the whitepaper]( ) so in reality we are talking very small programs. Bitcoin is 2 things, a distributed consensus platform and a smart contract - the purpose of Ethereum is to expand on the smart-contract side, with the ability to flexibly define contracts we can define smart property (something coloured coins attempting to do) laws, and relationships between people.

You should probably read Nick Szabo's various papers on [Smart Contracts](
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:05:34
even if you do see bitcoin-like protocols as replacing a parts of state, we're still in a very transitionary stage and it's not going to be clean switch - we have systems in place (such as a judicial process) that do work and we shouldn't just throw away because we don't have anything better in place

They haven't taken anyone's money and even pushing the date back until they are confident they larger problems are sorted. 


There is already 2 clients in development, check out their [github](


Read up on [Smart Contracts]( to understand the reason for the flexibility, then realize Contracts will pay per computational step, so in reality we are talking about very small programs [read the Fee section in the whitepaper

Or in the case of a 10k line script, it'd have to be a helluva profitable DAO :D


You are spreading FUD without really understanding Ethereum.


Bitcoin is an experiment and so is Ethereum, it's the dawn of Cryptocurrencies, nobody is perfect and we are all in this together, if you are a software engineer of 34 years, why don't you help contribute to the project (Bitcoin or others) 
There is also a Bitcoin 2.0 Protocol that addresses a variety of issues and Ethereum will inherit the lessons learned.

I think this is an interesting idea - but I think democracy at the core is an unnecessary model in a blockchain-based society. The reason we have democracy is so we can decide on a 'one-size-fits-all' policy that caters to the majority of the citizens.
But with Ethereum people can just use whatever policies(smart contracts) that are best for them, so they implicitly 'vote' just by using policies(smart contracts). In this case, the market decides what is the best law, *and* it's liquid.
If circumstances change, people can adapt immediately. You get voluntary exchange.


With Ethereum, you can *be your own government*.

Can you please go deeper into how an anarchistic system breaks down in a physical space? I'm not sure I follow but would love to hear your thoughts.
There would be a degree of 'one-size-fits-all', in the sense that the best smart contracts would be used by the majority people through a darwinian process. In my view, this predominant collection of smart contracts would resemble something like the modern nation state (and would probably include your model).
I don't think that would stop multiple ideologies co-existing in the same physical space, I envision it looking much like cultural sects you get today, places like China town and Little Italy operating in a western society, except they'll have their own smart contracts and will naturally gravitate to occupy the same space, but that doesn't disallow an Italian walking into China town, because there would be some smart contracts both of them agree to, or they would establish some 'glue' smart contracts upon first interaction.

From a perspective that Cryptocurrencies operate entirely within (the influence of) the State, then I absolutely agree with you. From this perspective, Regulation and favourable Media are expected, and MIT certainly adds to the legitimacy of *digital currencies*. This is a step in that direction, to bring the technology within the States influence.
My view is different from yours, in my view, Cryptocurrencies can be viewed as a competing State. A higher form of libertarian ideals and anarchistic expression.
Cryptocurrencies by their very nature take power away from traditional government, and in the coming years they will evolve to expand into every facet of our social organisation, including Regulation.  
However I agree with you, it'll be born from within the cradle of the State, adopting policies that make sense and having people peacefully and voluntarily adopt them.
But, as you can imagine, this will not be taken lightly or favourably, and this is why I am cautious of any interaction between them, especially when the actions taken have already been anti-social and coercive in nature. 
Also, I would argue that the additional step in the funding chain is more-or-less a proxy, and does not lessen any influence from up the funding chain.
I really like MIT, which is why I think it's great for many things, but not for technologies that come in conflict with the hand that feeds it.
Thanks for your comment

It's not going to be more private, the data you generate along with whatever Bitcoin transaction is going to be used to identify you. But thats okay, because in a world where privacy is no longer assumed, it's only the states that will ultimately suffer in the end.

Appreciate the video, you more or less say "Yes" we're competing in the sense of Bitcoin Blockchain vs Ethereum Blockchain, and "No" in the sense that we use their codebase for smart contracts because open source.
I would much rather hear the differences/pros and cons of each approach. Why does Counterparty believe in running this on Bitcoin blockchain, the pro is obvious but what downsides(ie coloured coin problem) are there that has necessitated Ethereum to creating a separate blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:07:10
Bitcoin is private in of itself, but mass-surveillance done by the state strips privacy, that's not a problem of Bitcoin as a technology, but of the State.

More than one way to skin a cat. The malware is running on the local machine.
Chances are good he's running a bitcoin gui, lets say bitcoin-qt, now all you need to do is setup a macro that clicks on the right buttons and fill out the transactions in his client.
Only way you can be secure is not have your wallet not on an internet connected machine (and do transaction signing offline)
