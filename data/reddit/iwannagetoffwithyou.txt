As a trader, I don't understand how he simply "lost" that much BTC. He seems more like a gambler than trader.

What is this supposed to even mean?

Pretty sure there’s a difference between literal pizza and two supercars.

You know everyone, not just bitcoin enthusiasts, think you and your club’s little shills who go in and invade other subs, especially topics asking for help, are douchebags, right? Because it’s true.

I’ve been told this so many times. I don’t understand why people hate crypto so much. 
“I don’t understand it? Ponzi scheme”

Damn. This is unfortunate for everyone affected. I feel bad for all the ones who lost money with the hack. I know how it feels to have money stolen. 
I have used NiceHash. Good thing my rig absolutely sucks and I’ve barely been able to mine anything.

Stealing it? (not recommended)

What does this mean for people like me? 
I have a Coinbase account and some BTC in there. Not much. And I’m not trying to hide it from the government. 
But Coinbase won’t let me verify my freaking identity. I sent them my drivers license, past and present address, the works, and they still won’t accept my existence. So does that mean I’m hiding my crypto from the government?

Can someone please explain to me the “hodl and never trade” mentality? 
I have more BTC from trading then I would have if I just “hodld”. And I am not an expert trader whatsoever. I didn’t know a thing about trading when I started.
I understand the fact that some new traders lose money. But I don’t understand the mentality around here that trading is literally from Satan.
