Thank you for the detailed answer. I will try it out tomorrow, and hopefully be able to provide encryption for those that demand it.

I came to the conclusion that removing the required login might actually be the best course of action. I would highly appreciate it if you could partake in the survey. Thank you for the feedback.

There is no other practical solution for making it difficult for a single individual to take the survey multiple times. It is of course no guarantee, but it is better than having nothing. If you wish to maintain your anonymity on the Internet, you should probably avoid the survey, although this particular survey only concerns Bitcoin anonymity. There is no practical way for me to obtain any link between who you are and which transactions you are responsible for in the Blockchain, without you going out of your way to provide me with that specific information. If your issue only concerns Bitcoin anonymity, this survey is non-intrusive.

Thank you. I posted several times in the past few days. Although with the activity on this subreddit, I can see how people might have missed it.

Good idea! I will look into it and try to implemented some kind of encryption in last section of the survey. Would you happen to know of a simple way of achieving this, without too much hassle?

Thank you for your opinion. Could you be more specific regarding the errors? It is still possible for me to correct them.
