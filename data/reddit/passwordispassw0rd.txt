Wow, your an asshole. You want to scare me? OOH, big bad navy seal. 300 kills. Your such a bad ass! OH, I am SO sorry to have provoked your wrath! You should ask yourself, did I DIRECTLY challenge you? Did I TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY that I WANTED to beat your ass? No I did NOT! I said I was a pacifist. I even said I DON"T want to fight you. You should read the posts more carefully before you decide to lash out hatefully and threaten me. This was simply about how I don’t (lift? No, I do not lift things, if your talking about weights or something) or exercise, I don’t care to, and I don’t like bacon. You took this to a WHOLE other level. I was just defending myself from YOUR spiteful comment where you made fun of me for simply not liking bacon and that I don’t lift weights. You, and that other buddy of yours, should calm down. And you do not scare me. I’ve come close to death a few times, and I’m not scared of it. I accept it. I’ve been robbed before, and have felt the blade against my neck. And I’ve been fucked with and threatened my WHOLE life from ALOT of other people, even from my own dad! He is tough and unforgiving. I grew up in a military family. My dad graduated from West Point (Lt. Col) and fought in Vietnam, for your freedoms and mine, like that of freedom of speech (be it threatening, hateful, and mocking like yours) and mine (where I was simply standing up for myself when you made fun of me). And I am not a kiddo, I’m 30. And it’s funny how you click “like” on your own comments. How egotistical. I’m done now.
