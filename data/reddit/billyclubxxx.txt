Just ordered one!  Love it!
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:26:03
No prob I’m in no rush.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:23:59
I’ll be getting it framed real nice and going on my wall. 
@_date: 2019-07-31 05:56:09
Very cool!  I agree with your assessment.  I’ve thought about doing the same.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:02:28
Sorry I’m new but what’s the strategy of selling in a flash dip?  I can tell from the comments that’s not the norm strategy but from OP post it sounds like some pros do it.  So what’s the strategy for you guys with the skills to pull it off?  
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:49:17
Just Hodl. It’s that easy. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 23:29:14
At one point it was over 25% I paid.  Is that not astronomical to you when visa is 3%?  And I also waited over 24 hrs to get a transaction at one point. You gonna roll through Starbucks to get a coffee and sit there for 24 hrs waiting for them to get their BTC?  
Now I’m not a tech guy. I have no horse in this race, I’m just sharing my experiences as a mostly average consumer who uses this very often, isn’t just a hodler and I’m not showing any preference except for functionality. Whatever works best is what I’m going to use. Which I think is how most of the world will view it to as time goes on. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:19:42
Traded mine for BCH. Sorry fellas. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:13:39
Well if you bought them at $375 you’re not unhappy through all this lol 
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:17:29
Possibly but I actually send and receive different cryptos daily and BCH just works way better. Especially during those attacks. It put a stop to using BTC unless you were ok waiting a long time and paying astronomical fees. That opened my eyes. I have no horse in the race, I just want what works best. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:09:51
Welcome to the club my friend!  Now gotta get to 21 BTC so you can be one of the few in that club. I was really happy when I got there. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:00:38
This is true!
@_date: 2019-03-26 04:36:06
I was just stoked it went back to 3900 lol. When it got to 15k I thought I’d missed the boat. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 04:33:22
If it does I’m buying a ton. 
@_date: 2019-11-19 23:28:51
I just bought $4,000. More worth. Give me all of it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:40:09
What about Breadwallet and Copay?  Are they just as insecure as Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:51:32
By spamming the network what does that mean?  I think of sending ads?  Lol. I'm a contractor so most computer stuff I don't know much about. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:54:14
Is answering required to do you transactions?  
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:22:14
Gotcha so Bread and Copay are better than Coinbase but not as good as a Trezor?
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:52:37
Ok sounds unanimous that it's the smart move. Thnx!
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:23:13
Dude, this sounds amazing!  You sound exactly suited to go all in and I 100% agree with you on my firm belief that it will kill a lot of fiats and pure logic says it’s going to go way way up in value. You’ll probably look back on this being the decision that set your life free.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:37:23
I'm not sure what a threat model is.  For me they were just a fun investment worth around 4K so not my retirement or life savings or anything but still don't want to lose money or be irresponsible.  From what I've read Coinbase didn't sound secure so awhile ago I moved them around to roughly half in Copay and the other half are in Breadwallet. None are in Coinbase or ever really were. I've got 10.2 coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:31:42
Thanks for the info. I have roughly half in Breadwallet and the other half in Copay. I'd read not to have them on Coinbase awhile ago but they weren't worth nearly what they are now so I didn't feel like a hardwallet was really necessary. Splitting them and putting them into those was what I did.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:53:04
I like this. I'm rather inexperienced to bitcoin but I have a decent amount of them so I'm diving in and learning a lot more about them. So I don't really have anything to add but I will be watching this thread with interest. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:51:28
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:06:45
Cashed them out today. Can't lose that $$$.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:38:52
Also no im not using them for trading or spending. They're just sitting there fun to watch go up. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:46:00
Is it temporary?  From segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:39:03
Which videos did you send?  
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:00:42
Thank you for the invite!  It's extremely intimidating. I don't understand 99% of it and have a ton of questions. Even reading up on it in the sidebar is tough for a non techie like me. I swing a hammer for a living lol. I really want to learn more though. 
@_date: 2019-08-04 07:16:18
Good on you.  You did the right thing.
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:38:05
I’m sorry could someone please ELI5?
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:59:02
Thank you!!
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:49:55
�� ok Maybe 30 but very green.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:44:39
Precisely.  Glad I bought the hell out of them $3500 hundred BTCs while my scared friends were even more scared.
@_date: 2019-06-20 07:05:06
Exactly, this makes far too much sense for so many reasons that it’s inevitable, get as much as you can of the top 20 and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:54:49
@_date: 2019-06-20 07:02:19
As a very casual observer but have been watching a long time and with my mind looking at it with a very practical real world view on it I see it getting easier for new people to successfully get quickly.
When I talk about it now I meet far fewer people who have never heard of it.  
A lot more people now clearly want to get some but not bad enough to dive in a try to figure out how.  
They get excited when I tell them to buy $100 worth of XRP and thank me later and most have done it who know me well, the day I told them in fact.
My father is extremely impressed my crypto has nearly caught up to his long held Apple stock in value in much less time.
I see it doing the grind to prove itself to the masses.  Many of my friends who were skeptics when I first told them I was buying it now ask me questions every day and lament not listening to me back then.  So big flip in belief from quite a few people.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:10:26
I’m just asking hypothetically.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:24:27
I don’t get the sense of general public interest and hype I felt last time.  This feels like there’s deeper interests working here.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:48:41
Tired when I wrote it. $3500 per BTC. After it’s gone way back down. But they were scared then that it’d go much lower still.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:27:39
How would you sell it?  Trade for real property like someone else suggested?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:13:28
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:56:52
I am so confused by all this. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:20:36
I’m so confused by all this. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:02:34
Like the guy who wiped a HDD that had 300 coins on it this means that those 3500 are gone forever right?  I wonder how many coins still are in circulation?
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:00:35
Damn and those 300 are gone forever then aren’t they?
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:46:07
Any ideas why the spike?
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:24:48
I’m a brand new grandpa and just set aside BTC for my grandson too!  Congrats!
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:06:54
What I was referring to is old man Rockefeller came from super poverty. He was unique in his family for having a great eye for financial discipline and he didn’t want to see his sons be like all the rest of their family. So they got an allowance but they had to account for every penny or they wouldn’t get any more. Forced them to learn about bookkeeping and budgeting.
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:14:48
You bet.
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:46:24
Exactly. Gotta follow the example of Rockefeller and have to really teach kids the value of money and to earn it. One of the toughest lessons for a rich parent to teach. Harder on them than the kids.
@_date: 2019-01-14 09:42:41
Here in the states we know the value. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 09:41:05
I got 8 payments today in BTC. Totaling almost a. Whole coin. Does it matter where I am?  I think this coin will be worth a Lot. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:59:38
Glad you got what you wanted my friend. We all have our path.  I myself have been hodling since BTC was $375 a coin. And I’m just buying more every dip. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:50:44
As an absolute newb to the political and inner workings of BTC as well as not being techy at all (I'm a building contractor) I appreciate the clear and understandable language used in this. So much of what I read about bitcoin just goes over my head that I'm left just as confused as before I read it. This may be biased to one side of the segwit2x argument and I'd like to read a similar layman terms write up from the other sides but this helps me understand a lot better. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:18:46
What did he say?  I missed it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:04:46
How can I get one of these?
@_date: 2019-09-15 05:18:06
Dats da gooooooood sheet!!
@_date: 2019-09-13 07:14:35
That’s awesome!  What a great idea. So many people are confused by it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:50:49
This is so exactly perfect of a copy of the old text I’m inclined to believe it was purposeful.  For this Reddit post probably. But your  point is excellently made, none the less. Good work.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:24:54
Just bought another $1500 worth.
@_date: 2019-09-15 05:22:33
Privacy coins will have a strong place. Gov will never stop trying to dig their greedy fingers in.
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:53:26
Except this time I see it and BTC isn’t working well as a currency. I’ve stopped taking it. It’s too slow. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:25:04
Time to get more!
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:05:22
Hodl shit I’m buying. Got another half of a BTC this week. It’s on saaaaaaaaaaale!!!
