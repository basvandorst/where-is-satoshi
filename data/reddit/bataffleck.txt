Throwing molotov gesture is more on portraying rebellion, not  violence.
I see it as rebelling against government that made the mess in the first place.
And instead of fire/molotov, the people use bitcoin.
Drop the euro, use bitcoin. The hell with what government says. The hell with what EU says. We (people of greece) want full  control of our money..

Of course not all people of greece will move to bitcoin. 
Only a small number of young/tech savvy greek who do know what btc is would have done it, 
and maybe few more relatives will be convinced by them to follow their footsteps.
Also, Of course they won't convert  all their cash to btc. 
But if things goes really really bad, it will be those few people that can stay financially sound (although with limited ways on how to spend their money)..
 And maybe that's how the world realize the power of btc.

Rioters do not want to destroy greece (the nation), they protest government policies.. Soo.. Yeah, maybe OP shouldn't put greece map there.. Maybe EU &amp; greece leader can be more appropriate.. Maybe.

@_date: 2015-06-24 01:53:23
I meant *more* tax... (I should've wrote that -- i was following the last sentence of the comment above me)  Which increased due to government failure to cover up their debt (like what happened in Cyprus, and maybe gonna happen in greece)
If things happen normally: regular inflation as expected, services like police/electricity/roads/public transport are handled  properly as usual.. Most folks will pay tax with no complain
Cos if everything happens normally, that means your (US) government is not horribly incompetent... Maybe not as competent as the people would like them to be.... But more like: "Well.. Can be worse.."
Now Cyprus.. That one CAN'T be worse...
And greece (though with new administration) looks like following cyprus's steps..

It's a real solution for upper mid class (with internet access &amp; tickets to get out of the country)  to protect &amp; transfer SOME of their wealth... just in case. 
Bitcoin wasn't created to solve debts.. Or to increase productivity... So.. Yeah..
 Imho Greece make mistake in borrowing too much and making so little, and needs to go bankrupt (like iceland) before rising up. 
And while that happened.. Btc is an option for those to know how to use it, to store part of their portfolio
And if... Shit really hits the fan, and small numbers of well-to-do greek family managed to protect &amp; transfer their wealth out of the country, away from government hand.. People will notice. People will start asking, "what is this btc?"

@_date: 2014-12-24 16:00:07
No,it does not defeat the purpose of bitcoin
Purpose of bitcoin is to create a currency system without central bank, unregulated &amp; manipulation-free. Not anonymity. 
It is up to you if you want to use your bitcoin for illegal purpose.. but don't blame coinbase for not wanting to be part of it.
Also, iirc.. Coinbase explained this in their eula

I think you are wrong on this.
Apple is the company that popularize digital purchase for music, movies &amp; apps..  (And books &amp; magazines to some extent)
And now they are on their way to popularize "digital" transaction, so we are going to be able to authorize payment with nfc &amp; fingerprint scanner.
Until now merchants don't care so much about nfc, cos although google wallets has been launched for years, nobody is using it. 
Now, Apple is betting their money in being able to change this. They are on a crusade in making non-techie people comfortable in using nfc/phone &amp; merchants to accept this new method. A crusade that will cost them a lot of money (advertisement, educating the costumer, working with merchant/ visa )
This is good news for android users like me, who for sure will be benefited by having more merchant accept nfc payment incuding google wallets (of course instead of fingerprint, i need to enter my PIN instead... But I'm sure future android phones will have fingerprint scanner as well)
This is also good news for people like us, who love our digital currencies. A society that comfortable is doing digital transaction everywhere is a step closer to digital currency adoption.
Apple might be the last company to accept bitcoin for all I care, but they might be helping the adoption by introducing apple pay

dammit man, if you want to hide it there, at least use micro SD..
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:38:39
Im looking at it from public acceptance of digital transaction as a whole...
Until now, making a purchase with your phone is something that , in public's eye, only being done by "tech-smart"  or "geekie" people.
 "Normal" people will use normal stuff: cash or plastic cards.. Cos if it has no physical thing, it's not money (which is silly cos plastic card is not money) 
This limits the implementation of NFC by merchants.. And even if they have, it just stuck there in the corner, cos:
- no one ask for it anyway
- the cashiers are not familiar in how to operate it.. Makes everything slow
Apple wants to change this, with costly ads &amp; negotiations with merhants/visa etc.
apple wants nfc stations (&amp; capable cashiers to operate them) on every store, 
and more importantly, apple wants *the public to be comfortable in doing digital transaction* using your phone as your wallet.
To me,  *public that is comfortable in doing digital transaction* is a step closer to bitcoin adoption
@_date: 2014-12-21 03:27:38
Wait, 
But isn't the original intent for bitcoin is not anonymity, But to create a currency system that is independent from central banks and regulation? 
Wasn't bitcoin created in respond to government bailouts/ interventions/ market manipulations ? Anonymity was not part of the intent.. It just happen that you can do transaction with bitcoin anonymously, IF both parties agree.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:34:23
Western union should expand their business to providing bitcoin 
A joint western union - coinbase would be amazing
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:44:56
Central bank, like the feds... not regular banks..
Central banks determine the interest rate, the inflation, the distribution. They can print money as much/as little as they want to manipulate the value. This is the very reason bitcoin is created. A digital gold that requires no central institution.
 And you don't need coinbase &amp; bitpay to do transaction. I've been doing transactions without both services.
my bad, what I really mean is "heavily regulated &amp; controled to benefit a small group of people only"  
Like Lobbyists, wall street, Etc.
While in bitcoin, regulations are part of it's algorithms.. Not siding to any group of people in particular.
Well, my comments still stand, the purpose IS to have a manipulation-free currency. 
We haven't reach there yet: the marker still small &amp; big amount of BTC is controlled by small number of people
@_date: 2015-05-11 08:37:09
True, 
In the end, confirming transactions would be another business altogether.. 
Hence we gonna have "visa/mastercard" version of bitcoins.
(And the best candidates are Visa and MasterCard themselves)
@_date: 2015-05-11 11:16:14
My thinking is more like:
- if VISA can make a way for me to store some of my bitcoin (after providing my ID to them) into their system.. (Let's say, VISA bought Coinbase)
- and hire a genius to link it to their creditcard system.
- and I can spend bitcoin, on any merchants (online /  mortar&amp;bricks) which accepts VISA.. It will just use its btc/USD rate, as if I spend my dollars on foreign countries using Visa
- merchant don't need to do anything. At all.
 Instant confirmation as usual (you are using VISA afterall)
Unlike startups, they have their system &amp; infrastructure in place.. And already have people "thrust" in managing people's money.

If core increased the limit, it would be the best solution. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:36:06
In the end, 
it is how much money they need to spend to implement btc payment + maintenance cost
 VS.
  how much money they can potentially get from implementing it (taking price volatility into account)
 Volatility is the wild horse here. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:44:40
If you think about it, price drop was (maybe) because of Hearn 
And because of that...china miners got a wake up call, and now most of them said will support classic/ bigger block
Now, classic supporters are everywhere.. From big companies, big name devs, big mining pool, etc..
This create optimism that we can break out from core tight grip... Which in return, turn the price up...
So... Thank you Hearn! 
And please keep your integrity, since you are now working among wolves 
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:33:12
I do support bigger block.. Cos transactions stuck for days annoys me.. maybe i wasn't reading much on XT, but i thought it wasn't really getting traction? Big names like coinbase/ mycellium/ vorhess(?) Support or at least experiment on it.. But miners has small/no incentive to use it.. especially china miners. 
(Personally, i find this annoying)
As for theymos... Yeah, screw him. But I don't think his censorship  has  anything to do with big pools decisions to not implement xt.
I get it.... If I need to deal with theymos,  I think I am gonna vomit every morning 
 But i still those think those are petty reasons to quit from bitcoin... And especially to claim that bitcoin has failed.
 Why? Because Bitcoin is more than just block size debate &amp; childish censorship.
Bitcoin is a gift from satoshi. It is our tool (weapon?) to fight money manipulation by the elites, our shield to protrct our wealth from big banks &amp; regulators's incompetence &amp; greed.
++++ 
Cmiiw, Bitcoin was created as a respond to 2008 bailout, where big banks playing with people's money, lost it, and the people was punished for it.
And we see that they haven't learn a bit. See iceland, cyprus, greece, portugal..
Back to mike..  Where is he now? 
 he is not just resign, he bloody join the frickin banks!  bloody 42 of em!!
He is helping them to make a private "bitcoin", a tool for banks to have a stronger control on people's bank accounts, and they will SURELY MANIPULATE it as they always did.
 Heck, now they don't even need central banks/government permission to create inflation or deflation.
 lightning is nothing compared to this! Theymos is like sweet nice
 grandma compared to these evil bastard! 
Theymos belongs in his parents basement, but (some of) these guys belong in jail!
Sorry, i kinda rant &amp; get emotional..
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:12:29
Hearn dump bitcoin the currency (and maybe the community). Not the technology behind it
R3 is selling blockchain technology (not the currency)
I think R3 gonna make their own "currency", a blockchain with some backdoor.. (Which surely they can control with inflation/deflation/or even backed by fiat)
Anyway... Imho Not gonna work.. 
We are here not because blockchain is permisionless, fast, shared database, etc etc..
We are here because no one can control bitcoin. No central bank. 
We saw what banks can do to our money, in 2008 bailout, in cyprus, in greece... and we want none of it
Blockchain is a tool invented to create a decentralised &amp; free-from-manipulation currency..
And they use it as a glorified google sheet

I doubt they will use only fiat
They will apply their own bankcoin, maybe in the beginning it will backed with people's accounts 
And soon they will derivate it as they always do. 
And then manipulate it as they always do..
 And they will have complete control on it that even central banks/regulators don't know what is  happening inside.
@_date: 2016-01-28 12:42:46
While we are talking about communication... Can they also explain RBF?
As in,
- who ask for it? It was rejected last time, why bring it back?
- why we need it?
- able to change amount and change recipient AFTER transaction? Sounds SUPER risky. Why do it?
- what are the limitation? Cos it seems bad for merchants..
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:08:47
I'm with you in this. I am not afraid, we are lucky we have bitcoin. Maybe im just bitter after reading Hearn saying btc is failed...

Does it has to be bigger block OR lighting?
 Can the market has both? Must a central "leader" decide what good for us? And censor other opinion?
Also, there's higher fee issue on lighting. And it (cmiiw) it also does not solve backlogs.. So again, market will decide. We will use it if it is good.
Another thing, why not let market decide? Why can't we lift this artificial limit (that was implemented to avoid spam to a higher limit) Which is clearly already behind the supply-demand equilibrium?
Bring on lighting too... but give the market options. Bring them both on the table.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:50:08


Yes, I don't believe in big banks. They have been manipulative in the past, and will be still in the future.

But i just cant believe that R3 coin would be free from elite bankers' manipulation. Things that they have done for...  well forever.
Even worse, it would be easier to manipulate R3 coins than fiat. You dont need to deal with central banks/parliaments/governments.
It would be closed blockchain ecosystem and they can do whatever they want with costumers money. 
Can you imagine if HSBC has used this technology when they did their money laundering?
Or american banks during the subprime mortgage? 
As I said before, it's like if donald trump comes up with his own version of online-presidential-election software.. 
It will save a lot of money, sure..
A brilliant technology, sure..

@_date: 2016-01-16 07:56:20
Personally I am really scared with this private blockchain development..
It's like bankers are begging thr gov. for the ability to print their own money..
Well currently, they are good friends (banks &amp; regulators).. But if shit happens, banks still need to beg for stimulus etc... 
But later.. when banks have their own private blockchain? With coins representing their costumer'ss money?
Blockchain on the hand of the bankers is scary.. They can add backdoor, manipulate the value, etc.
 It's like a....
Computer-based election technology, (which is a good technology for democracy)... But  With  donald trump  controlling the server.
Why can't Hearn see this? Am I being hyperbolic?

And what, quit when his idea not accepted/censored in forums?  (There is a comment in another post that said, I paraphrase: bitcoin is money, people have agendas, if you don't expect blood, mike, you are so wrong)
Publishing a resign letter that, well sounds (imho) childish?
And now he is under a payroll of a consortium of BLOODY 42 BANKS ! (Kinda sure they have deep pockets..)
So.. He quit because he just fed up with theymos?  Or fed up cos so few accept XT?
 A guy as smart like him? Who has been with btc since the early days?
I kinda feel it's insulting to him, to think that those are his only reasons...

Alt-coin should be stuff like litecoin &amp; peercoin. Entirely separate system. Personally I don't mind, but you want to ban it? Sure, fine..
But alt-client should be allowed. Because there is NO such thing as "holy" &amp; "irreplaceable" client. Client should always get updated, and we should be able to discuss the new proposed alternatives. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 04:51:12
I think no one is super angry &amp; bitter to core devs..
It just that, the market demand faster transaction time, and core devs disagree. Then some other devs came up with proposals of alternative clients.. Some too divisive, some are taking good compromise between two positions.
And now we are to witness what the market will choose.
I think (though I cant speak for all), We as community are not angry &amp; bitter with core devs. We know they contribution for years and grateful for it.
We do, however, bitter &amp; angry on the censorship &amp; manipulations implemented in some of the bitcoin forums

Your coin is not really on your computer.
 It is in a public ledger that everyone have in their PC. Called the blockchain. Let just say your coin is in one of the blocks.
 It requires a private key to access this particular block which will allow you to spend the coin. Think of it as your ATM pin.
The bitcoin software/wallet/app that you have in your PC/phone right now  (On which you can spend your coin immediately) Is actually automatically connect to that particular block using this atm pin. You just don't realize it.
When you backup your wallet, basically it let you know what is the pin number. So if you lost your phone, you still have the private key/pin number.. 
So you are able to connect to that block where your coin is... once you reinstall the app.
So, back to your question:
- you have $100  in bank (or, the blockchain)
- get your atm pin number from bank 
- spend $40 on amazon.
- the next day you go to atm machine and will find that your fund will be only $60

He maintained good credibility through out the years since then.
Why ignoring him (and mike)?

One thing for sure, gavin is not on the one censoring ( shutting people up from) important discussions on bitcoin main forum.. Or the ones who pretend like there is no censor happening...

Waayy too early.
Look at 2011, look at 1013
Last time it was 100/150 and jump all the way up to 1200.
Now there are more of us, with more established bitcoin companies and more business that accept btc... And our starting point was 260 + bitcoin is tax free in EU (Means, it is accepted as currency, which is more important than china back-and-forth regulation methinks)
I predict this can reach at least 1500 and probably 2000 before it goes down again to mean level of 300-400 early next year
I suggest to play save is to stop buying at 400.. Start selling bit by bit when it reaches 800..

It's like this (to borrow his cancer analogy): Doctors has diagnosed that Tommy has  a cancer, and Tommy can still be in denial. Only when tommy accept the fact that he has cancer, a curing process can start.. Else tommy will still do his old lifestyle (smoking, for example)


Western civilisation as we know it is finished. It cannot deal with the 
new threats it faces. It is being torn apart from inside and outside. 
Tommy's old lifestyle = western civilization as we know it. It is finished. It cannot deal with the cancer (isis).


ensure our cultural survival. 
Tommy's survival = our cultural survival..
Tommy's chemo/ new healthy lifestyle = New ideas. To replace the western civilization (that is failed fighting isis). Something that can withstand isis as an idea

If you have btc right now and doing day trading.. I suggest get ready to sell when it reach 900. Cos once it hits 1000 it would be happening so fast (up or down).. Better to have small profit than missed the chance entirely
If you are here for a long haul.. Buy while it is around 400. And put it in your paper wallet. Put a reminder for next 2-5 years.
I myself prefer to keep  80% for long term &amp; 20% for day trading fun.. (Cos I can afford to lose it)
Last time (end 2013) that 20%  became 60% of my total btc, by playing with litecoin &amp; some day trading.

Not just for keeping, but also for trading.
With bitcoin community right now (most are tech guys &amp;gals), we don't see much variation on kind of products &amp; services that accept bitcoins.

Coinbase has it merit, its simplify how people use / doing transaction with bitcoin..
As long as they do deliver what they promised, I am ok with that.
 Their service is not for everybody. Just because coinbase is not for you, doesnt mean they are bad.
Unless... If they have shady practices underneath that I dont know of (fixing rates? Money laundring?.. Then yes they are bad)
Also, bitcoin is decentralized &amp; open system, which is why the rate can not be controlled by any government...
 but business dealing with bitcoins do not necessarily need to be "decentralised &amp; open". 
In fact, there is no "decentralized" business..
Coinbase has done a lot to bitcoin growth: Installing bitcoin qt, making paper wallets, are not for everyone. We should be grateful with this kind of service which allow more non-tech people to use bitcoins comfortably

- Yes I can secure my wallet myself.. But many (like.. Lets just throw a number: 90% of earth population?) can't or don't have the time. Hence coinbase. If those people are not on-board, then bitcoin are just one big exercise  with no real impact in our society/civilization.
- even if I secure my wallet.. Lets say in a SD card, paper, or offline laptop... Then someone broke my apartment, who should I go to? Police, i.e. the government. 
- maybe I'm not a futurist, but I just can't imagine living without demanding service &amp; protection from government. I demand Roads, street lights, police... Why not demand for protection from fraud? Including the ones that has to do with BTc?
- but I get your point, we just see "ideal future" differently.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:03:14
The point of btc in that scenario is... People is ditching fiat currency to real-value currency (btc) 
People is sick with government playing the value of their hard earned money...
Look at cyprus, portugal, italy.. Or warzones like ukraine. Remember US 2008 bailouts...
People want to ditch this fiat money which value keep depreciates over time. 
People wants real currency to buy &amp; sell things/services (especially SELL). 
But bitcoin are juust to complicated. For tailors, for grocers, for gardeners, artists, accountants... Those who have products to sell but not really have "tech" capability on their own.
This is where coinbase come in.
What is your understanding on "de/centralized"?
To me, decentralized means, no central governing/bank that can manipulate the value. the rate is purely by supply &amp; demand.
Satoshi made bitcoin in respond to constant government interverence to fiat currency values. From asian 98 fiancial crisis to US 2008 massive bailout which devalue dollar price significantly --basically robbing everyone who own a US Dollar--  to save greedy banks from their own mistake: giving out sub-prime mortgage.
In a way, with 2008 bailout as reference, big banks/wallstreet can always do stupid things... Cos government will use peoples money to save them anyway
Bitcoin on the other hand, has no "the fed", or "central government", no central entity that ~~can~~ have the right to control the value.  Because it gives power to anyone who can to be a miner / auditor... And it has unchanged algorithm on how many btc can exists (as oppose to the fed "printing" trillion of dollars for bailout) hence: decentralized.. 
Crisis can happen, but in "satoshi's ideal world", the banks will have to pay on their own.
Now, based on that understanding (which what I can take based on what I see in his/her/their whitepaper--- maybe we have different understanding)  , "the point of bitcoin" still stands.
Coinbase is just that: just another clone of paypal.. imho it can never manipulate the value of BTC. Just as paypal has no effect to USD rates. But no matter how shitty paypal is, we should recognize its impact on e-commerce, how in the early years it encouraged small merchants to sell stuff over the internet for the first time... 
Imho coinbase can have similar impact in pushing bitcoin to the mass. Especially to encourage merchants in accepting BTC.
Just to add, in fact I prefer that one need to provide information/make an account to deal with them, and that they go public in the stock markets (this means their finance is open for public/stockholders) &amp; practice under US law. This means if shit happens, costumers have legal ways to sue them.
Also, from what I understand from satothi whitepaper, privacy/annonymity was NEVER the goal.. Heck, all transactions is recorded in blockchain! Everything you do is recorded in everyones computer... Yes we can't connect the address &amp; the person... For now.. There will come a time when no transactions cannot be tracked to the parties involved (ok, im a bit sci fi on this one.. Ignore that last sentence)
But honestly, If you want privacy, don't do  anything online. Use gold coin, john wick style..
@_date: 2015-02-28 00:15:07
It's a thing from the very beginning.. (Sort of)
As we know, If you have bitcoin qt in your PC, you have records of every transaction in BTC: wallet address to wallet address.. 
Now what's left is just how to attach the address to a person's identity/ company.
I'm sure in the future this exercise will be easier/ more common..
