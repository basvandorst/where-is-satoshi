Yeah, but when do you do it? I'm unclear.

It will and it did go to a rich asshole.

And will be again!

It'll be as valuable as dogecoin soon, so get ready to load up.

Do you really thing that what people are doing here really matters?

"FUD" tends to build up quickly when the new system is wiping out the life savings of thousands of people in the space of a month.

Listen to this guy. 10 percent is great. Get out and consider yourself lucky.

Cryptocurrency may have a future. Bitcoin is finished though. It will be a long time before most people trust bitcoin enough to put their money into it again, if ever. If you don't have trust, you don't have a viable currency. Get out while you still have enough money to eat and pay rent. Don't let the whales take everything you have.

Oh yeah, I’m sure the public is psyched to start moving their stable fiat into this shit coin after this fiasco.

I don’t see the connection between this article and Bitcoin. Are you saying that things can’t fail?

This is the fatal flaw of bitcoin. Bitcoin will rise until some other cryptography comes out that doesn't overly incentives hoarding and people will actually want to use it. That coin will eventually reach mass adoption and bitcoin will crash to zero.

No previous crash was this public or hurt this number of people. It will take a much longer time for people to trust any crypto currency again. The one that ends up being trusted and used likely won’t be bitcoin. That coin may not even exist yet.
