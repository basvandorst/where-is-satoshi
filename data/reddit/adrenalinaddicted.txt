If thats the case if have to NOT be more popular, and from that angle i think there is not many who want it that way.
But as a volatile currency i understand. and its a nice number too

Yeah Danish fellow, almost thinking like reposting. And thinking that it must be illegal one way or another? Its bad.!
- Now redditors got a pure source, but understanable that they didnt believe 'This bullshit!'
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:36:47
Wierd, somethiing here is strange.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:48:47

@_date: 2014-02-07 18:15:40
Its not possible.. We are so much before and most important thing for thé bitcoin community right now more than ever is a simple html5 wallet, thé most simple paying solution ever we made. Device to device - Human 2 human.
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:20:04
Was it the same amount?
Little out a box but in dk maybe other countrys too credot card cannot do 2 transfers in a row with same amount. But if changing amount 1dkr then its no problem. 
Hope it heles If not good luck and happy new year!
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:25:51
Small fact LEGO have around 20% of all toys market in the World.
LEGO is Danish and means LEg GOdt which means play well.

@_date: 2014-02-12 09:07:52
Could be nice to add some wooden coins to it with a laser cutted QR of 10euro/5euro.
Its awesome but need upgrade. This is an indoor machine no doubt so its not that huge a target for criminals.

@_date: 2014-01-04 22:55:41
Then it will be illegal in U.S.! And Europe cause of this asslicking competition.
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:09:28
The best option for shorting will be plus500 its a stock site with btc.
when it works remember me and throw a message, cause shorting bitcoins sounds way to crazy imo. :D
God day!
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:40:59

@_date: 2014-01-08 11:14:41
Yes but it was a short story that didnt even got a real try.
What is tbh?
-Bitcoin will raise no doubt. its just about when, cause maybe it started 5 years ago but its still 'completely' new.
