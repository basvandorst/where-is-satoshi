You're being willfully ignorant and choosing to believe the only measure of a cryptocurrency's efficacy and usefulness is it's fees. You're being intentionally passive aggressive and smug, and in turn you're revealing how daft you are. 
You're not worth explaining things to because you already have your mind made up and just want to prod at people.

Yes I know. I was referencing the video of Jihan Wu getting pissed at a conference because someone called it BCash.

The attack proved the exact opposite of this. Bitcoin came out on top after the attack and is still growing. If anything the failure that was the BCash overthrow attempt proved that Bitcoin won't be taken down by any of the alts in the current crypto environment.

I've never noticed the crypto community being disproportionately male to be honest. As far as I've seen it's actually a pretty diverse community of people. 
Only thing I could posit to explain there being more men than women in crypto is that a lot of people into this come from STEM backgrounds and that's a field of study/work that is predominantly male. Not saying thats the reason but it could potentially be. 
I'm in the furthest possible thing from a STEM field so I don't really know for sure.

If the scaling issue with Bitcoin is a bullet wound, the 2x fork was a bandaid. Does it relieve a little bleeding in the meantime? Sure. Does it take out the bullet and actually heal the wound? Absolutely not.
The solution that can actually heal the wound is being worked on. Causing further turmoil in Bitcoin with a super low-level temporary fix (2x fork) was not the solution we needed.

No cryptocurrency, in this stage of the industry, is ever out of the woods. That being said, I think in the context of the BTC vs BCH debacle, it's fair to say that BTC has proven itself to be the superior asset.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:29:07
No problem. A lot of people tend to forget Bitcoin is a project still in it's infancy. Sure it feels like this big monolithic entity, but in the grand scheme of what Bitcoin will become these are still the early stages, and it's important to remember that the technology is still developing and evolving to solve all these problems we are currently facing. It's a process.

Canadian here too. QuadrigaCX should be your go-to exchange to purchase bitcoin. It's the most robust and stable exchange in the country. 
Just make sure you move those newly acquired coins to a diversified and secure suite of hard wallets and cold wallets to store them. Don't leave any considerable amount of bitcoin in a web wallet

Lol one of the "secrets" is bitcoin being decentralized.
That's literally the most important, most well known fact about bitcoin.
This is like if you asked a 5th grader to write an essay on bitcoin and the only source he can use is yahoo news.

Crazy how they always forget to mention that when trying to sell the idea of BCH.

I'm a leftist (Democratic Socialist would probably be the most accurate label) and I think cryptocurrency shows great potential as a form of money that can ensure a more economically stable future for everyone.

Lol Mississauga is a massive city and very diverse socioeconomically. It's like every other city. There are suburbs with multi million dollar homes and project housing complexes. Can't write off the entire city as being shady as hell.

Problems with BCash:
- The price and trends are HEAVILY manipulated by the highly centralized group of stakeholders that are gunning for it to succeed. They tried to pump and dump it to overthrow the real Bitcoin this past weekend, it didn't work. They're very shady people and just on principle people don't want to invest in an asset with that kind of mindset and dirty tactics behind it. They have bots everywhere on the crypto subs still trying to shill Bcash, and have been hacking reddit users to use their accounts to upvote Bcash posts and downvote Bitcoin posts. Why would you invest in a currency that needs this kind of behaviour to get attention?
- Literally nowhere accepts BCash as a form of payment. Who cares if it has lower fees and times if you literally can't use it for anything. That makes Bcash just another "store of value" and if it's going to be that, it's just doing what Bitcoin does right now except worse.
- BCash is a fork off of the real Bitcoin, and has proven to not be as popular or worthwhile as the original.
- If everyone moved to BCash they would end up having the same issues Bitcoin currently does. It's fast and cheap because the volume and movement is so low.
Also, do not assume that just because transaction fees and times are high now for the real Bitcoin that they will be high forever. Do not forget that the Bitcoin system is still being developed and optimized. Scaling is the  priority of Bitcoin developers right now. They're working on a solution that fixes this in the long term. Bitcoin has time and time again proven it's a worthy investment and a worthy technology. Every day the adoption of Bitcoin grows worldwide. It's not going anywhere any time soon.

I'm really liking IOTA. It's the third largest holding in my portfolio currently. Bought some ETH as well, because I trust it. 
A few others I'm looking at but have not purchased yet are NEO, Substratum, and Lisk.
I'm interested in taking up a medium to large cap privacy coin but don't know what I should start out with (currently no privacy coins in the portfolio). Any suggestions? How are people feeling about Monero right now?
