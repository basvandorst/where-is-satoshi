What you can get from the blockchain is some assurance that the ledger is _consistent_. Since it is not decentralized, there is no need for the expensive proof-of-work when they can simply implement proof-of-identity. Through a blockchain, no one player can go back and modify past transactions. This is relevant to inter-bank needs, and could even be extended to individual consumers. It does not fulfill the decentralized and trustless system parameters that Bitcoin does, but it is an improvement on current banking structures.

He said a lot of words. A few of them even made sense when strung together. Nothing he said was at all original and it all reeks of self-aggrandizing bullshit.

An unsigned message was posted by a likely-compromised account that may have never been the real Satoshi to begin with.

Neither. One of HT's users was subscribed to the [pen-test mailing list where Wright was demonstrating his (apparently common) arrogance.

Probably. He appears to have a thing for misappropriating others' work and ideas as his own.

I'm not sure how Overstock plans on doing it, but it's fairly simple in concept. Take an address and send it a single Bitcoin, marking the transaction in some way to specify that spends from this transaction represent shares. Now you've got up to 100,000,000 units that can be distributed. Anyone can check the history of subsequent transactions on the blockchain, forwards or backwards, to verify that the child output they control is a unit from that genesis transaction. Very valuable dust. [Colored Coins](

Nothing he said in that video was either smart or original.
