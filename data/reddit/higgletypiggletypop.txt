Upvoted. The ideas here remind me of Seti back in the day. It was fun to watch it go, that's why a lot of people ran it.

So it sounds like you think there is some optimal blocksize limit. Why is it 1 MB? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:16:57
Yeah but if the bot is trading with itself it would be the taker in half of its transactions. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:38:15
You didn't answer my question. I know you're against any "raise." But why should the limit be 1MB and not some other number? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:53:59
This is a painful, painful read. Kudos to you for trying to engage with this guy, but it's obviously a waste of time. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:56:06
So a prediction coming true is evidence of manipulation? 
@_date: 2016-03-02 01:24:49
Such as strange mix of optimism and pessimism among those against raising the block size limit. Optimism to think that the future we must at all costs prepare for is the one in which bitcoin handles billions of transactions. Pessimism to think that incrementally scaling the network in the meantime is so very dangerous. Frankly I think both the optimism and the pessimism are misguided.

Spam email doesn't pay fees. Also, the recipient doesn't want it. The transactions you are talking about 1) pay fees and 2) both parties want the transaction to occur.

A quarter is absolutely on the order of credit card fees, for relaitvely small transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-02 01:29:00




@_date: 2016-03-01 07:35:28


No they aren't. 


"At some point" -- at what point?
"may not be enough" -- what are the criteria here? How far do fees have to rise / how big does the backlog have to be?


Again--no actual criteria here, just "we'll do this when the benefits outweigh the risks" with no discussion of how that evaluation is to be made. 
I think there's a larger issue here which is that this document simply isn't detailed enough to function as a roadmap. It reads like a quick summary of a much longer document, but that document doesn't exist, as far as I know.  
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:25:38
Simulation is cool, but there no source for stats on actual confirmation times anywhere?

This is the second paragraph of that document:


that would be over 400 terabytes of data per year.
The assumption of the authors is that transaction capacity scales linearly with block size. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:06:19
How so?

It's funny because it's true.
@_date: 2016-03-13 14:09:36
It's fine to think that raising the block size is unwise but to think that support for doing so isn't real and widespread and is just a bunch of 'script kiddies' is to believe what you want to believe.
@_date: 2016-03-13 14:06:27
I guess we'll just have to see about that. Either they will go away ,or they won't, in the next few months. As for "dumb kids" being the main funders, that is wishful thinking on your part.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:21:40
Oh cut the crap. This whole chain is based on your saying that the assumption of smaller block sizes meaning fewer transactions is wrong. If you're going to say that what you meant (without ever saying it) is that smaller block sizes + Lightning could mean more transactions, well: obviously, and thanks for wasting everyone's time. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 01:08:15
I agree with this...insider trading is a real thing, they're trying to prevent it (along with other improprieties)--not sure I see what is wrong here, and also not really sure what this has to do with Bitcoin.

US debt is not growing relative to GDP which is all that matters. The U.S. has been in debt since 1835 and is not experiencing a debt crisis. There is nothing strictly wrong with public debt. Great Britain has been in debt for three centuries and they are doing fine.

To paraphrase: ask yourself a question to which the answer is yes or no.  But neither answer could possibly imply that the block size should be increased. Did I get that right?

He does? You won't even acknowledge that smaller block sizes mean fewer transactions.

If you can't parse that a vague statement to the effect that 'maybe we'll do this if various unspecified conditions are met' isn't  part of the plan in any meaningful way, then that's willful ignorance.

The poster you replied to is making a (dark) joke that refers to the policy of the mods of this subreddit, namely that 1. all discussion of altcoins is banned and 2. bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic are altcoins and thus not bitcoin. So the joke is that as soon as Hearn started developing XT, he was an altcoin not a bitcoin developer.

These are crowdfunded nodes that many who would run classic at home, if not for ddos attacks, have resorted to funding. It's unclear to me why they shouldn't be counted. Speaking for myself it was a lot easier to send some btc to classic-nodes than to go through the trouble of setting up my own aws node.

This argument, that on-chain scaling can't possibly accommodate *potential* needs in the distant future so therefore there's no reason to try to accommodate today's need, is just so plain STUPID. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:34:35




There's no need for this kind of pomposity. 
I think that the Finney quote is a true intellectual predecessor to the ideas you describe. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. I would argue that there is still quite a jump to get from "There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient" (Finney) to "Bitcoin does clearly not provide a currency system" (you).
The Satoshi quote, I am not sure I see the relevancy there. OP didn't ask for an instant transaction. Just a confirmed one. And I think you are reading a lot into it if you think it's anticipating Bitcoin acting purely as a settlement layer. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:02:46
Acting as a settlement layer is one of many possible and competing visions for bitcoin. And it is most definitely a re-imagining. When was the first time bitcoin and settlement layer were used in the same sentence? 
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:11:48
There's nothing petty or trivial about tracing the development of ideas over time, especially when there are claims that these ideas have always been there. In any case: thank you for the Finney quote; I responded to it in the comment chain with jensuth. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 02:14:03
Ah, I see that enjoyed [our discussion]( so much that he has presented the highlights, as he sees them. Let me make a few points:
About the Satoshi quote: yes, he said that 0-conf transactions are second-class citizens. Let's remember that these transactions are not some special set of transactions. Every transaction starts out as a 0-conf transaction. Every 0-conf transaction gets confirmed (unless it [doesn't]( Whether or not the transacting parties decide to proceed as if a 0-conf transaction is complete, which sometimes makes sense and sometimes doesn't, is their decision. 
The argument that every confirmed transaction has settled, so therefore Bitcoin is a settlement layer, so therefore it requires a currency layer to be built on top of it, and also therefore everyone has always known this, is nothing but a meaningless tautology based on defining the word "settled" to mean "confirmed transaction". 
The Finney quote: as I have said, I think the ideas expressed there are true intellectual predecessors to something like Lightning. But it's a long way from "a secondary level of payment systems" to a single, monolithic, required "currency layer", and further still to claims like ["Bitcoin does clearly not provide a currency system"]( which is news to anyone who has ever bought something with bitcoin.
Now, I want to make something clear. I, unlike others, make no claims to know the future. I also welcome and encourage the construction of, to use Finney's words, "a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient". Perhaps Lightning, once it exists, will become very important. But Lightning and other ideas like it should *compete in the marketplace of ideas fairly*. The coupling of the promotion of Lightning to an active attempt to cripple Bitcoin's natural scaling process by artificially limiting the block size has left a very bad taste in the mouths of many formerly neutral observers such as myself. If Lightning or whatever "currency layers" emerge in the future are truly outstanding, they will succeed on their own merits without needing  the playing field tilted for them.

@_date: 2016-02-24 23:55:56
Why shouldn't this be a block size debate? The transaction is stuck because the system is full. Yes, the transaction is also stuck because the fee wasn't high enough, but lets not obfuscate the ultimate cause.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:38:04
I'm asking you why you wouldn't increase the block size in the face of network congestion. Surely you must have a reason for wanting the limit to remain at 1 MB. And if the optimal size is immaterial (again--immaterial to what?) then why not increase it when it's crying out to be increased?
@_date: 2016-02-26 02:19:49
Yeah. If you google *site:bitcointalk.org "settlement layer" daterange:2451910-2457023*, which searches from 2001/01/01 to 2015/01/01, you will find no hits.

Artificially in the sense of not set by the market.
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:51:10


Yeah, OP. I mean, really. Who are you to try to innovate and be on the leading edge as a small business? Just put your head in the sand for some amount of time (let's say somewhere between two years and infinity) until Lightning is up and running. And please stop disturbing the tranquility of our beautiful settlement network with your damn transactions!!
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:07:40
This is just incoherent. "It could be potentially devastating". Well, the earth could be hit by an asteroid tomorrow. No one thinks reasonable blocksize increases would be "devastating" to the bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:20:11
But OP's point of 1/15 of all btc being tied up in unconfirmed transactions remains true does it not?

I think this is correct.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:13:44
That's not correct, it is showing "the Median time taken for transactions with a fee to be accepted into a block."
EDIT: at least, that is what it purports to show, are you saying it doesn't?
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:00:29
It's non-intuitive, but I think you are right (see  
Given that that's the case, I wonder what these stats are really measuring? Since the average waiting time shouldn't drop below 10 minutes ever. Is it just stochastic noise or is there some other artifact of measurement at work?
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:17:00
Median transaction time is indeed going up, if you zoom in on the end of the graph. It can't be any other way of course, because the mempool has only recently become this big.

@_date: 2016-02-25 01:32:54
I notice you didnt try to address the empirical evidence I provided. Do you have any to refute it?  To say over and over that the vision of a separate "currency layer" sitting on top of the "settlement layer" of bitcoin isn't a radical re-visioning of bitcoin, in the absence of any evidence that people were thinking this way until very recently, is to argue in bad faith. I'd hope that's not what you're doing, so I eagerly await anything you can dig up suggesting this isn't a new idea.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:57:23
i agree that 24TB woukd be too big. 1 KB would be too small, we can all agree. So there are some bounds. But do you have an analysis--of any sort--that suggests that 1MB is the optimal block size?
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:10:13
Since the dawn of bitcoin? Try googling 'site:bitcointalk.org "settlement layer" before:2015/01/01' and seeing what you get. You can argue all you want for why bitcoin should be a settlement layer. Maybe you're even right. But don't pretend it's not a new vision.
EDIT: I wasn't doing the google-fu right, but the point still stands. The correct search is 'site:bitcointalk.org "settlement layer" daterange:2451910-2457023' which searches from 2001/01/01 to 2015/01/01. There are no results.

To paraphrase is not to put words in your mouth so long as it's accurate. I believe I have been accurate here, which I will back up right now with quotations from your posts. 
**With regard to "single" and "monolithic":** You've used the phrase "*the* Currency app" (emphasis mine) 10 times in the last few days (I searched). If you're suggesting a whole ecosystem of "currency apps", then you should say so, but it sure sounds like you have *one* thing in mind. 
**With regard to "required"**, I'll divide that in to two senses. First, "required" in the sense of Bitcoin needing it to be successful:
* "[Bitcoin does clearly not provide a currency system]( 
* "[there must be a currency layer built on top of that settlement layer](
Second, required in the sense of users must use it: 
* "[Is your application currency? If so, neither you nor the rest of the world will use Bitcoin for that](

OK I agree that questions of block limit sizing and questions of how to deploy changes to bitcoin are different. But what do you mean by "this dispute"? The context of this discussion is a stuck transaction, and the suggestion that a 1MB block size limit has something to do with that. (Specifically, you questioned calling this limit either "artificial" or "arbitrary", leading me to wonder what you thought the reasoning behind it was, and if you thought it was at or near the optimal size.) The block size question is not at all immaterial to transactions getting stuck in the here and now, today. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:53:28
Many of us did not sign up for this radical reimagining of bitcoin as a settlement system.
