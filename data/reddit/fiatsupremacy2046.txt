Why did you call it Money, when you haven't proven that bitcoin has value?
I asked you exactly to prove that, and you turned the Conclusion into a Premise, and then back into the Conclusion.
It would be like me saying: "You ask me to prove why I am Pope. Well, mine being the Pontiff is one of the clear proofs."
That is how you said: "Why does Bitcoin have value? Easy! It's money, that's why."

I'm guessing it's the difference between bid and ask. Because prices look like this:
15.6 16.3
Left is bid and right is ask. So when you buy something, you're automatically down, until the bid overtakes your buying price.

OK So make the case for bitcoin without violating the above pillaration.

You: "Because how else would you describe a network with such huge value?"

I was proving that bitcoin is unlike gold. The proof that bitcoin is unlike USD is a separate one.
This fact that it takes Several elements to prove bitcoin worthless, is exploited by simplistic arguers, who then jump from one issue to the other, claiming that none were addressed when in fact both were addressed.

Smart austrian economist: "Bitcoin is actually quite unlike gold."
Simp who bought BTC: "But Bitcoin is precisely like USD, except better."

It would be nice to have anonymous money. Some benefits:
- Since all tax is theft, it would be sweet to seize control of one's own finances
- Suppose a case where some shithead takes control of Syria and starts massacring his own population with chem weapons. It would be sweet to raise funds to whack him.
But my understanding is that bitcoin is not even anonymous, so fools actually pay their tax lol.

If I had to simply put it, what was the Big Mistake by bitcoin enthusiasts, it's the following.
Since the dollar has neither intrinsic value ($1 bill seems similar to $100 bill), nor apparent redemption value (you can't take the $ bill to the government and receive a golden brick)
then people conclude it has no value whatsoever. But it flies in the face of reality, where people often get mass killed over dollars.
So, then Bitcoiners concluded: "It's just a big mass delusion. People believe USD has value, even as it doesn't. All we have to do is switch that habit to BTC."
Shocking truth: It is not true that the dollar is valueless. It possesses something that makes it valuable, and which Bitcoin doesn't possess.
I could present what that is, but for the sake of keeping the post simple, I will end here. The above is the crux of where Satoshi made his mistake, which now makes Bitcoin worth nothing.

Things that can happen to you if you use cryptos in commerce:
You buy a coin for $8,000 in order to spend it on a motorbike.
You come back home to find out your coin is now worth $16,000. The bike peddler bested you in the game of life.
You sell your motorbike for 1 bitcoin, because after all it's equivalent to $8,000 which sounds about right. 
You take a nap and your coin fell to $4,000.

I believe that scarcity, convenience, and things like that can Amplify but not Create value from scratch.
Something like the following formula:
$1000 x 3 = $3000
An item was worth $1000 already; but after scarcity came in, it increased the value to $3000.
$0 x 5 = $0
An item had no value; but then it was revealed that it is a limited edition. However it continued being worthless in spite scarcity.
