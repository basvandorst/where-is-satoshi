No idea if Max was being tongue in cheek, but considering how good the reddit community has been historically in discovering hidden bitcoin, I thought it was worth a shot :)

It's not Ethereum's purpose.
I've written the below on Quora, answering: "*What will be the future of bitcoin after the Ethereum project?*":
"Bright. Ethereum does not supplant Bitcoin, nor does it try to. It complements it. 
Bitcoin is your store of value, your gold vaults. When you want to put your capital to work you need an engine (Ethereum) and to run the engine you need oil (Ether). 
It's completely possible to imagine (in my view, inevitable) that we'll frequently see derivatives built on Ethereum backed by Bitcoin."

Yup, I participate in meetup Q&amp;As via skype all the time and they are great fun for everyone involved! We get to meet the community and the community gets to ask straight questions. Love them! If you want one on Ethereum I'm stephan.tual on skype, add me anytime.

There was no such comment ever made, check your sources. The initial information that was released indicated 6.45% going to 20+ early supporters and founders after 5 years, alongside an industry standard vesting schedule.  
As for the code, contracts are working now, and it's even possible to start building GUIs. Not a single dollar has changed hands and anyone can go and clone the repos. In fact, if you like the idea but don't like the team, you can do just that today.

Brilliant background info Andreas, many thanks.

Neither, it's a platform and a language for writing decentralized apps. Its link to bitcoin is that we took the concept of decentralized consensus at scale and applied it to other verticals, such as law, or smart property. There is an internal currency called 'Ether', it's there to prevent people writing contracts from running infinite loops or hogging the storage. We're on r/ethereum if you have questions! :)

Let me do the honours: Is Goldman Sachs involved in this venture?
Categorically, no.
From Charles Hoskinson:
"We have two people on our team who started their financial careers- as many thousands have done- at Goldman Sachs. They have both since left and started other ventures. In both cases those were hedge funds. Joe retired and moved to Jamaica to be in the music industry and came out of retirement to join us. Costa went to university of Edinburgh to study LCS's relationship to finance for a PhD in Quantitative Finance. He is now running a hedge fund in Kyrgyzstan as well as building a full clearing house in etherscript.
We have no relationship with Goldman Sachs nor are they an investor. I wouldn't take their money if offered. I have great respect for their knowledge of the financial industry as well as quality of talent, but no respect for their business practices or questionable conduct."

I'll let the people you mentioned by name answer on their own, but for clarity, I'd like to address your passing comment about a '29.4% premine'.
You seem to suggest that's 29.4% divided by 8 founders going to their pockets. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
This percentage is not finalized and will be used instead for 3, distinct projects:
1) A non-profit organization that will focus on a) building the infrastructure apps (distributed DNS, reputation systems, etc) b) research problems common to all crypto-tech such as blockchain bloat and speed of transacting, all in an transparent, open source manner, distributing the results of this research back to the community.
2) A for profit organization, which will be converted to a DAO as soon as possible, acting as an incubator to projects building GUIs, wallets and other commercial products running within the Ethereum ecosystem. 
3) Finally, a very small percentage of this percentage will be used to reward the dozens of people that have contributed to the project so far, and pay part their salaries going forward. 
All the three projects will be exclusively backed by a single Ether sale, and will have 6-10 year roadmap upfront. Furthermore, this capital will be vested, and diluted over the years by Ether generated by miners, leading to the 29.4% looking more like a single digit after 5 years. 
I hope this clarifies things a bit. Note that none of this has been finalized, and that we will issue a (very detailed) business plan that I'm sure you'll like. Please give us a bit more time to finalize what I think will be a template for openness and total transparency in crypto projects going forward. When it comes out, you'll be able to see very exactly how finances will be handled and for what purpose, and make a decision to purchase Ether or not. Until then, it's all speculation.

Open Transactions is natural and strategic partner of Ethereum, and we are already working together on some projects. Our two technologies are complementary.

OP here, looks like he deleted all replies to his tweet. It's not a criticism (I think Max is a brilliant commentator), but I feel the tongue in cheek aspect of his post probably prevails. There's likely no QR code posted on the video, except maybe for the piece of paper folded on the table. Oh well! Was a fun Sunday easter egg search regardless :D

Because the 'traditional' model of offering such a service is based on developing a web frontend talking to some order book backend.
As MTGox users are discovering the really, really hard way that means losing control of your funds and being at the mercy of hacks or the exchange bailing out. 
Until very recently there was no real option to build decentralized services in a straightforward way. Furthermore, running decentralized exchanges on-chain can work but is not going to support HFT due to latency. 
Things are changing quickly though, have a look at Open Transaction, which allows for federated pools of servers, smart contract etc + HFT.

*"Ethereum is likely to be too internally complex and won't be easy to adapt to future technological advances."*
Actually from a code perspective we have considerably reduced the number of opscode in the latest ES2 meaning that now things like NTRU or even SHA4 or SHA5 (when they arrive) will be easily implementable. Future proofing is one of our main targets :)

As an organisation, we could have been quicker on the FIAT conversion, for sure. We sold what we needed to pay for salaries etc, as we went along. Note that not all movement from the Exodus multisig corresponds to a sale however, and that when BTC was indeed sold, it was done though private buyers as to not dip the market.

It doesn't always correspond to spending, and when it was was liquidated, it was always done through private buyers as to not dip the market.

Ethereum is not a competitor to OT, they are two different projects addressing different issues, and could work in a complementary manner very well. In fact Ethereum have mentioned they might be pushing funds to help 3rd party projects - and that list included OT.

This was by far my favorite talk by Mike and actually the one that got me back into crypto just before joining Ethereum. 
It would be a shame if it was lost forever... hopefully we can dig out copy somewhere.

Thanks for the link - also, for reference, this hackathon is opened to *ALL* blockchain technologies, bitcoin included of course.
See you in London on the 7th of November!
