No no not sadistic at all, I think it's valuable for people to be able to understand a person's thought process when they were thinking that taking a loss is better than being patient. I think people can learn from that. Perhaps someone made the dumb decision to sell their car or something and put all the $$ in crypto thinking they could get a better car and turns out they lost $$. Those people exist and those stories need told so others don't make dumb decisions or put in more than they can afford.

How is an ICO different than like, say, a crowd funding campaign? People willingly give money to strangers depite the fact that [most times] they will never get anything in return. One exception would be kickstarter. But like on go fund me you can make up a good story and get free money from anybody. To me an ICO is really no different. Just my $0.02
Which reminds me, I'd like to take a minute to promote my new ICO. I'll call it GoFundMeCash [GFMC] starting at $0.02
Get in while it's still legal
