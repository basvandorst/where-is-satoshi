Look at these rich folks *owning* homes.  
  
1 Bitcoin would at least let me *be* a homeowner!

So far I see people only saying no. I say it’s up to you by using your judgment on how important that money is to you.  
  
Let’s say 1 out of 5 people that use Bitcoin to purchase coffee from you decide to be a dick and make an attempt to cheat you out of the money they paid.   
  
Is that 3 or 4 dollars a big hit to your business? Is losing 3 or 4 dollars worth not accepting Bitcoin from *any* customers? Does accepting crypto at your business drive in new customers?   
  
You need to decide what the potential risk is worth. Take a set period of time and figure out your loss rate (if any) by checking for transactions that never confirmed (say over the last month).  
  
If you got “scammed” out of $10 over a month of business, is that acceptable to you? Did your increase in customers make up for that?

You're thinking of "brotha"

This has been one of my biggest wonders recently,  
  
Let’s say I have 100 Bitcoins and I’m good at writing code.  
  
I write some script that posts a sell order on multiple exchanges for 1 Bitcoin @ $6700   
Once the sell is confirmed my script posts another sell order for 1 Bitcoin @ $6705  
So on and so forth...  
  
In the end, theoretically, I have manipulated the price of Bitcoin (let’s say up to $6850)  
  
Of course this would need to be a large scale endeavor, but maybe I’m missing something that makes this impossible or very very unlikely.

Gemini  
  
Once you initiate a deposit the funds are automatically available to purchase Bitcoin (or Ether). The Bitcoin you buy cannot be moved out of your account until your deposit clears fully (5-7 days-ish)  
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:30:33
No! Fuck rules!  
  
Look at me. I’m the bank now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:25:27
I have an account on both exchanges.  
  
Given your scenario, yes, I could take the $500 as fiat profit.  
  
Taking it one step farther: I could instead purchase Ether with the profits, send it back to Gemini, (price isn’t going to change *that* much while awaiting confirmation) exchange for USD, purchase more Bitcoin and repeat until profit is negligible.
  
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:27:23
Thanks! I’m glad so many people here knew what this is called. I have some research to do now!
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:34:05
See the problem with a small amount is the profit margin is small enough to be gone quickly if the price swings to much while the confirmations happen.  
  
If I tried this with $1000 I *might* make $50-$100 but the risk of a price swing to negate that is too high.

Bank account deposits are available to trade for Bitcoin immediately, you just can’t withdraw until the deposit clears.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:38:03
Dude. Holy cow. This makes so much more sense than dealing with transfers. Wow. I knew I was missing something!  
  
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:22:02
Yes, the Bitcoin you buy at that moment in time remains the same amount of Bitcoin when your deposit clears.  
  
If you buy $500 worth when you initiate the deposit. It's likely that by the time you are able to withdraw it will be worth more (depending on the market, of course)
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:59:26
Right? It's like muscle memory.

I asked my boss a while back if there was any way for me to get paid weekly. haha.
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:41:54
I totally would if I wasn’t married and had two young kids! I don’t even know where my time goes!
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:55:07
I agree. I'm not sure what I would have done If I didn't have Bitcoin to sell. It just really sucks as that is not why I was into Bitcoin, to have it gone in an instant. I wanted to have a good amount for the future, when it really is widely accepted.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:50:32
Or a bitcoin address
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:56:52
While I agree, my situation involved a car accident and GAP coverage that didn't cover the gap.
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:05:58
Not sure. My bank is 25 minutes away and in the opposite direction of where I work. So it was basically out of the question in the near future.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:03:31
Wait. Shouldn’t I keep my private key, uh, private?
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:34:26
Nice! I’ll check it out! 
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:17:43
Can you recommend a good exchange for that? Uh, asking for a friend.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:57:08
Thanks. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:32:35
Thanks! I know I really just have to suck it up and start again. Just bummed out, really.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:59:27
Not sure what happened. I’m pretty sure it was yellow when I uploaded the final image. It took quite a few revisions to get it right so maybe I messed up and just didn’t even notice before purchasing.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:09:09
Ok that’s mostly what I figured. I read earlier though that it could just keep getting pushed out because of the increase in transactions with appropriate fees
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:01:12
Lol. “It’s not even complicated. I bet the tellers could do it.”
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:16:10
Can you post or pm your Bitcoin address, please?
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:18:49
Thanks to u/Dwaas_Bjaas for the design template!
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:22:03
Check out Gemini. Your funds are available for trade immediately, you just can’t withdraw until your deposit clears.  
-transfer $ from bank account  
-buy Bitcoin immediately (at desired price)
-wait for deposit to clear  
-transfer Bitcoin to your wallet
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:01:07
Yea definitely. But freezing the account when the funds were there to back up the failed amount? And taking that long to respond and resolve?
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:03:17
Mostly just a cool idea I wanted to see brought to physical form.  
  
But, I could give them to people looking to pay me in Bitcoin. Sure they could scan the QR code in my wallet app but if I’m not there, this allows them to scan and send 24/7
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:56:49
I’m just about 100% sure breadwallet does not support it, unfortunately.

I’m not sure exactly how long it’s been there but I started using it back in May.

Nobody likes slide decks, but this is pretty interesting to see the point of view from a major financial institution.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:28:28
I think they meant to reply to the weekend dip comment.
