I'm not sure myself, but a [quick search]( suggests that DVDs are a good option to store data on and that some brands are specifically designed for archival storage (ie to resist physical degradation).
Best to store them away in a reasonably cool dry place away from sources of heat and light. Some people recommend storing them in a fireproof safe and even away form oxygen.
[Wikipedia suggests]( dvds made with gold films in place of aluminium last longer.
 You can find long term dvds by googling "gold layer dvd" or "archival dvd" there is even a new type made of a fancy material they [claimed to last 1000 years](
[Gold Archival dvds]( last 100 years. [M-DISC]( will last 1000 years. (The Chinese [tested the M-DISC]( and said it was amazeballs).

using pre-order money for 12mo of extensive R&amp;D isn't a good idea. They should have gone with venture capital. Which they probably couldn't because they didn't have a good business model.
The expensive part is designing the chips, once they've designed them they should be able to get them processed in China quite quickly (unless they use molecular beam epitaxy instead of photolithography, which would be expensive and slow). I would be interested to see how they justify shipping just a handful a week 12 months after orders were placed and 9 months after the first chips started shipping.

This is a lot of bitcoin and could be very useful for promotional purposes. I definitely think that if the SC tournament was a success then there is a huge scope for sponsoring other tournaments (TF2, Dota2, L4D2, NS2 etc) with prize amounts from 0.1BTC upwards depending on the number of participants.
It will generate interest from a group of young, smart and tech savvy individuals - exactly the target demographic for bitcoin. Furthermore it will set a great precedent for the actions and strength of the community.
I would love to help out. At the very least I could start a tournament (if you were willing to discuss the conditions under which it took place). You could simply transfer the prize to the winning team, so I wouldn't even have to hold any funds. At the very most I could offer my assistance with anything that you are struggling to find the time to take care of. 
This is a great opportunity to generate some positive PR. My partner is in advertising and was an admin for one of the biggest TF2 leagues. The r/tf2 community is 100,000 strong, this could definitely make some waves over there.
These bitcoins, along with future donations, have a huge potential.

This isn't people standing up to apple, it's a bunch of rich kids smashing up expensive hardware that most people could never have afforded to buy new. It's pathetic and embarrassing.

They've been socialist(ish) for many years, shouldn't be that surprising that they have high tax rates.

LTC hash rate took a dive though 
mining btc with a botnet doesn't make much sense now that there are so many ASIC farms on the network

How much are they charging for them? I'm using the 25GH model, I get less than 0.001 BTC per block the pool mines. With about 5-6 blocks per day. This is down from just over 0.0015 per block at the end of November.
I placed my order in April, this thing was basically obsolete on arrival. If I'm lucky I might break even before it's starts costing more electricity than the value of the coins it mines.

I assume you're implying that Microsoft have done something terrible by removing malware from millions of machines. Whereas Google are righteous and infallible despite the vast amount of data mining and general fuck shittery that they do on a day to day basis.

Not really, you still have to pay capital gains tax and you have to pay 20% VAT on purchases of good and services.

Encrypt the wallet, save under a different filename, store it in an encrypted zip, upload to a private folder, and don't share the link. It would be quite hard to find.
It's good to be reminded that these things are searchable, but it doesn't mean that they can't be used. You basically trade some security benefits to make a more robust and convenient backup. 
imo if you have a large number of btc you should consider splitting it over a large number of wallets in cold storage on a robust storage medium.

Like [banks]( don't facilitate [money laundering]( either...

have you got any links to people posting about them online?

That's clearly not true, in April I was able to make a deposit with no verification necessary of both fiat and BTC.
I understand for legal reasons why it might be necessary for them to require customer's to provide identification when transacting fiat. I'm just quite surprised that they won't let me move BTC around without the same level of scrutiny.

Wth, that's like $1.30, why are some people so cheap?

I'm not sure that buying coffee was ever really the _point_ of bitcoin though.

I think this was for Commerzbank,

Cool, thanks. Just realised that it was running the old protocol to prevent a fork and it will switch to the new protocol when the timer runs out :)

Thanks for the reply, I also ordered in April. Haven't heard a peep from them since.
@_date: 2013-07-23 10:03:05
tbh I'd rather they just gave me some bitcoins! Anyone got refunds from these guys? I'm not super keen on giving them all of my personal information.
@_date: 2013-09-11 09:59:35
Has anyone _actually_ received an ASIC miner from BFL? Do they meet the specifications they advertised? What was the lead time?
Trying to decide if I want to do a paypal dispute or leave the order.
@_date: 2013-07-23 13:44:11
Good to hear, thanks for the the reply!

It's a big drop when trading any other commodity... bitcoin is just ridiculously volatile
@_date: 2013-07-23 13:45:12
I sent money to them the day before they were shut down (just my luck eh?) so unfortunately I don't know about anyone's profits from trading.
