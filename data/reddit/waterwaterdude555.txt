If you 'hodling' your coin on an exchange you are doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:33:21
no, it's still alive and well, btc transactions are still processing, stop worrying about the ticker price
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:10:27
Which retailer is this
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:04:58
So you've only hodled for a year or so? Sorry, but that's not long term.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:32:37
Yawwwn, in the world of hodling, I look at this as price stabilization. It's happened before, can last a few months/years.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:05:46
well, i'm ending my relationship with you stripe

segwit2x is a scam
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:14:26
yaaawwn......veterans hodler have seen this before. As soon as the bitcoin price starts falling, the alts will get a pump.

Buy an amount you won't lose sleep over
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:19:48
You did buy the dip, at least very close to it, good job
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:26:54
This is normal for BTC to do this. It will continue to do this for month/years and drag the alts along with it. It has done this before in 2014.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:29:27
You've already convinced yourself and you know all the counter arguments. What's the point of this thread
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:18:45
Sorry this happened to you, I remember when btc hit 1000$ in the mtgox days, many people got in around 700$-1000$, very similar to your situation.
The advice at the time was just to hold. If those people had held they would have made their money back by now, but again, for many, seeing their investment go from 1000 -&gt; 300 was too hard to stomach and people cashed out.
Just sit on your coins and try to forget about them for the next two-three years.

Shapeshift.io has worked out well for me in the recent past

People said the same thing in 2013. 
Sure past performance doesn't guarantee future performance but I'll take my chances as BTC has been fairly predictable in behaviour the last few years
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:38:33
I don't think telling people to shut up and hodl is going to help them, although it's probably the best advice.
Somehow I feel a strange obligation to reassure those who are not experienced in crypto who are getting burned right now

There was a guy who bought a trezor from ebay that had a fake reprinted secret key unscratched. He lost all his funds.

That's a question you should be asking coinbase.
That said. If you do your research on Bitcoin's  history is that Storing coins on an Exchange is a recipe for disaster. You don't control the fate of your coins other will make decisions for you or they will be stolen
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:04:50
I dont see anything bad about it. It is a coin in its own right. Trust takes time, and this coin is still very new to the market, mind you I'm also HODL'ing my bcash. I just think the rush to cash out bitcoins to bcash is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:22:24
It helps other nodes sync up with the blockchain, given your bitcoin port is open and accessible by the internet
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:48:56
Keep it on hardware/paper wallet until you are ready to spend it. Keeping your coins on an internet connected device has historically been proven to be a dumb idea

move your BTC to a bitcoin paper wallet and out of the exchange so that you have full ownership of your coins, and then _YOU_ can chose if you want your bitcoin to be moved to a fork or not
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:44:12
is there a roadmap for a release on main net?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:49:28
Indeed, it has endured the test of time. If you want chump change, go for an alt coin, DASH being my favourite for its instant send and mixing features... there are many good ones, but bitcoin as it is, is a store of wealth.
Bitcoin is currently being shorted on the futures exchange, that in my opinion is a testament to the power and influence of bitcoin. Were you all so gullible to think that the futures market won't be attempting to manipulate bitcoin's price to follow their prediction? This is short term, dont be swayed so easily.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:54:36
If you had a paper wallet when you startedyou would have owned all the forks today.
Holding coins in an exchange is a dumb move. Which is how you missed out in the first place.

So sorry this happened to you :-/ your coins got stolen.
Unfortunately this is going to keep on happening to many people who store their coins online.
I wish there would be a sticky post telling people not to use online wallets/exchanges to keep their coins. This just keeps happening over and over again to people who are new to btc
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:32:08
I believe the term for that kind of effort would be 'private key mining'.

It would be  nice if they backed up their claim with an insurance policy of sorts that would replace any stolen coins, tho proving they were stolen would be another feat of its own

So Bitmain got kicked out of china, they are now dispersed and Samsung has gotten in the business of ASICs.
Bitmain continues to resell old miners, I dont see them lasting in the long run.

Lacks genuinity, I have the feeling the people singing these songs are paid to do so, and are probably not even writting their own lyrics
"The band was conceived and launched by talent management company Cinderella Academy (Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo). The Virtual Currency Girls are made up of eight female band members, aged between 15 and 22."
Without naming names, there are some pretty amazing crypto musicians out there. But this pop group is lacking that magic and dont deserve too much attention

Dude, it's not all black and white, personally i sold all my bcash but just because he accepts and shows bcash statistics doesnt detract away that _his_ mempool gives a good general idea of the mempool statistics.

Never cashed out any BTC.
I'm already at my moon. As an appreciating asset, it's really hard to justify cashing out my bitcoin as i am already quite fortunate.
