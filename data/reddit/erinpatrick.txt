Well the average Greek citizen is way more financially savvy than I'm aware of. I would have no idea how to do that. I'm not doubting it's simple to cost average I just wouldn't grasp the concept quickly.

If they divorce Bitcoin from the blockchain don't they just have a centralized blockchain? Could the central banks create their own blockchain that incentivize miners to mine on gov-chain? Just curious since they're always demonizing Bitcoin. Like nothing bad has ever happened on the Internet protocol.

So I'm running the Bitcoin qt on a Lenovo thinkpad with Ubuntu installed. I've never changed any of my internet settings.  Routinely have 20 + connections. Usually 15 or so in and 10+ out. Should I keep it running? I assumed it was helping.

BITCOINS CREATED BY NSA GOOD GUYS
 
And we're in trouble. The U.S. government is bankrupt.
 
As I said in my show that I did in San Mateo, California, the New Living Expo, the NSA good guys [made Bitcoin.]
 
There are good guys in every intelligence agency.
 
[The NSA good guys] did make Bitcoin to have a backup so that if the Federal Reserve tries to crash the dollar, we can reboot our currency off of Bitcoins.
 
And Bitcoins cannot be tampered with. They cannot be hacked.
 
Goldman recently bought a bunch of Bitcoins. They see the writing on the wall.
 
JC: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I found that really interesting.
 
Let's back up. I have a couple of questions. Now we're about out of time, so I've got to get these in.

Sorry I think is because they used the same picture. I should've read the article but is correct, it is new news. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:11:17
So trezor coins can just stay put regardless of the outcome?
@_date: 2015-06-19 09:40:33
That is true but we all know that could change at anytime. Especially if a bunch of Greek euros are pumped in. Then add to it other exuberance from around the globe and we would be on a ride.

It's always surprising how little people know about Bitcoin if anything at all. Not to mentioned the little they do know is misinformation.

I think what he was implying was that bitcoin and crypto's would be THE payment system in the future and that Visa would only still be around in 25 years if they got on board. In other words within 25 years visa will go the way of kodak if they don't implement bitcoin.

Sorry but wouldn't it be roughly the same mining power? He didn't seem like he was taking it too seriously. I guess that's what I found confusing. If you were going to expend that much energy in mining from desktop wouldn't it just be cheaper to buy a few? I honestly know next to nothing about mining.

Bitcoin has the potential to improve monetary exchange peer to peer across the globe without a central authority. Yes the value fluctuates keeping in mind its liquidity pool is tiny, and its still in its infancy. I've gotta agree with op, price means nothing to those going long. If a person who bought at 1000 now wants out because they lost half their investment, then they put more than they could afford into it, and their weak hands will be shaken out. That's good for bitcoin. Here's a news flash bitcoins volatile right now enter at your own risk! Speculating is fine if you understand the risk. We might see sub $200 in 2014, and we could see $5000. The question is where will we be in 5-10 years? Hodling is fine in my opinion. Everyone should hodl a little until the infrastructure, security, and clear regulation is established.

Thanks to trezor I've moved all my btc from Coinbase and blockchain info. We'll still using a bitcoin info hot wallet. Did anyone else recently recieve a multi page notice from coinbase? Basically saying what op suggested. That all your transactions are being closely scrutinized and don't do anything bad or they can close your account at anytime? Without notice. At the bottom you had to agree to the new terms. I've been a coinbase user since early 2013 so not sure why I'm just getting this now. Something to do with new regulation? 
@_date: 2014-12-28 13:47:57
Ok I did that and it was already checked off. Uncheck it?

PayPal does compare yes. Arguably fees are less using bitcoin currently. Not saying they won't rise in the future. I don't think a debit card compares however. If I have a debit card and I want to send money instantly to someone else say in another country, how would I go about doing that, and how is it easier, quicker, and less expensive then a bitcoin mobile to mobile transaction? I honestly have no idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:30:31

A lot of people were saying that if it could hold the 430 floor it might be set for another run up. There has been a lot of fud especially out of china and generally bad pieces from an uneducated media. People are starting to catch on, fear is starting to subside and the infrastructure is growing including better security. Also, although people despise him here, GB came out with a bold statement the other day after rubbing shoulders with andreessen horowitz that he'd invest in bitcoin, and had a halfway decent conversation about it with his team. Like it or not he has a large viewing audience. Rodger ver made a bold prediction that amazon would start accepting bitcoin by the end of 2014, and also all MIT students are set to receive $100 worth of bitcoin in the near future. Awareness is growing, and IMHO its just a matter of time. We hit $1200 in a matter of days.. What's preventing that from happening all over again? Just speculation :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:50:29
If I really care? What makes you think I don't? 
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:48:15
Yeah day trading is risky and not for newbies. For those considering dipping their feet in the Bitcoin pond I'd say buy a little and play with it. Put some in changetip account and practice tipping. Try different wallet apps and setting up proper security. Learn how to set up a cold storage like making a paper wallet. Although I like ipadchainz swagger and delivery, not sure it's wise to promote that in any way. It's a good way for a new user to get burnt regardless of how many YouTube videos they watch on the subject.

Arguably for mainstream adoption Bitcoin will need businesses like circle and coinbase to have solid reputations with security. In other words people will feel safe leaving funds there. The average joe has a difficult enough time purchasing the Bitcoin let alone moving into different wallets, enabling 2fa, utilizing cold storage etc. this will improve over time.

This story came out yesterday. He's not flip flopping actually. He's saying those holding new found wealth in bitcoin are also gold bugs and they should diversify into Pm's. he's using bitpay so his revenue will be converted into dollars which he needs for operating a business in the us. IMHO he should just come out and say he sees value in bitcoin. How hard would this be? He's only using bitcoin to boost his on companies revenue. It's a little sad. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:24:24
Yeah! Try it out!
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:37:52
I appreciate your response. I just don't think it will damage his rep to at least put bitcoin in the same category as gold. He doesn't need to say its superior or even equal. Just a little endorsement would be nice since he's now "accepting" it.

How much does a legit mining rig cost these days? 10-20k? Plus energy cost. We can prob agree bitcoin will hit at least 10k in the next few years so at 6 hundy a pop why not just grab a few and wait?

Sort of. He said Apple pay might have a more immediate impact. Bitcoin would have a more long term impact. In the Coinbase ama fred and Brian put it a good way. Bitcoin isn't competing with Apple pay. It's competing more with visa MasterCard, WU etc. Apple pay and other like services are built on top of current payment rails, and Bitcoin is reinventing the rails.

Sometimes I wonder if this had been done to the big banks after the threat of failure and before the subsequent bailouts, we would be further along the path of recovery. There is an argument to be made that the banks should've been allowed to fail.

The hits just keep on coming. If anyone's actually tried using wu's service they'll tell you first hand it's cumbersome. Depending on where you live just getting there can be difficult. Many times the WU computers are down or there simply isn't someone available right away to help. Pretty frustrating to drive from store to store trying to find a kiosk that is manned and functional. Not too mention the hours of operation are right off the bat limiting. This is of course the same challenge at both ends of the transaction. The long form, waiting in line, identity check, and fees are just added onto the already complex process. I do have to say it's better than a postal money order. Try getting one of those cashed these days. I'm still holding one for 3 weeks. The post office never has the funds to cash it. It's under a thousand dollars. It's funny how doing these things now always reminds me there is something so much more efficient. Soon gentlemen. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:23:41
Everyday should be a celebration. Why a stressful winter? Knowing you could lose everything should eliminate worry. If you're stressed it means youre in it for the wrong reasons or invested more than you can afford to lose. Dont do that. Bitcoin is a game changer and here to stay.

Yes that's how the game is played!! In the end its an experiment. When the price approached 700 the headlines here were all joyous and celebratory then, the fear comes in... Ghash, Silk Road coins and people panic.. Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when they are fearful. In short, some people sold at 670, and bought back in at 550. Invest what you can afford to lose and just hold. Ignore the price. Bitcoin will take care of itself.

I'd say if your looking to put some fiat currency into a speculative investment like bitcoin do so knowing it could become worthless. With that being said, and this is of course speculation, encrypted digital money is most likely here to stay barring some end of the world catastrophe;) wink wink
Beware is a bit strong. Enter knowing you could lose what you put in so invest accordingly. IF.... In the race for cryptocurrency supremacy, bitcoin comes out the leader(which seems highly probable), then the short supply makes each one quite valuable. Only 21 million citizens of the world could hold 1 bitcoin. Hmmm 7 billion people, 21 million bitcoins.... Or consider the eccomerce market, and remittance market for starters. Almost 2 trillion between those two markets. If bitcoin captures even half of that in 5 years do the math. Again I'm only speculating, but ill take the gamble. .5 btc will run you about a car payment. Beware? Nah, think long term investment 5-10 years.

I'm not a market expert by any stretch of the imagination, just an obsessed watcher over the past year. If the price drops more than let's say 200usd that's typically caused by a media story like Silk Road, china, etc. we've only really had a few of these "crashes" since I've been paying attention. Otherwise we had a 10 fold increase in a few months. I typically watch the bitstamp price, so in retrospect we watched it sit in the 700's for a few weeks after the china crash, then a nice move up to high 900's. The 100 usd swings are pretty normal in either direction IMHO. Sitting back at about the 900 mark now and could see 1000 by the end of the day. Or we could see 800 haha. Enjoy the ride. I made the mistake of selling some during the Silk Road crash. My first experience with panic selling. Haven't made that since. I even sat through the china story. Invest only what you can afford to lose and if you believe in bitcoin the technology, protocol, invention, game changer, then it's money well invested regardless of price.

I think this whole gox thing brings about great talking points on monetary security. Even with a blockchain 2fa enabled wallet you're not 100% safe, but its much safer than storing them on an exchange. This is sort of a basic rule of holding bitcoin. Cold storage is the only true way of keeping bitcoin safe, never keep your bitcoin holdings on an exchange, and always use 2fa with very strong password. One of the things that attracted me to bitcoin was the idea of being your own bank. By managing your own bank you need to learn at least the basic security measures. With that being said those that lost money with gox some veteran bitcoiners should've known better. The era of bailouts is over. Sure your visa and mc come with some fraud protection, but at what cost? The banks that control our money are fradulent and criminal yet we continue to support them. Are they solvent? How much longer will they be kept afloat? Some things to think about.

Dem brows are serious. Great interview. He gets a lot of comments here regarding his appearance and speaking ability which in all fairness is warranted. I personally think he comes across as pretty confident and relaxed. I prob would too though if I had his success. Pretty funny around the 10 min mark when talking about people that invent new technologies that threaten current systems. He pauses awkwardly.

Once you've made the decision that price doesn't matter it gets a lot more fun. The lows are good buying opportunity, and the highs are well.. Just icing on the cake. I purchased another tablet today on newegg and immediately bought back via coinbase. They say bitcoin is either going to be gigantic or nothing at all. Pretty exciting to consider the upside. But yeah, enjoy it :)

Glad someone brought this up. My only concern is that people don't care about whether or not it's a debt based system.  If it's a technology backed by a bank or central authority the avg joe or Jill will want to use it. In other words they will trust it without question. They may see ripple as a "safer" protocol because it has the banks stamp of approval.

@_date: 2014-03-02 18:19:44
I think the percentage of people using it for an anonymous payment system makes up a tiny fraction of bitcoin users. I would say those who invest/speculate, and those that love the protocol and see a world of opportunity.

Thanks for your reply but I think you misunderstood a bit. My post wasn't to lament about losing a few dollars. My post was really in defense of holders,  especially those who bought high. The money was lost by spending the bitcoin at a lower exchange rate then what they were purchased at. I'm over it :) if I'd held and used fiat then waited for the price to go up( as I stated I believe it will) then I increased my buying power. I agree 100% with the notion of replenishing bitcoin as soon as I spend them. I was really just trying to start a conversation vs complaining I lost money.  Thanks again for your response.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:04:59
Pretty much my favorite Bitcoin advocate/youtuber right now. Something about dat delivery.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:32:59
I think it's possible to do both. I just bought a TV and new laptop off tiger direct. before that I sent bitcoin to my brother, and bought a toy for nephew for Christmas on overstock. on the other hand I purchased a trezor and am now moving some of my balance into long term storage. I think it's good to save some and utilize some. fwiw
edit: but I agree with you. we're all speculating in one way or another.

@_date: 2014-01-19 14:57:48
Right but with more money flowing into bitcoin the price rises and also becomes more stable. So wouldnt that make it a better store of value? Also in 5 years won't the learning curve be lessened. Like all other emerging technologies from the past. Cell, Internet, twitter etc. The question is whether or not bitcoin reaches main stream adoption critical mass etc which we don't have the answer. If it does it will stabilize in price at x amt of dollars and would arguably make a secure store of value. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:40:03

Right volatility happens in the early stages as it grows. Someone farts and the price moves. Good news is gox is done and we learned a lesson. Take care of your bitcoin. Fiscal responsibility Dave. Literally you are your own bank. Flipping a switch means on or off, and that can't happen with bitcoin unless you switch off the Internet

This will get down voted, but this is bullish talk. Regardless of how you feel about regulation your're sort of like that dudes grandmother. Doesn't matter what she thinks. As one of the panelists mentioned, it's the younger generation that will adopt this technology quickest, and for a period of time the old payment rails and the mobile to mobile rail will mesh together until eventually its all on the m2m rails. This as they put it would provide better security, and that's what people are familiar with. That's what they expect. "We"the current minority here understand Bitcoin is more secure than traditional banking, but the masses dont, and critical mass depends on that shift of thinking. These guys openly admit they are "playing catchup", but the sentiment here is very much pro cryptocurrency. Yeah, they made some dumb comments like when that lady used trust and credit in the same sentence. The fact is, they are looking to adopt this technology they just think the average Joe is going to expect security and they're prob right on that point. Whether it's Bitcoin or not doesn't matter but for now Bitcoin is the strongest blockchain, and blockchain technology is the future of money.

Yeah being a former tinfoil hat club member it's funny to see the "can't eat bitcoin" type comments. I happen to own Pm's (including lead),seeds, land, food storage etc. So i understand the importance of being prepared and self reliant. Its a good thing and something this country is missing most certainly. You can only live in fear so long however, and its a balance.  Here's a conspiracy theory.. What if the fear agenda was being pushed? You know fear sorta paralyzed people and keeps them unable to actually see clearly and do something good. Listen to rand.. The answer is all of the above. Go out and buy some gold, silver and bitcoins.

I'm a speculator. I believe the protocol is a game changer in the world of finance. The fact that so much money is being pumped into the infrastructure should signal something. Currently the price per bitcoin is hovering around $450 per coin. That's mind blowing to me. It's a price the avg person can easily invest without too much risk. I may invest in something within the space down the road but being someone with limited tech savvy buying btc is just the easiest way to be in the game.

The use of fossil fuels over the past century has taken a massive toll on humanity in the form of wars, pollution and environmental destruction yet we still drive cars around and heat our homes with it. If we refused to use it things would change but we don't. Giving my car to someone else to pollute with doesn't make a lot of sense. If you're going to boycott something why would you give it to someone else to use? I wouldn't consider an iPhone a good resource sorry. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 01:06:11
If folks are gambling with bitcoin they deserve to lose there money. I'm a holder so I don't care what the media says. I don't panic sell, I believe.  Bobby lee obviously wants bitcoin to succeed so he's ok in my book. Invest at your own risk, and if you gamble and lose dont whine about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:52:16

yup a lot of avg joes will miss the train and one day will kick themselves for not seeing it meanwhile using it on a daily basis. Like the Internet. I like many others wish I had invested in Apple or Google, or (fill in the blank). It's still something I use every day. Not because I'm making money off it but because it's useful. Bitcoin is like that. I was driving on the highway the other day and realized I left my ez pass and didn't have cash on me. I immediatey though how cool would it be if I could somehow have money sent to me instantly through my mobile phone and scan that as I went through the toll. Regardless if it's Bitcoin this is the type of utility cryptocurrency provides. This among many other things we can't comprehend. Yet.

So the question is at what liquidity point will bitcoin become stable? I would assume we would see volatility up to say 50k? Once bitcoin breaches 100k(2-3 years) we should see much less Volatility. There will be no reason to covert to fiat currency. So more towards the space side.

Agreed. Ended up listening to the whole thing. Actually thought that after posting. Worth the listen. Wi vii are good but Barry and Fred(not sure his name)were exceptional.

Cool idea good luck! I've got a 1930's radio king btw

I was gonna say that was a bit steep haha. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:37:33
I'm actually impressed the bottom didnt drop out completely. Their wording was pretty awful. Market pretty much back to where it was before the announcement so I take that as a very good sign for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:36:41
Actually I said he should publicly support it. Big difference but nice try. The good people of this sub won't let shills like you ruin it.

Like being interviewed by this guy. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:05:57
Thanks and well said. I mainly brought this topic up because it's a topic of debate in the community. I agree, you need to do both depending on the circumstances. Holders shouldn't really be criticized however. We need to keep in mind those newbies that jumped in at the $1000 range and are still holding. I would not recommend they transact. I have no doubt we will break $1000 before the end of this year but I'm just a speculator:)
Edit: transact with those bitcoins. They could always buy now and transact/replenish. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 05:29:01
Nice use of the word retard. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:37:39
Totally spot on. Great post thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:18:04
Yes in the grand scheme of things china or any one nation can "ban" bitcoin but that won't stop it from existing elsewhere. I think the ban articles are becoming a joke here and the price reflects nobody is taking them seriously.

@_date: 2014-08-14 17:02:55
Exactly. You won't get rich overnight with bitcoin. It should be considered a long term investment. 5-10 years. People with weak hands that panic sell are doing so because they got in for the wrong reasons. They either invested more than they could afford or don't understand or appreciate the protocol. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:12:26

It's like the MySpace to Facebook comparison right? There was no monetary incentive for people to use myspace so switching meant nothing. Is this what you're saying?

Great discussion 500 bits @_date: 2014-01-07 14:09:45
1. Bitcoin is a technologically sound project.
2. Bitcoin is unstoppable without end-user prosecution.
3. Bitcoin is the most dangerous open-source project ever created.
4. Bitcoin may be the most dangerous technological project since the internet itself.
5. Bitcoin is a political statement by technotarians (technological libertarians).*
6. Bitcoins will change the world unless governments ban them with harsh penalties.
Not just libertarians, penalties would need to be very harsh even then bitcoin would work around it, and the Internet was a dangerous project?

Wrong for now. At 1k you'd be right. Bitcoin has a way of changing the picture completely in a short of time. But you're right, never invest what you can't afford to lose. We're gambling.

Decent interview. It seems he's done some homework in comparison to earlier interviews and really does get the technology behind bitcoin. Here's my question. If not bitcoin then what? Would he advocate for a return to gold backed paper? If so would that paper be the US dollar? I'd be interested to hear his response. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:35:23
Agreed should own a few diff cryptos. Consensus seems to be among experts that bitcoin will control a majority of the market, but a few others will get a small chunk of the pie. It's a big pie.

@_date: 2014-02-04 14:41:17
Right but then you have to ask yourself what is money?  The dollar? pesos? Gold? Eggs? Doesn't currency come down to what we want to exchange with each other and what we consider valuable? Right now people are willing to trade dollars(or 1's and 0's in bank) for bitcoins, a revolutionary computer protocol. Most agree we need a revolution in monetary structure/policy throughout the world, and some think bitcoin can be a major part of that. So maybe the fact they aren't considering it to be money is a good thing.

Just bought 2 asus transformer pads from NewEgg. After the purchase I replenished my wallet with coinbase. I feel like companies that are first to accept bitcoin will also develop customer loyalty for years down the road. Could be wrong though.

Bitcoin is a transparent public ledger that will create an honest system of transaction. The failings of sites like gox or Silk Road have no bearing on the bitcoin protocol. The technology is priceless and will continue to grow regardless of the people who feel threatened by it.

Yes youre right, he is being rational. The bitcoin community could tell regulators to go fly a kite but I'd argue that might make progress and innovation impeded significantly. I don't think facilitating illegal activity was the purpose of bitcoin. So they want a marriage of some sort. He also mentioned that regulatory framework is 150 years old and that will prob need to change to accommodate bitcoin. Bitcoin will disrupt the current monetary system regardless of regulation.

The answer is they really can't. It would be like winning the lottery just to get to a working middle class position. Then your just a different kinda slave. I like the analogy of sitting down to play monopoly but the other players own all the properties, and get 10 times the amount passing go.

 The price has been stable. The china thing is a joke. It's been banned 4 times in the last 3 weeks and the price hasn't budged. It's laughable now. China was banned from bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-01-15 15:29:38
I've often thought the same thing. The more that is held/stored/saved the less available to buy, thus price rises correct? 
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:33:51
This is clever, but the price really doesn't matter. Yeah if all the money fled out of Bitcoin then yes it wouldn't be worth anything as far as dollars are concerned and because of that it would weaken and prob die off. Look at the number of new wallets though. Especially in the past year. If you think that has no significance ask yourself how many wallets you had or tried the first 6 moths after discovering it, compared to how many wallets you have today regardless of balances.

Price is already rebounding. It doesn't take much to cause fud and this story served its purpose. Either way they'll fix "the bug" and prices will re stabilize. Some people just got really cheap coins.

I got to the part where Peter said that if we put an oil company out of business when they behave badly like bp, we'd be riding around on bicycles and we need oil.

Personally I think it makes a better store of value right now. Nobody likes strong hands. More people holding just drives the price up. Yeah it wouldn't be utilizing one of its attributes, but luckily it does several things well. If you manage your security correctly its gold without the safes and firearms. Better than gold. It will become more transacted once we hit the moon.

Truth. Whether you like it or not if you signed the papers it's your responsibility. You might be able to avoid paying for awhile, but ultimately you will be held accountable. Someone mentioned below that best thing would be to not have gotten the loan to begin with. I made that mistake. I'd def pay my debt off with bitcoin if that day comes.
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:55:45
I guess it's speculation that they would even move it to begin with. How real is the threat hackers can get in there and make it disappear? I think that's the real question. If it was highly probable wouldn't they move it ASAP? So, saying the threat is real and they decide to move it how much would they move and where? I'd prob move all of it. The next question is where does it go?

I agree, its good to keep an open mind. Bitcoin could fail. I think its healthy to keep that as a possible outcome. It's still an invest what you can afford to lose sort of experiment.

Hoarding is the only way to go. If they want to treat it like a commodity then so be it. Hodl everyone, buy at least 1 btc and think long term. You can transact when it's worth 1000x its value.

Started out saying he lost half of the $200 he put in and not his best investment, then he says it can be replicated easily which yes it can but the network behind the bitcoin protocol can't be replicated easily. Enormous flaws? I wouldn't say enormous, and not as flawed as the current monetary system. He did make the case that we need a system like bitcoin but not bitcoin itself. He topped off this enlightening interview by saying essentially bitcoin needs regulation which it doesn't have(insert Wild West comment) ffs can't we just trust in mathematics? Oh yeah what interview would be complete without an mtgox reference. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:35:26

@_date: 2014-01-23 12:43:15
And why do you think that? Of 4 trillion in assets I don't think anyone believes a majority of it will be moved instantly to bitcoin. How much would need to be moved in the next year to affect the price of bitcoin? 1/4? 
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:14:15
Have they already purchased the bitcoin?

So he's already said everything we need to know. They want to make sure people aren't laundering money, and yet not clip the wings off the fledgling technology. Keep New York a hub of innovation. Now I don't have to sit through the whole thing. Carry on. See you on the moon.

@_date: 2015-01-14 00:08:17
This right here. I think what people forget is that Bitcoin the name doesn't need to be adopted by the mainstream. You can call it whatever you like but it's blockchain technology. Right now the bitcoin blockchain happens to have the largest network effect. Regardless of what the price is, more venture capital went into Bitcoin in 2014 than any other year. In the end if Bitcoin reduces friction in financial services and lowers cost it will be adopted. The mainstream doesn't care how things work just that they work. Good chance big money is waiting to scoop up a good chunk of this limited digital technology.

@_date: 2015-01-01 13:42:06
Can you give me examples? I appreciate the feedback. 
Something like this 
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:28:43
So you disagree with every panel member? They all agreed bitcoin would need to work with regulators and it was expected. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:01:07
It might be something built on top of the blockchain. I highly doubt he would let his own company support Bitcoin if he didn't think it was an important technology. How does that make sense? The only circle jerk on this sub comes from the trolls.

meanwhile you're collecting the tips. part of what makes Bitcoin cool is that fact that you can send small amounts of money to anyone anywhere on the globe at anytime. It's called micro transactions. You know like being able to tip someone for content? Buying a news article for 25 cents? It was a gesture bud. If you didn't like it why collect it? If you wanted more money all you had to do was ask. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:47:45

Dude you have a backup seed. Learn about something before you go spouting off doom and gloom. And it wasn't $100, I paid in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:49:47
right I said it was relevant, it just didn't specifically mention the Bitcoin blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:53:50
Questioning the ecosystem? Not everyone is questioning the ecosystem just because the price drops. Price fluctuations are expected in this ecosystem. If people buy Bitcoin without knowing that it's kinda their fault. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:22:48
picked 1.8 up at 275 last week. I was hoping to see 150 or lower yesterday but now here we are back above $200. Nobody likes it around here when you try and pick the bottom.
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:57:37
haha you can't be for real:) but I'll play along. You don't keep the back up seed in the same house that might burn down. If you do, store another in a different location. Unless both locations burn down then you'd be screwed.

I got a refurbished Lenovo thinkpad off tiger direct. Well under $500. Installed Ubuntu 14.10 and am now running a full node. Fairly inexpensive set up.

Wow thanks man. I'd rather use the Lenovo for other things and have a machine that just runs a node anyway. Without port forwarding(which I'm still not sure how to do) im getting around 13-16 connections on the laptop. Thanks again wserd.

@_date: 2014-01-22 12:26:01
Right but what we are seeing now in terms of price (under $1000 per) is the hold back. Meanwhile the infrastructure is growing and will accommodate the price increase. By the time bitcoins are worth 5-6 figures you'll be able to stay in bitcoin and never have to use visa or MasterCard etc again. Except to pay your taxes of course.

I feel this is a valid question. If a hard fork happens and you aren't camping out on Reddit, how long would one have to move coins off in this case CB? Is the answer all users should move all Bitcoin off exchanges now? Until a resolution had been met and confidence regained? 
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:23:41
This must've worked thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:55:11
You're right. I forget what day it was, but I do remember a big run up in just a matter of hours. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:59:18
The only thing I find concerning is that CB is recommending users withdraw bitcoin but will suspend withdrawals in case of a hard fork. Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:52:41
Do you know what exactly he said in the news conference today? I haven't seen an exact translation of what he said. Shouldn't it be easy to figure out if they were stolen, lost, or not there to begin with?
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:36:45
But how can you withdraw if they suspend withdrawals? Doesn't make sense. Unless again I'm missing something. I get it's a cya for CB.

Why make it more confusing to the average person just learning about Bitcoin / blockchain? Everyone knows by now Bitcoin investing is volatile and will be for most likely a long time. Throwing out the Etherum project wouldn't really add value to the interview IMHO. It was focused on Bitcoin as it should be. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:07:01
Feels like late 2013...
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:21:17
Isn't this always the way haha. Not saying you were timing the market, but it's impossible for the lay person. I've learned to put aside bitcoin I'll never part with, and some to play with that I'm ok with selling or using whenever ignoring the market fluctuations.  
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:24:46
Same here. Matured a lot since those days. I think the nervousness gets eliminated when you're not invested with money you were suppose to pay your rent or grocery bill with. With the halving coming and an uncertain monetary system, seems plausible price will continue to go up. But could also plummet... It's fun nonetheless and I'm enjoying this ride.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:18:29
Haha just having a little fun, but yes just my opinion. I can't imagine he wouldn't hedge his bets at all. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 09:59:29
She did amazing.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:33:41
Do you think he'd admit to it? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:15:00
Thanks, and yeah I kinda realized after I sent the transaction it could take awhile. I typically use my shift card which makes speed of transaction kind of a non issue. Live and learn. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:18:57
He sounded desperate. To me it sounds like the old guard trying to maintain its relevance. In case of the apocalypse yeah gold may be useful. Who really thinks thats a possibility? I think the more likely scenario is cooler heads prevail and technology advances the planet in a positive direction. Gold just isn't cool no matter how you spin it. The next generations aren't carrying gold bars or silver coins to buy a cup of coffee or order an uber. Aside from that I don't want my funds in someone elses hands even if its Brinks. Crypto is just a better form of money. Gold comes in second even with its history. This is Gold 2.0
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:20:30
He holds crypto. He's not stupid. Just shilling for his baby. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:51:18
The last question response was perfect. Bitcoin value will need to increase in order to become a game changer in the banking /payment space. That's obviously what these investors are betting on. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:14:15
If I use my shift card I can pay using bitcoin wherever visa is accepted. The argument that you can't transact using bitcoin is nonsense. I do it all the time then I replenish my wallet with bitcoin I traded fiat for. So yeah I can buy a coffee or a hot dog with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:19:16
Just to be clear, US customers will no longer be verified, existing customers can continue to use bitfinex, but can't trade 2 cryptos? SAN and EOS?
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:04:57
That's correct. Neither a great option really. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:37:17
Did anyone listen to Schiff on Rogan? Sounded kinda desperate honestly. The fact he dismisses it entirely is where he loses me. He was peddling a gold credit card where your gold is kept with a 3rd party(Brinks) and it was so cool and hip to send it anywhere to anyone anytime using the power of the internet. He's a smart guy obviously but hard not to see how scared he is. He's obviously holding crypto. He's not that dumb. Andreas will eat him alive in a debate.

That and I'm pretty certain they've been experimenting with blockchain technology for awhile. Also, just because they are experimenting with the tech doesn't mean they are trying to develop their own blockchain. We all know you can't have a secure blockchain without decentralization ;)

@_date: 2017-11-16 05:26:37
I guess my next question would be how secure would it be compared to the bitcoin blockchain? Anyone can create a blockchain, but doesn't the network/mining create the security. Maybe my understanding is novice.

"We also have an equivalent to bitcoin up and running, again within the labs, so we can mine what we call a 'Citicoin', for want of a better term. It's in the labs, but it's to make sure we are at the leading edge of this technology and that we can exploit the opportunities within it."
Equivalent? That's a lie really. Unless they don't understand security.

I guess I though it was already established that Greece has nothing to do with the price increase and it was possibly other countries facing similar capital controls that were possibly dipping their toes in. Either way the increase is so minor that maybe it's all useless speculation.

Easy to use
TREZOR is Windows, OS X and Linux friendly. All you need to do is to connect your TREZOR to the computer and follow the instructions. There are only two buttons, to confirm or to deny the action, so using TREZOR is as easy and as intuitive as it can be. Users can backup the whole TREZOR contents on a small piece of paper and use this backup to regain access to all their coins in case of disaster, loss or theft.

Bitcoin is a fucking beast. The only areas of concern are security and volitilty. There are services in the space that will lock the price to eliminate exposure to volatility. With hardware wallets like Trezor, case, or ledger security can be done by the individual user without having to trust an exchange. Not everyone is willing to or able to do this but the options are there. In light of things happening in the euro zone, being able to move my money into a storage solution that I controlled would be a pretty sweet option.

This is all very true. If you've been around long enough or have a trading background you understand this. Some people jump aboard because it's exciting. Best advice for newbies here. Yes it's risky so don't risk more than you're willing to lose, look at the historical chart, sit back and hodl long term. Long term could be 10 years might be ten months. 2014-2016 were pretty long for holdlers. Be prepared to be patient. Understand cold storage and implement. This really isn't a pull back I don't think. 3k would be a pull back yet I remember new years eve  telling some buddies buying 1 bitcoin at 1k might be a good idea. Enjoy the ride everyone.

Luckily I've been in Bitcoin for awhile and I bought more ethereum between $11 and $30. Even though its sucks to think of how much money I ended up losing, its not a unique story for crypto users. People have lost fortunes. It's part of the experience I guess. I had at the time around 1k on Cryptsy. Not a lot and I guess I was willing to part with it if something bad happened. I was aware of the risk. Hard to play Monday morning quarter back.

Right, it's more a general misconception with the public and media that Bitcoin is some dangerous anonymous currency that helps facilitate illegal activities.

Why are smartphones, tablets, laptops, fast food, and online shopping valuable? Millions of people don't care or even take the time to consider how money gets from point a to point b. Scanning your phone at the counter will be just as routine as anything else people do mindlessly every day. It's about convince. Same as people being afraid of the web, email, or cell phones. Think of one person you know that doesn't use at least one of these things. So I think this question is valid, but its like asking why is the web valuable, or why are cell phones valuable. We're a little ahead of the adoption curve but some think this will happen faster than some of the above mention as far as speed of adoption. Think about getting to the store and you forgot your wallet. You could txt your wife to transfer some funds instantly to your phone no problem. As long as you didn't forget your phone :)
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:11:59
Right I agree. It's not black and white. I personally could care less if someone says they're worthless. It's not the first time a major technological advancement such as bitcoin was criticized or deemed worthless. People are starting to wake up to the notion that bitcoin doesn't have a price tag. Sure you can buy and sell them for what the market says they are worth, but the potential lies in the protocol itself and how it can be implemented to make things work better. Starting with money alone it makes significant upgrades.

Well said. So you admit it's theatre? Most of the time this disagreeing leads to division, which leads to distracting us from creating harmony. The average pm holder doesn't always see it as theatre. I guess that was more of what I was suggesting that we really need to work together. If a small percentage of the population really controls 99% of the wealth then where do we fit in. 99% ers arguing amongst themselves. The only thing that needs to be said to PS is that bitcoin is a better currency plain and simple end of debate. You're not going to carry a bar of gold into the grocery store or even coins. You're going to carry your smart phone in, or even better a smaller device or nothing at all who knows? So again my original point was to say its not a debate and all this debate is slowing down progress. I feel like if Silicon Valley and Pm's had a baby it would be bitcoin. It's a love child so lets all enjoy it.

Exactly. He's right on sound money, Pm's etc but he admits it's too over his head. You can see his eyes bug out several times trying to focus. Either he's acting or he's just too set in his ways like many naysayers that they dismiss it as too complicated.

Right just no new deposits. So some could still have fiat sitting at the exchange? To be used to buy bitcoin back?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:13:56
Absolutely. It was a great feeling. It's not just about phones. We "vote" everyday with our wallets. From the banks we use, to where we eat. It's simple.. Starve the beast. If we want change this is how it happens. Bitcoin is just one tool. Several things we can do. Like boycotting apple, ebay, PayPal, etc etc. I got a galaxy 4. Kinda the top seller in android phones and very popular. New galaxy due out in 2014. I also bought my daughters the moto x for Christmas. They each got a chance to design their own color combos and signature on back of device.

“It’s a bubble,” Greenspan, 87, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview from Washington. “It has to have intrinsic value. You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven’t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.”
Or just not be 87 years old. That's right, we should listen to this wise old man. The old monetary system has worked so well. The intrinsic value is its use as a tool by the people to immediately take control of the wheel. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:07:44
I agree it is ok to want to make money I was trying to make the point that some people aren't doing it for the money and are still evangelizing because of what the implications are for society. It will improve it. Now if that's up to debate fine. Some say it won't some say it will. I personally think bitcoin attracts forward thinking people who are honestly trying to make the planet better. Money can be a powerful tool for good. :) thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:49:51
Never understood why some say holding is bad. Maybe because holding hurts their ability to manipulate the price. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:47:31
I just said not everyone is in it for the money. It's kind of a silly debate. It's always a criticism of bitcoin that people are just looking to get rich quick. A very broad statement. As I said not everyone is looking to get rich. The concept of what money is needs a complete overhaul.

I'm sure this has already been mentioned but right off the bat schiff makes the case for a digital currency backed by gold. Is he trying to marry the two? I love Pm's and I love bitcoin but to me bitcoin is just better as a currency and as a store of value. You can argue intrinsic value all day but I think bitcoin is stronger in those 2 categories. Maybe he knows this and is trying to jump on the train. Any thoughts?

I personally think its good to not invest more than you can lose. If you've made a profit why not cash out enough to cover initial investment then you're at zero risk. If you have lost money may consider just holding. No reason why we won't see 4 or even 5 digits in the next 24 months.

Hey guys here's an idea. How about we all ignore the foolish press? I'm not saying ignore criticism about bitcoin, but at this point isn't it obvious to decipher? Bottom line it's obvious bitcoin is a threatening utility to a shitty monetary system. It's still growing but even as a young protocol it does things better than others like gold or the dollar. What happened to all the occupy folks? Problem with that movement is that there was no tool. Well here is the tool. Convert your fiat into bitcoin. Fuck the current volitility. By panic selling and buying into the media fear you're handing them the game. If everyone converted just a small amount of fiat into bitcoin it would be game over. Buy a little and hold. This is the peoples currency. Resist the FUD.

@_date: 2013-11-09 16:58:00
I think that's what people are missing. The fact that major players will want to use bitcoin within their infrastructure. Whether its amazon, PayPal, eBay, Facebook, governments etc etc. 
Bitcoin is a valuable commodity because of its properties and is finite to boot. I think worldwide adoption will happen however most people will be using the bitcoin protocol and probably wont even know they are using it. It's too valuable to be left in the hands of the people. If you can't beat em join em. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:19:45

No prob! Cold as hell up here in maine too but currently enjoying the wood stove. It's probably all part of the show. Peter more than likely holds bitcoin. I hardly doubt he's that stupid not to. It's the division it creates between pm bugs and bitcoiners. We have the same vision but obviously both camps will stay loyal to their investments respectively. That's why IMHO you should have both. I'm a novice investor and even I know you stay diversified and hedge accordingly. Speaking of hedge, zero hedge is a great example if you want to see anger flowing through a comment thread. It gets down right nasty. So yeah thanks! Stay warm!
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:02:51

So the article says that capital controls have made it difficult to use arbitrage in china using bitcoin, yuan, and the dollar. So people that were only in it for the arbitrage are now cashing out? Trying to see the connection to the price dip. Also, $100 swing in one direction or the other is typically pretty normal.

Wow I shouldn't take the time to respond to this but... Would you like to form a quote that's negative towards bitcoin. Go ahead, all ears. I forgive you for telling me to go fuck myself. I know you didn't mean that. What are your criticisms towards bitcoin because the only ones I ever hear are involving, drugs, child pornography, and money laundering. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:50:57
If you're a "little guy" I wouldn't recommend trying to play the game. Meaning if the dog you have in the fight is a poodle it ain't worth trying to mix it up with the pit bulls. If bitcoiners believe in the protocol and what it means for the future of humanity then we know that it's going to be integral in almost every sector known to man from social networking to banking. For the little guy panic selling the few bitcoins you have in hopes of "btfd" might backfire. Meaning lets say a site like coinbase runs out of coins, or a site like bitstamp is down, delays etc etc. by the time you try and get back in the price is doubled. So my reccomendation for the little guys is to hold. We're on the launch pad about ready to take off, tptb are just trying to come in and play daddy. Destination: moon

This documentary (let's make money) is from 2008 but just watched it for the first time. A lot of information that those of us into bitcoin already know and understand. It's on netflix in case anyone wanted to watch it. It covers how the wealthy stay anonymous with off shore bank accounts, and how counties are exploited for resources at he benefit of a few. The part where I think bitcoin fits in is it will be a redistribution of wealth. I believe most of us believing in bitcoin as sound money, and trusting in the protocol also share other ideals that will help change the world. Once this transfer is complete we will have the power to make these changes and in effect save humanity. I believe we can do this and it's happening now. So thank you everyone out there working to make this happen. "Let's make money!"
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:33:47
I don't want to be that guy who's says your being a dick, but I just became him. Haha I'm just messing with you. Seriously though. I've been pretty stingy with my btc partially because I don't have a lot. I've been wanting to support the bitcoin ecosystem for a long time but as I said I've been hoarding a bit. So I bought a gyft card with bitcoin funded by coinbase account. I did it all in minutes before entering the store. The receipt just shows the $250. Largest amount you can fund I believe. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:07:57

@_date: 2013-12-20 18:24:04
Tom woods also came out as very positive on bitcoin. He's filled in on ps show before. Never heard timothy b lee. Ill check him out. Thanks
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:21:10
@_date: 2013-12-30 12:27:33
He makes it a point to say that any issues bitcoin may have can be fixed along the way if need be. Built on top of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:17:11
I thought bitcoin wasnt related to drugs? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:07:19
Yes great videos!
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:17:29
So was hoping someone from coinbase might see this. Tried accessing my account today for the first time in a couple days and received this message. It was literally on the first try and after I entered the authy code. Any ideas? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:46:07
Remittance market is over 500billion. WU gets a big piece of that pie. Bitcoin being a dominant method will be the obvious leader sooner than later. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:14:05
Yeah. I think the guy was actually trying to add something but ver made it pretty clear no matter what central authority that is voted in its still a central authority. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:54:46
This process also doesn't include his time and effort to send it and the fees associated. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:29:38

@_date: 2013-11-22 04:03:16
Nope nothing here either.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:47:39
Great point but those numbers do get silly. Just a 50x increase would be 33k per?

Tough crowd for positivity tonight. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:05:55
Hard assets. I figure convert to fiat then directly into real estate or Pm's. Keep some bitcoins on ice. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:14:24
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:48:25
You'll just be giving other people cheap coins. Panic selling low bad. Buying low good. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:41:42
And this.. Some people might make millions, even billions, and some thousands. Buy one at 1000 someday might be worth 50k or 100k. I'd assume most people could live with an roi like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:34:58
Bitcoin mentioned at about 20:00. Great video thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:49:04
Very well said.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:26:42
Yup 19 bucks an ounce not too bad. Going hard Pm's and bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:40:17

Very computer illiterate hear so any advice will help here. Is it possible to even update my Mac to 10.8, and if so is armory working for osx? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:35:15
Yeah didnt she pretty much say bitcoin will not succeed? Blah blah
Oh yeah and they tried throwing ripple in there.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:59:52
Technically anyone has a right to buy, sell, trade btc at their own discretion so what makes it any difference if banking investors invest? By the sounds of the hearing most everyone agreed virtual currencies namely bitcoin are legit, have extreme value, upside, and aren't going anywhere. It's probably inevitable they adopt this protocol, and yes hopefully new entrants can compete.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:24:15
Yeah but he basically said bitcoin has reached beyond its worth and now time to convert back to gold. Ill hold onto my bitcoins for now. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:25:15
This was a great interview. Going to add YouTube channel now. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:51:39
Yikes bro. Your comments kinda stand out as bs. No I'm not going to argue that point.

I had the first iPhone and every version after that but it was time for a change.. And also apples stance on bitcoin didn't help. Android baby, vote with your wallet. Also had an enthralling conversation with AT&amp;T guys about bitcoin. It's just hard not to feel the excitement. I told them why not put $100 bucks into it? They seemed to agree :) to da moon!
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:46:58
Didnt a lot of people get a big break when bitcoin hit 260?
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:38:21

Is 5k an arbitrary huge sum of money?
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:01:05
So for every billion dollars we jump 100usd? 10billion market cap =1000 per?

@_date: 2013-12-10 14:06:10
Haha ok well maybe a general response rather than a reply to my comment would be more appropriate. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:39:46
This exactly

This is a normal correction.

I'm planning on knee surgery in the coming months. Ill be paying out of pocket. There is a place in Oklahoma that does cash prices. So for say 6k I could get my knee repaired. So the idea of booking a flight with cheap air, and flying to Lithuania to have surgery there sounds very appealing. Maybe by the time I'm ready 1 bitcoin will cover everything. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:45:15
Great interview thanks.

I guess I was trying to make the connection between Tom woods and ps as having similar economic views but on bitcoin drastically different. I think we have a faction of the media that is all about keeping the public fearful. Without getting too philosophical, dark entity that feeds off fear etc. It's a trick of the awakening process. You wake up to the realities around you. That only goes so far. At some point you have to put the conspiracies aside and actually do something good. Be the change you want to see, be part of the solution so to speak. Problem with AJ types is everything is fear and dread so the fear causes paralysis to actually take positive action and change. So yeah AJ won't understand because his job is to keep people afraid. That interview was a classic example. It started with bitcoin, then 3 min in they were talking about nwo police state bad bad scary.. Doom!!! Haha

Ok computer novice here, and its not Sunday but I have a security question. I have half my btc sitting at coinbase(wherever they keep them), and half in a blockchain wallet. I'm was going to use armory and print a paper wallet but my osx is so out dated(like domestic cat) that I can't use armory. 
Is coinbase safe for storage? Any advice would be much appreciated thanks!

This is very true. The only problem however is that at times the disgust and hatred for religion cuts us off from love. Once you realize religion is just a control device it's easy to believe in... Well nothing. IMHO this cuts us off from love, and the ability for us to see ourselves as one. Unity vs division. Religion is great at causing division huh? The person we know as jesus (really yeshua, I think jesus is a Latino name) may have said some of the stuff written in the bible. Theory is he was crucified for his words, then his story used by the same people that killed him. He wasn't the only one in our history telling us to love one another. So yeah religion as an institution is corrupt by nature though more than likely many involved have no idea the true origins. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:48:28

You stole my comment. He's become my favorite speaker on bitcoin. And kudos to the tasty treat guys for having him on and taking the time to understand bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:11:18
I'm passionate about trying to make the world a better place. It's pretty frustrating when the system around you is structured to make that near impossible. Bitcoin is the first tool I've seen that can actually give power back to the people. Not the govt or the big banks. And no I'm not heavily invested in bitcoin. In fact im much more heavily invested in Pm's. IMHO I feel like debating someone like him is a waste of time and you're right to each his own and I apologize if I came off as aggressive in anyway. I however do not feel like having a spirited and honest discussion has tremendous upside. Yes we are all dead in the end, but is this really how you view life? Call me naive but I believe we can improve on the human condition while we're alive. Thanks and again I appreciate your response. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:47:59

That's the name of the documentary. "Let's make money" highlighting how money is created out of nothing. Yes the world needs to be rescued, and bitcoin can be the vehicle to facilitate this if we all choose. The transfer of wealth will be the cause for change, but its what these new millionaires do with that money that will be the difference. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:46:26
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:50:19
One of the chief complaints about bitcoin is illegal activities. Wouldn't bitcoin make it harder to do these things since it is easier to trace? Arguably a positive if we really want to thwart some of these things.

If you're only holding Pm's prob good sign you should be in bitcoin too. Sound money: bitcoin/precious metals
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:46:18
Exactly we are all pinned to the price of bitcoin in euro, usd, yuan etc but in reality whats preventing me from giving someone a bitcoin for a laptop. Bitcoin is what we say it is. The infrastructure continues to grow so this will just help support the idea that bitcoin doesn't need to be pegged to anything. That's the point.

Exactly what most people say. Don't put in anything in you aren't ready to lose. With that being said, big risk, big reward. Could it possibly dip to 300? Anything is possible but dips like that have typically been because of panic selling due to a misinterpretation of a news story. Silk Road closing cleaned up bitcoins rep, and china saying banks can't touch it keeps it out of the hands of the types bitcoin isn't here to serve. So at 850 will be go north or south? I personally think bitcoin is a safe investment at this level. It's just getting stronger. Good luck!

Bitcoin mentioned once in first segment, once again midway trough the second, but they don't really get into in until the final minute of the video. In case anyone someone wanted to skip keiser theatrics. I personally enjoy them. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:45:16
Like gold chains? Grillzzz? Seriously? Indeed a poor measure to say the least. Oh let me go put 30k in gold rims for my car. Or how bout an all gold wheelchair?(lady gag) makes perfect sense considering we are destroying Mother Earth, raping 3rd world countries, dropping bombs, and people sleeping on the streets. Give me a break. Don't worry bitcoin is here to change that. Power is shifting. I wonder how many hungry mouths ill be able to feed?

Most anyone will tell you don't risk more than you are willing to lose. Golden rule. You're gambling. With that being said, big risk, big reward. If and when you are able to cover your initial investment great. 500 is pretty low IMHO. You're going to get people saying its crashing to zero and into extinction but I'd beg to differ. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:58:48
Right, so much focus on bitcoin as a currency, when it really acts as verification system too and ultimately might end up utilized primarily in that way. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:55:06
Sat in the parking lot at target pulled up gyft app on galaxy s4 linked coinbase account and sent around .4btc to Gyft. Purchased $250 target card. At the register opened up gyft, clicked on target card, up popped option to redeem, then cashier scanned barcode and voila! Greatest part was didnt scan my Visa card. Felt incredible tbh, and the cashiers mind was blown. So thank you satoshi, thank you gyft, and thank you coinbase. Oh yeah and thank you android.(yes I switched from iPhone to make above mentioned happen)

@_date: 2013-12-21 14:07:06
I feel comfortable with those words. It means people that own bitcoins saying they are going to be worth some ridiculous sum. For 1st world that means much greater than 5k. If you're making minimum wage in Bangladesh and happen to have some money to invest I'd suggest some Pm's or bitcoin. If not I'm optimistic bitcoin will in the end make life better for those in 3rd world countries.

@_date: 2013-12-02 19:04:32
If we all made a pact to only sell for 20k,40k, 100k etc then that's what It would be worth. Even those numbers are undervalued and everyone knows that.  You of course need to understand bitcoin to understand this.

Thank you Barry! Someone who gets in on msm. It's refreshing to hear. 
Also did tha woman say they have their version of he fed referring to mining? Not a great comparison. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:59:04
Yeah bummer. I bought one today just before the coinbase lockout. Bought at $545. Sadly however I think we will see a grand before we see it dip down to 500 or below. May never see that price again. Agreed major major win. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:55:59
Regardless everyone should still put a dollar into bitcoin.

Interview was a bit awkward but they usually are and the interviewer didnt help. Few cups off coffee on board. Great for bitcoin though. They are definitely being used increase adoption by woman 16-50. So overall yeah really positive sign. I've felt all along it would happen quicker than expected. They seem to think so too.

Explanation on 1:20? Seriously what just happened? Gyft card as mentioned halfway through, but no mention of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:48:52
Has anyone considered many aren't in bitcoin for the money? I agree obviously some to varying degrees, but those of us fed up with the wars, poverty,corruption, and greed are looking at this as a tool to make the world a better place.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:16:38
So in the course of the next week we will see it drop to 200 then up to 2k?

What happens when the banks start utilizing the bitcoin protocol? The guy from Boston seemed pretty favorable about bitcoins potential at the senate hearing yesterday. If your bank started utilizing it would the average joe even know he's using it when he scans his phone at the counter?

Yeah same for bitstamp
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:32:03
Thanks. So just makes it harder to obtain. If I hold bitcoin in china I can still buy things with me bitcoin, trade them, sell them, move them around etc etc?
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:42:49
My thoughts exactly

I agree with this. He starts out making some favorable comparisons. Then he just starts making ludicrous claims about breaking gold and silver in to fractional pieces for spending. There is a reason the dollar became the preferred method of currency. The problem is they took it off the gold standard and voila qe infinity, and money backed by nothing. You're right, bitcoin is unlike anything anyone has ever seen or could've imagined. It really is gold 2.0 but even Bette than that. It fixes the infinite quantity of the printing machines, and is without a don't heads and tails above Pm's in the transportability department. Perfect timing. Thanks satoshi. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:37:51
Exactly my impression.

I planned on using some btc for Christmas shopping using gyft card or snap, but that was when the price was over 1100 per. Then the dips began and we just haven't made it back to the moon yet. So yeah I'm holding until we get plus 1k at least.

It's clear man cannot think clearly in the presence of beer. Once Matt up handed that across the table the guy that was talking eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. Was literally reaching for one. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:06:56
Thanks. Was trying to spread things out a bit but now wishing I'd left them alone. Thanks for reassuring me. Appreciate that. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:28:25
That could be true.

I have to disagree. Keiser was the reason I got into bitcoin.

From her testimony:
"We must recognize that some individuals and, apparently, an increasing number of businesses, see value in using forms of “virtual currencies” to complete their own transactions.7 Can we prevent them from doing so? Probably not. Should the United States step up their regulatory efforts in this arena? My answer is not yet, and not until such time as stronger evidence suggests problems exist with these currencies that contribute to financial instabilities, or otherwise enable issuers or intermediaries to commit fraud on users or complicate monetary or other important public policies."
She definitely pushes the regulation thing to make sure "bad things don't happen" we've heard this quite a bit. However she says here we can't control it. I really think they just want to control bringing it into mainstream so that the system doesn't go bonkers and they can fold up the old monetary system in an orderly fashion. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:58:20
I've been saying it all along. Peter wants to join forces. Crypto currency as Erik says is an amazing tool. It's a better monetary system. Peter wants it backed by gold. 
PS needs to appear tough during the negotiations.

Wow. Anyone else starting to feel bad for pm bugs like Peter? Specifically pm bugs that just won't give credit where it's due regarding the invention of bitcoin. I own Pm's and hold bitcoin. Both have great attributes, but in the end bitcoin is just a better currency. You can't buy anything with bitcoin? Gold is as easily divisible? Honestly I could sit here and list the fallacies he just spewed out but not worth the time, and I stopped listening about halfway through. So I feel bad for you bud. I understand you own a company that sells metals but this is sad. Especially when I had so much respect for you before. Again, gold and silver are great, I love them, and hold them literally near and dear to my heart. But 20 years from now my children won't be walking into a coffee shop and asking if they have change for an ounce of silver. They will whip out their smartphone and voila. Is this really still a debate? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:51:20

I think skepticism is a good thing. As far as them just stepping aside I agree they don't want to. Threatens everything. Change is inevitable however. Syria was a great example of how they tried to drum up business and constantly shove the fear down our throats in the media. They wanted war to profit. (Yawn) didnt work. Desperate attempts. Bitcoin is like the financial nail in the coffin. It's way too disruptive yet they can't stop it. Crappy situation to be in. So I feel they know the time has come. This is my hope anyway.

Maybe someone can clear this up. Basically peolple in china can't deposit fiat into btc china? So they can't exchange their cash into bitcoin? They are still able to cash out their bitcoin and get the money deposited into their accounts? Am I missing something?

Well the petro dollar is as corrupt and dangerous as they come. In fact fincen rep made that quite clear yesterday. That is what the world hinges on. A corrupt monetary system controlled by a few. Isn't that what the 99% have been battling against? The big banks, centralized govt etc? In walks bitcoin. Bitcoin by its nature is just a better system. Not by a little bit either. On top of that its happening already. People are making the choice. They can't control it or destroy it and thus why I think they are giving in. Lead follow or get out of the way sort of thing.

Although I know it's a reality bitcoin could crash and is not by any means a guaranteed investment, did it seem he mentioned how easily it could be replaced, crash, and Lose value just a few too many times within the first 15 min of the video? Usually the concept of bitcoin being easily replaced is followed by the idea that it has first mover advantage etc.

It will always hold value and be easily moved around, and for some poker chips. Beyond that it will most likely do things so much more revolutionary. Have you heard of colored coins? I'm wondering if this is where those come in?

Still holding. Sold enough to cover investment so all gravy now. Believe in bitcoin as monetary game changer.

I can't see that hearing as anything but positive. Major win for bitcoin. Hard not to feel like they just opened the floodgates for adoption by several of the worlds largest markets including, banking, housing, remittance, online commece, and technology advancement. Either the us embraces this innovation or others will and us companies will miss the boat. A very big boat.(think cruise ship) They won't miss the boat. I even felt like Carper had a very open and pro bitcoin attitude. No way they come back banning it. They know that doing so would be like shooting themselves in the foot. IMHO buckle up.
