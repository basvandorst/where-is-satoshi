I have a few dozen history books. My favorite is David Swing by John Newton from 1908. I have a first edition copy, printed in Chicago, with the pages still uncut. I also have Great Stories of all Nations, Lieber and Williams, 1927, and the Outline of History by HG Wells, 1922. It's a third edition. I have a lot more history books, but those three are my favorites. The David Swing is very rare. Shipping is included in the price, and payment is in bitcoin.

So... You don't want your half a cent worth of dogecoin?  Anyway, people from r/bitcoin are buying my books, so... I'll stay.

Oh mah gawd, thank so much for the coins.  I've always kicked myself for not investing in bit earlier.  This act of charity and goodwill definitely takes the sting out.
