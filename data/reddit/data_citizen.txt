A common response I've heard to this question is that people will continue to pay their taxes in fiat but that is all fiat will be used for. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:22:43
I think there are countless people out there who are far for qualified than I am to answer this question.
That being said, my view on the subject of taxation is that blockchain does not really provide a better way for government to collect taxes, so there is no real point to tax people in the form of cryptocurrency. When it comes down to it, the question is still "does cryptocurrency fundamentally make tax collector's life easier?"
They won't do it just because it's cool or trendy, they will only do it when there is an intrinsic value in adopting crypto. Perhaps the government will do it when crypto is so widely adopted that people begin to make nation-wide complain that they have to convert their tax into fiat every single year.

I dunno, it improves customer experience, increase transaction speed, and cuts cost. I see a lot of economic incentive to do that.

Does this mean you are willing to pay higher transaction fee to keep the blockchain system working? That is a very generous act in my opinion.

Good idea, there are also suggestions to use the excess heat energy from mining farm to heat greenhouse garden.
That way you can mine bitcoin AND grow vegetables at the same time.
@_date: 2015-05-16 15:16:44
Yea I know, the miners live off transaction fee after all coins are mined.
But the problem persists, if the overall transaction fee is not higher than electricity bill, the miners will not survive.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is still a relatively new technology, it may take more time for it to become more global. Personally I think it is perfectly normal for the developed countries to adopt it first, simply because 1) more people have electronic devices there and 2) they are more inclined to try out new technologies.
I think Bitcoin is already being used by the Chinese, it's just their activity is not transparent since we can't see it from the outside. Think of China as its own isolated ecosystem, what happens in there does not necessarily reflect what is happening outside. The Chinese don't need westerners to "bring" Bitcoin to them, I think they had passed that point already.
@_date: 2015-05-16 06:27:54
Thank you for the insightful reply. 
I suppose the follow-up question would be how much higher the transaction fee has to be to secure the mining industry?
@_date: 2015-05-22 06:57:07
Will Bitcoin make it easier for people to evade taxation by reporting false income? Just curious.

The statement is not wrong.
Rules are not inherently bad if it is created to meet the people's need. Bitcoin itself has rules enforced through the protocol.
We associate rules as something created from the top-down by people detached from reality. This doesn't need to be the case if the rulemaking process is bottom-up and involves a diverse array of people.
If people don't want to be constrained by stupid rules, they need to seize the opportunity to organize and make it themselves.
If you are noticing stupid rule makers encroaching upon the community, you really have to ask yourself who sat idly by and created the vacancy which these newcomers now occupy.

Hi I am the guy you responded on YouTube that indirectly caused the creation of this thread. I feel like there has been some misunderstanding because we are constantly missing each other's idea by close mark, that is, we are not communicating effectively.
The answers you formulated are good response to their corresponding questions, the problem is that those questions were not mine. You had misinterpreted my question because I did not explain them very well, at least that is what I think is happening.
My question is "**How do people increase Bitcoin's divisibility?**".
*Read that question again slowly, digest the question.*
The question is **not** an enquiry about how blockchain reaches consensus, **nor** is it about whether increasing divisibility will lead to increase in money supply. I know that blockchain helps people reach consensus, and I know that making money more divisible will not increase money supply, period. Moving on, I don't think that you need to explain all that in order to answer my question, the same way that you don't really need to explain the complex physics behind telecommunication to teach someone how to change their mobile phone.
What I was asking, is a simplified step by step explanation about how can people modify a network such as blockchain. In the case of mobile phone, the steps to change a mobile phone is: 
1) Remove the old SD card
2) Purchase a new phone
3) Insert SD card into your new phone
4) Activate your new phone
If we apply the same format into my question, the answer *might* look like this:
1) Programmer writes a program that increases Bitcoin's divisibility.
2) Miner receives the program and implement it during their mining process.
3) For every block they mined, each transaction inside can carry currency unit much smaller than 1 satoshi.
4) Return to Step 2 until mass adoption of the program.
I know my explanation is bullshit, and I would appreciate if someone can correct me. The point is, this is the kind of answer that I am looking for - a step by step procedure on how to modify blockchain, not an abstract, metaphorical description about how blockchain works.

That's it, thank you! "Hard fork" is the word I am looking for.
During the process when a new software replaces an old software, is there any problem that may arise among the users? For example, what will happen when half of the community had adopted the new software while the other half remains unchanged? 
Is it possible that Alice may not be able to accept a transaction from Bob if they are using different softwares?
