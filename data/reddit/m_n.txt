Well supposedly a lot of the backlot is from BU spammers sending loads of $0.03 transactions.. don't shoot the messenger pal.

Not claiming anything, simply relaying information i have read. Don't shoot the messenger buddy.

Well mass sending of a tiny amount of currency to deliberately clog up the system... better?

How much of an affect does it actually have, just used this on my 2 transactions that have been unconfirmed for 20+ hours..

Wish i had known about the higher fee speeding up your transaction. Have 2 transactions stuck at the moment, have been for 20+ hours in the chaos... 80,000 unconfirmed transactions and still climbing. Hope they get a big chunk done tonight.

Okay i see, do these 'attacks' usually last long a couple of days or something?

Such an unhelpful response really, already done the transaction so people plastering the same thing over and over isn't going to change anything.

There are nearly 90,000 unconfirmed transactions (2 of my own) You are not alone in this. It's incredible frustrating for many and until a solution can be found this problem is just going to get worse and worse.

Or just set a fixed fee and implement an actual order, first come first served etc. Surely that would alleviate the problem?
