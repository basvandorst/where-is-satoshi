[This]( is how
@_date: 2016-04-19 02:44:03
BitPay has a WooCommerce plugin, I used it extensively with no major issues.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:23:14
Directly from  is the best way.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:30:04
I took the same screenshot, the hack is now fixed, but here it is for the record: [ScreenShot](
Edit: for clarity
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:21
History in the making...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:58:56
Here in the basement with ya.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:16:04
Nah that was just a test run.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:47
[Here you go](
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:38:53
Its true. Works great to ensure you hodl at least 9 days :D
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:02:31
Because 12K sounds like a great low price per BTC. :D I have buy orders at several price ranges, including 12k now. Plus isn't reddit the best place for investment advice to begin with? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:35:33
So buy hashgraph ICO asap?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:08
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:19:10
So are you predicting 12k / BTC within a few days? I'll set a buy order for that, lets see if it fills.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:14:52
Try another USB cable. This exact thing happened to me when I tried using it with an off-brand cable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:02:39
Roger Ver wasn't quite ready?
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:37:36
Tell your Mom to read up on Bitcoin, and keep doing what you're doing. Nothing illegal here.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:46:24
This seems very wrong. Is there a BitPay rep on Reddit that can counter this? I'm a BitPay user and am now concerned. Never thought I'd have to go back and check rates for every transaction item we sold and match it up to the exchange rate at the time of purchase. 
Thanks for reporting this @_date: 2014-02-22 19:59:19
anyone else seeing this or is this a problem on my end only? Coincidentally just got an email from a customer claiming that they can't checkout on my ecig store using bitpay.... While investigating what might be the issue I log into bitpay and see that??? WTF?
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:03:06
Probably Bitcoin Black Friday. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:00:25
I've had patchy experience with them and their 10% off if using bitcoin. I placed a single purchase a week ago for ~ 1500, all went through, got discount, and already have the said server in hand. Then 2 days ago, realize I need a few desktop workstations for new employees, go fill out my cart, enter bitcoin as coupon code and get denied. 
Tried using another account thinking maybe they limit it to a single time use per account, and nope, was able to enter the coupon into the cart, but bitcoin payment was not an option (this was on a premier account) 
Go figure. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:24:27
Strange, all good for me in IE as well, but Chrome is showing cert error. Hmm Ok Sorry for panic post, will dig deeper on my end.
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:10:14
To the moon????

Willy Bot is making a comeback!

"Reports have said the electricity used in just a single bitcoin transaction can power a house for a month."
Such WOW.
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:57:15
But they will only mine for 2 Weeks(™)
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:23:23
anyone reviewing the source code for any nastiness?
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:08:57
Yeah I read that too, however since when do gov officials tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but...?
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:33:06
You might want to put somewhere on your site that you actually accept bitcoins, otherwise looks and sounds like you're just trying to get traffic and publicity. Sorry if I missed this somewhere on your site during my 10 second glance.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:11:31
Same here. Dwolla with us bank account and CampBx, signed up with kraken today as well.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:22:30
Awww shoot... only one picture??? :(
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:42:46
Small being the key here I believe.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:22:46
I guess that is better than a 404 or a 500 that's currently being served by localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:57:28
Had many transactions with them. No problems so far. But agree very misleading.

NaNiwa Takes it
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:14:03
Awesome idea. This could help propell Bitcoin even more!
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:47:09
now go spend it at BitcoinBlackFriday.com
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:55:16
Eh, they are not that bad, slow but not bad.
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:12:00
Aaaah, that's empty as well. IDK how to REDDIT :(
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:00:58
FBI don't care about the bust value.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:31:08
You've chosen to invest a large part of your inheritance into a high risk, volatile, barely out its infancy, crypto currency and have made quite a few mistakes. Take it as a lesson learned, keep reading and educating your self, and most importantly always only invest what you are comfortable with losing.
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:36:07
Its coming.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:52:35
Probably this.....
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:17:56
only invest what you can afford to lose. read the sidebar for information on how to store your bitcoins.

snort cocaine
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:07:02
Should be 0.0005BTC. Aint that the whole point?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:59:53
Failed for me on first attempt, then worked on 2nd.
**EDIT:** Site is having issues for sure. constant 500 and 404 errors. Unable to do anything on site aside from login. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 19:19:57
That's a lot of coins to be keeping in an online wallet....
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:21:34
Retweeted from both personal and business accounts. I would buy from whom ever does it first Newegg / TigerDirect . Upvote OP please. This would be Epic.
@_date: 2013-05-10 19:46:29
Another tango down. Interesting. But exactly what the community needs until developers and network engineers start writing and designing with security in mind while consistently updating their techniques. Hackers do...
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:55:41
WTF is U Rate?
@_date: 2013-05-10 20:46:13
Eh, that's true too. I was thinking really hard at how I can be optimistic and find some way to make this kind of breach a positive thing. Agreed. Nothing will change....
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:19:31
Agreed, not a concern yet, however still interesting news and relevant. IMHO
@_date: 2013-07-08 15:58:54
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:59:53
I guess you're right, could just be servers overloaded.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:08:45
POC only shown to work in a controlled experiment, but I'm sure someone will soon work out the kinks, connect a more powerful laser microphone and start snooping on our Bitcoin encryption keys from a coffee shop down the street from your swanky appt.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:24:22
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:26:11
Its a fairly new wallet too, only started being active about a month ago.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:35:02
Yes. This.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:08:58
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:22:57
someone made money :D
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:12:55
Ahh, There it is. I'd make it more prominent! Be Proud! :)

Bitpay. Easy, and I think they even have a Wordpress plugin.
@_date: 2013-10-07 20:31:52
Chase still does not offer any app based 2FA, and even has restrictions on special character use in passwords....
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:52:41
Site has been around for more than a few months, I've gambled there and received a fair payout.

@_date: 2013-12-05 22:53:28
Interested. Please do post.
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:08:12
Hope it was not a lot.... Coins are probably gone for good. Hope you learned your lessons. 2 factor authentication is a must.
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:03:58
Maybe this is a great opportunity for you in the (rural?) area you live in?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:31:48
They "credit" you 0.1 BTC for signing up, but won't pay out until you earn at least 1.0 BTC. You get paid for doing "jobs" current jobs involve promoting their site with an affiliate link that will pay you 0.02 btc per person who signs up.
