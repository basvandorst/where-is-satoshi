Just think if they would have delayed it a year or two, your friend could've made a few thousand.

A little editing and a legitimate voice narrating and this would be a much better video. Find someone with an English or Australian accent.

How fucking hard is it to just help someone with less knowledge than you without being a dick? I don't understand why it's being lazy, that's why I'm asking questions. I thought this was the place for it.

Is it bad to just store your BTC on Coinbase? I don't have a wallet currently, and as far as I can tell I'm not being charged by Coinbase to have my balance there- can someone explain?

Wells Fargo did.

Thanks! I appreciate the generosity! I'm a pool repair guy who understands hydraulics, I'm 40 years old, and I'm just now trying to learn about Bitcoin despite anyone over 50 laughing me off, so this is my only reference to get info. I have a ton of questions and it's not always easy to find the answers, despite how simple it might seem to someone with a better grasp on the technology. As I speak with my friends about it, they ask me a lot of questions that I can't answer, so I'm sort of taking it upon myself to learn all the info.

What is the genesis of this? This is the third or fourth time I’ve seen this and it’s a cheap cheap POS watch from China....is Elon really pushing these watches? They suck! I pulled the pins to use on my good watches.

But why advertise a method of payment? The sleeve logo has nothing at all indicating them as the attached company...unless they are really trying to get people to use Bitcoin to gamble at their site, but it still seems like a lot of money to pay for returns that would be very hard to measure.

I asked this exact question as a topic around a month or so ago...was very curious myself!

Probably spell check before you tweet out something with such gravitas...
