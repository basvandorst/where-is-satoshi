Yup. Thanks.

But if we have the numbers right and these high-end ASICs are profiting 10x annually at $5.6k BTC, you'd make back your initial investment in 6 weeks.
I'm just looking for some confirmation that these numbers are correct. Two people here have said 15 TH/s will net you 1 BTC in 1.5-2 years, but all of the calculators are saying far less.. Like 10-20x less, and they're not consistent.

Just want to point out this person is talking about u/iknowhim2017 and not me. I have no prior interactions with either of these folks.

So if you got a 15 TH/s miner, it would solve once every 2 years? I mean, that's $35k/yr right now gross -- that's more than 10x annual, and with the prices going to the moon who knows where it will actually be in a year.
Do I have this right? Even at $5.6k.. Why doesn't everyone who can, buy 5 of those for $15k and bank like 30 BTC annually in a pool? Energy would only be 1 BTC, and with a 1000% annual return it could scale extremely fast. Something's wrong, right? Or everyone would be quitting their jobs who even had $3500 for a single-miner rig to start.

Wait, so, I looked these up.. They are $2200. You are saying they make $46k/yr gross @ BTC = $5.6k? Why isn't everyone doing this and getting rich?

Thanks for letting me know about GPU vs. ASIC. I'll ask about the numbers over in that sub.

Is this calculator wrong, then? 
The numbers are for 5 high-end ASICs. It's saying 5-6 coins/yr when it should be saying about 30 by the numbers you quoted me earlier.
And by the way, do you know if these can be used for Ethereum and if mining that and converting to BTC would be more profitable than going for BTC? Seems they have a better return and we can just swap the currency, right?
Thanks for your help.
