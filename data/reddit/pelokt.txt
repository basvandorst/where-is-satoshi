Reserve banking is partially predicated on the idea that money can be generated out of nowhere based on collateral. The money from the loan for your car didnt exist until you signed your good name on the dotted line.
If bitcoins go down the same road, then our human greed will take over, as it always does, and next think you know there will be interest, usury, and all of the other tools that will bring about its end.

In the early days he dumped everything he had into security at the cost of a crappy looking website. I havent spoken to him in a little over 2 months. The last time we did speak we was going on about discussions with the CDN govt to recognize bitcoins as a legit currency.
His tack seems to be more about making bitcoins into mainstream by way of official sanction and creating the foundation for a solid bitcoin banking system. My fear is that he will run out of money before he can pull it off and make some for himself. I say that last sentance only because I agree with your earlier points.  He needs to keep up in order to keep existing, and lately it has faltered somewhat in that department.
If he does pull it off,  then I will consider this man to be one of the founders of the currency. If he can get the gov't to acknowledge it then the mainstream will follow in droves. To my knowledge he is the only one trying to get this thing to work though official channels. at least in canada.

@_date: 2011-07-23 00:48:33
right now its all just currency speculation populated largely by those who are smart enough to know computers and finance at the same time. thats it.  If that keeps up then the value will slowly drop back to whence it came - zero - unless there is a reason to keep bitcoins in the first place; and that is only accomplished if someone has a reason to *save* them, which right now no one does.
@_date: 2011-07-02 12:53:57
The problem is the sheer amount of legal hurdles that have to be run through, and now that the system is up there is the ever present risk (as with any money system) that fraud will occur.  Long story short is that its not exactly cheap to setup and run a system that has to not only fit legal requirements but be secure and disaster proof as well.
We're doing all this work up front to not only try to get a good reputation, but to not become another Mt. Gox. (not to bash them, but they are the highlight of what can go wrong if things aren't done properly from the get-go)
Having said that, the issue of the fee is hotly contested and still is. Don't be surprised if it moves in the future.

your statement that credit cards are "as safe as anything gets in this world" made me laugh. thank you for that.
You're right though - bitcoins by its nature lacks that "central authority" needed to create the big brother in the middle to make sure there is no hijinks.  I dont think we need that big brother per se, but in its current state, bitcoins arent the best route to take.

thats right, but this method allows for the user to stay online while he does his trading without having to worry.
as for a compromised machine, you are right.  if a virus should be able to get past the client that decrypts then yes, it would be able to get the wall.dat file.
but the virus that is out now - the one that sends your wallet.dat file to another person, wouldnt work because it cannot ftp the file or send it though other means.

Unfortunately, its a lot easier for our monkey minds to comprehend pieces of paper being safe in a metal box somewhere or at least folded up inside some cowskin more than it is an encrypted string of numbers in a virtual environment.

well in that case, the US dollar is backed by nothing at all. Oh wait - its military assures that when any country wants oil, it has to do it through OPEC, and OPEC only accepts american.
Is there a document stating that the dollar is "Backed" by oil in other countries?  if there were there would be (a more obvious) world war on our hands.
Willy-nilly is a phrase I have not heard in a long time. Thank you!
@_date: 2011-06-30 21:39:16
While I agree that Mt Gox isn't playing fair,  I think its more a stabilization of the system taking hold.  a number of exchanges are coming on line so things will probably move again soon.
@_date: 2011-07-20 15:10:40
gov't will need a record of some sort that shows where the car went.  I suppose you could say you bartered it for another item, but that would mean effectively writing the entire thing off taxwise. Its legal to sell a car for as little as a dollar, so I dont see the problem.
@_date: 2011-07-22 20:49:19
i hate to say it but im seeing the same pattern with bitcoins - something needs to be done to prop it up with real value in a genuine way before its realized that its nothing but a digital currency.
@_date: 2011-07-23 05:30:01
I didnt say they would be worthless, But I did suggest they would eventually end up heading towards zero unless there was a reason to keep them.  Dont forget that the point of being in bitcoins isnt to make money so much as it is to have the concept aspire to larger things, and to try to profit from its death as some would do is actually sad to me.
Doing things like short selling to me is a gateway to larger steps that would eventually include interest and usury.

as much as I hate it, the dollar is backed by the fact that on the international market you can't buy oil without american dollars - hence the reason for the wars.  Until that changes the "fiat" currency you speak of is indeed backed up by something...american military making damn sure that dollars is the only thing that buys oil.
@_date: 2011-06-20 01:44:22
ahh yes you are right. I should have been more clear and said in there that you should only run your client when you are doing a transaction and shut down your truecrypt client when bitcoin isn't active.

@_date: 2011-06-16 17:40:00
2 problems with that:
1) the markup on hardware isnt as great as you think and so his discount is most likely minimal. Electricity and depreciation cant be ignored otherwise the profit is an illusion (the cake is a lie!)
2) by putting together this rig he has increased the difficulty for all of us, including himself. The system is designed to compensate for this type of activity to a degree. He will make more coins yes, but at a comparatively slower rate.  Again, factor in his initial cost, time to setup + maintenance, and whatnot.
lets not assume that the bitcoin value will depreciate or dare I say settle at $5 each....
If I had that kind of money, I would just buy the bitcoins directly, and let some other fool deal with a mountain of obsolete hardware in 12 months.
@_date: 2011-07-23 15:58:49
Well written, especially the part at the end where you basically say "if you dont like it then piss off".  I've found that when people take that stance it generally means that there is some truth to the opposing idea and they can't defend against it.
My worry is that *unless* there is a real reason to hold the coins then it will become a fad. It doesnt have to be backed by a commodity, but it *does* have to be used by people, which bitcoin isn't.  Everyone is just currency speculating hoping to make a quick buck, and if that continues then the value will definitely drop to zero because everyone will slowly realize there is nothing else to do with them.

I was in agreement with you until you suggested that gold doesn't have value. Then your argument lost all meaning.
A fiat currency is defined as a currency backed by nothing, or "ZERO" as you would say. thats the american dollar, and the pound sterling right now. Fiat currencies backed technically, and literally, by nothing. the only thing keeping them afloat is the army that backs them.
Unlike bitcoins however, there is no army to assure that these dollars get used for things like oil, so we need popular support instead.
Keep in mind that the VAST majority of dollars are actually just digits on a computer; there are far fewer paper dollars then digital dollars in existence. Your dollars are held in digital segments to record each transaction and therefore are not entirely unlike the block chain. The difference is that one will reverse a transaction - the other will not.
I have physical silver and gold, the gold I bought when it was 700 and the silver when it was 13. Check the prices now and tell me how well your precious dollar is doing. Last time I checked it lost over %95 of its value over the past 100 years. You're right - there's no value in "something shiny". 
As for bitcoins?  Its the peoples' response to mass fraud - having a central bank dictate things has bought the world to its knees - at least someone (the guy who invented bitcoins in the first place) is trying to do something about it.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:02:49
remember that bitcoins are supposed to be money that you can use for more than just currency speculation.  Your account wont freeze, just your ability to use the exchange for a short time.

taxes apply to currencies recognized by the government.  When you cash out  your coins to represent the car, thats when you pay the tax.  
think of it like bartering your car for another item that you will sell for actual cash later.  I know that goes against the spirit of bitcoins, but as far as taxation is concerned, thats the best way to view it.
