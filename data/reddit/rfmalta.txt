no... you also need the authenticator (if you enabled it)
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:39:19
I have the seed!!!
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:59:46
yes they are better
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:31:55
Agreed. Thats why Authy is better than google auth.. they back it up for you... and this problem never happens
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:42:25
will help from now on... thks
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:53:20
thats not correct.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:41:42
yeah I will wait... Im waiting since march 22... the okcoin support answered in 1 day!!!
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:00:52
yes I did
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:33:14
Yes, but google should at least warns users to do this right?
I am not taking my responsability away... I'm only warning that the site does not care about it users!!! They should at least answer my e-mail!!
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:48:49
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:19:29
the gauth app never provided me with seed... only greenaddr.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:10:14
It was easy because I provided my e-mail, My IDs, my photo... everything they asked me for!!! Thats how a site should operate... you know nothing about customer satisfaction...
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:45:35
I have the mnemonic and the e-mail to confirm my ID. They should do as btcchina did. They answered right away... no problems at all. EDIT: it was OKCOIN
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:52:48
Well BTCChina reset my auth. they asked me for my IDs and I provided. this is the way to go.
Now what is this file nlocktime .zip?
Edit: it was OKCOIN... not BTCChina
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:07:10
Never said they stole my money!!! Said they dont answer e-mail... they dont give a fuck for their users care
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:29:39
Can you tell how to do it? Didnt find in you link!
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:27:19
the google authenticator app never gave me one... now if you're talking about the GreenAddress mnemonic I have it... but the site also requires the authenticator to release the funds
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:21:24
yeah I have Authy too... much better than google's!!!!
