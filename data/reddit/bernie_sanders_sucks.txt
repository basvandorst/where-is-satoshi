UBS has been doing the same thing since last summer: 
  
They are using their own private version of ethereum.  You're going to see a lot of this in the future where companies want the benefits of a blockchain without a public group of users to worry about.
  
TL;DR: Bitcoin and Ethereum Frontier not affected.

People get this wrong a lot.  The fundamental value of bitcoin is the immutable, distributed and persistent ledger called the blockchain.  The blockchain is a record that cannot be easily erased and I believe it will persist for all of humanity.  I can record a message in the ledger that will persist for as long as there are people.  There is no equivalent. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:05:44
No, because it is a half truth in order to force a perspective and you have fallen for it.  Those were pool operators, not centralized mining operations.  They rely on the participation of the pool participants in order to have the hashing power that they do.  So if they do something controversial, the participants can leave and then they no longer have hashing power.

That is not a fair comparison at all.  You are judged by your contributions on github and you can stay anonymous on github and be carried by your actions.  There is a reason that github isn't being used to manipulate the public opinion, because it can't be without actual contributors weighing in.
  
The [redacted] platform creates the perception of validity by simply labeling a group as verified, you don't need to contribute to have a say and there is no way for us to audit it.  It is a very bad framework to embrace and I am questioning every ounce of its credibility and intention.

I agree.  But I also see the potential for muddy waters when the base gets big enough to get away with it. 
   
Centralizing the consensus process in this way is very dangerous.  It won't even matter that they don't really have majority consensus, they just need to create the illusion of it so that nobody decides to get loud.  Most people are lazy and want to be led but still want to feel like they contributed to the perception of winning or getting what they think they want.

I agree, that's why I am interested in where is going with it.  You can label it all you want, all I care about is the facts of the matter and whether or not his response is warranted based on those facts.  For instance, if he could somehow prove that they colluded to promote fear in order to drive a code change instead of letting the code stand on its own, then maybe he has something.
  
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:28:32
Yes, that is what I am talking about.  You have zero proof if those "verified users" are unique individuals.  That whole framework is easily gamed by those in control.  If we embrace it, we are embracing a flawed system that can be used to co-opt anything they want in this space if it gets traction and people stop questioning it.

@_date: 2016-01-20 22:05:42
Yes, I would recommend storing your bitcoins in a wallet instead of an exchange.  If there is a contentious fork and two chains compete, you will have the flexibility to decide what chain to embrace if you hold the keys rather than an exchange deciding for you.  Also, exchanges have a habit of running off with peoples money or losing it to a hack so this also protects you from that possibility.  If you're using Coinbase or a similar reputable exchange, then leaving them there while you learn about bitcoin and how to handle your coins is a safe bet for now.  I would only send a small amount to test your wallets and workflow at first and then move the rest when you're comfortable.

Bitcoin Classic is nothing right now, they have admitted they will swing towards whatever the "majority wants" and that is the whole point I am making.

I've run IRC leafs on huge networks and had less problems.

I am all for expanding the blocksize. But I will not back [redacted] because they want to put in place a system that can be used to create the illusion of consensus.
[redacted] has proposed that we embrace their system and vote on their platform. This immediately excludes those that wish to participate as anonymously as possible while creating a platform that can be gamed so that a few people have a disproportionate amount of influence over the vote.
Their plan to convince us that one person equals one vote is to verify accounts using a picture with someones username and date on it. This is a terrible idea because it does not actually prove that each of these accounts is a voting individual. I can stand on the corner in any 3rd world country and pay pennies for pictures of people with usernames and dates using diverse backgrounds and then I have more than one vote. This is just one simple example of how it can be gamed. If they aren't transparent with user data, they don't even need to do that, they can just create sockpuppet accounts and label them as verified.
Someone said the other day that we are not voting on a block increase, that we are voting on a framework for consensus and whatever framework manages to overcome core and push a fork, will have immense power going forward, it will have a network affect that is incredibly difficult to overcome and that is extremely dangerous for us.
I see [redacted] as a potential power grab. Stay alert and question everyone.

The flaw is that if you use the same exchange, you may end up with some or all of your original coins when you go back to BTC and they also have a record of all of this.  You need to spread it out across multiple platforms.  So if you have access to kraken, you could convert your btc to litecoin, send the litecoin to shapeshift.io and convert back to BTC.  I think shapeshift.io has committed to not tracking, but not sure about that.

Most people admit that a change to the blocksize capacity needs to happen at some point in the future, but we are not agreeing on the solution.  In addition to that you have efforts to collect and contain the voice under a centralized platform.  There's a lot happening and it is all happening because bitcoin has incredible potential and it appears that it will be extremely powerful in the future if it succeeds and you hold some or hold power over the community or parts of it.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:06:46
I would still be involved.  I did not get involved because I want bitcoin to become something more than what it already is, because it is already something very valuable to everyone.  Bitcoin is an example.  It is an example of how things can be different and it shows plainly how our current system is rigged.  It is a constant reminder that our current markets favor the big players and not the little people.  That anyone can buy in and have an interest in the system.  It is a reminder that rigged markets need to be controlled and sometimes shut down to maintain control while bitcoin hums along 24/7, 365 days a year without stopping to take a breath.  By merely being an example, it shows how antiquated our current systems are and presses for change.
  
This is why people want it to fail, so that this example is no longer a thorn in their side.  They want to point at it after it has failed and say "look at what happens when you try to do what we do".  As long as bitcoin continues to be an example, it will precipitate change whether bitcoin itself changes or not.

This just isn't how the world works.  In the real world, you can convince a lot of people to do something by just making it look like other people want it.  People are easily manipulated and it happens every day around here.  I expect it will happen with any centralized voting platform that steers bitcoin development because there is so much on the line.  Not just the billions invested in it, but the threat it creates to the establishment and probably a hundred other reasons that I haven't thought of.
   
The real kicker here is that you must know this if you aren't stupid and I don't think you are, so it makes me question your motives even more.  Why would anyone prop up a flawed system if they don't have to or when it threatens to undermine something they care about?  Money and power comes to mind as the obvious first choice.

I am all for expanding the blocksize.  But I will not back Bitcoin Classic because they want to put in place a system that can be used to create the illusion of consensus.
  
Bitcoin Classic has proposed that we embrace their system and vote on their platform.  This immediately excludes those that wish to participate as anonymously as possible while creating a platform that can be gamed so that a few people have a disproportionate amount of influence over the vote.
  
Their plan to convince us that one person equals one vote is to verify accounts using a picture with someones username and date on it.  This is a terrible idea because it does not actually prove that each of these accounts is a voting individual.  I can stand on the corner in any 3rd world country and pay pennies for pictures of people with usernames and dates using diverse backgrounds and then I have more than one vote.  This is just one simple example of how it can be gamed.  If they aren't transparent with user data, they don't even need to do that, they can just create sockpuppet accounts and label them as verified.
  
Someone said the other day that we are not voting on a block increase, that we are voting on a framework for consensus and whatever framework manages to overcome core and push a fork, will have immense power going forward, it will have a network affect that is incredibly difficult to overcome and that is extremely dangerous for us.
  
I see Bitcoin Classic as a potential power grab.  Stay alert and question everyone.
  
EDIT: And now I'm being vote brigaded.  Anyone want to show me why their consensus framework is not flawed?
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:42:53
This can't be right, I was told bitcoin is dying and nobody uses it.  Must be one person spamming the network then...
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:57:11
If the majority wants it, there is nothing an anyone can do to stop it.  But it is not at all clear that the majority wants it and the framework being put forth for us to embrace centralizes consensus and power on a platform that can be used to influence how consensus is perceived.
  
Please stop framing this like the miners are already in majority agreement when that is not at all clear.
  
We have seen a few pool operators with large amounts of hashing power say that they agree, but until they actually change the software their pool uses, we won't know if their pool participants agree.
  
So for now it is nothing but marketing and many are falling for it simply based on perception.  
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:49:33
You're going to have to show why the framework can't be gamed to force change.  Calling it FUD does nothing to disprove my points.

A couple of problems:
  
- This will monetarily incentivize attacks on whoever the committer is because people want to get paid.
  
- People will write code just to get paid so we will end up with a lot of shit that no one asked for.
  
- Who will decide the structure of payout?  Good luck just getting passed this, but if you happen to pull it off, see points  and

Stop bringing up the no code as any kind of argument.  It is just a matter of time before this top argument is used to announce software that you should immediately download and keep running so you can be important.

Right.  But keep in mind that a mixer that does not adjust its behavior with each use will create a pattern that can be identified by a 3rd party like Circle.  Whether they take action on that I don't know.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:57:34
They can't force people to download and run the software.  The changes they make don't just get pushed out to production automatically.  People review and decide to accept it or not and then actively install the latest version and use it.  Any changes that are not in the interest of the majority will get no where.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:25:33
No, this is bullshit without proof.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:16:03
It was demonstrated last year that it is trivial to fill up the mempool to slow down confirmations and make the opposite argument you just made.  Be careful how much weight you put behind this argument.

Nothing is stopping me and I do participate.  But my participation and the participation of people like me can be overcome if you can centralize consensus under one platform and use it to convince a majority to run software, it won't matter what their technical level is.
   


  
It centralizes consensus on a platform that can be gamed, the "bigger" it is perceived the more power it has over the masses and their ability to question.  The BIP means nothing because the platform will embrace whatever the "majority" agrees on and since it is a centralized platform for consensus, you just need to create the illusion of a majority.
  


  
Again, it does centralize power under a centralized framework for consensus that can be gamed.

You say this and then you go on to blame Core for anything that happens or does not happen, they literally cannot win according to you.  If they force a contentious fork, they will lose because the other side will start lobbying "it is not enough" and the power grab will continue.  If they do nothing and someone else forces a contentious fork it is their fault and you will blame core.

I think you're not comprehending what Paul is trying to do here.  He is accusing them of appealing to emotion to drive code changes and he is threatening to give them a dose of their own medicine.  Whether you agree with his approach should not be the topic of discussion.  The topic should be "is he right that they are trying to appeal to emotion to drive code change" and "what *facts* does he have that can be used to smear them".  I'm throwing some popcorn in the microwave just in case.

You just need the private key.  You'll notice and option to encrypt the wallet and I would encourage you to play around with that to understand how it works, it offers a lot of flexibility with cold storage and transporting wallets.  Definitely play around with sending small amounts.  Your money lives on the blockchain and it is distributed all over the world.  You need the private key and an internet connection to make a transaction once you have funds at an address.

If Satoshi created bitcoin at a university using federal grant money, what would that mean to his ownership rights to bitcoin and the private keys generated during that process?
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:07:41
I would sandbox everything and make sure I am not re-using addresses.  If I was going to do this, I would buy coins anonymously and have them sent to a fresh address that I generated on my own using one of the many wallet tools that you can run offline.  From there I would use a wallet to sweep and send to mixer, a wallet that I only use for that and that does not re-use addresses.  The mixed coins would be sent to yet another wallet that I use to spend and again, no re-using addresses.
note:  The reason I wouldn't have the person I buy from send directly to the mixer is because this way I can say for sure that I did not recieve them as opposed to them claiming the wallet(mixer) is broken.  And also as a courtesy because I don't want to mess up their game by having them send directly to a mixer.

Yes, it is contentious because the numbers don't reflect that.  I and the few people I know who run nodes are running core nodes and we are happy with the diligence they are doing in reviewing paths forward.  Sorry if it isn't quick enough or what you want.  But I strongly disagree that a majority in "the community" have lost faith and judging by the number of nodes over the course of the discussion, the majority agrees with me too.
  


   
That's just marketing until they act.  Some of that hashing power is from pools, so until they change the pool software or try to and we see what the members of the pool think, it is nothing more than talk.  And that talk has changed over the last few days too.
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:42:42
You really shouldn't be investing based on what you read on reddit.  It's important to weigh it, but it's also important to remember how easily this platform is gamed and used for promotion.  Look at my username for a nice reminder, it is a product of said marketing.
