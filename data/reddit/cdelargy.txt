Really appreciate your effort to debate this issue. Thanks.
I respectfully disagree that there's an IOU involved. BitGold represents one ounce of gold worth of bitshares. Always. That value is enforced on the blockchain. There is no party that is owing anything. When the contracts are unwound, each party receives the appropriate amount of bitshares as entitled by their contract as enforced on the chain. For this reason, the assets are not IOUs (which is a promise from a third party to do something at a later date), but fungible CFDs that track the underlying asset subject to a spread based on the market demand.
We both agree coinapult "simplifies" certain transactions but to say that it introduces stability to bitcoin is naive (it is a high-priced liquidity provider working with exchanges). To say that it doesn't matter what country is involved is absurd. Read Coinapult's terms:


To that end, you may also consider that you waive all rights to collect damages if they decide to not honor their IOUs:

Dollars themselves are created by banks by issuing them based on taking ownership of some form of collateral. They are not USD-based themselves.
With bitshares, the collateral for BitUSD is btsx. When they are created, the buyer locks in 100% collateral and the seller locks in 200% collateral. This allows the buyer of bitUSD to eliminate volatility vs USD and the seller to gain 2x leverage vs USD. If at any time there is such volatility as to require a margin call, the appropriate party is liquidated and positions are maintained. This is the same thing that any true CFD agent does, but it's implemented in the same way that bitcoin does for governing transactions.

A bitshares delegate performs their job by signing their blocks with their private key. If they sign two blocks that conflict with the same key, that would be incontrovertible evidence that they should be fired.
Voting out is the same as voting in- delegates are always the top 101 voted via the blockchain's record of votes by shareholders. So it is the responsibility of the shareholders to appoint and administer which delegates will verify and enter tx into the blockchain.
The extent to which a bad delegate could harm the bitshares blockchain is to perform a temporary (~10 seconds) DOS attack by withholding transactions (commonly done by bitcoin pools over 10 minute rounds). Also, since price feeds are certified by delegates, they can add outliers in the price feed, which could cause disruptions if a majority of delegates collude to manipulate the price. This type of collusion is more likely to occur via the centralized exchanges entering fake orders to manipulate the exchange value of the assets traded on bitshares.

Bitcoin doesn't encompass the economic activity of the world. Bitcoins are like shares in a money transfer and asset registry company, which only accepts shares of the company in exchange for its services.

An IOU is not the same as a digital asset. This was my point in explaining the difference. Exchanging bitcoins for IOUs is not the same as hedging via buying bitUSD, bitGold. As a most trivial example: I cannot send somebody gold via coinapult. I can send bitGold via bitshares.

For a merchant that doesn't have the resources to provide bitcoin-specific customer support, using a merchant processor that guarantees instant payments is a reasoned trade-off.
Having to deal with refund transactions, stuck transactions, payment addresses, etc, can be quite difficult. If a merchant has simple interfaces and guarantees about finality through a third party, they don't have to worry about understanding and applying the appropriate policies.
Any merchant can accept bitcoin by running a bitcoin full node and generating addresses, running a watch only client, and choosing a price feed to generate payment requests. Interfacing with fiat is where it gets real complicated, real fast.
But your original point stands, just hope you might want some small insights from somebody who has built and maintained a traditional payments platform.

The completely obvious criticism of this proposal is that it would allow any miners who wanted to increase the block size to create their own transactions to maximize the data included in a block, allowing future increases to become larger.

What is the point of these hypothetical scenarios?
The issue at hand is whether or not to deprecate the existing protocol and replace it with another, incompatible version (a block size hard fork) or to use an approach to extend Bitcoin's functionality using an existing-client-compatible approach.
If for some reason we did have a 100KB block limit, the rationale to choose one or the other would be the same.

I think everyone with technical experience with Bitcoin, especially those that followed development of the previous soft-fork upgrades (BIP66, BIP34, BIP16, output overflow bug enforcement, OP_code deprecation, 1MB block limit, etc) is aware that these changes were implemented with wide support from users, miners and developers.
It is at least a structural improvement in discourse that we can identify Olivier's errors in historical knowledge, combined with a confusion related to soft fork dynamics that should enable us to help him understand his errors.

Erik, your use of Frederic Bastiat is indicative of an extremely surface-level understanding of his views on economics.


Frederic Bastiat, Economic Harmonies, pg 208
Bastiat's words apply to anyone aiming to take on the role of would-be-central-planner-of-Bitcoin. Attempting to reduce the costs (pains) of use of a precious and scarce resource that is only maintainable through competitive forces by abandoning its central property of censorship resistance via peer-to-peer validation, will fail.
Suggesting that we're not going to get the users for services which cannot compete with the quite-real-and-obviously-important-today uses of Bitcoin as digital cash, who are quite-obviously-and-verifiably spending fees to access Bitcoin's network, is an offense to Bastiat's views.
Increasing the block size (abandoning the consensus parameters that Bitcoin has evolved to possess) in order to reduce the pain that these supposed new use cases hope to offer is nonsense, and your use of an imaginary "parable" does not amount to a lesson in game theory as your article's title suggests. It is an example of your confused, pseudo-intellectual grasping of "you'd never know what we could have unless we hard fork out limits!" and is persuasive to very few who actually use Bitcoin for the purposes that it was transparently designed to provide. If you can't afford to use it, look for an alternative. Just do not claim that use of an alternative is evidence of failure.

A website using a single periodic transaction to timestamp their state, as documented using a merkle tree doesn't need to be sidechained.

Nice. u/gillenium actually asked us for feedback on the price model that was originally pointing to $400, see

I don't mean to sound pedantic, but a pretty big benefit of bitUSD over "actual dollars" is the ability to send bitUSD to anyone, instantly for less half of a cent in fees, with no need for any third party to manage the exchange rate risk for you.
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:02:27
The debate is not "is there a centralized service that can do the same thing" its is if the decentralized system offers any benefits. Censorship resistance (the ability to use it without a third party's consent) is not offered by the centralized services.
As for merchant acceptance, I agree the low liquidity of Bitshares (~100-200k USD per day) means it is not competitive right now.


AFAIK, DPOS requires that 101 delegates produce the blockchain, with 51 (elected) delegates needed to perform a hijacking style attack (potential double-spending, market manipulation, etc). 50% of bitcoin mining power is directed by 4 entities. Both could be attacked!
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:44:47
Miners include a transaction in their blocks known as the coinbase which pays themselves the reward and fees. Because miners have different receiving addresses, they generate different blocks as a result.
Validation of blocks and mining is usually performed in parallel. Often pools will blindly (prior to validation) build on a new block in order not to waste hashpower, but this is risky. This is part of the reason that increasing block size is dangerous (bigger block, more miners mining on unvalidated blocks for longer).

Some strong news along with a few big buyers could get us there, but I imagine a lot of bitcoin will trade before we reach there. Anything less, and I expect we'll be falling back to current levels or further down to the $80 support zone.

Promising to pay interest and not having the cash to cover it is not fractional reserve, nor is it really an issue bitcoin would have any impact on.
Bitcoin DOES prevent FRB because there is no way to send an address a bitcoin without taking it from another address, therefore, there's no possibility of "fractionality", i.e., keeping only a fraction of lent amounts in reserve.

investments constitute an investment of money. It is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.

There is no encryption in bitcoin, only cryptographic hashing. The blockchain stores the transaction in a block that says "take X from alice's address and let the address bob owns spend it".
The way this is possible is because the addresses are the public keys, which are enough to verify a transaction but not to make one.

You inspired me to figure the daily rate as well:
Starting from January 1st, $13.50/btc, 112 days at 2.025% growth yields $127.50/btc.
Using the same amount and projecting to 12/2/2013 yields $11,369.79/btc. I'm not holding my breath :-)
Using 1% growth per day til 12/2/2013 gets us to $1,184.40/btc. 1% a day is 7.2% per week or ~35% per month. It's not likely that we could maintain a steady growth rate of 1% per day especially for 200 straight days, but I think it's possible we could see a few periods of hyper-growth provide a catch up to meet this eventual goal by the end of 2013.

What percentage of the outstanding bitcoins do you think are available on exchanges? MtGox has about 100K BTC on the order books. Maybe there's another 2x that on other exchanges order books and then double that in the exchanges' wallets, (100K * 3 * 2 = 600K) then given that there are 11M bitcoins issued that's only about 5.45% of all bitcoins. Good luck cornering the market via exchanges!

This is why economists without knowledge of bitcoin will always fail when attacking it. They'll just assume it works like other systems, without bothering to investigate why we say "bitcoin is decentralized".
There are no issuers of bitcoin. Any user may choose to use any blockchain they want, but if you want it to be useful to more than yourself you'll choose to use the longest chain, which is what most users agree is the proper account of who has what.
Furthermore, there are no promises in bitcoin, only virtual ledger entries devoid of counter-party risk.
@_date: 2013-08-07 04:27:53
OK, but let's consider this beyond tax reporting. The SEC is setting a precedent that will perhaps extend to the requirement of bitcoin denominated stocks to officially register as foreign private issuers, opening the door again to the CFTC to regulate any futures and exchanges, and raise exceptions in regulators minds related to the bitcoin ETF. Do you think these are concerns?

Agreed- and don't discount the next block reward halving (we're about 18% through the 25BTC blocks already). There is about 4.3 million bitcoins that will be released between now and then (which will probably occur in September or October of 2016).
If we consider the current ~$90 price of bitcoin, that new supply allows for around than $388,000,000 equivalent in monetary base growth. That's big, but if the key hypotheses related to bitcoin's growth continue to be proven true I imagine we'll see more than $100M per year coming to bitcoin.
After the block reward drop, inflation drops down to 4% ( Certainly we can expect bitcoin's growth to outpace 4% annual growth for the rest of its life.

I also have had many many problems with coinbase and sending transactions. Many of them are delayed 24 hours and more. Support usually responds within 3-5 days so it is completely unhelpful.

Such a shame, since I have already built a few things on their API that I'd love to release but I can't do it knowing their failures in support and providing any reasonable quality of service.

Agreed. The BoA/ML report was not very well done in my opinion. It was a rough first stab using comparables with way too many magic numbers.
Wedbush's report was shorter, clearer and had a much more logical valuation model: 
They even give a handy table so you can calculate fair value based on time to achieve % peak penetration of demand. I think the case for 5 years away from 10% of the listed demand is a reasonable bull case and that yields $20K 1-year implied value.

Here is the long term historical chart for bitcoin price in USD:
The last time that we had a media hype cycle followed by a decline in price was in 2011. Back then there was much less of a legal framework for building businesses on, few merchants were accepting bitcoin and those that did mostly got burned. Ultimately, it took about 6 months for the fallout from the hype to clear and a new minimum price to get solidified.
If we assume that we're in a similar media-fueled hype cycle, then we can guess that the bottom won't come until the people who were brought into bitcoin trading during the last few months will capitulate and sell into the lows or just give up with trading and go in for the long-haul. This could be sooner or later than it was in 2011 but I think because of the underlying regulatory and business landscape for bitcoin is so much improved since 2011 that it will likely turn around faster- but government intervention or a major technical vulnerability could weaken the price beyond previous lows. Such is investment risk.
Long term? Anybody's guess really. A lot of people are building things that will necessitate the expansion of the wealth represented by bitcoin, so the price will have to go up in order for all of us to be using it to store more of our wealth, make more of our purchases, etc. If you assume we are beginning to reach the stage where growth is stable exponential (the early middle on the S-curve) then we should expect the log graph to continue in a linear fashion, bounded somewhat by the previous highs and lows.
My guesses are that bitcoins will stay between ~$60 and $180 in the next year, possibly creeping outside that range around influential news events. In the next 2 years we'll start seeing an approach with parity with gold, currently around $1400/oz. Beyond that? Somewhere between $1 and $10,000, and if the USD loses its status as world reserve currency, well, the sky is the limit.

Investors who wanted gold when and where there was no efficient gold market would have to mine it themselves.

Assuming you can only buy from one place at a time, you'd probably start with Mt. Gox. If you were willing to pay up to $1000 per bitcoin, you could buy 68,702 coins for a total price of $9,457,500. There are less than 2,500 coins available for more than that, and they are priced a lot higher than $1,000 each.
So those ~70K coins you could buy would then represent about 0.6% of the total ~10.9M coins in existence. The sum value at $1000 each would mean the "market cap" of bitcoin would be about $10,900,000,000 or ~11B, more than a 10x increase immediately.
You'd see everybody who owned the other 99.4% of the coins thinking about taking some profits at that point, I'm pretty sure :-)

All bitcoins in existence are worth roughly 3% of the current monthly printing rate, so, still pretty small potatoes for them.

Thanks for contributing some rational thought, I agree that the "real" value of bitcoin is not reflected in the exchange rate.
Of note: paypal does more than half of its business processing credit cards, about a quarter in stored value transactions and the rest in ACH or electronic bank transfers. I don't think these numbers are publicly disclosed by paypal so they may be off a bit.
I like your analysis, but want to contribute that I believe that it is unlikely that bitcoin will displace paypal's credit card transaction volume directly, as there are distinct individual consumer advantages for cards (some fraud protection, rewards, credit line, etc). I do believe there's a fairly strong case for the stored balance and ACH competition from bitcoin, especially in niches where paypal can't compete effectively (global payments, remittances, grey market goods, digital services with low margins).

Your key argument seems to be that because the average transactions per user is decreasing, that proves that the economy is failing?
You may want to consider that the average user used to be a highly experienced, passionate user of bitcoin (likely that has been around for years) and now the average user has 1-3 months of experience with bitcoin. These new users don't transact as often. It's not a surprise!

It depends on your network connection and how quickly other nodes send you the blocks.
Really though, the money doesn't go anywhere, the transaction that allows you to spend the bitcoins is just either in a block your computer has sync'ed or it's not.
Most likely it will be a while, say 10-60 minutes, before you get synchronized with the network.

I think you *can* think of it that way if you choose to, especially if your strategy isn't to mine and hold bitcoin. If you bought a miner with USD and plan to sell all proceeds for USD there are obviously disadvantages to thinking this way, as you're exposed to much of the risk with less of the reward.
tl;dr: With mining you don't have to hold bitcoin to gain exposure to the rewards of price appreciation.

The general form of the counter argument to infinite copycoins is essentially the concept of the network effect. The largest network is the most useful, so it attracts the most usage. Certainly there is room in the universe for more than one bitcoin-like currency, but the switching costs need to be outweighed by the benefits for individuals to want to use alternatives. I'll be happy to use altcoins when they provide something unique and useful that bitcoin can't copy.

My advice would be to find something you would enjoy doing that would allow you to earn a steady income and provide benefits, enough to cover basic needs.
My assumption is that we're not going to stay at current price levels for more than about a year, so I wouldn't worry too deeply about making the right choice right away. A price move of 2-3X to the upside would probably seal the deal for people like you, whereas 50% drop would probably make you thankful that you held on to the job.
Picking a day a few months from now as a tentative quit date would allow you to do some long range planning, work out an early retirement style budget and pull the trigger if things work out.

With the utmost respect, you'll probably need a better pitch if you want to attract investment. A partnership requires shared benefit, and building a bitcoin business requires engineering.

Many redditors here will try to explain to you why the "shutdown" of bitcoin is impossible or improbable, but I think most rational people would admit there's at least a chance of events or restrictive spying that would cause bitcoin to be admonished in the USA, and possibly some other major world countries.
However, if you assign this a 50% chance (for the sake of argument), you assume that the potential future value of bitcoin would be reduced by 75% as a result, that bitcoin would achieve a future value of $3,736,842 (via [this future value calculator]( and using these numbers you calculate whether the odds are in your favor at a valuation of $200 per bitcoin:
(3736842/200) x .5 x .25 = 2335.52625 times in your favor.
That means you can adjust your assumptions to be 2000 times more negative about the outcome and still it would make sense to bet on bitcoin.
Does that convince you that bitcoin is not yet "over"?

Intrinsic value is not a term I used, as it is poorly defined. Fair value is defined via Wikipedia as "In accounting and economics, fair value is a rational and unbiased estimate of the potential market price of a good, service, or asset."
We all do our best to figure out how we can be unbiased, but if you say bitcoin's value is zero then you're using de facto bias of excluding any potential for future value.

Good question.
The "change" address in a typical address works as such. When Jeff was paying, his wallet took an input with X bitcoins, and sent the amount (A) to the recipient and the remainder, X-A to the change address.
If he accidentally sent 0.2 instead of 0.02 then he needed the other party to send back 0.18 in a new transaction (with their own change returning X-0.18).

There are two principal vehicles for bitcoin investment (i.e. not income generating businesses, but strict currency investments):
1. Direct bitcoin purchase. Like buying gold bullion, there is absolute certainty about how many you will have.
2. Investing in hash power (buying miners, mining contracts, etc). This  gives you a statistical probability of future bitcoin based on network growth.
A lot of investment is going into  now, which will get more and more competitive. Naturally, the smart money will pull away from investments in mining as the returns drop, and will likely partially return to direct purchase of bitcoin.
As this occurs, the relative mining income will rise, and we'll likely see the ratio of investment in each wobble around a general equilibrium that balances risk and cost.
A growing proportion of monetary investment going into mining will partially redirect as buying bitcoin directly becomes more financially appealing to more investors.

The most common "flaw" I see in common conceptions about bitcoin is that bitcoin ought to adhere to a particular monetary policy.

If your ultimate aim is to learn more about bitcoin, mining is a reasonable way to do it. You can buy a USB miner on Amazon for less than $10, but it might never make $10 worth of bitcoins in its life, so be weary of any aspirations for getting rich quick by buying a miner (or a contract).
Mining contracts are the worst of both worlds- risk of no return, risk of bitcoin dropping in value, etc.
If you want to speculate on the future value of bitcoin, buying it is the most effective way to do so.

I disagree. At the very least there will be financial auditing requirements which will indirectly create delivery related costs. By specifying their thresholds of basket redeemability the fund is choosing tradeoffs. Attributing this choice as an exclusionary tactic ignores the fact that the Winkelvii have voluntarily chosen to allow small incremental investments (0.2 btc) but not to act in a manner more suitable for an exchange business.
I'd be more upset if they were going to claim that small baskets should be redeemable as it would be a huge challenge from a compliance, risk and marketing standpoint.

Yes, however in order for the SEC to have a valid claim, the Supreme court case law of [SEC v. W. J.

Bitcoin exchanges operate like markets- just like gas stations have different prices for gasoline, some reflect convenience, quality and service.
In the case of mtgox, the USD denominated price is higher because if you have USD there, the best way to "get it out" is to buy bitcoin and transfer it that way.
In the case of bitstamp (and by proxy, coinbase) the price is lower because merchants sell their bitcoin for USD there. Supply and demand at work.

Currencies issued by banks and other private institutions can be destroyed by prohibiting their use and/or convertibility. I can see how you could impede some of the convertibility of Bitcoin, but to suggest that it can be done across the globe at all times is absurd. There's a cost one has to pay for totalitarian control and with the incentive system embedded in Bitcoin I don't think it would be feasible.

Partially agreed- the one major issue that I think puts me on the fence on whether or not they're technically in violation of the California MTA, is how it defines the two key terms "money" and "money transmission":










Source: [Section 2003 of the California MTA](
Bitcoin doesn't meet their definition of money, so it would be a stretch to consider bitcoin a payment instrument. Coinbase doesn't issue a store of monetary value as defined, but if one considers bitcoin as a method of transmitting money (which is what the DHS seems to have done in their legal backflip to seize the mtgox/dwolla bank accounts) then it might fit on the third definition. Even in that case I bet there's a good chance of winning a defense on the basis of the  given the clear definition of "money".

I'll assume you're a smart 5 year old :-)
If you take all the people at an exchange who want to buy and all the people who want to sell and let all of the ones who find an acceptable offer trade with eachother, you're left with two groups of people; the buyers who weren't willing to pay enough to buy any, plus the sellers who wanted too much to find a buyer. The price at which the last trade took place is the market price, and as time goes on, it changes as different people change their mind about how much they want to pay.

Yes, having another coin with a separate blockchain would enable laundering, however, other schemes such as trustless mixing can do it cheaper and more safely (without needing a third party).
The main benefit I can see is that if there was a cataclysmic failure of bitcoin and we still needed to transfer money, it would be nice if there was something that could quickly scale up to the demand.

There's just not enough eyeballs on scrypt to trust it.
SHA-256 is well-known and many systems other than bitcoin rely on its integrity. Scrypt is a proposal that didn't really go anywhere.
Further, most folks that like scrypt seem to because it has large memory needs compared to SHA-256. That means that it delays and increases the cost of development of ASICs, but it doesn't fundamentally change the game. Just as centralization of mining has increased as the complexity of bitcoin miners has increased, litecoin will follow, at a higher marginal cost, for lower marginal benefits. I don't think that will mean it won't fail, just that it will be pretty lame that people would invest so much capital into an algorithm that may be totally flawed.

Here's some ideas, feel free to borrow and extend:
Do some back of the envelope math on how much companies/individuals would save by using bitcoin over alternatives. Sending an international wire transfer? Purchasing precious metals? Have to collect payments from customers over the internet that are at high risk for chargebacks? Pick one or two that resonate and give concrete examples. Extrapolate savings for the target market.
Redirect any questions about price to the fact that the volatility reflects disagreement between buyers and sellers, and that the market is forming. Cite opportunity for futures markets to provide stability to businesses who are not ready to manage complex foreign exchange risks.
Finally, I'd suggest stressing the network effect. Just like the first telephones had less usefulness because of the lack of other telephones, as service providers improve the ease of use of the system, more users will realize its advantages and the value of the system increases as more people are willing to transact in bitcoin.
Lastly, there's opportunities for everyone to participate no matter how little you think you can contribute. Tell them that they can buy $5 worth of bitcoin for only $0.20 in fees!

The classic example is the telephone. The more people who own telephones, the more valuable the telephone is to each owner.

I'm not sure I really understand why you would say something can be "seedless" and "deterministic" as those terms seem to be pretty contradictory.
I'm fairly certain that you could create a "removable seed" wallet using RSA PKI but it would be slow and storing the private keys would be relatively expensive in terms of storage.
Additionally, because the space of valid RSA keys is so much smaller than EC keys, the seed would have to account for this and be WAY bigger. Instead of using a sentence as a passkey, you might need a page of text.

Hi Andreas, thought you did a great job. Focusing on principles provides a great way to look into the long term future of bitcoin without getting distracted by the political sideshows.
Here's a few ideas that I think might be interesting to consider:
* It would be useful to understand exactly how bitcoin may provide a stabilizing and/or enriching influence in countries where the citizens face strong capital controls, currency devaluation and wild swings in exchange rates. By looking back and using historical data one could construct example cases of workers and merchants who use bitcoin as a store of value and medium of exchange (at say .1%, 1% and 10% of their financial activity) and compare them with their counterparts who abstain from participating in the bitcoin economy. Who does better by how much, in which situations? Is there a strong possibility for a feedback loop?
* What is the potential for viral growth of bitcoin in numeric terms during a currency crisis? Is there hope for a slow growth of bitcoin or will it be entirely eclipsed by large economies collapsing and turning to bitcoin as a salve? What factors will separate some countries and nonpolitical jurisdictions to become fast adopters vs slow adopters?

What the speaker probably would point out is that RSA keys, because they must be very large pairs of prime numbers, are much more expensive to generate (you couldn't necessarily supply everybody ever with as many addresses as they'd need to perform each transaction) and much more costly to store (ECDSA keys are more than 10x smaller for the same level of protection) and there are strong implications for size of messages in the block chain, as you may have recently noticed.
