Buy BCH

Like banks? The good news is that we're doing the slow ACH transfers to do the fast crypto transfers, and this is one last bank charge before that money tunnels out and escapes the whole predatory system. We're getting there.

I bet a bitcoin that some of his quotes in here will be requoted repeatedly in a few years, like, "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor." or "Read my lips, no new taxes." or "I did not sleep with that women."

Big buy signal. Why? Because banks feel threatened. Why? Because bitcoin (bch) eliminates the need for these parasite middlemen.   
Certainly, speculative exuberance has occurred, but the core tech.... look at it Dimon. Many dismiss crypto outright and won't. But Satoshi solved the "Byzantine Generals" problem.  The blockchain allows people to transmit value peer-to-peer without middlemen.  Without banks.   
I bet a bitcoin that Dimon's quotes here will be like "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor." Or, "I did not have sexual relations with that women." Or, to be fair, "Read my lips, no new taxes."  He even insults his daughter.    
Bitcoin is worth 4 times more than it was in December.  Remind me in January 2018.  My guess, bitcoin is worth $10,000.

Could the BCH price be dropping because people are selling BCH to buy BTC to get the double coins from the (possible) Bitcoin Gold and segwit2x forks?

Got robbed by the USG or BTC-E operator Vinnik? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:59:03
I agree. The USG's involvement is bad and could negatively impact honest actors using BTC-e in a free market.  But should the government have stepped in, or anyone with the ability to do so, if BTC-e was negatively (criminally) impacting honest actors worse, by stealing and laundering crypto through BTC-e? Looks like Vinnik may have been doing this, and IF SO, which is worse, USG interference or keeping your money in a corrupt, criminal exchange? USG interference may NOT be the best of two sub-optimal choices. I don't know. We need more facts on what BTC-e and Vinnik did, if anything - but my GUESS is the USG has something concrete.

A good thing? Finding the Mt. Gox criminals and money: 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:24:44
A good thing? America, world police, finds and prosecutes the Mt. Gox hacker(s) (since nobody else will / can), freezes BTC-e during this process, then (eventually) returns some stolen Mt. Gox BTC and releases user's funds after cleaning up the mess? Bring the hate, and maybe this theory is wrong, but if the USG shut down BTC-E, it's because they got concrete evidence on them for something. The users may be collateral damage.
