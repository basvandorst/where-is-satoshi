Oh okay. Can I ask why? What’s different from this address than from a ledger wallet address?
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:44:27
I’d like to know this too please.

Scam was probably the wrong word, but I have respect for bcash. but what turned me against it is when developers deliberately changed the name of Bcash to say they were “bitcoin (no cash at the end)” causing a lot of (alleged) new users to send BTC to a BCH wallet just due to them not realizing they sent to the wrong “bitcoin”, never to get back their money. In a way for me if they mess with someone else’s money in a misleading way they are practically messing with my money as well.

Bitcoin is like America, in that they both faked going to the moon.

I also believe a few separate google play wallets did also, but I could be wrong.

At the end of the day Reddit isn’t what drives bitcoin forward, I know your not dumb to see that. There’s good discussions on the subreddit, but in actuality it’s just guys and girls just talking about what were interested in. This isn’t an economic journal. we’re all like friends that likes to gossip and rant about the other people/ projects, and where we would like to see bitcoin continue grow towards. Butttttttt bcash is still a scam.

Well those are “debit cards”, this is a credit card.  Idk I’ve been looking to get my first credit card to start building my credit, but as a college student not having fees seems really appealing. I know citi offers a card similar, but I don’t think citi would let me open a card like that since I’m just starting and only have rent on my credit. Also being a fanboy that’s a plus. But all depends if they would accept me I doubt it though. 
Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

It’s cool, at first glance I thought he was too.

I’m still a noob on some things. What are futures exactly? I’ve seen and heard that term being thrown around but I’m not sure what they are. If you don’t mind could you explain what futures are. Or just link me some links I guess. Thank you man. Sorry for being a noob.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:06:10
Yeah I’ve some sources on that. Just didn’t have time to read them/ slipped my mind to look them back up and read them. This post is really just thought from reading a few post in another subreddit.

As I said at the end I’m really just seeing if anyone else has changed their view on bitcoin cash. Kinda just getting some of an incentive to see if really want to do the research or not. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:09:16
Sigh.

All my adult life. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:19:07
No I’m not complaining I’m just wondering. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:15:47
Yeah I get it, I saw that many supports were claiming that bitcoin cash still has lower fees than bitcoin. But the only reason I could think of why is because not as many people use bitcoin cash. And I think now bitcoin has lower fees that bitcoin cash so, their point isn’t even valid any ore.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:21:00
Yeah I figured. Just saw a “big” spike just wanted to see what others think about it. I know it’s nothing big. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:15:33
I don’t believe he ‘s wearing a mask.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:38:55
Done.

Didn’t someone prove that one of those pictures are fake if not both of them? Your message still stands, but still.
