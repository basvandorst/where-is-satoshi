1. You can probably do this yourself right now if you wanted. Get a wordpress installation that you can install the Coinbase tip button on, then set up a type of secure playback with the tip button right next to it and then try to spam that link everywhere.
2. Find out a way to help other artists and potentially start a company :)

It is a shared group of how much money each person has which can't be broken in to or changed for bad wants. Every person who uses this stuff agrees with each other every 10 minutes, using computers. No new money can be added by anyone. You can send any small part of money for things that you could not before over the computer. I could send you money using your phone without using the normal money holding people, just straight from you to me.

I made a business card that I hand out. I sell consulting after a free 15 minutes. It has everything they need to know to get started and the consulting is if they need help to get up and running. I'll share the files if people want them :) It's way easy to just hand them a business card with my email on it!

I just started and I have only given out a couple to businesses that know me. I've had a lot of good conversations so far but nothing else, but it's only been 2 days since I've printed them. I have a feeling like it won't be a tonne of money, at least at the beginning but the next bubble event could change my mind. I'm also planning on buying something from the businesses for probably half of my rate that I collect so they have a first sale. I don't have a website yet for it but I will be making a subdomain for it. I'm planning on drawing up some standard contracts from what lawyers and hedge funds use for protection, and I'm thinking of charging a lot to instil confidence and perhaps they'll just research it themselves and get excited. 
I have a couple corporate clients already for my computer business, so I can sell; but it's going to start slow.

This is a terrible idea, part of the reason why Bitcoin is wonderful is that it is unable to have chargebacks. How about just making a hot wallet and filling it up once a month, or just securing you private key?

"Dark Market costs Cops lives." "Dark Market a haven for criminals?" or "Police inspect Open Bazaar for bad actors". Apple, Zappos, etc don't have a direct negative connotation from the start. People who don't know better still know what Dark Market means, it means untaxible to a lot of people. Much like black market. I'm just thinking it's so limiting but like other people said, we can just fork it and make our own.
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:01:35
I think the reason we have a price drop is just that some of the positive news hasn't actually 'kicked in', unlike the negative China news. The 'final word' so to speak. The investments into 500+ bitcoin businesses hasn't made anything public yet. I think we're going to see a huge price jump when these investments start releasing products. Also look at Argentina, the bitcoin community in the capital city has more density now than New York (businesses per million) As that picks up speed, it's a prime example that highlights the pros over fiat capital controls, etc.

Another big thing is that I don't have to 'make an account' to get a refund or anything, they just send it back via the same method. This lowers the burden of security for the business and for me.

They're referring to insecure communications, like older facebook login processes, some banks, etc. If you use HTTPS Everywhere or just make sure you use HTTPS on sites you care about, it's fine. I love the wifi pineapple, but it can't do much about secure connections except making them fail to connect.

Anyone who says names don't matter has never understood marketing. Seriously, the first impression is all you get for the vast majority of people. I can't believe how short sighted it is to fight back against a name change, why do they care so much? Change it for those eventual news reports.

Ya, but it could include bills etc. For instance, I'd love to just donate to techdirt once a month, a couple bucks. I'd press a button on their website which would generate a QR code with the scheduling information in it. Or if you send money home every month, you could schedule the payments based on the percentage increased in wallet size that month.

Hello Everyone,
We've made some changes to what people wanted to see, so it's a better product even now!
We have decided to go ahead with accepting bitcoins!
The process is simple, we will only keep the bitcoins if the Kickstarter campaign is successful. We understand that this requires trust from the bitcoin community, however we want to make this business our future. We are willing to put our name and our founders' name on the line and the future of our company and this idea to see it succeed. 
We will refund the bitcoins to the originating wallet address before June 4th if the kickstarter is unsuccessful. We'll be refunding by default, so you must contact us if you do not want to be refunded on the 4th.
Please check the site for more info.

I agree with the 'right now'. It needs to be developed, but not used live for quite a while. Perhaps make it for litecoin and move it over after it's mature.
