Let it take it's time....10k is not the goal, we are heading to 100k on the next impulse run.

Sick, congrats!

But now, its profitable....no?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:24:33
This is dumb. The coin is valued at  right now. How does it suck. Sucks I don't have more.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:29:09
There you go. Take a seat. Stumped. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:15:58
True, thanks for the reply!

I think you are way off. First, Bitcoin has intrinsic value for a lot of people, but it Depends on what YOU consider intrinsic value. Now, having altcoins and ICOs that request or depend on bitcoin gives bitcoin intrinsic value.  Being able to transfer or store wealth on bitcoin gives bitcoin Intrinsic value. The fact that bitcoin has a limited supply gives it intrinsic value. One bitcoin will always be worth one bitcoin. A dollar's value decreases every time a new dollar gets printed. I'm not even going to touch that absurd pesos analogy.....how many pesos are out there?
No dividends?  Pffffff..... Have you heard of bitcoin cash?  It's worth about 8% or so of the value of a whole bitcoin. People got that for every bitcoin they held through the fork....and you can sell it or hodl it.......can you call that a dividend? 
I think you are being shortsighted and a bit presumptuous..... but hey, I like to speculate. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:18:23
Sooooo, this is even worse than the other comment. Yes, sell it in an exchange. That's all you have to do.....two days ago you had 1 coin valued at $2700, today you have two coins. One at $2700 and the other one, which you got for free, valued at $650. 
I'll take free $650 any day.

The market 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:36:50
Well, theoretically you should have declared it as payment when you first obtained it......it was compensation for your services. Then after the sale, the difference would be recorded as a capital gain. However, since when you initially obtained them they were likely below $100 for the 6 of them, then I believe there was technically no requirement to complete a 1099 for you so none was reported to the IRS. The sale, for sure, will be a capital gain. Double check with your accountant though. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:49:41
Yea, everything I have read about them would suggest so. Sorry to hear 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:31:30
I agree with OP, last bubble it X-ed like 10 times. We are only at 2-4
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:51:07
Did they ever do an ICO on the Lisk blockchain?  I'll wait

Best advice you will see

What a terrible answer

Your average parents struggled with Facebook and probably never even touched MySpace. We will get there soon enough. Adoption is happening in many different forms. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:18:57
Funny how it touches 7900 and then dropped. Many factors to consider (cancellation of 2x), but it happened similar to when they last called the top.

Keep a copy of the private keys, tell the recipient to move to new wallet within a month or it will disappear. If they don’t move it, they’ll likely lose the wallet and private keys. Transfer back to your own wallet. Repeat.

Everyone expected the same thing with bitcoin cash.....btc just went up
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:28:20
This unacceptable. Be ready to lawyer up. 
Also, if you wanna show me some love!  Good luck, keep us posted!
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:32:35
Lol, wtf. OTC means over the counter. He could be referring to buying from physical individuals in person. I don’t think this is what’s happening, but your reaction was arrogant and absurd. 
So use your brain and try to apply the terms to this industry. Maybe that’s the reason you are an unemployed economist? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:22:30
Didn’t they go up 50% today according to coinmarketcap?  You obviously don’t know shit. 
I hate 2x, for the record.

Well, the golden rule of thumb in bitcoin is to just hodl. There are reasons why bch will survive, one being the group behind the scenes that want it to work. That being said, bitcoin is king.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:18:59
I hope not. I just don’t think they need the capital everyone thinks they need. You just need a few thousand sub 10$ btc to fuck shit up. And miners would have had access to them. 
But in any case, I think btc will survive regardless. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:47:18
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:25:35
Smart thinking
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:00:52
Probably no. I️ would imagine the attacks will come in waves.  When will they happen?  Hard to tell, the attackers might wait for bch to go back down before p+d it again 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:08:57
Gdax doesn’t charge fees to sending btc to another address. You are the one that should learn how to use their service correctly!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:14:11
The only thing we know for sure is that bitcoin survived another attack!
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:30:54
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:05:33
It’s free from gdax. Why would you not use gdax knowing it exists?  Smh

Don’t talk about bitcoin!?  That’s impossible.

Well, I’m not a techie but how about the idea of the lender having a side chain with it’s own coin created that could represent interest. The loan would be backed up with collateral and the interest would be based in a certain increase of the interest coin over a certain period of time? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:42:39
Thanks for the breakdown 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:15:40
The miners
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:07:50
It’s a tough issue to deal with since there are very few other wealthy groups of people that are willing to put so much capital at risk in such a volatile market. Who would know better these markets than the people that have been mining since btc was just a few dollars?
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:45:16
Alright, let’s pretend 0.05 is not a significant number between 0.2 and 0.15......and also, let’s assume it’s not that big and that 1400$ is not a significant amount for someone for seg2x futures. 
I haven’t checked your numbers, but let’s assume they are right. , 30% (0.05) not that far from 50% (0.075).
So, just be open about shit. The risk in the fork is real; the miners have the capital to fuck shit up. Thinking otherwise is ridiculous. 
I noticed you are a LT btc supporter. I respect that. I’m just saying, thinking that the miners and the people behind the fork don’t have power is a dangerous and short sighted position to be in. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:24:08
Dunno, it fluctuates. 
Check at nice hash profitability calculator for a rough estimate. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:17:44
Good call. Yea. That’s what I️ like about gdax. No transfer fees when sending btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:30:07
Well, likely a handful of the current top 10
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:11:57
No. I don’t believe so.  There is no fee for depositing fiat in CB.

Look at Venezuela, they are not investing in the regular sense. They are buying to protect value in light of their extremely depreciative currency. 
In other times of crisis, think Greece and Cyprus, the people buying bitcoin were doing so, not as an investment, but to transfer or protect wealth.

@_date: 2017-07-31 23:52:34
So are these increasing daily costs the same regardless of the coin mined?  Thanks for replying on such an old thread, I was just considering Geminis Mining, but am a beginner in regards to mining.
