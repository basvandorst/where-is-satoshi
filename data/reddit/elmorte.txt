Yeah, I didn't get charged even that $1. I received $0.02 less (on 1 BTC transaction).
Got killed on the Paypal withdrawal conversion rate though (not based in US or Europe). 2% less than a bank exchange rate (which is horrible to start with).

I never received that email, only:




























@_date: 2015-12-10 04:42:55
Not ALL. I got paid out legit. I think they pick and choose, and let some smaller transactions through. Or maybe just the first one for each email address, hoping the next one is a bigger payload.

I'm checking this thread because I'm thinking the same thing - that it might be some sort of a long con.
The times are in my local time zone:
1:38am sent 1 BTC to their wallet
2:49am email from Paypal with the receipt
2:54am email from contact Transaction Complete

Tell me about it, I typed in 5 first...luckily was on mobile and didn't trust myself to c/p the correct address, so by the time I got to the PC, some common sense prevailed.
And only did I think to Google the website AFTER clicking send...*sigh*
Screenshots below: 
Edit: should probably say *phew* instead of *sigh*...it's not $200 anymore, it's $400+ we're talking about.

Saved the first screenshot, went to sleep, woke up to the second one:

Judging from the rest of the comments, YMMV. Ain't gonna put myself through that again.
Edit: formatting

Crap, keep updating though. I tested with 1 BTC and immediately had buyer's remorse. Stayed up, waiting for 3 confirmations and a little while longer, but went to sleep thinking I've been had like a dumb fool.
Woke up this morning to an email from Paypal saying $439 was credited :) Chances are I'm not doing that ever again.

I was sweating balls last night too, same thing 1 BTC. Went to sleep at 2am, woke up this morning to an email from Paypal saying the money was credited :)
I was kicking myself to sleep last night though...not sure if I wanna go through it again.

It would make sense if they're only selling the private keys to the 100 BTC addresses.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:54:27
Bitcoin or r/Bitcoin? What nonsense are you spouting?
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:13:32
Gotta be some money in it too.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:16:08
Go on...

Do they need a full node? I just thought they need a branch relevant to the user
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:07:04
Must be that Google quantum computing. They sure killed Bitcoin this time.

How *does* risk management work in Power Ball?

Does not do what exactly?

Tough fuckin crowd in here. Comments are sorted as controversial by default so you will always see a bunch of comments by socially retarded ppl on top, barking at you.
Back to your question, yeah, basically based on reviews and trust. There are escrows where your coin can be parked until you release it. You could have the seller send you the shipping receipt and you release based on that. They could also dispute the transaction if you refuse to release the coin even after they shipped the goods. Generally, neither party wants a negative review.

The website above allows OP to **purchase BTC** and **have it deposited in a wallet of his choosing.**
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:05:51
And that's just one example I know of.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:45:54
You mean TRIAL, right? Trail would make a lotta ppl nervous...

You don't need to go to the store to get your money. Sell it online and get the money in your account.

The cost and difficulty of taking money and btc out (i.e. liquidity). 
After that, the cost and difficulty of funding.
Then I look at the exchange (usually listed publicly) to see the availability and spreads. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:32:32
So um, how often is that?
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:32:48
Hehe, no, I haven't.
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:31:45
What's that? Like botnet mining?
@_date: 2016-07-01 04:58:15
The blockchain
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:11:03
Right...so how come there are wallets that do not need to sync the whole chain?
Edit: shit, how does that work: 
@_date: 2015-10-22 19:44:27
Been thinking about Multibit HD. Any feedback?
On average, does it take longer to transfer Bitcoin from one of the listed wallets to eg. Localbitcoin than from say one exchange to another?
