Massive correction coming. IMO

Okay ... but why would anyone want a Bitcoin?  Let’s see ... the technology is already outdated and slow and there are countless better products already in the market that do a better job — and, it can be forked endlessly.  There is no value in a Bitcoin at this point other than the greater fool theory — you are a greater fool than me so I’ll sell you my Bitcoin for more than I paid.  Enjoy you useless Bitcoins.

That’s a joke.  Yup, the banks are going to sell XRP to buy BTC. And I’m going to sell my Lambo to buy a KIA.

HODL to $0 then they can’t take your money because you won’t have any to take.  You will show them!!!!!

Blood in the streets tomorrow. Sunday Bloody Sunday. Last day to take tax losses and Val’s car tax winners.  We will see blood across the board. Get ready to sell sell sell.  I’m foolishly optimistic and bullish though so don’t mind me.

Correct ... it’s possible the word embraces the slowest and most outdated technology full of in fighting that is controlled by centralized miners in China that no longer has any relation to the original goal.  I agree ... but what would you pay for it vs. it’s chance of long term success?  $1 or $10 or $100 or $1000 etc.  I’d pay maybe $100 for a Bitcoin.  But — I would diversify. Watch what happens when companies like Coinbase get up to supporting 25 coins. Price of Bitcoin will crash. Folks already are switching to LTC and BCH to move funds around because BTC can’t do it economically.  XRP gets added to Coinbase — ask yourself honestly if you would use XRP to transfer funds between exchanges and accounts, and you will find your answer about Bitcoin’s value. Don’t be the greater fool!

Oh, I will ... but we need a real dip of about 30-40% before it’s safe. Don’t worry about me ... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:33:28
You keep thinking that — all the way to zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:04:57
Sure ... but that doesn’t account for the new investors ... they need panic to sell. Otherwise, they’ll HODL.

Okay ... please let us all know well in advance when it’s time to get off of the escalator ... because it’s pretty slow and I’d hate to get trapped holding a $20k bag. You’re making a pitch based on marketing and first mover advantage.  Bitcoin is just like every other fad at these prices — price too far removed from underlying value.  Be not the fool.  Put your money in undervalued promising crypto-technologies ... 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:01:24
And the banks will buy.

Here lies Bitcoin — beloved by all, in regions beyond now — having a ball.

He’s looking for some clothes because he didn’t buy Bitcoin early ...
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:22:44
I agree but would like you to explain your reasoning. What do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:40:11
Ok ... some of that is okay. Also, big money taking profit and vacations. They don’t leave their money unattended in this volatile market. Plus, we need a correction — when 90% of market is at ATH — it’s time to be fearful, not greedy.
