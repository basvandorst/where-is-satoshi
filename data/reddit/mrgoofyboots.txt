Ok I guess I should’ve use better terminology, all my stuff got stolen. All of it. Had to start over every account and email I had.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:46:10
Man my old post about exchanges being the main reasons coins were setup to scheme people seems more legit week after week......after week.
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:12:39
Very important lesson. I was let’s just say, “fuckkkkked upppp” and was bragging about how I had so many bitcoins on Facebook and Reddit. Posted something on Reddit and allllllll my stuff got raided. Btc, bank accounts, online everything. 
From one goof up being high and excited. 
Don’t be like me!! Lol

Just chill fellas. Probably a whale or two, and some sellers offloading to treat their families to a nice Christmas. Up up and away in 18! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:46:28
Very possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:21:50
Panic every time it does anything ahhhhhjhhhhhhhhhhh jk 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:49:03
Yes but it's a versa. Transmission will probably be shit in a few years unless you get the stick. But still at least it's a new car lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:29
Thank you, really appreciate that.

You and others are not alone bud. About 4 and a half years ago I was in a bad place in my life. I was taking anything and everything I could to TRIP BALLS, couldn’t just stick with mushrooms and weed like I promised myself. Anyways, around the same time I became intensely interested in bitcoin and all cryptos. I would get high as shit and read, read, read, and have discussions with other Redditors on different crypto subs. Well after a good bit of discussions and comments I had almost two whole coins, back when it was a couple bucks a piece lol. 
Well one night when I was  super messed up and I got excited when I realized what I had and stupidly posted something with just enough personal information for some assholes to steal ALL MY MONEY. They invaded my bank accounts and drained them, logged into my Reddit account and stole my coin. I had to delete EVERYTHING AND START OVER. 
Well about a week after that I took a combo of lsd and ketamine and threw myself into a drug induced pyhscosis that last about a month and included a stay in the looney bin to stabilize me. 
When I got out I was 70,000 in debt from the hospital stay and broke from my accounts being looted. Had to file bankruptcy and start my life over with almost no friends. Friends disappear when you get the crazy label stuck to you. 
So after all that I kind of said screw Reddit and bitcoin for a while even though it was my error posting personal information. 
Don’t do that on Reddit lol. 
So could have had about two bitcoins just from other  people on here tipping me for liking my input and opinions, but I made a huge mistake and now I’m watching all the success these others are having. It sux but I’m glad someone is proving all the assholes that say bitcoin is BS wrong. 
To top it all of I can’t work because of a severe back injury and I’m waiting for surgery (with medicaid). So buy the time I get back to work and would be able to save bitcoin will probably be forever beyond my grasp. 
Only hope I have now is luck or invest in the other coins carefully and hope for the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:26:18
I have even less after this whole Coinbase fiasco now too....
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:10:21
Lucky dog!!!! Like others here have said do your due diligence and you should be go to go for quite some time!!! Best of luck sir!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:58:55
You are the man/woman!!! Thank youuuuu!!
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:21:13
Well what about examples like the Leman Brothers, Enron, etc. They were big corporations with well know faces that robbed investors.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:39:33
Best solution would be a new exchange that lowers the rates and makes just as much by having would assume more users/transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:41:44
I do. Been watching since the beginning. Fun ride indeed
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:18
And def not the first shady thing from them for sure. That’s what happens when you have basically kids running and enterprise like that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:51:54
I agree but the big ones could do the same, if they wanted to anyway. But you’re right why disappear when you can just sit back and collect massive transaction fees....
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:38
I’m not sure what exactly to speculate on, but it’s nuts seeing EVERYTHING taking a nosedive. 
Maybe those who’ve were shorting it colluded with some whales to help each other out. Seems like a simple enough explanation? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:10:30
Follow your gut man. As silly as it sounds it's almost always correct. When bitcoin came out I was super into it and would read day after day after day learning about it. I wound up with about 2 from bitcointips and was planning on putting more in as I could. Well it was about he same time in my life I was bad off on too many trippy drugs and had to go to the looney bin for a few weeks to clean up and come back to reality. Well once I got back to normal I let my family and friends talk me out it since it was associated with that part of my life. In the back of my mind I would still think about it and want to do it. Eventually I check back in and then it's at 5,000 then 7,000 then 10,000. Don't miss the buss y'all! I'm now going to invest in all the other coins that I can afford and maybe get lucky with that and eventually be able to afford bits down the line. Good luck man
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:51
I’ve always been a fan of bitcoin, but facts are facts. I still hold out hope but I guess time will tell us.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:05:58
Looks like we may hit 13k before close of today!!! That's insane! When I first started following the movement it was like 4 dollars and people were saying it would go up 1000 and crash and burn forever and here were are fellas and ladies. What a time to be alive!
I use to have about 2 bitcoins from being tipped in comments back when r/bitcointip was still around but I forgot about them and they are gone now. 
Thinking my new startegy will be to buy as many of the different altcoins and just hodl those until more people jump there too. Just got my first Dogecoins last night heheh. 
Good luck everyone and get in soon if ya can, before it's out of our buying ability very soon! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:57:09
Good point man.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:46:52
Y’all just make sure to keep things like this in your ole memory bank. This truly is the Wild West of money at the moment. And remember, people always look out for themselves only, and you should too. 
Be careful fellas and good luck out there! We all need it. 
And be suspicious of all exchanges, websites, etc. people will do anything to take your money and put in it in their wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:56:52
What a story dude. Really happy for ya!!! Doing a great thing for the kids too man!! Props to ya!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:05:24
When I got into bitcoins I was also heavily into tripping with a lot of different shit. And was not exactly in my right mind. Well since that happened my mom refussssses to even hear that word lmao. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:22:29
My dad has a decent boat just sitting in the shed he refuses to use or sell. I almost convinced him to sell it so I could is the money to put into bitcoin at 14k at the time. Then It when up to 19 and I was like seeeeee, ya see man!!! Now it’s at 12 :-\
What happened?!?! Lol
And I don’t work due to a disability so I was hoping it would be my chance to make some kind of an income. And I still do. And to clarify I still want to buy at 12k, never know, this may be the lowest we see it go for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:20:18
Oh I know it does but at 13,500 a piece bitcoin is a little too much for me right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:48:17
Can you please donate some to a mental health organization of some kind sir??? So many people need it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:21:43
Would actually bet on that 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:43:46
I’m amazed at how much Shittier the folks are now. Back when all this first started that had naysayers, but for he most part we were all looking out for us, now it’s just a bunch of know it alls and bullshitters speculating and talking shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:15:34
Thank you so much!!!! I'm going to nerd out on this all night hehe! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:14:02
A lot of my family and friends told me I was a bit "bonkers" about it. It also happened to be the same time I was so a Weeeeee bit too many drugs. I had about 8 BTC from tips on bitcointip from comments and dialogue with people when bitcoin was first starting up. Drugs are bad mmmkayyyy. Lol. It's not about being smart or not per se, more about having the money and the gall to go for it. Although it was wayyyy easier back then when it wasn't worth much and people would "tip" you for comments and what not that they enjoyed. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:53:13
You def raise a lot of very valid points. But all of this was said when the price rose to like 500 bucks and I was kicking myself for not putting in at the time, I actually had a little money to save and I should have. But also the price went from 500 to 11,000 in less than a year, so could be a bubble lol. Or you c yes get rich and get out...
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:59:33
Shit, god damnit I don't reddit sinned agaiiin!! Lol. Yes, UNLESS you get the manual lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:48:39
No I’ve just seen a few users recently post having issues with their funds so I was just wondering if they might pull a MTGOX on people soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:02:26
So basically the community needs at least one exchange that can handle the volume and lower fees?? Lol. Anyone working on that yet?? Hehe
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:03
Just from what I’m seeing on an app that tracks most of them. Seeing a lot of 25% dips etc. only one in green was ripple I believe. I wish I could buy buddy I’m disabled and waiting on my approval or denial letter. When I finally get one I’ll be sinking a small amount into coins every month, I truly believe in them all just a shitty couple days we are having. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:55:30
cornelius vanderbilt!??!?!?!? lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:02:12
The engines are great in those provided you maintain them. Same with anything really. But as long as you get a manual you should be fine, just have to get used to putt putting everywhere hehe. Like my 4 banger frontier!! Lol but she's got 206,000 miles and runs almost completely silent. Nissan makes really reliable  4 bangers. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:16
That’s not necessarily a great idea either. Because everyone has their own agenda, and blindly following or listening to someone isn’t the brightest idea, save for Andreas, that man is a saint. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:24:53
Exactly. And know there is more examples of large, REPUTABLE businesses that lure investors in with snazzy book keeping. Why wouldn’t there be a possibility of that with crypto currency??? Not that all of the exchanges are shady but I’d imagine there’s at least 2, sound like a good number hahaha.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:26:19
Just tattoo it around your butthole, no ones gonna check there, hopefully lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:19:27
I'm willing to bet whoever ran bitcointip stole them or something. That's the last place they were when they were worth like 300 lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:11:21
He deserves it, then some.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:11:18
Just waiting until he is free to cash in. I would. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:43:43
Oh man ur going to get so many downvotes lol. Even if it goes down to 50 cents these brainwashed folks will still scream hooodddllll
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:24:30
Nice guide, 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:46:46
The memories lol.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:56:14
I wish I never let mine go. I had a few, but was coming out of month long trippy binge and when I came back to reality got rid of that and other things to start over so to speak. Well letting go of bitcoins was stupppppiiddd. Family convinced me I was delusional ��
@_date: 2019-05-10 06:45:09
So he admitted basically he’s bought and paid for.
Should be thrown out of office. 
And as soon as more nations slowly drop the dollar, they will change their tune
