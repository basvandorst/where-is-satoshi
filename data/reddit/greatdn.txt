As one of the few financial services professionals in the United States currently both accepting Bitcoin and willing to work with it (and the only licensed accounting firm of which I am aware),  I make it my business to regularly monitor Bitcoin related chatter, usually on Twitter.  I recently came across an excited Bitcoin advocate who tweeted: “Price of Bitcoin is increasing exponentially.  This can no longer be called a ‘bubble,’ it is more and more looking like early adoption.”  This seems to be the general feeling among Bitcoin people (“Bitcoiners?”).
