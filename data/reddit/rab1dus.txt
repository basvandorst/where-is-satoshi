LOL! I'll start setting them up!

Yeah.  It was tough at first.  I started my own company in the same industry so still spent a lot of time with my work friend circle.  I went to working 80 hour weeks though so didn't have much time to socialize.  I was happier though.  The pain I always had in my chest went away.  I make a lot less money now and don't see my family as much due to work and travel but still better off overall.   It's been 5 years now and no major complaints.

Agreed completely.  Let's get something working to make Bitcoin usable.   Even if it is a sidechain.

Coinsquare.io service is good.  Fees are horrendous.  User beware.

Couldn't upvote this enough.  Have seen so much of this in my life as a nerd.  Seemingly smart people falling in to religious traps.  So weird.

Um.  That's exactly what Bitcoin was developed for...     If you want to use a credit card, why bother with crypto?????

I'd take lanes today vs. teleportation in the unknown future to come.

I quit a very good paying job because I wasn't fulfilled.   No regrets.

Amen!  Couldn't agree more!
There is a real problem now that is untenable.  I understand there are sidechain solution in the works to help address such at lightning.  When are they going to be available?  How does the core team feel about side chains?   Not the ones that work for Blockstream, the independent ones?    So many questions that I would love to see answered.

I've never used Quadrigacx.  Coinsquare.io has a fixed btc fee they charge when withdrawing to another wallet which last time I used it I felt was unreasonable.  Can't remember the amount.

I love bitcoin but in Canada, you can email money to anyone and they can deposit it instantly.  Usually no fee.  I setup a bank account online with a different bank the other night and emailed myself money to deposit it instantly.   Compared to bitcoin, it's actually far superior.

There's a reason gambling is a regulated industry.  Sorry for your loss.

I was an early miner that lost 10 or so coins.  Imagine there are a lot of people out there like me.
