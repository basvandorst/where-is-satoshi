Bitcoin isn't likely ever going to suffer from "scarcity".  I can go to any open exchange right now and buy Bitcoin.  
It's not like I need bread or milk and none of the stores around me have any, that's scarcity.

This is hilarious, they sound like they're imitating [Philomena Cunk](

Say I don't want to download a program or create an account somewhere online.  What is the fastest way to legitimately get my hands on some relatively secure bitcoin?

Mark Karpelès will be secretly wearing this wherever he goes.

What the fuck is wrong with these news anchors?  I feel like all three of them have no idea how to form a sentence.

I thought for a minute that this title was referring to [Bobby Lee the comedian](

I'm going to assume that this setup neither belongs to this person nor is/was used for actual Bitcoin farming.  The picture looks like some one is getting ready to setup a LAN Center and wanted to get a picture of all of the hardware beforehand.
Cakes hasn't commented in here since he posted this pic but these are general assumptions.  Unless this can be verified, I doubt that some one would put this much capital into Bitcoin mining.  
If so, I'd like to see proof/verification.
