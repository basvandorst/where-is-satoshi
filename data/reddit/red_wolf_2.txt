Yep you can load that DAT file into another client. I'd take a backup, then download the latest version of Bitcoin QT and let it resync... Be warned it will take a while to finish!
Put the wallet.dat file in there and you should be fine...

They said that years ago.... Still hasn't happened yet. There will need to be a quantum leap in the technology to break people away from it, and it will also be reliant on the bitcoin ecology not evolving with the changes. So far that really hasn't happened, and shows very few signs of happening soon.

The issue with the Jalapeno PSUs comes down to poor quality parts in the power supply itself. The most typical failure mode is when the capacitors in the low voltage side of the PSU start expanding, and end up shorting between part of the high voltage side. This dumps mains voltage through the Jalapeno, which promptly grounds through the USB port shield, destroying the Jalapeno's FTDI USB-Serial interface chip in the process. Sometimes it takes out the household power, and in some cases it has destroyed the USB port of the computer it was connected to.
The Jalapenos themselves are actually very reliable. I have five of them, and have only ever had one die, because I stupidly used the included PSU with it. All others have been on aftermarket supplies and are still running flawlessly to this day.

They cocked up Myki by putting the contract out to tender, and awarding it to the one and only company which had absolutely zero experience in what they wanted done. Add to that a bunch of politics and the thought that the new system should simply replicate the existing one (rather than replace the antiquated zoning system) and you had a recipe for disaster.
To turn that recipe for disaster into a true perfect storm, they then went and outsourced all the development to India, and didn't check the contracts properly when it came to what was considered variations, and how much they would cost. Utter disaster of a project.

Depends on the type of pool you want to run... I've set up a P2Pool instance on my own virtual infrastructure and it is remarkably simple to do. Other pool software will also do the trick, but I've never tried it. Maybe consider eloipool, its the software on which Eligius is based.

I was actually referring to the people celebrating in the other comments with statements along the lines of hoping everyone sues BFL into oblivion. Guess they wouldn't care if other paying customers lost money as a result,  but that is greed for you...
The depressing thing was all those who months ago were wishing death on BFL were trumpeting how wonderful BitSynCom and Avalon were.... Right until they got completely and blatantly screwed over by that. There was proven mining on customer gear while deliberately delaying shipments and who knows what else.

I found P2Pool remarkably easy to set up on Linux... The longest bit of it was letting the blockchain sync for the bitcoind instance. I also made my node public if anyone wants to use it: stratum connect to randomcontent.wolfnexus.net port 9332... Use your wallet address as username, if you find a share (or many) you get paid in the coinbase transaction on the next block mined by P2Pool.
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:28:23
The worst thing is, switching to P2Pool IS easy to do! Find a near-by P2Pool node, plug its address into your favourite mining client/device, set your username to your bitcoin wallet address and the password to something random and away you go, its that simple!
I even made a config file generator on my site to use the P2Pool instance I set up. Guess how many people use it? (My site is the one where I tell people how to reflash BFL Jalapenos using a Raspberry Pi)
I suspect the main issue people have with P2Pool is the variance in payouts. What they miss is that with a higher hashrate on P2Pool, the more frequent payouts will be.

Quick hint for most PC and similar fans:
These often use sleeve bearings (the more expensive ones might use ball bearings) which dry out over time, particularly when kept hot and running at high speed. I've had GPU, CPU and case fans all seize up or get noisy at various times, and the fix is usually very simple.
Take the fan off whatever it is attached to, then look on the motor side (non-blades side). Often there will be a sticker over the back of the motor. Remove it and you more often than not will find a plastic or rubber plug covering the bearing.  Pull the cover off, spray in some wd40 and spin the fan gently by hand, then wick it out with a tissue. Add some suitable grease/oil into the bearing, put the plug back in and stick the sticker back down. Bam! Working fan!
If there isn't any obvious way into the fan, just squirt a pile of wd40 in between the fan and the base and let it soak in a while. Won't keep it running as long, but good for the short term. Just let the excess drain out before reinstalling it.

Only took me a few hours to set everything up, and that was with me building a full system and setting up bitcoind and namecoind as well as p2pool itself. Personally I'd use Eligius as its nice and large, but if you're interested you're welcome to use my P2Pool node (so is anyone else for that matter, just use your bitcoin wallet address as the username): randomcontent.wolfnexus.net:9332
Must admit, its probably most worthwhile if you have a decent set of ASICs mining, I haven't had much luck pushing about 60ghash towards P2Pool so far.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:28:09
Seconded, Eligius doesn't charge any fees at all and does merged namecoin mining.. Been mining there quite a while now.

I don't have enough mining equipment to in any way make a profit... And apart from that I get very, very few donations for what I have on my site (a pile of information on how to reflash BFL gear using Raspberry Pis, also my solar powered miner project). When it comes to cost of operation vs return, I've never broken even. The P2Pool instance is really the newest addition overall, I tend to use it if I'm feeling lucky or if my primary pool is offline. If it became in any way popular I'd probably review the fees based on traffic cost, at the moment I'm having to estimate.

I've done this on small scale before. It is a LOT of energy, you would need a LOT of panels, and even more batteries to maintain the mining.

The Raspberry Pi is a nice easy option, either grab MinePeon or do what I did and grab a copy of Raspbian and build it all yourself (takes maybe an hour or two?)
You can also use the Pi to reflash it too....

I added another 90w panel part way through the Part 2 update. Also found out some of my batteries weren't too healthy, and ended up trying (and partially succeeding) in rejuvenating them in Part 3.
I'm hoping to raise enough to get another 90w panel, and hopefully another decent sized battery too. Running both Jalapenos has drawn the battery down almost to its cutoff threshold, and its not yet sunrise here. I ended up disabling one of them to let the system survive until it rises in a few hours time.
@_date: 2013-08-21 19:01:01
Quite high, if you purchase all the parts new. I actually had most of it left over from previous projects so the initial outlay was pretty much just the BFL ASICs and the Raspberry Pi.
If you were to do it from scratch though...
I'd estimate close to $1k... Maybe 3-500 for the panels, about 2-300 for the 100Ah battery (new) and extra for the charge controller, wiring, Pi and other assorted bits and pieces. Its a nice green setup, but I doubt it will be profitable sadly. Heres to hoping for some nice price drops in the renewable energy generation market!

It also comes with the benefit of giving me a ready source of 12 volts to boost the battery of my car (the whole thing is set up in my garage).

Two BFL Jalapenos at 7.5+ghash running off a raspi, solar powered (some of the time, depending on sunlight).
I really need another 80-90w panel and at least another 200Ah of batteries to stabilise the system fully though, so normally it runs just the one Jalapeno...

The batteries will discharge equally as power is drained from the system. Fortunately they are all the same chemistry and have the same charging requirements. The downside however is that the batteries are of different ages and are degraded to different levels. Where this presents a problem is when cells are failing and have higher resistance, the overall charge capacity ends up dropping and you can end up with things like one battery discharging through another.
At the moment I leave all the battery management to the charge controller, however I am considering adding suitable diodes to help manage things a bit better in the future.

@_date: 2013-08-23 16:54:00
It would probably work, however the available ASICs out there would likely be a lot more efficient. I'm not sure what specifications the CPUs involved have, but if they're any similar to x86 processors you would maybe get a few Mhash per core, giving a maximum of maybe 90-100Ghash total? I suspect the cost would outweigh the revenue.
Anyone else know the specs for such a cluster?
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:12:01
Before the sun set? The battery was on float charge at 14 volts, so as far as the controller was concerned it was full. That said, I didn't have the full set of batteries in the system. Instead I only had the 100Ah battery in circuit, and the charge controller disconnects the load before it pulls the battery too low. I believe the LVD threshold is either 10 or 11 volts, with the reconnection threshold set at 12.6 volts open circuit.
Check out parts 2 and 3, I took quite a few measurements for the loading of both the Jalapenos, Raspberry Pi and the little netgear wifi bridge gadget (although I estimated the Pi and bridge at approximate values due to the difficulty of measurement)
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:17:14
I knew exactly what I was getting into, I expected delays and issues when I ordered my second order on Black Friday. The new game they seem to be playing is to ship orders out of sequence. Some people who ordered mixed orders (Single + Jalapeno(s)) on Black Friday have had them filled well in advance of some orders made well before Black Friday.
In my case, I know of and have proof of an order placed and paid a good 16 hours after mine being filled more than a week ago. Mine is still in production.

First things first. Take a sector by sector image of the drive using a suitable tool such as ddrescue (if on linux) or win32diskimager.

Store the image you take to another drive for safekeeping before you try any sort of analysis, then try tools such as Recuva.

That would be me! When it comes to using alternative energy to mine bitcoins, the main thing to consider is supply reliability. If you have a pretty constant supply of wind you should be able to minimise your energy storage (batteries) capacity quite a bit. The real issue over all of it however is the cost. Very few setups will end up returning more than they cost in terms of bitcoin mined.

While he is seemingly against Bitcoin, his words do carry some wisdom. Fanaticism never ends well for anyone, and it would be worth looking to history to see where other systems have failed.
I don't expect or want to see anything as stupid as what some people quoted in the article suggested. If bitcoin does take off, maybe he will say "wow, didn't see that coming". If it fails, maybe he will say "told you so"... Either way, the whole thing can really be summed up as a great example of the interesting times in which we live.

Odd, I know I commented here, but it seems to have completely vanished...

Very easy to reflash it... I would just to try and get a little more crunching power out of it.

So.... Time to figure out if there is a way to lock a particular node out of the network if chosen to do so by the rest of the network?

Of the rig itself? I have one without the panels (which are on the roof, not much to see there). I'll post it in Part 3 in a few minutes.

Hi Kyle!
They do eventually ship orders, even if you end up waiting 10 months... What unit(s) did you end up ordering?

I've had my two Jalapenos for quite a while by now....

Well, that settles that one... The power supply finally gave out around 6:40am local time, just as the sun was beginning to rise.  This means I'll definitely need a larger battery capacity to make it through the nights (local cost estimate of about $250 for another 100Ah) and probably need some more panels, unless the cloud clears up a bit. I'm planning to see how much output they give today and use that to judge whether I'll need more panels yet or not.

What happens if a bitcoin ATM is on the moon? Where to then?!

Pretty much guaranteed to be gone by now... Sorry...

I've received my product from them - two Jalapenos, both running at between 7 and 8 gigahashes each. Took its sweet time getting to me, but they work as promised!
If you're in doubt as to whether I do have them, theres a photo on my site, check out the post about the solar powered mining rig...

Definitely a long shot I'm afraid... Look for data slicing tools, or undeleters.  Sadly I don't think any specialised open source software exists to identify and recover lost wallet.dat files yet.

It probably could, and I was actually thinking of building a suitable device I could interface via the GPIO pins (something like an I2C ADC, with a suitable current shunt and a pile of resistors).
Then I remembered the BFL Jalapenos actually include voltage monitors! They have them on the regulated 1.whatever and 3.3v lines, and best of all, one on the main input voltage!
I'm thinking of trying my hand at writing a mod for BFGMiner to control the Jalapenos based on the voltage, if it gets too low, switch them off, when it gets high enough, switch them back on again...

Yep, Zadig is the one... It just switches the driver from whatever Windows puts in there to the WinUSB driver. To remove it, you can simply uninstall the device through device manager and let it reinitialise with the original driver too.

On solar? Fortunately there isn't any that I'm aware of. This operation is entirely off-grid, so tax or not I'm pretty sure there wouldn't be any issue... In any case, the power involved is negligible compared to a fully fledged solar array putting out multiple kilowatts of energy.

If I could upvote this twice, I would. Hit the nail on the head.

These things will be a lot more popular if they start appearing in airports...
