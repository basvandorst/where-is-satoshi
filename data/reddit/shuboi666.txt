I don't see the window of it being trendy closing any time soon. If the worst happens, it happens, but I see this as a technology adoption for all businesses. Alt coins break into different sectors of business and how blockchain, smart contracts etc can benefit tomorrows world in the food, financial, entertainment industries, and I want to invest in these companies that I see potential in. 
 Diversifying into your alts can minimize losses if a single coin tanks, but if all of them tank then you're screwed, which is why everyone says only play with money you're ready to lose.

Alt coins have potential for big gains too. Diversify and research which coins/tech you think has potential and invest some money in those coins. Watch the alts you like for as long as you can and read as much forum/twitter buzz on those alts. I feel like having my Btc just sitting around doesn’t earn me more btc just more usd, so i want to make my btc grow as well to earn even more usd. Those alt coins can do a lot. 
I don’t know though, I’m still learning. If there are downsides to investing in alts other than fear of a total market crash im curious to learn more.

So it’s specifically between the 2 listed coins only. 
Good to know cause there can be discrepancies between the options which could add a lil extra percentile to the exchange.

Has LTC ever indicated movement in BTC? So with this hike to 250+ it can be viewed as an optimistic look at BTC hitting the 25k ceiling soon? I know there will probably/definitely be a correction dip.

When a coin has multiple pairings in the market, like XRP/BTC and XRP/ETH, are these different markets entirely? Or is it just one market and you pull out whichever coin you're trying to exchange?

How do they know where it will be in 3 months? With the surge of Coinbase users, and the growing momentum, can they be wrong? What happens if it surges based on where the futures place it?

Maybe it’s their incentive?
