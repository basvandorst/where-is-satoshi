Don't be surprised when you find that some boomers are hedging cash and stacking sats.

I've been buying since it went below 8K, again when it touched 7K. Waiting for 6.xK to pour more fiat into this madness.

I'll give a thousand Satoshi's for one.

I first heard about Bitcoin in 2014, but did not get into it until March 2018. I invested in some mining equipment. I got my ROI in just under a year. I reinvested in more gear this past July. I expect the ROI to take about half the time at current prices, less time if price increases and more time if price decreases. I will continue to HODL and stack sats now that I am playing with house money.

For a million it two, it's not worth the risk. For 35-50 million it's worth framing someone.

You mean 10k Satoshi's?

Daily RSI is showing oversold. Time to stack sats.

Need my kidneys. I keep a cash position for dips.

Uh... Real Estate? Think of Manhattan Island being purchased for a string of beads. That property is now worth trillions. Let's compare the assets in a hundred years. Nothing like time to give proper perspective.
