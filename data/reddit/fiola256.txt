Looking pretty amazing. Exchange sync worked for poloniex and binance, but hit btc is not working for me, I triple checked API key and secret, no typos there.
Keep it up! I would def pay for a pro version for ad free if you ever wanted to monetize a bit.

Sure I am not saying there are no blocks more than 1mb, just pointing out that an empty backlog on bch isn't really just because of 8mb blocks. Having less than 1/10th of btc transaction is important to keep in mind.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:59:54
i'd argue bcash is not due to them not having enough transactions to fill even 1mb blocks most of the time

I believe the worry is if lets say 70% of the hash rate is gone, the difficulty adjustment is once every 2016 blocks, so worst case right after you adjust the difficulty, 70% of the hash rate evaporates. now you are stuck mining the next 2016 blocks at 30% of the hash rates. Eventually we will get through it and difficulty will retarget. Everything after that will be back to normal. But it'll be a painful couple weeks\month until the difficulty adjustment happens.
Now if the fees skyrockets, then there would probably be other miners joining in to rack in the fees. I think we will see miners shipping their equipment to other countries to continue mining. 
Bcash has an easier time with this scenario since they implemented DAA which adjusts based on the last 144 block average. They would be able to retarget difficulty faster than bitcoin will.

I set permission for order history, but not payment info. I enabled payment info and now it works. Not sure what payment info entails? Does the app really need that to access balance?
Also another weirdness I observed. Coins in hitbtc trading account doesn't get synced. I have to move it from trading back to main account for it to show up in the app.

Thanks for the link. You can transfer out (with up to 1 week delay for withdraw...), But can't transfer in.

In my own experience a lot of people buy stocks based on feeling not real data. Or they listen to stuff like Jim Cramer and think they are smart investors. Not every is rational and do index funds.

yeah I was just entertaining the question of what would happen if it came to that. I agree it'll be a slower decay.

Yellow bar that says error detected and also pop-up that says error check API key or status

That's true but the way they did it was a surprise to people. It wasn't a blog post saying they decided to add trading as well., Just a hey surprise, here's your bch and GUESS WHAT? you can trade on our platform conveniently. 
And lets be real here, who gives a shit if I get fired if I can make enough money to retire on this one inside trade? That's a weak threat.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:37:49
Weak hands exchange hands I guess. 
too many newbies that bought in trying to get rich quick, they hear these fud and run off to altcoins thinking they are awesome day traders.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:39:03
They said
"Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We’ll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support."
So the understanding was they would first roll out bch withdraw, then later trading, not both at the same time unannounced.

I don't really care about increasing block size a bit to say 2mb, seems fine for the short term, and I do feel a lot of stubborness from people that are focused too much on ideology. There is a place for short term fix while we work on the long term solution. While I am excited for lightning and segwit adoption, we are having a real problem with transaction fees being very high and newbies that don't know how to properly set the fees are burnt and look elsewhere for their crypto needs. 
That being said, I despise roger and the whole bcash shilling that they do. If they want to compete on merits that's perfectly cool and is exactly what crypto is all about, spreading FUD about core and name calling is just low.

i hope you were kidding about taking another loan to buy more bitcoin. I have a sizable amount of investment in bitcoin, but that's disposable cash that I had around, and amount that I could lose without feeling any financial hardship. If you are not financially well off, bitcoin is not really the right kind of investment for you imo. Never borrow money to gamble\invest!

TD customer service sucks anyways. sometimes they just flat out lie to you. I've made an order and wanted to cancel within 2 hours of ordering, called them up and they claimed it's shipped out already. Fair enough I thought, but they actually didn't ship until 2 weeks later because it was back ordered. 
never buying anything from tiger direct after that.

The difference between borrowing money to buy a house is if I need to liquidate it in say a year I have reasonable expectation it'll still have around the same value. You can't say the same for bitcoins. It's either go big or go home for this. So the question is, can you tolerate it financially if bitcoin goes to 0 in a year? if you cant then it's financially irresponsible to yourself and your family to invest in bitcoins.

The moment you have your coins on an exchange you are trusting them with your coins. The trust layer in the trustless system that is Bitcoin is the one that fails, and there are altcoins trying to solve that problem.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:56:50
They already kind of say that lol.
They claimed that the mempool was coming down on bitcoin chain after the split because core stopped spamming to make a case for segwit working. Some convoluted logic they have going in that subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:16:15
I thought having segwit enabled now means asicboost is not possible?

Just like his Satoshi reveal schtick, all fluff.

I hope so but those were different times, they didn't have the ability to mine another coin that shared the pow.

sadly i know people in real life that's bought into that narrative and dumped their BTC for BCH. it's all about generating the FOMO. People are greedy and when they see a large jump like BCH had they don't want to miss out.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:47:05
this is really cool, thanks for making this

If you don't already have a printer then 40 bux for a well printed case isn't really that bad.

that's a good point, can't complaint about more competition in the space!

pretty much on par with robinhood i guess, skimming off the top and claiming no commission charged.

Technically it's commodity,. It'll be a really good day when it's recognized as currency world wide but we are not there yet.

What's not working on LN? Genuinely asking because I just tried buying Amazon gift cards on bitrefill with LN and it was flawless.
