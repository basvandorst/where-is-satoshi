yes that number , im am not looking so much at the prices since im holding for long term
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:58:57
lmao looks like he is the one doesn't understanding 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:27:43
for me there is never a downside because i'm HODLING 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:26:47
don't do it , they are rats
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:19:01
and if you see investors moving money away it's because they believe 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:39:10
Free world energy , US starts war with North Korea , Internet its going to be shut down 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:04:19
i would love to show you screenshots i feel weird because it's like i'm
the only one noticing this 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:36:10
so i can't hold large amounts of gold lingots in my house ? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:40:55
that's why bitcoin is not going anywhere it's here to stay
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:53:04
how do they know who to Fine 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:04:57
i bought at 10.5k and i'm buying when it's cheaper too 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:49:08
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:15:00
so what should we buy , apart from HOLDING bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:56:05
holding then:( i hope it's a lot because i bought late so i feel it's insignificant 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:26:55
im thinking the lowest will be 10.7k
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:07:52
something serious is going on in those HIGH LIFE worlds and we don't even know about it , they want us to sell bitcoin but everyone is HOLDING, they want to own most of bitcoins so they can control the market but that just make the prize higher because everyone is holding lol , it's just backfiring , i want to see how long it will take them to realize they are late to the game 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:54:51
what is this future ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:54:40
lmaooo nice hahahah
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:37:50
it's because it's weekend , banks doesn't work on weekdays 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:16:05
start it 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:23:01
if bitcoin goes to zero , everything goes to zero because bitcoin is the base of everything 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:17:06
its not a math problem , just i used easy language to explain you, each time a new block its discovered , the next one is gonna take more time and power to find
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:53:27
at this point i just trust in bitcoin , because it's the oldest 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:53:38
the end is never my friend 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:00:12
exactly so how is that even posible , or the market has gone crazy or some SERIUS SHIT IS GOING ON UNDER OUR NOSES and obviously companies don't feel happy about it so they will just stay silent on the whole thing , even fucking netflix is affected , nintendo the list goes on , i've been watching the market(stocks of companies) with detail and they all start dropping the November 28 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:33:41
This 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:28:59
oh shit 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:33:26
if not we should have more volatility , and also have you seen Apple , facebook ,amazon , sony , tesla and other tech companies stocks ? they are all in red lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:25:09
they use btc to gain trust if btc goes up everyone goes up , that's why i bought other cryptos just to hold 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:20:55
im not saying it's possible i'm just saying stuff that could make btc drop
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:08:34
don't trust him 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:18:13
i give you 5k for your bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:16:42
im buying more lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:05:14
if you didn't buy at 10.8k don't ever thing you are going to have another chance anytime soon 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:39:41
last weekend bitcoin over the week didn't blew , this is the first weekend of the bitcoin era AKA the Bitcoin fever 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:27:57
yes exactly for now i'm buying as much of this rare coin to have in possession  , and someone have to give a good amount of value for me to trade some of the part 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:52:22
lmao this dude doesn't understand the power of the internet , if we made battlefront 2 a total shit , we can make with our confidence and memes , bitcoin price skyrocket 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:51:30
Ok so , do you think miners are getting tired of mining bitcoins , and want to switch to another crypto ? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:28:53
fees are high because traffic is high 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:23:32
thats why i think , that everyone that is putting their money in bitcoin must be willing to lose it all , if not then what the fuck are you doing on this market in the first place?
to make some money?
thats not how it works , thats not how everything of this works.
if you are investing on bitcoin , you are investing on the future without banks and centralised money , if the bitcoins that we are holding today can buy us a tesla a house or a Coffee it doesn't matter , what matter is that we changed the world of money and we were the first ones that understood this movement.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:12
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:30:23
we should create a @_date: 2017-12-03 00:41:22
also you can't predict here , we are in unknown waters all this helps us understand how this work , but this week that passed was really different than the previous week so we can't say they will behave exactly the same , in just telling you what , im HOLDING i won't sel this bitcoins i have unless someone gives me a Lambo or something 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:36:51
they have a old mind , they will just see this as an normal stock exchange , but what they don't know is that most people is HOLDING 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:49:51
how do you know ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:31:44
lmao the same as i was thinking 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:28:28
exactly my thoughts 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:05:26
lmao ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:32:28
It's because bank transactions doesn't work at weekdays 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:29:22
btc wasn't made to be as a daily currency 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:40:43
exactly or cut trans atlantic cables 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:50:11
i am ready 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:34:02
the more it's worth , the less btc will be removed from your account 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:13:25
so what you are planning to jail more than 20million americans ? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:03:31
because the world first need to adapt dude , we are currently on the 1% of the whole world that understand how this works , have patience , what do you want to all this transition to be from one day to the other ? i'm doing all i can to educate people about bitcoin and so do everyone that is HOLDING right now should do it , also in my business i'm putting Bitcoin and other crypto Accepted , just putting my grain of salt 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:53:51
that's why i'm putting my whole trust on bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:18:55
but if high fees are up but the price per each bitcoin is higher then you should spend less bitcoins to pay that fee 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:26:55
bitcoin won't be used as daily currency , in the future , but other cryptos yes they will
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:43:25
awww that's so nice!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:29:23
don't hack me please 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:37:43
se me dificulta tanto comprar bitcoin en países latinoamericanos 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:00:43
or maybe everyone stoped at once mining bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:30:00
i don't feel this is the right subreddit to
post this 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:58:53
dude just hold that's it , i've got 3 different cryptos because i sold a little bit of my bitcoin when it was higher , since all the other cryptos goes up when btc goes up i don't recommend bitcoin trading since the network fees are really high ATM , i got dash and bitcoin cash , just in case they ever reach past 5k , the trick of this all market it's to hold and don't be scared of dips , and also being able to enjoy the memes it's amazing , HODL
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:30:55
thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:16:35
that's how i see the limit of growth of bitcoin , 0.00000001 btc=1usd
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:17:41
Dude i'm from Panama i understand you , the best advise i can give you is to try and educate your friends , and go on with more and more people , incentivize to accept bitcoins if you own a local 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:06:05
also go to nasdaq.com and tell me if you see any green numbers ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:42:41
and i only have a small amount of bitcoins but for me it's worth more , and i think everyone that is holding knows that their bitcoin are worth more , so
that is what brings the price higher , so when wallstreet involves on bitcoin don't sell them because it's a rare asset we have , we won't give them the power of
bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:58:51
wow ok 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:14:21
they don't want us to hold
so we HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:02:23
it is 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:52:25
i hope it's like it , that's why we should start spreading mature behavior toward this because it's quite serious , and we can make memes but not do it everything as a joke , if this is affecting wall street then it's some serious shit , and you could bet your ass there are a lot of people willing to buy bitcoin but don't understand how it work or where do
they start , imagine like explaining how a cellphone works to your grandpa 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:44:45
i need more
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:53:19
oh shit really 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:51:07
btc is backed by mathematics and algorithms processed by multiples computers and time and energy 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:20:38
government disappear bitcoin or gold ? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:26

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:24
just hold , btc it's the one and only , the others we don't know their intentions 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:04:04
check it yourself , if you have iphone just use that stock app
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:32:27
but they have literally free electricity so indeed they can make something..... if they do it right 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:52:04
HODL it's the only thing you need to know 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:00:13
i have my crypto on exodus , is it secure ? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:39:43
Governments going to track and kill every bitcoin owner
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:36:48
Bitcoin is gold 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:12:14
exactly , 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:50:44
just HODL PLEASE THATS ALL IM ASKING 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:48
im holding here 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:26:15
im holding , im holding x and im proud of it lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:05:15
check them out them side by side and compare when do they start dropping and when does the bitcoins Blowups start
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:17:52
it's so hard to buy bitcoin right now 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:12:22
thanks , i'm doing this, i think in the end BTC will be the one and only 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:05:46
oh really? nice 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:47:47
i tried but they don't let me put my card And also im living abroad until january and i don't want to set everything up in this country if i don't know how it will work back in my country
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:31:01
so how do i get a paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:31:24

@_date: 2017-11-20 17:13:19
and now i cant even veryfy my identity to put my creditcard
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:21:24
ok so im from panamá , google it if you don't know where it is , and i'm studying in london until january , and i don't know if that affects my credentials 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:58:47
im in london at the moment , and i live in Panama the reason i didn't give any info is because here on reddit they remove everything you try to post or comment( like personal info and shit ) , so i didn't want my post to be removed 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:25:36
yes same as me , sometimes sucks being young 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:17:32
this money doesn't affect me at all , i just don't want to have it laying down on a bank account 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:29:31
i remember telling my uncle to buy when it was at 1 dollar 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:52:58
sorry mate , if they won't take bitcoin from me , then i could give you some , but they take more than i'm sending 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:15:37
yes , they asked for my ID verification but it could never been verified 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:44:55
i've heard btc will be cheaper in a couple of days 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:10:54
can you explain me what are exchanges and wallets, i suppose wallets are where you store bitcoin(although i prefer writing it down)
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:52:20
i just have this feel , it's like a tactic to indirectly end cryptocurrency or at least affect it 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:22:22
can you recommend me good information places/vídeos , i want to get informed as much as i can 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:39:21
that's the other thing , so i don't trust it anymore but i don't know enough to prove it 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:26:29
so im fucked , i am just able to sit here and watch , you don't know how painfull it is 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:56:49
okay 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:43:58
3 days ago
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:11:30
movement is starting g 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:40:20
so it's time to buy right ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:50:34
the amount of transaction fee is too high , i could give you a small amount of btc but they will take more
btc for transaction than for what i'm willing to give you 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:30:55
seems sketchy AF
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:40:46
what does Hodl means? is not hold ? is the same.  ?
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:52:27
LMAOOOOO����������AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
