I'm unable to withdraw as of now. When will withdrawing be enabled for my account? Is there a specific issue w/ my account?
Edit: The notice changed.
It says "Notice: Your account is currently restricted from withdrawing because your BitGo wallet is frozen and accurate accounting can not be determined for your balances." However Bitfinex was able to accurately show the account balance earlier.

**Have you ever tried to transfer more than $10k in the US?**
You might need to pay $50 for a wire transfer or you might need to wait 3-5 days for the transfer to "clear". The system is run on something called ACH -- which is super slow and was built in the 70s.Contrast this with Bitcoin, where I can transfer millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin for a few cents and it arrives quickly (within an hour).
**Have you ever tried to transfer money internationally?**
Same issues as above, except it's even worse on the backend -- especially in countries without a developed banking system.
**Have you ever tried to build a business that deals with payments?**
You have to deal with fraud +  chargebacks all the time (ecommerce business pay a huge amount of money to mitigate these risks). Bitcoin doesn't allow chargebacks, so once the money is in your account then you do not need to wonder whether the bank will take it back. With Bitcoin, you are in control of your money.
**Have you ever tried to build an app that integrates with the banking system?**
Their systems are old and very messy to integrate with. There are some slick layers that try to hide this complexity, but it is like putting lipstick on a pig. Bitcoin is much better to integrate with than integrating with 100 different banks who use 100 different systems that change all the time.
**Have you ever lived in a country with high inflation like Venezuela?**
Your money becomes worthless pretty quick. Bitcoin is deflationary, so it is supposed to get more valuable over time. Incompetent governments can't mess with this currency.
Those are just a few reasons. **We are just scratching the surface.** There are more cool concepts like multisignature transactions, smart contracts (voting, ledger systems, identity systems), and anonymity that Bitcoin enables.
If you're interested in investing, read about why people invest in gold and you'll realize that Bitcoin has many similarities to it and even a few advantages over it. We are in the early stages a profound technology that will shake up the current system.

Your points are fair and similar to what was saying. See my reply there.
The mom who is intimidated by technology probably won't use it today. But, when someone creates an app useful + usable enough for her to use it, then you might see her use it without even knowing it. 
There are lots of startups and innovators working on making useful + usable apps on top of Bitcoin. An example on the front page of today is the web browser, Brave ( But, we are only in the early stages and time will tell what use cases flourish.

The thing is, there is only like $5 on the Bitgo wallet (whose wallet doesn't seem to be locked). Bitfinex could just subtract $5 from my balance let me withdraw the remainder. I have a relatively significant amount of BTC stuck in Bitfinex because of this. I believe it is within their control and they could account for it.

Seems like you copy-pasted from this thread: 
I copy-pasted a few points from that thread as well:
1. Are there any credible and verifiable sources about Hearn's job at Google and how he allegedly left the internal network completely unencrypted which allowed the NSA easy direct access?
2. IIRC, it turned out, the fork was caused by an unforeseeable bug in the database understructure not the bitcoin commit.
3. You can also read in this subreddit that Mike wan to ban TOR, that's totally opposite to his vision. Mike Hearn tried to use TOR for all the transactions using BitcoinJ (the Java implementation of Bitcoin that he developed) plus he defended stealth-addresses for Bitcoin.
4. In regard to redlisting, 
Mike Hearn seems to have nuanced views on redlisting, rather than a strong stance advocating for them.

I've heard that you need to settle on-chain far too often.
Let's say there are two channels:
1. Alice &lt;--&gt; Bob
2. Bob &lt;--&gt; Carol
In channel 2, Bob has a balance of 0 BTC. Alice sends Bob a payment of 1 BTC through payment channel 1.
Based on my understanding, Bob can NOT send Carol 1 BTC unless he settles his payment channel with Alice on chain and funds payment channel 2. Is this true? Is Bob able to send Carol a payment of 1 BTC with out settling payment channel 1?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:38:21
I know that if Bob has a balance, Alice can send bitcoin to Carol through Bob.
The question I originally posted is slightly different. If Alice sends 1 bitcoin to Bob (who originally had a balance of 0 on both payment channels), can Bob then send 1 BTC to Carol?

I think it's a myth that cash based futures don't affect price.
For e.g. if the price of BTC futures is above market, then people could have a cash and carry arbitrage ( They could do the opposite if the price is under. In both scenarios, this arbitrage requires holding or selling the underlying asset.

Mt Gox's custom wallet implementation did not account for transaction malleability issues. This means that someone could withdraw BTC from their account and change the transaction id on the fly. 
Mt Gox's wallet implementation will check the blockchain for the transaction using the changed transaction id and think that they never actually sent the BTC. So, since it appears that they never sent BTC, Mt Gox would would resend more BTC from their hot wallet. This is how hackers took advantage of Mt Gox's naive wallet implementation.
Since this was an automated process (i.e. no human actually checked withdrawals and there were no hard limits), Mt Gox sent a lot of BTC that they shouldn't have. Hope that helps clear things up.

Coinbase tipping allows both.
You can send to a bitcoin address which goes to the user's Coinabse account (onchain) or can use your Coinbase account (offchain).
If it was just offchain, then it would not be much different than Venmo, Paypal, or Square. But, Coinbase gives you options.

If they got hacked, there's a good chance you would lose your money. Consider all of the previous exchanges that have been hacked. Your coins and the exchange are not insured by anyone. If they aren't able to cover the hack, the company would probably go bankrupt and it's assets sliced and distributed. Though, out of all the exchanges, Gemini is probably one of the most trustworthy. Regardless of their trustworthiness, without insurance they would not be able to cover such large losses in the case of a hack.
Also, your money is less secure than being at a bank. The percent of banks where people lost their money in the past 5 years is way less than 1%. However, the % of crypto exchanges that got hacked (or scammed their customers) and people lost their money in the past 5 years is greater than 70%. That's pretty crazy when you think about it. In addition, banks have FDIC insurance which limits losses for your account, whereas, Bitcoin exchanges do not.
Don't store your coins on an exchange. I tell you all of this because I had a similar mentality as you and I lost coins in the Bitfinex hack. It's not worth it.
In addition, Gemini started supporting zero confirmation Bitcoin deposits recently ( So your point about being able to offload coins quickly is moot. 
Do yourself a favor and download a wallet (Copay, Mycelium, etc.) and store your Bitcoins offline in cold storage. It's a bit of work, but it might save you much grief later. Well worth the cost.
EDIT: If you still want to store your coins on an exchange for whatever reason (which I wouldn't recommend), then a good way to derisk yourself is to store your coins across multiple exchanges. So, if one exchange goes under, your whole Bitoin portfolio is not gone.

To play devil's advocate, Core also has a governance model. Decisions need to be made and not every random piece of code goes into core. The debate should be centered around what structure is better.
You make some fair points about weak points with BU.


There are, however, some weak points in Core's governance model as well. Seems like Blockstream, a private corporation w/ vested interests, has too strong of a influence on what gets put into Core.
I don't have a good answer or an alternative for how the protocol should be developed. However, I do know the governance model of Core and BU has ticked off many people. Any ideas on how to make both sides better?

Core is terrible at communication.
What they've developed is amazing. Segregated witness. 
- Fixes transaction malleability
- Is a block size increase  
- Activated via soft-fork (which is a great precedent to set considering contentious hard forks undermine the network consensus rules)
- Enables countless innovations on top of it such as lightning network
This is a great scaling solution when you think about it.
For several years, these points were not highlighted. A large part of the community didn't think we had a decent scaling plan, even though we did. I even thought that. That's where large blockers got traction and a community. Big blockers scaling solution is easier to digest and Core never really tried to communicate how awesome their solution was to majority of the community (non-technical people and non-academics) until it was too late.
As much crap as this community gives Gavin, Peter R, or even Roger Ver...they created a community that believes in their ideas by simply communicating them more powerfully than Core. This is why the big block camp started getting more powerful :  even though Core's solution is technically better.
Core's largest weakness is in full show here. This isn't an interesting open source development project anymore. There are governments and industries with large vested interests manipulating public perception at their whim and dividing the community.
I hope we are able to stick to a tech meritocracy as far as Bitcoin's protocol goes. But there is much more that needs to be done to maintain an accurate public perception and fight these vested interests.

To legally run a Bitcoin business with customers in NYC, you have to get a Bitlicense. That's why they got the Bitlicense.
SEC was referring to the unregulated nature of most exchanges in the crypto space. More specifically, BTC-E, Huobi, OkCoin, BTCChina, Bitfinex, etc. which account for a large volume of Bitcoin transactions.

Sorry about that. Didn't mean to be rude. Just saw that people were interested in getting a shirt made and were requesting it. I also noticed that you wanted to sell stickers instead of a shirt.
Regardless, because it is your design, I can send you any profit made from this campaign. If you can PM me your details, that would be great.

Nick Szabo has an interesting essay called "Shelling Out: The Origins of Money"[1] which goes into some details on collectibles and how humans evolved to use them. They were useful for trade. Tribes that could trade could survive temporary adverse conditions by trading those collectibles for necessities, they could specialize in specific skills and therefore produce more, they could cooperate more instead of relying on supply, demand, and time happily coincinding, and they could more peacefully settle disputes and punish crimes. In effect, they were much more productive as a society and could survive any condition better.
Art is a unique collectible in that it optimizes for the quality of being extremely difficult to forge.


He goes on to argue that the reason art is valued even higher today than in previous eras is because government issued fiat is a terrible store of value.

Not that weird of a question. It's pretty legitimate.
We need 95% to activate. ~10% of the hashpower has been going to Bitcoin Unlimited. Representatives from ViaBTC and BTC.com mining pool seem to indicate that they'll by blocking segwit. Even the Bitmain founder (whose pools control a significant amount of hashpower &gt;15% if not significantly more) indicates they need code for a 2mb hardfork prior to adopting Segwit.
With this information, it seems like a good question to ask.
@_date: 2016-11-13 17:46:24
Thanks for this response. Why isn't the FUD being cleared up? I've seen "LN is vaporware" in a bunch of places and believed it. It is quite confusing even for a person who follows things closely.
Do they have a timeline when these are ready for production use? I know they are dependent on Segwit, so is it like a month after Segwit launches? Or a year?
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:05:20
That would mean they own $5.6 billion of crypto. Goldman Sachs' market cap is only $90 billion. It seems very unlikely that they would invest so much.

We can't get Segwit above 50% miner support. What makes you think a much more contentious UASF would get that kind of support?
I'm not sure how much hashrate he controls, but many miners might have similar stances as him. Most of the hashrate is controlled by a few people and it's pretty clear they don't like Segwit. Not sure how we'd even get them to want a UASF.

I think you're trying to create a narrative of Bitcoin users that might not be wholly accurate. We're a diverse group of people from all different backgrounds. That's partly what's amazing about this -- it's a global phenomenon that's taking the world by storm.
Regardless, I tried my best to answer some of the questions.


No one is at the center of the revolution. It empowers everyone.
In bitcoin, there are different interests (users, miners, exchanges, developers) where some people might have more influence over everyone. However, one of the strengths of Bitcoin is that it takes away the need to trust a central figure to make sure everything is ok.


Many people are not just in it for the money. There are many reasons why someone would choose to get interested. Some people are in it to take their financial sovereignty back.
Others are in it for the cool tech and applications that it enables - smart contracts on the blockchain, foreign exchange transfers, decentralized exchange, decentralized commerce, etc.


People can hold their wealth in Bitcoin. They can fund research, protocol development, or related open source projects. They can set up a company that utilize Bitcoin - decentralized exchange, ecommerce, smart contracts, mining, etc. They can also share their knowledge about Bitcoin and empower other individuals with this new technology.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2016-09-22 21:12:30
@_date: 2016-09-04 13:40:26
it's too centralized....so can't really trust it (might as well put your money in a bank at that rate)


Maybe a bank would appreciate this technology. However, as a Bitcoiner, I am not too interested in it.

I think Jihan Wu already controls more hash power than that. So he can attack the network. Also, if several of the mining pool owners colluded, then they could certainly attack the network. Having Bitcoin mining centralized is probably the greatest threat to Bitcoin at the moment.

I was pretty passionate about bitcoin while in college as well. This was advice given to me by an entrepreneur who I respect. 
Most Bitcoin startups right now will fail because they need to spend most of their time educating potential customers on what Bitcoin is. There will be much more success in this industry after this phase is over. The 2nd generation of startups wouldn't need to explain what Bitcoin is to customers.
Taking this into account, I didn't start my career with Bitcoin and instead opted to go into a more traditional field. To make a viable career out of Bitcoin is difficult right now. If you are really interested in it, join a FinTech company that you think can benefit from Bitcoin in 10 years. In 10 years, when the next generation of Bitcoin startups are born, you can use your industry + crypto knowledge to earn an income. But right now, there isn't much money to be made consulting in crypto (unless you're *extremely* knowledgable on the topic).
Anyways, take my advice for what it's worth. Stay hungry and stay foolish.

You can replenish your wallet with Bitcoin bought from the exchange.
