I thought we fixed recessions a long time ago. Wasnt that why central banking was invented?

I think you are looking at it wrong.

\&gt;  What type of adoption are you looking for?
Things like bitmex is something we take for granted. But Bitmex doesent work without bitcoin. So im looking for more things like this. Businesses that go all in on Bitcoin and become succesful. If i knew excactly what it was, i would try to create that business myself i guess.

I dont get it. I see small and medium gaming competition regularly. but is the prize in any of them Bitcoin? No. Why not? Its such an obvious prize. Its international and so on. Anyone can recieve Bitcoin. Not so much with Dollars and so on. Im out
