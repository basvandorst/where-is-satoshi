I've wondered this as well. Bitcoin will become even more rare and that would drive the price upwards. However if it's too rare, it will kill the opportunity for day to day use

I wonder how many customers they lost that day

I'm in the same situation, I'm starting to diversify my long term holdings instead of just btc. I'm normally just day trading while increasing the amount of bitcoin I hold. But with the new year comes new investors, and no one new wants to buy into a down trending chart. This will drive others up and bitcoin further down.
This being said, I still believe in BTC, so that will remain a solid amount of my long term portfolio, but I am also starting to branch out.

I'm sure a lot of retailers. I've read about a lot of sites accepting small coins due to the fact that they have almost no fees compared to bank transactions

I'll personally be buying more, just waiting on the transfer to go through. I add what I can afford to lose, I wouldn't recommend anyone who is skeptical or new to crypto. I'm comfortable since I've been around for a few corrections now so I've gotten used to this.
It's being over exaggerated because of all of the new people losing money and panicking

It's common sense

Why are people surprised by this? They legally need to collect this information. It's not them doing an injustice, it's them keeping track incase of any illegal activity so they don't get punished for it
