Sure, I agree, but is that really the main issue preventing global crypto adoption ? No it is not, so my point was why is that seemingly the focus now rather than the real important issues. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:47:48
This is awesomesauce; These are the types of things we need for better mass adoption potential.

Miners dropping off will have no affect on congestion - just like with bitcoin there will be a difficulty adjustment to match the mining speed. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:20:55
Why do I feel like this sub has turned into BTC vs other cryptos rather than BTC vs Fiat. Come on people the other cryptos aren’t the ‘enemy’ we should focus on adoption and using BTC to better the world. Yea BTC is king but the other cryptos shouldn’t be the focus - rather crypto adoption and usage in general. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:03:38
Ehhh a more accurate analogy would be Bitcoin is TCP and Ethereum is VMWare

There are companies that do - Tesla for example. The more and more climate change becomes a reality the more people with jump on board with renewables. Hopefully it will not be too late...
@_date: 2018-05-09 12:09:14
This actually is a pretty good idea, it’s a shame I’m not an artist...

Any power source that saves the earth from a heat death is cheaper if you factor
in all costs like environmental costs and therefore well worth it.

Ethereum is providing additional functionality which results in the increased size. Why do some people insist on comparing it to bitcoin ? It is widely different and comparing it to bitcoin is silly. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:47:30
Yea all my stocks are hurting bad too.

I ended up adding a different card.....

He can't because his only explanation would be 'maximalist'. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:35:36
Wow dude ... epic fail. First off this is a picture of the model 3, not the S, secondly sales numbers have nothing to do with your claim of quality. They are not a 'meme' company; The model 3 was rated as the safest car in the world, is more efficient than the volt by a factor of 2, with almost twice the range, and has a zero to 60 of 4 seconds. I don't know if your just trolling or ignorant and don't read up on EV facts but w/e. There is a reason you are being downvoted into oblivion. Educate yourself, stop spreading lies.  
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:02:43
Why such strong sarcasm lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:56:12
Ah ok cool that is cheap. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 15:51:04
The very fact that I cannot argue with you on why you are wrong without getting banned is reason enough on why being a maximalist is in fact not a good explanation. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:55:58
Your right, it should be overly complicated like every other car interior out there.  /s
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:25:15
So all the ones I looked at online were closer to &lt;$1,000  
I guess there are some cheaper ones that you can get elsewhere ?
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:57:57
So it's a read only connection that requires expensive satellite connectivity infrastructure to receive. How is this good for poor countries ?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:11:18
You literally get banned from here if you say anything negative about bitcoin or positive about bcash how is downvotes on r btc worse than that? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:14:38
So it looks like China might be cracking down on miners via power costs. Multiple news sources starting to come out with information. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:04:18
I completely disagree, there is plenty of pro bitcoin data on there. The difference is they also allow criticism. When you allow uncensored discussion to be fully realized then the advantages certain altcoins may have on a fundamental level over bitcoin comes up. If I were to discuss how an altcoin that has better core features on here, even if its a fact, I would be banned. You can discuss bitcoin/altcoins/blockchain all in one place and it not be a bad thing. 
When you censor discussion to be 'positive talks' only for a specific coin only its always a bad thing because then the full reality of cryptocurrencies/blockchain is completely hidden and cannot be realized. Intelligent people enjoy discussion that looks at all sides instead of a single viewpoint. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 05:30:33
It was a massive mistake buying a crypto that went from 1.00 to 4.50? I'd say that is a big win. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 23:26:09
Giving identity + buying crypto &gt; not giving identity + not buying crypto 
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:14:20
Ah yes - even more statements proving your extremism. You know we already get it , you don’t have to keep making it so obvious. Also, even tho as an extremist it’s hard for you to understand , you can actually like both eth for what it is, and Bitcoin for what it is while recognizing both have strengths. It’s called critical thinking and you should try it sometime; It’ll open up a world of new areas for you to explore mentally that I promise will be very satisfying. But don’t take my word for it, I’m just some random guy - the great Bitcoiner andreas antonopoulos has a YouTube channel you should check out for some good crypto education/insights. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:59:18
Ah so your the extremist , cool thanks for making it obvious.

If it’s a Synology prob a quad core atom, celeron, or pentium d depending on what model.

He would have had to lay everyone off if he did not implement KYC. This is just the sucky reality of running legally in the US. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:58:24
Wait only 4%? I know we are at like 8 tx/s but how high can we really get on chain with segwit ? Should this additional transaction volume be considered scaling? Scaling would be lightning imo. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:58:46
What unique attributes does bitcoin have that makes it a real crypto and all the others not? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:24:42
Bitcoin is truly amazing but there is lots of other crypto/blockchain tech out there that are trying to solve real world problems. Intelligent people tend to avoid closing themselves off from information sources whether they agree with their opinions or not. Gathering information from all possible sources is the only way to gain truly educated understanding. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:45:50
Does that apply to the people that call Bitcoin Cash, Bcash?
@_date: 2016-05-25 04:13:30
But how fast ?
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:42:03
Litecoin block time is 2.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes. Also they have Segwit and much less transaction volume. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:03:36
Yea Verizon just switched their whole network and many more are following suit. IPv6 isn't dead rather delayed. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:30:58
There is some data missing here though. With a 5 cent fee ethereum transactions still get confirmed, it just takes 1-2 minutes instead of 15 seconds. But yea I agree single block confirmation times are high cost ATM!
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:27:54
That's one expensive game haha
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:55:10
Very true! 
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:26:20
That's one expensive game haha!

If your a Futurama fan and like the typical mobile phone style 'slow progression' type games it's not too bad! 
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:24:01
Why so hostile? I've been involved in bitcoin since 2011 - it's a fun screenshot nothing serious....it's literally a game fake asking for Bitcoin (no payment address). Telling people to run away if they don't understand something is not a good policy on this popular bitcoin sub imo. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:33:44
:') lol - only 1/4 of the way through but I hope so ;P
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:51:12
Yes of course you do - the IRS will probably figure it out and come after you if you do not. As soon as you sell your BTC back to USD and realize gains make sure your tracking it so you can pay them correctly.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:53:12
It is not a sensationalist title. A sensationalist title would be something more along the lines of 'Bitcoin network vulnerable against quantum processors, IBM already has a working quantum processor'. This title tells you all the basic information and it is accurate. If someone is impacted by a title but fails to actually read the rest of the information on the subject then he/she is at fault not the author. Anyone who would actually make financial trades based on simply a title and not further research or ... at a minimum ... read the rest of the article honestly deserves to learn that financially expensive lesson. Why should authors adapt their titles to people who make bad decision with no research?

Copied from another thread to uncover some truth on the matter -  
This again, lol
"**Binance Response:**
The  account is under investigation as a result of suspected fraudulent  activity. During the investigation of this case, Binance does guarantee  the security of the account's assets. This has been addressed multiple  times and the situation is the same, otherwise, we would have let you  know.
We have also already advised you to contact your local law enforcement, as shown in [your screenshot]( but oddly enough, it seems you are more interested in posting on Reddit. Furthermore, [your video]( of [your altered screenshot]( still does not match [the real response that you received](
While you are free to continue posting on Reddit, it has no bearing on the investigation and will not change the situation."
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:27:50
How is it FUD if it shows accurate data and even implies we are very far away from achieving anything short term. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:20:44
Wow good points , hopefully this can light a fire and get some unity in the bitcoin community.
