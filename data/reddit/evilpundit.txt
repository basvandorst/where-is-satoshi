Is there any possibility that defrauded customers might be compensated? 
By mining those bitcoins, they not only used the machines and denied them to customers - but they also raised the difficulty level - thus adding to the losses of buyers.

I've considered turning to some other coin - perhaps dogecoin, which seems popular. But if my pool decreases the payout threshold, currently at 0.1 BTC, I'll keep mining BTC for a while.
The problem I saw was that many people who weren't in the first wave of ASIC buyers would have been very disappointed with the ROI, which diminished very rapidly. These people might just give up on mining altogether, rather than buying into the next generation of ASICS.
However, if the difficulty rate can come down, then that shouldn't be too much of a problem. For some reason I thought it was designed never to decrease, but I was wrong about that.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:45:55
Ah, that solves the problem, should it ever arise! Thank you.
Now I'll keep my mining rig around even if I turn it off - it might be useful again someday.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:32:26
But wouldn't the difficulty setting make hashing slow regardless? Or can the difficulty level decrease, rather than just ratcheting upwards?
I had the impression that difficulty was set to always increase.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:16:58
Thank you! I'll look into that.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:16:35
That sounds very impressive indeed!
I have a 300 mhash GPU rig sitting iidle. I think I need to reaserch this urgently.

About four or five weeks ago, my Bitcoin-QT cliernt stopped loading the blockchain. Despite upgrading to the latest version, and installing the 64-bit version, I have been unable to get it wiorking again.
That's why my node is down. If I could get it to work again, I'd be back up.
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:22:06
Is there a big difference in hash rates between Bitcoin and scrypt? I'm using BTC hashrates, which are the only ones I know.
Also, thanks for the link! Looks very useful.
Obviously I need to do a bit of research.

Of course I did! That's a *genuine* photo of a bitcoin!

What do you actually mean by a "prompt"? It's unclear to me what you want done.

I am beginning to suspect not. I have a theory that Satoshi Nakamoto is not one person, but a group of people with expertise in mathematics, cryptography, programming, economics, finance and more.
The Bitcoin framework is incredibly well engineered. It seems to be free of loopholes, and able to cope with future eventualities. While it is possible that a single person could have created the spec, I think it is unlikely.
Instead, I think that Bitcoin is a collaborative project - possibly originating within DARPA, the NSA, or some other government agency. 
Consider the history: 
Internet itself was created by DARPA.
TOR was developed by the US Naval Research laboratory.
Now, a seemingly unbreakable, anonymous, international currency appears out of nowhere, like Venus springing from Zeus' forehead.
When put into historical context seems like part of a trend of US government departments creating open, accessible, and strong protocols for digital interaction.
Edit: Also, it's surprising to note that the tightly government-controlled Chinese TV network also seems to approve of Bitcoin - to the point of actively promoting it in a documentary feature.
Perhaps there are some people within various world governments who think a worldwide digital cash solution would be beneficial - or might help to avoid depression and war?

How does Bitcoin embody contract law?
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:34:36
That's a thought - though I got the Swift code from their page at the same time I sent the payment. 
Maybe I should hit F5. :)
Given my experience and that of others, I might look for other ways to buy bitcoins.

Obviously, the governments and/or intelligence agencies of many countries are involved in cyber affairs of many kinds.
US, Israel, China, Russia, Britain, Japan - who knows what they're up to?
"Satoshi" could be anyone, or any group. "Satoshi" could be a 12 year old Ethiopian girl at a web cafe, or a ten-billion dollar black project of a superpower. We just don't know.
I'm just guessing, based on previous history. It seems that American military and security research, in particular, has a habit of spinning off very useful technologies. But this does not rule out other possibilitis.

The news of the fincen regulations might also be contributing.
However, I think this, too, will pass. If it gets below a certain number, I'll buy more.

Thanks again. I'll have to re-read this many times, since there is a lot to bitcoin that I don't understand.
It seems the more I learn, the less I know!

Is a brainwallet the same as a pass phrase for Bitcoin-QT, or is it something else?
@_date: 2013-05-25 15:58:25
So I should back up my wallet after each transaction?

Thank you - it's good enough for me!
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:10:40
If we don't know who Satoshi is, then all we have is speculation.
I speculate that it is possible, but not very likely, for one individual to have done such a thorough job requiring enormous expertise in several different fields.
"Satoshi" is obviously a cover identity. Whether what it covers is one individual, or a group, is unknown.

I tried to deposit some money in Mt Gox a couple of weeks ago. My Australian bank said the wire transfer didn't go through, because their bank in Japan refused to accept it.
I wonder if that's relevant?
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:13:28
My country's government is English speaking, but it is not the US government. :)
I only point the finger at the US government due to the precedent of some of its departments creating distributed digital protocols that aren't controlled by a central node or authority.
Of course any other person or group could do this, but the US has a track record.
@_date: 2013-05-29 13:39:37
I certainly don't expect bitcoin to stay stable forever. Various events will change the price.
But it seems to have reached a consensus plateau value in the current environment.
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:23:33
I'd like to think that, but [my tentative conclusion is different](
I think the US government approves of Bitcoin, because like TOR and the Internet, it was *created* by the US government - or parts thereof.
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:27:50
Thanks for the detailed explanation.
So such an attack is possible, but unlikely to succeed.

Unlikely. Cash didn't end taxation.

Okay, I get that, more or less. It works if the script determines that certain conditions have been met.
But let's try an example. Fred agrees to deliver 100 widgets to Joe by 1st June 2014. Upon delivery, Joe will pay 100 bitcoins. This is written into a script.
On 3oth May, Fred announces he has delivered the 100 widgets on schedule. However, Joe says he didn't receive them.
What does the script do? How does it decide who's telling the truth?
It can get more complicated than that, as well. Fred makes the widgets, but he delivers using Bob's courier service. Bob is not a party to the contract between Fred and Joe - Bob's contract is with Fred. Fred says Bob told him the widgets were delivered to Joe on time, but Joe says he's never heard of this "Bob" and hasn't received any widgets. And so on.
How does the script decide whether the contract has been fulfilled or not?
@_date: 2013-08-01 01:12:11
As an Australian, I'm also interested in this question. BitInnovate is closed indefinitely, and my attempt to transfer money to my Mt Gox account failed.

Is it possible for the Chinese government to get control of 51% of the nodes, by encouraging its citizens to host them?
If this happened, would China control Bitcoin?

That was one which never made it into the wild. Internet and TOR did. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:29:04
I think it *is* possible that a single person could have designed Bitcoin.
Just not very likely.

My bitcoin-qt wallet file is protected by a password. Does that mean physical possession of one of the backup copies won't give access to my funds, unless the password is known?
In other words, is it safe to keep multiple copies, some of which may be accessible to others, as long as the password is secure?
@_date: 2013-06-07 16:30:05
It seems bitcoin provides a reliable technical means of delivery once all parties agree a contract has been fulfilled, but humans will still argue about whether or not fulfilment has occurred.
Unexpected situations can make it difficult to decide whether the terms have been fulfilled or not. Bad players can exploit loopholes in agreements. I think that's where contract law becomes tricky.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:33:17
Another moronic question - what's a 51% attack?
@_date: 2013-06-07 15:59:19
Interesting. Though I suspect the contract lawyers will survive by arguing over what the exact terms of the contracts actually mean. A huge part of law resides in interpreting precise wording and intent.
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:49:29
You are right; I am not familiar with the history.
Though, if "Satoshi" is an individual building on what other people have done before - then in effect Bitcoin is a group effort.
And, if "Satoshi" is some shadowy organisation, then it's likely that group would have dug up the history of crypto-currencies in order to develop the best standard.
Almost all technologies have predecessors; but this one is remarkably well-conceived, and so far, seems to have provided for almost any possible loophole.
It could be the invention of a lone genius - but its extraordinary resistance to hacking makes me think it was extensively tested against attack before being released. And that would require more than one person.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:40:31
They are indeed speedy. I've used BitInnovate twice now, and both times the bitcoins were in my wallet by the time I got home from the bank. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:32:51
Thank you - I *will* be reading much more, as you suggest.


A large government is not a unitary body with a single purpose and ideal - especially when some degree of democracy is involved. We already have the example of the invention of the Internet, which bypasses government control of the media, to a large extent. There may be other factions within government, which feel the same way about fiat money.
As I've said before, I'm speculating in the absence of knowledge. I hope to gain more knowledge, and I welcome your input.
@_date: 2013-05-29 13:59:48
I'm simply noting the resemblance of the curve to a change from one metastable state to another. It may or may not have any significance - and it certainly has no predictive value - but nature tends to re-use mathematical patterns and it's a simile that occurred to me.
This phase won't last forever, because unpredictable events will inevitably drive the price in the long term. It just seems to have reached a plateau of sorts, for the time being.
@_date: 2013-05-25 16:37:35
I've only made one outgoing transaction so far, so I'm probably safe. But I'll back up often anyway.
@_date: 2013-07-19 02:06:27
Luckily my bank returned the money, minus exchange fees (I had foolishly sent it in USD).
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:07:53
It would have to be a paper wallet backup, because having the backup on a computer would lose the advantage of being hack-proof.
@_date: 2013-05-25 16:36:43
Thanks for the help. I had assumed, incorrectly, that my bitcoins were "stored" as entries in the blockchain, and that my wallet was single address that could access all of them.
Given that new addresses are generated for each change transaction, does this mean that the number of addresses in a wallet will continue to increase indefinitely?
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:05:07
I'm certainly not making any sort of prediction, as the future of the price is subject to many unknowable factors. This is absolutely not a suggestion that this should affect anyone's investment decisions.
This is simply an observation of what seems to be happening on a short-term scale. Like other currencies, there are periods when their value doesn't change much, but with bitcoin the volatility is far greater for several reasons.
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:07:11
