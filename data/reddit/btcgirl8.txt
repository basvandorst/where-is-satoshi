Best way for me to withdraw money is to get a shiftcard and it connects with Coinbase. I can go to any ATM and withdraw money in hand right away and they charge like $2-3 per transaction. I can also use my shiftcard to make purchases with my bitcoin at any retailer/store if needed.

I would definitely get a shift card. I have no problems using it at well when shopping or taking out funds from an atm

Get a shift card and you can connect it through Coinbase. Can use any ATM to withdraw, I believe $3.00 transaction. I use my shift card for withdrawals and any store for shopping. :-)
