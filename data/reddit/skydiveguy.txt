Exactly. The miners can invest as much as they want in mining equipment... The nature of BTC is to adjust the difficulty the more people mine to keep the block creation at ~10 minutes per found block.
This is the genius part of BTC. 
Mining rewards were made to reward people doing the work required to maintain the infrastructure not to scoop up all the BTC.

This is why the price is hanging low.
Newbs are putting their money into the perceivably "cheaper" alts.

People need to find a better way to argue "bubbles" or "tulips" when its brought into conversations with morons that refuse to understand crypto.
I stopped arguing with idiots about this.
I used to try to explain that its scarcity and capped at 21M coins and they come back with "until they change it" to which I reply "they cant. its hard coded into the design" and then they just come back with some other stupid comment.
Non-Believers will always be that way and its better to just shut up and let them cry when crypto wins out in the end.

This is wrong. These numbers are skewed.
I currently have 1 of my BTC in GDAX for trading experimentation.
This 1 BTC exists in GDAX's "wallet" not in its own wallet. When you buy/sell on GDAX its not going in and out of a wallet, its merely creating database entries on GDAX's site.
Therfore, exchanges will represent the majority of these major holders of BTC.
Thanks for doing the math, though. It is very interesting.

This is one of the many arguments I gave him when he was complaining about BTC not inflating/deflating with the market.
"How much was a loaf of bread in 1970? $0.05? Its $3.99 now... thats exactly the problem."
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:07:11
I heard about it in 2010 and it was so new then that the only resources I could find then were all about mining.
I found it too confusing and gave up in it... fast forward to 2013 and I saw the price jump to $1000 and I decided to take the time to learn.
I bought in on the price drop and did some alt coin mining, which I traded in for BTC. 
Glad Ive stuck with it all this time.

If they could recommend it to clients, they still wouldn't.
One keeps calling it a bubble and refuses to accept it because its "not fiat".
Of course I offer all the proof as to why that exactly how it was designed.
The reason it will succeed is because the people that take the time to understand how the blockchain technology works are the ones investing.

Our securities guy has poo-poo'd bitcoin forever... lately hes been asking me about it...
Until Monday when he just had to forward me an article about how bitcoin dropped 29% over the weekend (and the numbers were fudged to make it look worse). Bt the time he sent me the article, it had almost already regained most of those paper losses.
I laughed and said "you of all people should know thats when you buy"

The article says he bought in starting inFeb 2017 so maybe he is just now realizing the gains after a year has expired.
But, most millennials are not paying their cryptocurrency taxes, so...

The problem is that coinbase just dumped a blanked dollar amount on everyone. 
I want to pay taxes but they offer zero assistance beyond dropping a 1099K on you. 
If they have the technology to do these advanced, fast trades... they can easily tell me exactly what was bought and sold longg or shirt term and the gain or loss. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:59:42
Yeah... there is NO WAY I am paying takes on what they are reporting... the taxes alone are more than I make in a year.
Im going to sit down and map every transaction I made. I'll probably have to pay gains from when I bought to when I sold but I am not paying straight taxes on that number they are reporting.

Miners are the ones using the option markets as a hedge against losses.
The option market might actually protect against this (although  I dont think mining costs affect the value of BTC)

most are not buying because most are not selling their goods for bitcoin.
Once vendors like Amazon and more brick and mortar stores accept BTC it will be the beginning of the true value rise.

I am a long time holder (since 2013).
I bought 1 more at $5500 and ended up selling them all when the drop happened... then bought them back a couple days later at about the same price.
Not over 200 transactions but more than $20K.
From what I read, it looks like some of it was when I transferred it back out to my hardware wallet.
I need to sit down with a pen and paper and map it all out.

You're reply is even dumber than your original post.
You cant just "create them". Its called "mining" for a reason: because you need to do some amount of work to obtain new coin. Just like gold is mined.
People dont hold fiat currencies because of inflation. Thats the whole reason infation was created... to prevent people from hoarding it and collapsing the economy.
People dont actively spend gold, they hold it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:34:13
Thats not what you're selling in your post. 
You clearly laid out a bunch of statistical mumbo-jumbo with reasons (per your infinite wisdom) about why its going to skyrocket.
Actually, you are using "what the crowd is doing" as the backbone data for your beliefs so you need to actually relay on what the crowd is doing to form the basis of your analysis.

@_date: 2018-02-08 16:56:37
You truly are a moron.
Bitcoin is caped at 21 million total coins. This is not an illusion. Its FACT.
Just because there are still ~4 Million BTC remaining to be mined is not a valid argument. In fact, right now there are 17M BTC available (minus ~4M that were lose in wallets, etc). This means that if you wanted to buy up 18M BTC you couldn't at this moment in time. This is scarcity.
You cant increase this number, ever. Not without a fork and no one will let that happen.

I bought 2 video cards 3 years ago and mined alt coins.
I then traded these alt coins for Bitcoin.
In total, I mined enough alt coins to now hold .5 BTC.
The $300 investment in 2 video cards has been paid off 3X+ at the current value and I still use the video cards in my high end PC.
All in all, a win.
