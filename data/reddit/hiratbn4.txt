you only get taxed on gain/profit. let say you bought $100k worth of btc (10btc) when price is at 10k, when you sold 1btc when the price is at 15k, you need to pay tax on the 5k gain/profit. if you sold at a loss, say 9k, you don't pay tax, you'll get a deduction on taxes. the 9btc left in your wallet, won't be taxed until you sold them or used them.

sell 2000 btc on exchange to drop the price and then buy 2000 btc back over the counter at the lower price. rinse and repeat.

that would be a nice name for an btc/lightning alternative to google pay, apple pay, venmo app. would be nice if we can send btc like sending cash using venmo. for example if we send $100 to a friend, that friend get $100 in btc and $100 is deducted from our bank account/ credit/debit or btc balance on the app. would help with adoption a lot if theres an app like that.

ok then have an option to send and accept cash or btc.
