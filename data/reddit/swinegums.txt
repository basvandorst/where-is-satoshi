Yeah, I downloaded the Bitcoin client ages ago and every so often fired it up and poked around a bit but never really got any further in my understanding. It sounds like I'd be better off with an online wallet that simplifies the process.
For the record though, I am running the Bitcoin client on a PC - if I click the tab 'receive coins' it has two fields - one for a label and one for an address. I am assuming the address is the public key I would give out for someone to send to? If so, where is the private key generated that would allow me access to transfer the bitcoin? ie How do I prove to the blockchain that it's mine? I can give out the address generated, but where is the other key?
Sorry, that was probably a very convoluted way of asking that ;)

Ok, that makes sense.

Right, thanks, I understand the concept, it's the wallets I'm struggling with but I think I'm closer now.
One question - if I want to send bitcoin I need the private key for the address that I'm sending it from, correct? Where do I get that from? In my wallet I can see the addresses I can give to receive bitcoin, but these must have a private key that corresponds to them. Where do I find that?
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:36:58
The UK's banking system is light years ahead. Canada is stuck in the 1950's. I didn't realise how good we have it in the UK until I moved to Canada. I used to buy from Bittylicious, no problem, direct bank transfer, online banking, super straight forward.
Canadian banks don't allow direct banking transfers online - you have to go through a third party intermediary (interac) and there is a limit on how much you can send. Some institutions also charge you for doing this. Interac is touted as a great innovation but in truth it's another unnecessary intermediary, and another unnecessary opportunity to impose charges. It also has a limit on how much you can transfer in a day (around $2-3k)). In the UK I could plug in account number and sort code online, make as many transfers, bill payments and whatever as I wanted. No middle men. In Canada I am limited in how many transfers I am allowed to make, who I can make them to, and how. It feels archaic.
Almost every bank has a monthly account fee. These can be waived if you maintain a minimum balance in the account. For example BMO Performance Account gives me unlimited interac use but costs $15 a month. The $15 a month is waived if I maintain a $4000 balance. If I go under $4000 at any time, I'm charged the $15 (but only once per month).
We set up accounts with Van City and BMO when we landed and it took on average 90 minutes in a branch, per account. Van City was truly terrible, we spent at least 5 hours in branches over several visits, multiple follow up calls, massive amount of paperwork for truly basic application processes. We switched to BMO because it was so bad and while smoother, it took 3 hours over 2 visits to set up accounts for me, my wife and my daughter.
We subsequently discovered BMO has a limit on the $ value of bills you can pay in a day. ie If I had a credit card bill of $5k and my BMO bill paying limit is $4k, I would only be able to pay off $4k in one day (and could not pay any other bills that day). I was told this is for 'security'.
Myriad ATM charges. Each bank does it differently. Some banks limit the number of ATM withdrawals you can make in a month, or they charge you.
When we set up my daughter's account, the basic plan limited how many times she could withdraw and use her debit card, or she would be charged.
My savings account with BMO allows me to make 1 transfer out a month. Iirc my reward for this is a grand 0.05%.
Basically it feels like a lot of arbitrary and unnecessary limitations and intermediaries designed to gouge you for charges wherever they can. The UK banking system, for all it's failings, is streets ahead when it comes to ease of use and artificially generated charges. I never realised just how bad it was over here, and everyone just sucks it up. No choice, I guess.
And then on top of all of that bullshit - BMO arbitrarily banned debit and credit purchases of crypto. I was mostly using Quadriga via Interac but the banks completely restricted how you could deposit to them (BMO also lost a transaction that they tried to charge me $60 for), so I used Coinbase a few times. BMO banned debit purchases from Coinbase. Can you imagine a bank in the UK saying that you couldn't use your debit card to make a particular purchase? Not because you don't have the money, but because they are "protecting you from risk". Restricted on how you can use your own funds. It's unreal. 
Oh, and BMO is constantly being hacked and revealing company data. Guess what their online security is? A 6 digit password, which is the same for your telephone banking. Fucking joke over here.
@_date: 2014-09-14 11:20:07
You asked, I shall deliver! Here is my understanding so far:
All bitcoin is recorded on a kind of digital ledger which is maintained by all users on the network, thus greatly diminishing the possibility that the ledger can be manipulated. Because of the nature of this ledger every transaction can be traced going back to the first bitcoin. 
The name 'wallet' is actually kind of misleading because nothing is contained within it. A wallet is probably more accurately described as a key chain because it contains multiple sets of public and private keys. The public keys are like an address that bitcoin can be sent to, whereas the private keys are like the digital signature that allows you to access whatever has been sent to the public address. They are generated in pairs and are unique. Without the private key you cannot move the bitcoin that has been sent to the public address. 
The keys are stored(created?) in a wallet.dat file which can be read by wallet software and there are multiple different types of wallet software ranging from secure hosted online and mobile apps to basic QT and desktop applications like electrum. Some (like QT) of these require the entire blockchain to be synced before you can use them, others (like electrum) do not download the entire blockchain.
Bits I'm still trying to get my head around:
* How do I find out what my private key is? For example on QT I can see the public address but not the private one. On electrum it gave me a seed that allows me to call up the wallet wherever I am - so is that effectively my private key (I realise it isn't actually it, but it will always give me access to the wallet so to all extents and purposes it's the same thing?). **update I found the export function on electrum that allows me to see the private/public key pairings but can't see the same on QT
* If the address was generated on QT does that mean I can only access it using that software? Or could I use any software/application as long as I have the public and private keys?
* If I wanted to use my bitcoin on a different computer than my usual one could I just download something like electrum, run it and enter my public/private keys? Would that information then be stored on the new computer? Or would I need to have the wallet.dat file? 
* Say I use localbitcoins and buy a bitcoin for cash and the guy gives me a public and a private key. Do I just then enter that into my wallet and then send it to a different address? How do I enter it into the wallet? On Electrum would it be via the import option? Or do I need to open another wallet altogether to send it? Do I need the wallet.dat file? Assuming I can just import the public and private keys can I then send it from one address in that wallet to another one in the same wallet and then delete the original address?
Sorry for the mountain of questions, I really think I'm nearly there with it but just a few details I need to get my head around. I'll keep on reading and if anyone is moved to reply to any of these questions and help me along the way it would be much appreciated.

Hey, thanks for the reply again. I think you missed a few words in this bit. Do you mean that all keys are valid into the future? ie there is no expiry/time limit on keys?
@_date: 2014-09-13 17:44:49
Right, makes sense. So... Say I posted a public key and lots of money gets sent to it - it would then become a tempting target for people to try and find out the private key - which if they got their hands on would enable them to transfer the bitcoin at that address wherever they want. But, assuming my security is up to scratch the private key stays private and I can then use it to transfer the bitcoin wherever I want. 
Hey, you know what, I'm actually starting to understand this stuff! So glad I asked this question today, everyone has been awesome :)

@_date: 2014-09-14 01:05:30
I made an electrum wallet tonight and was wondering that. Basically the seed means i never need to know the private keys (as long as i have the seed)? 
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:22:06
Right, but the bitcoin only ever exist as an entry on a virtual ledger, right? So the wallet really only contains keys to be able to move around your bit of the ledger? I get the analogy to email, but my email doesn't require me to make a paper backup, or have a computer that's never been online before I set it up. Are all of the security concerns based around the fear of someone else getting access to your wallets keys (getting access to the wallet.dat file?)?
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:05:26

Brilliant, I'll add this to my list of reading from this thread! Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:37:06
I think the confusion stems from the whole idea of 'wallet' simply because wallets contain something physical, ie money. A bitcoin wallet doesn't actually contain anything as far as I can see. Some of the videos linked explain how bitcoin is essentially just a big ledger so the bitcoin wallet really is just a bunch of keys that allow you to change whatever little bit of the ledger you have access to.
And making backups of the wallet means backing up the wallet.dat file?
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:26:44
This was a really good and clear explanation, thank you for taking the time to write it up. I now have millions of questions. I am sure you're delighted :) 
I'm messing around with the bitcoin client now and I have the wallet open. I can see where the addresses are under the receive coins tab, which I am assuming are the public keys. Where are the private keys to go along with that? If I gave you one of those addresses and you sent me bitcoin, how would I verify that those were, in fact, my bitcoin? Would they just appear in my wallet and I don't need a private key until I wanted to send them on again at which point I would need to prove they are mine? 
What happens if you send bitcoin to an address and the receiver never 'picks them up'? Do they just stay in limbo forever? Or is there a time limit for the private key to be matched to the public key? (I'm assuming that for any transaction that you send, I also have to actively receive, by entering the private key to match the public address - if I don't do this are the bitcoins just lost or would you get them back?)
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:40:27
Thanks, your reply makes good sense. I got the same feeling from a lot of the reading and videos I'd watched about security, but I wasn't sure, saw this thread and thought, "hey why not find out once and for all". I think people that do write ups must espouse very heavy security as best practice but it probably isn't what every user needs to do. 
I also read about having two wallets, where one contains a small amount for your 'every day' spending and  the other contains the bulk of whatever you own and is kept hidden away more securely. In which I guess you send from one set of keys to your other set of keys any time you need to top it up! Haha I'm confusing myself now (honestly it's starting to come together). Anyway, I guess the equivalent would be like carrying around spending money and having a savings account (or shoebox under the bed) for the rest, you take little bits out of the big sum when you need to and carry around 'safe' sums that you can afford to spend/lose.
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:46:07
I definitely understand that bitcoins 'ledger' structure is inherently virtually tamper proof - My confusion has been with the notion of 'wallet' rather than the ledger because a real life wallet does hold something physical that can be removed, whereas a bitcoin wallet actually consists of keys that allow you to move stuff around on the ledger (which is then verified by everyone else on the network).
Someone else linked to the wikipedia page on Public-key cryptography and  I think i probably need to put the time into getting my head around that at this point.
Thanks for the response, everyone who took the time to reply has been incredibly helpful in getting through my thick skull today! 
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:30:03

Can someone ELI5 how a bitcoin wallet works? I've watched lots of introductory videos and it always seems the bits I don't understand are glossed over. I'm sure what I'm not understanding is very basic and so the video makers probably assume it doesn't need explaining.... But it does to me! Can anyone ELI5 and be patient enough to break down how a wallet works step by step?
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:15:08
So nothing is actually stored on your computer other than the keys inside the wallet? Lose access to the keys and you lose access to the wallet?
@_date: 2014-09-14 20:27:21
Thank you for your reply! Still slowly plodding through this...


Is it not possible then to import a key and then send from that key to another? Can you send internally within one wallet from one address to another or do you need 2 wallets? If you need 2, can they be on the same application (say, electrum)? I'm not sure how that works.
And by saying "send bitcoin over the network" you mean for the other person to send them directly from his wallet to your wallet?
I'm thinking that electrum looks easiest at the moment, QT seems very unwieldy to me but probably I should just look into the simplest online solution. I just need to understand how much I don't understand and whether I understand enough of the important bits before I make a decision. 
Thank you for your patience!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:42:11


Do they also charge you for transactions, or just charge a flat fee? Aren't you starting to move into Paypal/banking territory then?
@_date: 2014-09-14 10:04:28
I played around with it last night and it was amazingly simple to move this to the Qt wallet and then from there to a newly created electrum wallet and then even track the movement on blockchain.info. Very, very cool, all of it!
I'm still hazy on some of the aspects of the private keys and how they function, how portable the wallet is, benefits of online vs. offline wallets but I think my best bet is probably more reading and then come back with specific questions and hope people are still feeling patient!
Thanks again, hands on was definitely a good way to go.

It's not so bad. Just do a trial run with a small amount to get the feel for it. People on here are usually willing to donate a few bits so you can practice sending and receiving. Once you grasp the basics it's ok. I am technically illiterate for the most part but I asked lots of questions on here and just took the time to get a feel for it, tried different wallets and paid really close attention whenever I was making a transaction.
I recommend electrum as a desk top wallet, I have never had any problems with it. Then if you decide to take the plunge and buy a larger amount get a tresor or ledger which are both super safe storage. Other than that it's just a question of making a commitment to pay attention to what you're doing whenever you make a transaction. It's really not that bad once you have a feel for it.

Look up Andreas Antonopoulos, he has talks all over youtube and is very good at explaining what it is in an understandable way.

I'm happy for you. You live in a banking utopia. Congratulations! Much of the world doesn't. Thanks for sharing your anecdotal experience, it's always interesting to hear of outliers.

This is bullshit. Plenty of reputable exchanges out there. Do your due diligence.

Lol. Because the legacy banking system is fast and cheap, right?

It *is* more complex than you're making out. To really grasp why Bitcoin is so revolutionary is to understand that there is no need for a middle man like Coinbase - holding your own keys is what it's all about. Be your own bank.
My take is that 1. Most people see the hype but don't look much deeper so end up with the kind of opinion like above and 2. Large swathes of people don't want that kind of responsibility but are willing to pay for an insured third party to hold their money for them for a fee. For people like those, what's the point of Bitcoin?
Either way, if, as and when the tech develops as the 'believers' see it developing the point will become moot. We're just simply not at the level of mass adoption yet where the tech has become as all pervasive as the internet or cell phones. 
Again, just my personal belief, but those that really read and understand the white paper see that level of adoption as a really strong possibility because nothing like this has been attempted before, and it is both a massive disruptor to existing systems and a disintermediator for the complacent status quo middle men that we all have to currently deal with. Even more so, it has the potential to put enormous pressure on governments and the whole existing, creaking economic system that is leveraged on debt to the *n*th degree. 
Disruption and disintermediation are the hall marks of a nascent, game breaking technology a la internet. Lots to be excited about in that!

It depends where you are. I think most places require some kind of KYC, even ATM's and localbitcoins these days.
I just hold my nose and buy from Coinbase and transfer to a private wallet as soon as the transaction goes through. Don't hold your own keys = not your bitcoin.

So one specific geographical region, and one currency. Gotcha.

Your cynicism is ugly. You can paint it as 'realism' all you like, but you just come across as an asshole.
If everyone followed your line of thinking there would be no point in doing anything, ever.

Hope is wonderfully human. I wonder what you gain by so determinedly attempting to quash it in others with your 'certainty'.
You are not the gatekeeper of truth, or some objective reality.
Confidence is just a tone of voice, no matter how verbose, articulate or condescending one may be.

Because px403 is talking bollocks. If I talk to my friend in the US I differentiate between USD and CAD. I don't just say 'dollars'.
@_date: 2015-11-23 10:05:16
Ah ok, nice. Looks like I was being a dingus. Thanks for taking the time to reply :)

I have used bittylicious pretty exclusively to buy but the selling FAQ reads as though you need large amounts to sell. Is that not the case? If I just wanted to sell 1 I could?

Don't be an apologist for his behaviour. He is trying to co-opt the Bitcoin brand. Your equivalency does not work. CAD, AUD, USD, any other dollar, all are clearly denominated. His method of denominating the 2 coins up to now has been 'Bitcoin Cash' (BCH) and 'Bitcoin Core' (BTC). Now he has moved to 'Bitcoin' (BCH) and 'Bitcoin Core' (BTC). It's deliberate, calculated and very, very scammy. Ver is a bad actor in this space, as has been proven time and again. Don't make excuses for his behaviour.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:20:48
I figured as much. Thanks for your response.
@_date: 2015-10-20 19:29:22
I think his point is more that people blithely and willingly give up an enormous amount of personal information without really considering the implications of what they are doing. But yes, your point is valid.

You're in luck. We have one especially designed to travel down tubes.
