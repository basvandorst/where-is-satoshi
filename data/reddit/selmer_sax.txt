I'm confused. I can have a dollar bill that has traces of cocaine on it and have been used to fund a cartel, and that's perfectly alright, but if a bitcoin was touched by illegal activity it's illegal?

100% unregulated free market and 100% unchecked capitalism are failures. They go hand in hand, and they lead to their own demise, as the economic system crumbles. Capitalism without restrictions will concentrate all of the wealth in the top tiers and cause the production to fail.

It doesn't. Free market needs regulation to succeed

How would a Type 1 civ be required to not use dead sources of energy? Type 1 harnesses all resources on its home planet

It depends on how long you anticipate your stay to be. If you do not have enough cash to sustain yourself through that timeframe, then the government can refuse you entry as a visitor because of the possibility that you are going to not leave when the visa expires, and rather take a job and stay.

I'm not against capitalism, all I'm saying is that capitalism's tendencies lead to an unsustainable Lorenz curve. Once all wealth is concentrated in the upper few percentage points, then capitalism grinds to a halt.

I thought that even though he's donating large amounts of money, the value of his investments is going up, so he has more money now than ever.

Not really disagreeing; giving a different way of looking at it: you could say that they are each orbiting a point in space. They both act on each other, but the sun is so much more massive than anything and everything else in the solar system. It's a really really uneven binary system if you only talk about earth and sun, so saying the earth orbits the sun isn't fully correct still.

It's the second one. I don't get it, different strokes for different folks. iPhones have their pros and cons, as do android based smartphones.

Would you instead suggest everyone be armed to the teeth? Genuinely asking, as it seems that that would be the only way to prevent any single participant acting out of turn and precipitating a catastrophic failure

I'm pretty sure they'd have converted it to fiat.

That's the thing. I saw that transaction record, but when I refreshed the page, it was all gone. The transaction page showed that there had been no transactions.

Ah okay sorry just learning economics now from an *eh* teacher in 10th grade. Thanks for the clarification, I didn't actually know there was such a thing as M0

I agree, there's no incentive to steal 4cents. My main concern was that there is some glitch in their systems that could drop larger amounts of money by accident. My account is showing 0BTC in the top right, and under the Transactions page a current balance of 0BTC and no transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:52:51
I tried again with yet another account and transferred it to my main. It worked, thanks!

I don't know why you're being downvoted. Oh wait, I do know: you went against the circlejerk hivemind.

Weeping Angels, The Rebel Flesh/Almost People gangers, and the Water from Mars monster/disease thing are off the top of my head scarier than any Cyberman.

But when I looked at first it registered the transfer and gave me the balance. I logged out then when I logged back in it reverted to 0.

While the concept is scary, they can't hold a candle to things like Angels

I would assume you wouldn't use the M0, as the M1 is where most people keep their money (checking deposits, other immediately liquid accounts)
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:30:39
I got over $3million with those assumptions. Not saying they're likely, but I don't know how you got less than 1/10 what my math says.
