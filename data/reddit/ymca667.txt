You need to set up a wallet and move those coins. Coins held on an exchange are not your coins, only a promise that they exist somewhere. Then set up an account on the exchange you'd like to use, along with confirming your bank accounts so that your money spends as little time as possible on the exchange. When you decide to sell, then and only then should you move your coins off the wallet and onto the exchange.

It would only be mass adoption if people bought with the intention of using it somewhere. All I've seen so far is people that buy and hold it close to their chest, hoping to one day become a millionare. Textbook speculation.

It's DCA, except all your money is now in BTC, and you need to pay a fee just to access your own money. Totally stupid idea.

The gist is that you never want to keep any of your money on an exchange. Exchanges go belly side up all the time, and they are not backed by any regulatory agency, meaning you lose anything that isn't in your control.

Most any wallet will do the job, provided you keep control of your random keywords. I personally use MultiBitHD, I personally like the UI and certain features like current exchange value, address book, etc.

Lambos are too easy to get. The real wealth trend in Dubai is to buy factory new cars that have been out of production for decades, cellophane and all.

I highly doubt BTC is going to sustain 100%+ annual gains. Again, its your BTC to invest, but trading any kind of shares, whether it be stocks, futures, options, or forex such as BTC almost always beats the returns from passively holding. Also it prevents you from needlessly riding a downtrend, especially if its uncertain whether the value will go to 0. Because let's face it, it's within the realm of possibility that BTC could die.
That being said, I just turned 80% of my holdings into cash after riding this amazing moonshot. I paid $1.50 for tx fees and came out $1750 in the green on top of my initial investment. I'll buy it back as soon as this trend reversal does it's magic, and hold until the next moonshot. Then I'll be making even more. I guess I should thank you for making the market less volatile, making it easier for me to make money :P

Yet another reminder not to keep your BTC outside of your own personal wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:20:48
Why would you buy at this point in time? Next time, just swallow your pride and admit you missed the upshot, it will prevent losses. It literally makes no sense to buy when the prices are at an all-time high. My advice is to buy when there is a relative plateau, then hold until the eventual uptick, and dump at a reasonable level. Rinse and repeat. That way you avoid risk and generally profit.
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:49:15
My point is you need to be realistic and look at the hard math and behaviour of the market as a whole. I agree that the complete long term trend is up, there is almost no denying that. But any time the price surges, it will inevitably come down--you can't speculate that it will magically continue to rise. What I mean is that if you want to make serious gains (ie how most big fish make their $$$) and not just play the complacent overall returns game, the surges are your main profit. If you missed it, you need to be honest with yourself and not buy into a burned out market, because you literally set yourself up for failure. In that respect, when you don't buy in, it is 100% certain you will not lose any money, which means it's not at all like gambling to wait. People who /do/ buy into the market at high prices are the people who end up becoming the profit for those who bought at a lower price. It's just how the market works. 
EDIT: In fact, over the past few hours, a double top has formed at 1623 on Bitstamp, which is usually an indicator of a resistance level being solidified. I dont see this rally going anywhere but down over the next few days unless something massive causes it to break back through the resistance.
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:05:26
Thats fine lol, I respect your investment decision. I, however, will continue to compound my holdings while minimizing my risk. It's a strategy that's grown my BTC holdings substantially, and I'm happy with my increased returns over the base rate of return.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:38:16
Be realistic. It's a pipe dream. Anyone who seeks to make actual profit in this game will be trading. Prices don't magically go up and down, they're driven by traders who make bank on large volumes off of people who buy high. It's literally how any market works lol, winners and losers.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:25:14
Yeah people on this sub need to get real with their investments instead of repeating the same old bad advice. To be fair, though, there has to be losers for there to be winners, and i guess HODLers are going to take the initiative to be the losers when shit hits the fan :D
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:05:00
Yeah I don't understand all these people's line of thinking. In the marketplace, whenever you reach an all time high, you are bound to come down at some point. Doesn't mean it will die, but it will go down. It's simple supply and demand driving price.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:24:17
To some degree this is flawed thinking. After a surge, you would be stupid to buy in, because the way markets behave, a fall is imminent. You dont know when, but its guaranteed to happen. The best times to get in are when you can minimize your risk. If you buy high, then you just become the profit for someone else and the market will leave you out to dry for the short term.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:45:49
Hey, it's ok, we're all learning constantly. Just make it your takeaway from this situation that you need to let go of the hype in the market and focus on the pure math.

Tru dat
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:07:21
What I can tell you is you will never gain anything without taking a risk. What I've been doing so far is instead of holding, I've been trading my positions up and growing them at a quite resonable pace that beats the base rate of return of simply holding. You could try that.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:26:21
You don't have to be a dick. You asked for options, I gave you an option. If risk isn't your thing then you'll have to settle with just holding like the rest. The only passive income in the BTC community is to muscle up and buy hardware to mine altcoins with.
And to answer your question, yeah, I do my trades by hand. It allows me to have complete control of my capital.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:14:34
Oops yeah mental math error. Still, possible, but it would take some kind of miracle for the big fish not to drop the bottom out of the market at that kind of valuation, let alone reaching it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:07:20
Oh. I may have interpreted your response incorrectly. My bad. 
Yeah bots look good on paper, but I feel more comfortable doing analysis on my own and making straightforward decisions. It helps me stay out of the hype train and focused on whats actually going on.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:28:14
Beware of overconfidence however. This is a market after all, and there are people who own quite a lot of bitcoin. Once they decide enough is enough and decide to rake in the profit, they will dump and tank the market. Remember that a billionaire has effectively made $350m as of the past 16 days, when he sells is anyone's guess. And eventually it may come back up, but it would take a long time. Its just the reality of markets.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:37:25
Well look at it this way, a few months ago, I moved over $2000 from account to account and it took 15 min to confirm and cost me USD$0.72. Try doing that with Western Union, and it will take you 3 days minimum and 4% of what you're sending. I'd say BTC is pretty convenient.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:27:06
Do not buy now. Wait until the big fish decide playtime is over and dump massive volumes, because it will happen. Then pick up a few at 1100 or so where the support looks to be, and wait for the next big surge to take it over $2k.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:32:14
Improper and flawed thinking. It may climb another $200, but more than likely it will tank in the next few days if not hours. My prediction is a support at $1100, which means if it plateaus at $1100, then you buy like wild and hold until it blasts off to $2k sometime in the future. The best time to buy is after a large selloff, where you can minimize your risk. As of now you stand to lose lots of money or gain a small bit.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:47:57
I've never had issues with their platform. My accounts get verified within 1-2 business days, and my money is promptly delivered to my bank account within 3-4 business days. You should know that, as a minor, there are specific requirements to meet for you to make official financial transactions. You can't blame the platform for something *you* were ignorant about in the first place. Lesson learned. Clear your accounts before you plan on making big moves.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:51:49
How are you arriving to the prospect of BTC going from $1600 today to $12k in three years? That's ridiculous. Also, I'm sorry, but I can't ever take the prospect of bitcoin being $500k or even $74k seriously. It's just not realistic considering there will eventually be ~20m units in circulation. That means $1.49 trillion market cap at $74k and $100 trillion at $500k. The only reason BTC trades so freely is because it's moderately priced. If these unrealistic prices were ever attained, there would not be nearly as much movement.

@_date: 2017-05-05 16:09:24
Yeah but how far would it need to tank for that to happen? Support levels over $800 are not particularly strong. In my eyes, probably very, very deep.
