Without utility, trust means nothing. Trusting the fiat infrastructure won't buy bread and the fundamental use case of currency is to provide ease of transaction. You keep associating the payment network with credit card systems and I think that is a false equivalence. It is more akin to the physical dollar and shows that adding a credit layer over the payment layer adds utility, but the core infrastructure itself maintains an inherent utility. If I am only using btc to pay my credit card bill every month then decentralization is moot because my transactions are dependent on a centralized credit system.

No.  It gains value because they use it. Trust is only one factor that drives people to use it.

You may not dig it but it is a thing. Popular wallets and exchanges use it.

Meh. Right now a block increase would be beneficial but I see the other side as well. Efficiency tends towards a level of centralization and that needs to be dealt with by market forces,  but ideally we want a tertiary solution that keeps decentralization as well as efficiency. I think the more interesting ideas on the mailing list are BLK futures and rapid propagation schemes. There also is,  in theory,  room for a settlement network and a payment network utilizing separate but interconnected blockchains. We are only starting to see the meta-layer use cases of transactions as well. I personally feel like we should have an increased block (if the estimates on 2 or 4 are to be believed, I would prefer a smaller increment) without a dogmatic ideal about what it is that will be the most stable long term.

I am new here, so bear with me. Bigger block size is faster but smaller lets people mine on lesser hardware. Does speed come at the cost of decentralization or security?
