OK, I will update the OP with relevant info.  So, anything I can do at this point?
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:11:14
Thanks, I posted there.  Will update.
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:57:22
I am not sure what to do at this point.  Your help is greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:24:41
The upgrade was 2 hours prior to the transfer.  Last transaction going out where I did use a password was in mid August.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:46:20
The wallet.dat file in AppData\Roaming is enough for some one to have access to?  The passphrase is used to encrypt the private keys, correct?
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:12:54
OP, have you ever lost any coins?  Is generiousity one way to recoup the losses?
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:32:05
You are right, my OP was just an outcry than anything else.  Since I am not 100% versed on properly storing and securing something of this value, I deserve to lose it all.
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:32:35
I see, thank you for explaining that to me.
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:44:37
No, they don't look like any of mine.
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:13:34
The fact they they haven't left somewhere else gives me hope that I still have a chance of recovering them but is that common, not to transfer out further that is?
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:26:40
But I didn't type the passphrase.  Let the update finish and that's it.
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:16:31
If the malware recorded my use of the passphrase a couple of weeks ago then why wait to transfer out till yesterday?

I run a site for in-game virtual items (cosmetics for TF2, CS:GO, Dota2) and offer 15% discount off of Steam market prices via BTC only. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:19:03
So, are you saying that it's just a version upgrade that shows my coins transfer out?
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:34:37
One of the wallet.dat files, the oldest didn't have encryption enabled but it was also missing all the transaction data.  The other ones if I load them up in the client the Encprypt Wallet is greyed out and I assume therefore encrypted already.
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:14:50
If I did what can I do with it?
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:42:00
I downloaded bitcoin-0.9.3-win64-setup.exe 27-Sep-2014 07:33 12224864.  Shutdown the client and ran the update.  It crashed and upon the restarting the upgrade started to rebuild the chain.  I was a couple of weeks behind as well.  Just checked and my coins are gone.  I am not even sure where to start.  The client version shows 0.8.6-beta.  If anyone's willing to help me out I'd greatly appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:40:22
How can you tell that it's been almost 3 days?  
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:55:09
Nvm, they are my addresses.
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:26:41
Expected to see Jim Halpert for some reason.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:06:28
My only hope that it's some kind of bug.  This individual said he was in the same boat but the didn't specify if his coins were transferred out.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:51:08
Also, it appears that I have an entire Bitcoin directory as a backup on one of the external drives.  The Wallet.dat files are 120kb-140kb range.  Is there any way to tell if they have been not encrypted?

@_date: 2014-09-28 18:18:54
Also, I don't quite understand how malware transfers coins out.  Isn't the passphrase needed for that to happen?
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:14:54
OK, thank you for the explanation but I didn't not use a client for a while and didn't use the passphrase.
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:49:21
I have started the exact steps you are describing about an hour ago.  I got the 2012 wallet.dat file in but the core is now reindexing the blocks.

OK, I am not sure what you are implying.  I understand what you are saying but what is the cause of this then?
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:39:52
I had a similar revelation once I lost some.  There's no way an average Joe will be using coins if they can be easily stolen. You have to understand the underlying technology and be computer literate.
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:42:02
I honestly couldn't tell you what version I was running.  I believe I was 2 versions behind.  The client usually runs in the background but hasn't been up for a couple of days.  And I have no outgoing transactions either for quite some time.
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:34:26
As you can see, I didn't care enough to secure my holdings.  What more can I say.  How can I verify that the oldest unencrypted wallet.dat file contained my private keys?
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:19:25
Not sure if the site is broken or my stream is...
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:59:28
I do most of my shopping by spending BTC on Gyft cards.  As soon as I buy a card I immediately replenish the BTC spent by placing an order for that amount.  I have 2 apps on my Android -- Gyft and Coinbase.  It literally takes seconds.  Cyanogenmod ftw.
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:52:33
Actually most of them are mine. I was able to match them up.
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:23:35
I have a wallet.dat.old file dating back to 9/16/2011.  And also a wallet.dat.rewrite last modified 04/02/2012.  Anything I can do with these?
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:45:51
I tried the oldest wallet.dat 09/16/2011 and it didn't require a password to import.  Now, I don't see any of the input addresses.
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:42:09
Oddly the oldest backup didn't try to reindex the blocks and showed no transactions.  I found this file in one of my backups amongst others and I assume it's the original one.  It goes back to 09/16/2011.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:38:52
Directly from here: 
Never entered my wallet password.  Just let the upgrade running, it crashed.  I restarted it last night.  This morning I checked to see if it finished reindexing the chain.  And that's pretty much it.

My second day running a Bitcoin node and Lightning. Generating this invoice using Joule.

Thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:13:33
You could also use Joule ([ If you followed guide, you just need to expose port 8080 via ufw, change lnd.conf for LND REST API port and configure Joule extension by adding the macaroons. It's surprisingly simple and provides a clean UI for Lightning transactions.

I was in a similar situation.  A call to Dwolla got it all resolved.  Their support enabled a questionnaire that involved some questions to verify my identity.  Once I finished that I was good to go.
