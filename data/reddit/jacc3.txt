Basically cash/gold on the internet, backed by code and the majority principe instead of a government or bank.

I think it's a great idea, but just not a good name. There's too many uses for "bits" already, and since they're also computer related it wouldn't be unrealistic to say there will be misunderstandings and confusion. 
I'd rather just use uBTC as a standard for the time being. Besides, SI prefixes are very logical and easy to use. If there is a need for it, a nickname for uBTC will surely come naturally.

It was a refernce to an old League of Legends video. Oh well. I'd appreciate it very much if you were kind enough to share a small portion of your wealth with me, thank you.

I guess "uBits" would work good when talking, but I'd say we stick to "uBTC" while writing.
Also, I think moving to uBTC is a perfect move currently. It is a step in the right direction, while not being as radical as bits. The transition is very logical and is easy to get used to, and you can clearly see the connection to Bitcoin and understand what one uBTC is in relation to a Bitcoin. For example, think about kilograms. Everybody (except maybe Some Americans) know how much a kilogram is and uses it regularly, while knowing it is actually just a simpler way of saying "thousand grams". It also makes it easier to think and talk about numbers whatever the size, since you can talk about milli- or micrograms for example. 
The only problem I can see with uBTC is that it is a bit annoying to say, but nicknames will come naturally eventually (e.g. "ubits" or "microbits"). But as long as we stick to uBTC while writing, and just use the nicknames when talking, I don't think it'll be a problem. 
I'm quite tired and writing on my phone currently, so I guess I could've phrased it better, but I still hope you get my point.

FYB-SE, I've used them. No verification required (at least for small amounts like up to 10 000 kr or something like that).

These were around earlier, too. I received one maybe half a year ago. I gotta say, whoever's doing this is at least doing it better than the vast majority of the scammers, so beware.

There are three main reasons why I think it's a bad name (I think we should use one millionth of a Bitcoin as the standard unit, I just oppose the name):
1. Bits are already a well known word in computer contexts. This will most likely confuse newbies since they associate bit with something else, and the whole reason of this change is to make Bitcoin more understandable. Saying multiple types of dollars haven't caused any problems is also wrong, even though it is isn't that common since it's regional and the vast majority knows there are different types of dollars.
2. Bits is too similar to Bitcoin. Sure, it's good if they are a bit similar so you understand they are about the same thing, but as I said it's too similar. For example, one MilliBit would be the same as 1,000 bits, which isn't exactly logical. It will confuse people, especielly new people, and might make them think bit and bitcoin are the same thing and can also open up for scams.
3. It isn't unique. We want something simple, something people will remember and haven't heard before. Bitcoin currently serves that purpose, while bits does not.
We want to open up for new people, but in my honest opinion I think the name "bits" would just be counterproductive and make it even harder for new people. Until we can come up something better, please just stick to µBTC/uBTC.

Well, that is also one of the advantages of just usin different SI prefixes. The transition BTC -&gt; mBTC -&gt; uBTC is a lot easier than BTC -&gt; bits.

It seems legit, but the fee is huge (50%). Shouldn't there be cheaper places to buy Paysafecards? I guess I can accept up to 20% fees, even if it still is *very* high. 
EDIT: Compare with [Steamloader]( who sells steam vouchers with only a $1 flat fee, meaning a mere 5% or 2% fee (for $20 and $50 vouchers respectively).

I don't think many will warn the newbies when they earn so much money from their panic selling.

I've heard about it, but I didn't know how legit it was because I could only find several months old reviews of it. Thank you!

Just one thing, shouldn't it be "e.g." instead of "i.e." in the info? Like *"SI unit for milli e.g. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)"* for example?
