Not BTC related but maybe interesting because of her Newsweek report today.

This is an amazing Play by Play of the chase etc.

I concur with your agreement.

[HERE]( is proof and BTC addy for todays hero!

you think 15% isn't a gianormous substantial share?  (Pardon me while I ignore YOUR logic.)

Yes, a rolling increase as purchases have been made without problems would be nice.  I am stuck with the wait after trading BTC both ways SEVERAL times.  Sigh, hoping for a decent change that is mutually beneficial to Coinbase and the end user.

Do you mean, they're neither wrong?

Followed by a 1/2 million dollar buy !!

I Strongly agree with this.  Investment in BTC is fine but spend just a little also.  Merchants as well as people in general need to "see" BTC as a viable currency!  Good Luck!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:39:14
1 million dollars !!
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:15:29
Thanks ?

Guess I should have said it was the story of the guy buying bitcoins 2 years ago and just remembering he had them.  Just glad to see bitcoin all over the news!
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:56:57
Nah, even if it drops to say $100ish, it will rise again !
@_date: 2013-10-09 12:44:17
Awesome, hoping for the BIG rise !
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:48:20
Awesome !
