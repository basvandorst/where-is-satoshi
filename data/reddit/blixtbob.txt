As I explained earlier, it's not really the same. What ETH did was a rollback then improvement to the security.
But sure if that's what you are suggesting is something completely different. To me it sounds like you are one of those that got an idea on internet and just cannot realize you are wrong, on top of not knowing how the blockchain works. 
We will just have to agree to disagree, since we wont get any further here.

Unfortunately you are in the wrong here, and he is right.
In ETH they forked at an earlier timestamp to rollback transactions made later. How would that save the coins if you have the private key to the wallet? It would be the very same scenario that if Satoshi himself wanted to move his coins. Can we stop that with a fork?

First. You are now assuming you will get consensus to alter stuffs that all miners are hardcoded to check against (Remember its the miners consensus you need, not the owners). Good luck with that.
Second. So what you are suggesting now at as soon as someone moves something from Satoshis wallet we are going to fork? (Since there is no way for you to know if its satoshi himself or a potential hacker) Sounds resonable.
And all other early wallets, guess we just fork there aswel ?
There is two reasons for you why this is completely unrealistic.

Haven't we all? C'mon you know better than trying to convince a random dude that you know what you are talking about by saying "i have worked with this 20 years". Like I could continue this path by asking for your github etc etc but we both know it wont go anywhere.
