Untrue.  We still have a decentralized censorship resistant borderless pseudo-anonymous cash system. Nothing changed here.  Everyone is welcome to use it and offer any kind of service or product built on top of it.  Everyone.  If the rich recognizes bitcoin’s value and want to invest in it, accumulate as much of it, make it accessible to your grandma directly from her bank account or what not they have no permission to ask us, Bitcoin users for.  Bitcoin was designed that way from the very beginning.  Embrace the crypto capitalist era.  If you were expecting Bitcoin to act as Robin Hood and STEAL money from the rich to give it away to the poor you were damn wrong from the very beginning.  If you were expecting it to bank the unbanked and give anyone an equal chance to do business without permission at a global scale then you shouldn’t be complaining.  Just my two sats.

Onchain capacity is required to accommodate second layer (ln) on ramping and off ramping transactions.  The beauty of SegWit is that it allows more data to be stored efficiently into blocks.  Bigger blocks could be required in the future but must not be implemented if they compromise decentralization (cost of firing up a node + hard disk space + bandwidth).  We need as much nodes as possible but not at the cost of them being hosted in data centers because too expensive or complicated to run at home by the average proponent.

@_date: 2018-09-12 18:59:35
It indeed is. The point here is that if a node requires several TB of storage + bandwidth, the average proponent will not bother running his or her own node.  They’ll probably not consider running a hosted node neither.  This path eventually leads to fewer nodes, hosted in fewer locations and exposes the network to a greater risk of centralization.

This.  The only reason some people stopped using/ buying rotary phones was you couldn’t use them anymore.  Took more than a decade for such a small change to happen.  At first, early adopters would buy touchtone phones because they stood for progress and innovation and they thought it was cool to own one.  Yet, they had to have their devices to reproduce pulse electronically because their phone line wasn’t yet ready for touchtone.  This is about where we are with Bitcoin.
A decade after that all of the phone carriers were offering touch tone lines only.  
This is what is starting to happen with BAKKT and other innovations.  It is just the beginning.
A few decades after that, nobody noticed their calls were carried over the Internet.   
Hyperbitcoinization is happening one step at a time.  At some point we will have most of the planet using BTC knowingly OR NOT.  This is what a paradigm shift is about.

You are wasting your time and energy caring about market manipulation.  
It will happen because there is profit to be made and that is perfectly fine.
We are still in the early stage of price discovery.  
Market manipulation will fade away with adoption.  This cannot be worked against.  Hyperbitcoinization will lead to less and less volatility as it happens.
Shall we all stop worrying about it and concentrate our efforts towards more decentralization and adoption, market manipulation will become a thing of the past in a matter of years.  Not decades, years.
All we have to do is fire up as many unique nodes,  keep the network resilient and antifragile; use the currency and the network for the freedom they provide us with.  Dismiss the noise around it, just use BTC and work towards its adoption. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:09:03

This is not the point.  While I do agree 100% with your statement and couldn’t stress enough that it is not in Bitcoin’s philosophy to trust any incumbent but yourself when it comes to holding the private keys, I must admit they are still doing something awesome here.  Gemini is definitely working towards adoption and what they just announced is taking us one step further towards Bitcoin / cryptocurrencies as a store of value and  investment vehicle at a global scale.  Every single initiative counts, everyone is welcome to innovate so that a critical inflexion point can be reached.  Only when that happens, Bitcoin and some other cryptos will become units of account at a global scale.  
In other words, what they just did does not suppress anyone’s right or possibility to secure their own keys.  It just enables much more fiat to be converted to the paradigm shift of Bitcoin.   
Do we need to educate people about how Bitcoin enables them to be their own bank, of course we do.  Should we criticize by what means institutional money is brought to the market, well I don’t think so.  Everyone is welcome to innovate on top of or around Bitcoin without asking permission, that is the point.
Also, not your keys, not your bitcoin.  Ha!

With blocks up to 4mb in size with SW, they would need to spam the network up to 4x what they did in the past few months to have the same stalling effect.  Furthermore, couldn't we punish them if they do not mine full blocks when mempool is full? 
@_date: 2018-10-29 10:34:59
12-24 months before hashboards starts failing (factual).  
6-18 months left until new ASIC generation (my guess - s9s have been around for a while now + new players entering the game -)
In either cases,  OP could still ROI and turn a profit (dollar wise).  It all depends on his strategy and capacity to pay the electricity bills while hodling as much as possible.  This last hypothesis implies faith of price appreciation over time.

Couldn't we then force them to mine full blocks when the mempool is full? With SW adoption coming up, we then should get blocks with capacity up to 4mb?  I mean.... the only acceptable scenario in which an empty block would not be orphaned would be that there is zero tx waiting to be included in a block?  I don't mind them spamming the mempool if they pay the fees.  Am I wrong ?

Satoshi has not been around for a while.  He/she/they is/are letting us Bitcoin proponents decide what Bitcoin use cases are.  
Stop ask yourselves what was on Satoshi’s mind.  Ask yourselves what Bitcoin can achieve for human kind and how it can be done.
Ask no permission, do what you think is right.
Innovate, thrive.

No, it’s the other way around.  6.25 BTC added every 10 minutes instead of 12.5;  This implies miners will not sell under x2 the cost of mining 1 btc before halving.

Your 400$ is not any safer than your .045BTC was.
If you do not control the keys, it is not your Bitcoin / Money.
Coinbase is sort of a bank.  Your coins there are as safe as if I was holding them for you.  Would you trust me for that?  If the answer is no, do not leave your coins on coinbase or any centralized platform which holds the private key for you.
Your journey starts here :

Wrong.  He already holds a ton of BTC.  Investing 1.25M in BTC at this point would have no effect on his fortune and no effect on the price of BTC.  
Instead, he invests in a business that he thinks will help bring more and more adoption.  If it succeeds, he wins on both sides.  If it fails, well, he still has a lot of BTC and could profit from other scaling / adoption easing initiatives.
This is exactly what we all need (him included) to bring BTC to the masses.

Makes lots of sense to me.  
Once the 9k memes are unleashed 10k could happen within hours.  
It could then go very fast from 10k to previous ATH.  Then IF it goes past previous ATH, 20k could happen within hours and the ascension could continue up to near the next psychological resistance level of 30k.  Hence 28k is well achievable.
Get dem 9k memes ready.  It could be the last time we ever see them at all.

Neo, I am going to tell you something they don’t want you to know.  A secret that is hidden in plain sight.
All of the bitcoins you buy and hodl in a cold wallet are not for sale anymore.  They can’t be seized either.  
Should 10 million people buy and hodl 0.5 BTC and then 20 million people buy and hodl 0.25 BTC and then 50 million people buy and hodl 0.1 BTC, there would barely be 2 million bitcoins left for the rest of the world population.
That’s 80 million people controlling about 90% of all bitcoins. 
If Bitcoin as a programmable, censorship resistant, borderless, unstoppable, decentralized form of store of value and medium of exchange becomes a standard to the world economy.  If it ends frenetic devaluation of currencies and brings back high valuation of time.  If it brings back something as good as the gold standard while offering much more flexibility and much less friction than gold.
Will it rise over time? It is likely to, because it will get more scarce as it gets adopted.
Will it crash on its course to world reserve currency? It is likely to, for at some point some will cash out taking short term profits just before they FOMO back in.  Because Bitcoin changes you.  You can’t walk away from it for too long.  It calls you back.... and you can’t resist its proposition to be a sovereign individual. 
So Neo,
Are you in for the short term small profits that will buy you a nice car or for the revolution that will enable economical self sovereignty to the human kind?
Whether the price goes up or down is up to you, Neo. 
Furthermore, what Bitcoin is worth for you is what really matters.

It’s always the right time to save money.  Plus you do not buy bitcoins, you sell government issued shitcoins for decentralized borderless hyperinflation avert censorship resistant sound money.
Do you believe Bitcoin can change the world and make it a better place?  That it can change your life and those of others positively by separating money from state?  
That is all you need to ask yourself.
