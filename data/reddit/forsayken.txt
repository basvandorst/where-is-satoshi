I want to know the bitcoin stat more. That is a SHIT TON of money. I guess you could determine the average transaction cost over a year somewhat easily and then find the number of transactions done in the last year. I am not familiar with enough bitcoin tool sites to find this but probably not that hard. I bet it's high...
Edit: Two comments below stated 2 billion and 1.6 billion. Awesome. In a shitty and completely useless way. Hope that improves drastically.

Not just voluntarily. Willfully. That would suck. Got a taste of it here in Canada in 2017-2018 though. Banks were shutting down people's accounts if they were moving money to exchanges and rejecting wires from exchanges. A bunch of other stuff too. Perhaps not directed by the government obviously but it's not like they were helping at all.

Force the banks and other financial institutions to stop working with any merchant or business that also chooses to try to accept cryptocurrency for payment or get involved in it in any way. No government services would accept it either.
Can't outlaw the medium but governments sure could do a great job regulating, blackmailing, oppressing, and extorting it out of what they recognize as normal.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:17:27
Yeah this is pretty awesome. I'm not really a believer in bitcoin but I just did a transaction and it was like 1/20th of what I was expecting and went through. This is enough to at least regain some confidence in its functionality in the future. We'll see if this rate remains as bitcoin's next surge.

To elaborate on another comment, this country WAS doing things other than oil. The leader at the time (in the last 20-30 years) decided that everyone should focus on oil and corn (for ethanol). This meant changing fields from other foods to corn and focusing on oil instead of perhaps manufacturing/exporting other things. Just about as soon as everything was up and running somewhat effectively, the price of oil crashed leaving the country with no profitable exports about a decade ago. Sanctions from the US exacerbated the problem. And because the government had seized control of everything oversaw just about all business, instead of trying to change, they doubled down and they are where they are as a result. The government also thought they could just print more money to try to solve the problem. This rarely works and is only a very short-term "solution". It obviously did not work out.
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:20:41

Anyone know when their Q2 earnings report is due?
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:44:58
It's a lot more complicated than that. One of the biggest reasons Venezuela is in the position they are in is because when oil was really expensive and ethanol was popular, they put all their eggs in one basket. Oil crashed, no one needed the corn, and then it was too late to change back and diversify their exports. 
This isn't the only factor obviously but it's a big one. Printing all the money ever was the result of poor decision-making by a terrible government but shitting on liberals and socialism in such an absolute way not accurate. We have plenty of countries that employ elements of socialism to varying degrees and are doing just fine. Venezuela went to far on the dial, has been run by dictators, and pissed off the US.

You could technically set up a system with a few consumer GPUs (around $1600-2000 for a 4-GPU set-up), mine whatever is most profitable (usually Ethereum) and then trade that for bitcoin (or whatever). What sucks about this process (other than mining a slow trickle of like $3USD/day) is you likely live in a country where you technically have to claim even event as a capital gain/loss so it becomes a tedious task or recording each time you got a mining payout, the current fiat value of said payout, and then the fiat value at the time of trade to another currency so you can calculate gain/loss.
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:05:31
Yeah. Scary. It does seem unlikely though. The new software would have to reach 51% before being fixed. As per most hypothetical situations such as this, wallets are typically safe. The issue is with transactions.
I guess at some point some blockchain out there is going to suffer huge. NEO has gone down a few times because it's basically centralized for now. Transactions were stuck for hours. I think up to half a day a few months ago. That in itself is scary to me.

Sorry to hear the bad news. It's terrible, I know. Unfortunately, no outside government will act. They can't. I believe the situation is beyond diplomacy and that's as far as foreign governments are willing to go. Change must come from within. As I said, it will be costly and tragic but unless the current leadership is ousted or willing to perform a completely 180, it's just about the only way.

It gets plenty of attention everywhere but it's old news and nothing is changing. It's also a heavily sanctioned country at this point. The leader is a dictator. Everyone knows.

Trading and withdrawals were going fine and had been for years. Quadriga isn't a new exchange. It's been around for quite some time. And then crypto withdraws stopped suddenly a few weeks before the exchange closed. But the real problem is that for at least a year prior to closing down, the exchange was not processing fiat withdrawls in any kind of timely manner. Sometimes it took 2-3 months for people to get their money. Sometimes longer. One could say the writing was on the wall but Quadriga was the  place in Canada to on-board and off-board from cryptocurrency; especially when dealing with larges quantities. I used it for quite some time and it was always fine for me. That said, I still never kept anything on there for very long and consider myself lucky to have withdrawn that last little bit of Ether days before it all shut down. That's important. But many people were trying to withdraw their cryptocurrency or fiat and without warning, were unable.

Hard to even imagine. How crazy would that be? It would have to be a project by some secret part of the government that has no skin in the fiat game. Again, so hard to even imagine. And now a significant amount of mining is happening from outside of the US. I guess one thing bitcoin could do is make other fiat currencies less desirable but the US dollar could remain.

@_date: 2017-08-15 13:03:11
Just keep it secure and if I were you, for the short term at least, keep an eye on Bitcoin Cash. I say that only because there could be a chance of it eventually taking the place of Bitcoin which means the price of BTC will plummet. There's really no proof of this but it would be unfortunate if you just left your coins and completely ignored them and a few years from now SOMEHOW BCH took over. I think it's unlikely; just worth keeping monthly tabs on or something. Otherwise, well done. Very wise investment years ago. I just got into crypto a few months ago when Ethereum took off.

Ah yes. The loss. We must impose this on our children early so they know how we feel.
So...$120 BTC or ... split it evenly across btc/bch/eth? I don't feel like any are going to plummet but eth looks to be the most stable/boring right now. Maybe I'll wait a few days longer and see what BTC does.

My (quite young) son has $120 in savings. I want to put that into crypto and then do the right parental thing and back it for him should he lose money. I am wondering if I should put it all into BTC or maybe get a mix. Perhaps BTC, BCH, and eth. Again, we're talking low numbers here but I can't come to a decision. Opinions?

I just got to me computer and noticed it's fairly down. I'll likely just resume buying in small inexpensive portions over a period of time to play it safe.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:40:54
Exactly. I think it's a fantastic idea. Savings accounts get MAYBE 1.5% in an ideal scenario. If you want more, it's locked away in GIC or mutual funds/ETFs and he can't get his hands on it if he decides he wants to spend it. I wish I bought in for him last week :) He'd see like 15% return already.

It's a rather long discussion and you've hit on a bunch of good points.  There are certain platforms that make use of this cookie. But its adoption is low right now. And I don't think its as universal as we would hope but I am not 100% sure. I've not read anything of a universal opt-in for... everything. Or just all advertising. I don't think it's as easy as we think. I mean, GDPR was passed two years ago, most places ignored it and waited for someone else to come up with a solution, and now everyone is panicking because they realized it was a huge issue and would take a lot of work to transition.
That said, I don't think it's called an opt-out cookie. More like opt-IN. That's the problem. Consent must be obtained from the user. The user doesn't have to seek out a service to opt-out. As a result, opt-in numbers will be extremely low unless it's a company like Facebook or Google that gates their services until you opt-in. It's essential low enough that websites that are primarily North-American or really anywhere else that have a small EU userbase may just give up altogether just to play it safe. The fines are significant and I'm sure these companies consulted a bunch of lawyers to weigh their options and this was the least impacting (which is what we did, as a North-American company). Beyond this, my knowledge, I believe, falters. As I understand it there isn't a universal opt-in. One is tailored for each service/platform. In some cases a general opt-in can work across a few platforms but there isn't one thing you can do to opt-in everywhere.


Agreed. I think for advertising, GDPR is overkill. But GDPR has a lot of extremely valid and important functions such as forcing companies to report breaches and forcing them to better secure important user-identifiable data (like personal/financial data - WHERE WAS THIS IN THE US WHEN EQUIFAX SHIT THEMSELVES?).
By the way those opt-outs before were a joke. Once you cleared your cookies or used a different browser, went to private mode, went to a different system, it was gone. They are non-transferrable. This is what makes an opt-in system so difficult now. Anything that relies on cookies is fallible but there isn't really another solution other than linking it to a login (Google, Facebook, a few others).
If GDPR comforts you enough to disable your ad blocker, power to you. I don't live in the EU so here I am using it because the overlay ads and the ones that start with audio are still around but if we can ever wrangle the industry just a bit so that its banners and user-initiated audio stop, we'll see. For now, ad block stays.

Oh you gone done it now. $-400 off the price, here we come!
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:17:47
As someone else replied and made an excellent point: it's about choice. It's your data someone else is using without your permission. I personally don't see this as a big deal because the data is more or less not personally identifiable but it's still a difficult point to argue because you're arguing a belief and it's not inherently right or wrong.
And let's face it, a lot of these targeted ads drop like 15+ cookies and are grossly inefficient. There are initiatives to improve this though but they aren't enforced (LEAN).
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:03:36
Nice to see a little hate for the GDPR. It's a bit over the top. I can understand why websites are just blocking out the EU. Their ad server alone would have to be completely revamped just so they don't target users with behavioral-based ads which I wish we could all agree are benign and harmless to begin with.

You have broken the prophecy.
@_date: 2019-10-02 17:43:28
With such a low supply of 21,000,000, if it does gain mass usage, the price of $1000 means there is only $21 billion worth of Bitcoin compared to USD. That's not very much money to work with. We already have people that possess $21 billion in regular fiat and a pile of millionaires in the US alone whose combined wealth far exceeds $21 billion.
Basically look at the estimated number of US dollars in circulation. If Bitcoin somehow replaced that or even just became a second currency that was used by 30% of the population, it's somewhat likely the market cap has to probably grow in proportion. And what if it's popular worldwide? And then consider the potential millions of bitcoin that are in wallets that are no longer accessible due to lost hardware/private keys/seeds/passwords/etc.
And yes, miners want to get paid. They require incentive. That's a whole other issue that will need to be dealt with once the block rewards are tiny after another halving or three. The chain will need to scale to handle so many more transactions because expensive transactions are not sustainable to the user and neither is the abysmal number of transactions per second or block. Eventually Bitcoin will probably need to handle a lot more transactions while keeping the transaction fee low so more people can use it, it doesn't get congested which increases tx times, and miners can still operate with a profit. Of course, this assumes the bulk of transactions are handled on-chain and something like Lightning has not gained traction. It's too early for me to have a strong opinion either way.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:22:36
We are now.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:43:56
I think people will retreat to cash and known stable investments with guaranteed income. Especially if prime rates increase. That means price of bitcoin will drop. The USD or other major fiat currencies would need to tank independent of other fiat currencies in order for people to want to retreat to cryptocurrency. Most might instead retreat to gold. Just my hypothesis. Bitcoin hasn't even been around during a significant financial crisis but if it reaches record highs, it comes at a great cost to others - however indirect.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:23:28

Fireproof safe/box somewhere where it won't get cleaned up and tossed out. On top of duct in the basement by the furnace or something. Taped to furniture is a bad idea in case that furniture gets thrown out. Taking pictures is a no-no but I guess if you had a device that had no wifi/bluetooth and removable storage and you took multiple pictures of a portion of the word, that might be OK. But it's digital so I don't trust it. That storage would go in the fireproof box and not used for anything else.
You can also etch the words on a piece of steel and store that somewhere safe as paper can rip/burn.
Otherwise, safe storage is always pretty tricky. Nothing is 100%. Your house can burn down. You can die. You might forget if you mix up a few words on the seed. You need to find a compromise that works for you that balances security and ease.

Buddy, you need to reply to comments to start a conversation.
But as others have said, sometimes happened along the way at some point that got your wallet compromised. The fact that you used the term "account" is worrying. Anything but the use of hardware wallet or some combination of offline, cold storage, and paper wallet mean you probably didn't practice proper security.
Sorry. But unless you can track down the person or somehow follow the coins to a known exchange address so the exchange can try to identify the person via KYC, you're out of luck.
Happy to answer any other questions but it's unlikely any will lead to the return of your coins.

Best to view prices of alts in terms of Bitcoin instead of USD. Fewer alts have fiat trading pairs whereas BTC is used as the main trading pair for alts.
If you do that today, it will paint an even more drastic picture where just about every coin in the top 100 is down and only a handful are up (and not by all that much).

All the other answers are correct but I just want to add the obvious: Before importing your private keys/seed words to access the wallets for the forks, move your bitcoin to a new wallet and don't use the original wallet again.

It's a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny fragment of global electricity usage. Factories, farms, banks, server farms, air conditioners, furnaces all use a lot more.
Also, if you're in a country or region that takes advantage of nuclear power or solar/wind, then crypotcurrency isn't going to impact climate change.
It just doesn't matter. It may use a lot of electricity but electricity usage of anything isn't so much a global problem as agriculture and shipping/logistics is. Both of these things yield more emissions than cars, for instance.
Best way to respond to this argument is to just not respond. Respect their opinion and move on. You don't need to convert people. How many people are even open to changing their preconceived notions? Almost no one. People are set in their ways. If bitcoin turns out to be important, they'll come later whether they like it or not.

Just in case certain chains might somehow interact with others. Sometimes new chains have glitches or problems and you don't want to have any risk of coins on another chain being affected.

True. This is definitely possible. And the network hash rate is very high so it can withstand a portion of the hashing power going elsewhere temporarily or even longer term.

Hardware wallets. Trezor or Ledger. I use Ledger. You can move your bitcoin there and then import that paper wallet into whatever other wallets to claim forks.
You can also just make a new seed in whatever wallet you're comfortable with and send your BTC there. Cheaper than a hardware wallet but I'm most comfortable using a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:30:35
In this specific case, wtf was the ICO for? What was their coin offering, if it was even a coin? Geez. This just raises so many red flags. But back in May 2017, shit was starting to go crazy and I can see why they managed to raise what they did.
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:22:29
You lose ease of access then. And the whole point of a paper wallet is that you are accessing it almost never because there is a non-zero chance your PC or phone is compromised and the more often you enter that private key, the greater chances there are of loss (malware, keyloggers, phishing, go to myettherwallet, etc.). 
A cold wallet, which I presume is usually a hardware wallet, is better. You gain mostly easy access but then you're left with having to safely store the seed words which would be a devastating loss should that piece of paper (or whatever) be lost or stolen if the device were damaged. Ironically, a lot of people put their seed words in a safe deposit box at a bank. Also, your hardware wallet is only good as long as it's in your possession. I would assume that if you ever had your hardware wallet stolen, it's only a matter of time before it's cracked and access to your wallets are gone. It's down to a race: can you acquire a new device and apply the seed words to it (or just use the seed words to generate the private keys) faster than a person can access the wallets via the stolen device?
I hate to admit it myself, but I think banks would be the best place to store crypto for probably 99% of users; especially if they "insured" it like fiat against loss via an attack against the bank; similar to what Coinbase offers now (though they do not cover losses due to loss of control of your account though). This particular situation has never really occurred with a traditional bank nor a site like Coinbase so I have no idea what would really happen vs. stated policies.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:48:32
They have a new desktop wallet app coming that consolidates everything and they add wallets for coins every so often. They don't have dedicated apps for enough coins though. Neo and Stellar have you accessing third-party wallets via Ledger which seems kind of half-assed.

BTC is very low right now. I'd be hesitant to sell any right now. That said, if you mined it back in the day or bought it for like $100, then you'll still up thousands of %.

HitBTC has been known to freeze accounts, and it's always been really shady. I've only read of one individual account that was frozen so far. This spawned news stories to say it's happening. Is it actually happening as widespread as we are being told? A lot of "websites" that write "articles" take content from Reddit posts. This isn't journalism. It's basically a blog that is made to look like a news article.
Just keep whatever you're not likely to trade in your own wallet. Most exchanges are fine and you're safe to keep some stuff there. I wouldn't get worked up over the idea of a centralized exchange. It's always useful for one technology to bridge with others somehow. We're not in the final form or probably even close but I wouldn't worry about a few shady exchanges out of so many. It's easy to simply not use that exchange anyways.
FYI just about everything except the one token I have been trading quite a bit in the last two months is in my own wallet. A solid 95%+.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:29:55
Exactly. I see a bunch of comments in here with small issues. I'll wait 2 weeks.
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:18:28
They have made me quite a bit of bitcoin in 2018 and I am proud of my growth. The problem is that while I grew my bitcoin holdings, I traded as both bitcoin and alts were losing fiat value so I have technically realized significant fiat losses.
When calculating capital gains/losses (at least in my country), you have to calculate the fiat value at the time of the trade relative to what that asset was worth when you original acquired it. Buy bitcoin at $10,000 and then trade it for some alt when it's worth $4000 and then sell that alt back when bitcoin is worth $3600. It's a loss every single time but I have more bitcoin than I originally had when I bought it at $10,000.

My initial response is that this assumes on-chain transaction speed NEVER changes. Will Bitcoin never change? That's it? What we have now is what we'll have in 50 years? If that's the case then why even bother?

Oh I meant that 95% of my assets are in cold storage and not touched. I play with the other 5% :) 
I was hit hard in 2018 too. The last few months of tiny trades with gains here and there have felt nice but I'm not going to beat around the bush: After my holdings falling like 50% overall, the 60% I've gained on the 5% I've been trading with in the last two months is nothing. It feels nice. But it's nothing. Like many others, I've got a long way to go!

Transparency, anonymity, and privacy are three very different things.
Bitcoin is 100% transparent, NOT private, and anonymity is up to interpretation. Every single transaction is public so that negates any privacy but it is anonymous in that your personal information isn't broadcasted. But your address is. If someone ever linked you and your wallet address(es), any and all anonymity that you thought you had is gone.
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:14:33
I'm tempted but it'll likely carry a price premium for a while. The Ledger Nano S did until recently. I'm not too concerned over bluetooth as the tx is signed on the Ledger. I don't know what someone could do if they intercepted that signed transaction. Anything? 
I'm sure you can still plug it in but time will tell if using Bluetooth is secure. People love attacking these devices. I'm sure we'll know within a month of release. The other big feature of this wallet is the ability to install far more wallet applications. 3-4 was the limit on the Nano S. This one can apparently do 60.

In addition to all the other answers, you absolutely need a buyer. That's how exchanges work. You're not selling to a middleman. There are services where there is a middleman but they would never assume this volume. If you set a sell order of 2.8 million BTC at a price of $3600, it will take a long time for buyers to commit to that price. You'd have to send some of that to a huge number of exchanges. A sell order like this would impact the market due to its size relative to daily volume and total supply.
Additionally, you could set a market sell. This is always interesting to think about and we've seen instances of this on a smaller scale. A seller did this to eth on Coinbase once crashing the price for a moment. I have seen this on smaller exchanges with coins that see very low volume like BCH. Someone set a market sell and crashed the price. A market sell will sell your bitcoin at whatever price is available based on the buy orders. If you went to an exchange with 2.8 million BTC and set a market sell, you'd fill many/all of the buy orders that other people have set. I imagine a sell order of that volume would be more than enough to crash the value of bitcoin to near $0.01 on that exchange until the order fills. You would lose a TON of money because much of your bitcoin would sell for a lot less than the current market value and lots of people would be enjoying massive discounts on the price of bitcoin.

I think most serious traders understand it perfectly and they want to keep their stuff on exchanges so they can make quick trades. This whole idea of Proof of Keys is nice.

I don't think we can for now but the price has only been plummeting for a month. Let's give it a few more months to see what happens as the overall market (hopefully) recovers a bit. Bitcoin has been stifled for years now. It has a tough road ahead of it to compete.

The platform still evolves and will still evolve. Requirements and application changes and bitcoin will adapt. It already has. Things like segwit and LN and just two obvious examples.

This is pretty huge but (to me anyways) I didn't know they had recently lost access to some cold wallets. This is by far the biggest and really the only exchange in Canada to convert CAD to cryptocurrency in large amounts... up until about a year ago. They removed all means of easy and fast means of fiat-&gt;cryptocurrency (Interac Online, Interac e-transfer) and offered only EFT/wire with high minimums.
There are also rumors that the CEO or someone high up died in India a month ago. Some don't believe it. The exchange has had severe problems with regards to withdrawing CAD for about the last 8-12 months and withdrawing cryptocurrency for the last few weeks. Often users had to wait for several days to receive cryptocurrency. The website went down for "maintenance" on Monday or Tuesday without any warning or announcement.
I wonder what will happen to users who had cryptocurrency or fiat on the exchange or in the middle of attempting to withdraw?
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:42:11

Yes. It's possible an employee could get into your safe deposit box and take your seed. The intention is to minimize risk. They aren't going to know you put a seed in the box though. And you're not going to tell them. You don't need to disclose what's in there. Again, minimize risk. There's a good chance that storing your seed at a bank is probably among the safest methods of storage.
Additionally, you can slightly obfuscate your seed words by simply swapping the order of the first two words on the piece of paper. Extremely simple method of hiding your seed even if someone gets their hands on it.
For your latter point, at that point it's down to a race between you with (hopefully) the hardware wallet + a copy of the seeds vs the thief: Who can access and move the coins first?

I'm talking about the Vega 64 and Liquid variants. The Vega 64, for example, is 20% slower than a 1080 Ti and uses 20% more power, on average. To add to that, the 1080 Ti is cheaper because the Vegas are getting bought out for Monero mining. I personally prefer AMD but there's no reason to go Vega for gaming except the Vega 56 if you can get it close to MSRP; and even then, the 1070 is so close it to in terms of performance that if you can find one of those close to MSRP, you're just as well off.

The only thing I worry about Bitcoin sometimes is that regular people can't use consumer-grade hardware to mine. The mining hardware is too centrally controlled at this point and I hope that new contenders enter the space offering more hardware at scaling prices over the next few years.
I want to be able to put down like $1000 in hardware and mine at a profit. I could do that with ethereum up until a month or two ago (more or less). The warehouses full of hardware will never stop but I'd feel better if I knew it was easy to put a machine or two in my basement affordably.

The deal was done in the mail. The seller alleges the money was mailed as cash but was more than $10,000 (around $14,500) and he claims to have contacted the buyer after and wanted to cancel the deal. So did he actually send the bitcoin? Or no.

Yeah. Between the two LTC is faster and cheaper. But for how long? It just seems like a temporary advantage. And then eth and many other cryptos are even cheaper and faster than LTC.

I read most of the article and didn't notice a mention of how many wallets can be installed at once on the hardware. The Ledger Nano S can fit a paltry 3-4 at once. You can add/remove as needed without issue of losing access to existing wallets but it's a pain. Apparently it has just 320Kb of storage. Their next wallet better be able to fit like 100 wallets or more.
Both companies need a "next generation" wallet that is a bit bigger, bigger screen with more info on the screen with at least the ability to show the entire wallet address on the screen (a problem with the Ledger) as well as the amount at the same time. Trezor seems to have this covered. I only have a Nano S but it just doesn't seem that rugged. I'd pay more for something knowing that I can toss it around and feel confident it can handle a little bit of abuse.
The other thing I would prefer is more desktop apps for Ledger wallets. It's not the end of the world to use the MEW site for ERC20 tokens or Neon for Neo or the Stellar site to access lumens wallet but a single desktop app that supports all their coins (or maybe the more popular ones) would be ideal.
The last sort of confusing thing is you use the Bitcoin desktop app to access all coins previously forked from Bitcoin. BCH, BTC, Litecoin, Vertcoin, etc. It's not immediately clear that this is the case so you install the wallet app on your device and you're left to search the website or use Google to figure out how to generate a wallet and use it. This is even more confusing if it's something like Neo where there isn't a Ledger desktop app. You have to install Neon and use that. It's just not clear to the user. But once you know this the device is easy to use and it's cheap if you can find one.

I've never understood the value proposition of Litecoin. It's just there. It's cheaper per unit but who cares? Truth be told I often think Bitcoin isn't going to be  or perhaps even in the top 5 in the future because I think the ability to easily obtain a cryptocurrency that isn't so volatile is what will be used and that it's probably more likely that blockchain takes off and we just end up using it to govern fiat transactions. The future is unknown but I just don't know why Litecoin has hung around so well, why it took off late last year (probably noobs on Coinbase...maybe), or what the heck it's going to offer in the future that every other crypto doesn't already do.

I read that story too. Tough to hide with the Homeland and state department are on you. But it's probably an edge case among edge cases. But a non-zero chance I agree. Swap two of the words. Reverse the order. Just about anything will be sufficient for most.
Or etch it on a piece of aluminum and bury it somewhere. Unfortunately, being our own bank is hard.

I watched the entire video. I don't think it's the lack of attorney that's the main issue. Any that is appointed to him has a ton of homework to do. He also seems a little bit crazy to me and his rambling and opinions of things just got worse as the video progressed. I'd be interested in a follow-up after the trial is finished.

I suspect AMD will just struggle forever. Solid CPUs. The RX 580 is fine. Vega 56 is OK but the rest of Vega is bad (mostly due to extreme power draw and same price as 1080 ti but far slower). CPU sales are fairly good. GPU sales are great (obviously, Ethereum mining). Their hardware is in both consoles. And yet...here we are.
I bought a Freesync monitor before Vega released :(

I have a Ledger. When you first turn it on you can generate seed words which use the BIP39 and 44 protocol to generate keys and stuff.
Now...I have no idea how these companies don't know the seeds. I just know that you can generate random seeds. You can even generate or make up your own seed words (as long as they properly adhere to the respective protocol/standard) externally to the device and enter that into the Ledger wallet and you're good to go. There is a level of trust that I have in Ledger that they aren't somehow seeing your seed words. I naively assume that because there's never been a reported problem of stolen coins on hardware wallets that I'm safe. You can also use the device in an offline environment to sign a transaction I believe. Just in case you are paranoid.
Hope I got most of this right. There were few answers here when I posted so I figured I'd take a shot and hopefully point you in the right direction.

Why did BCH use the same address format at BTC? But isn't that common with forks of any coin?
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:47:48
Neither the Ledger nor the Trezor have been remotely compromised yet. There have been a few outlier cases where a very specific set a conditions are met where someone with physical access to the device (I think it was a Ledger Nano S) where they were able to access some part of it and this was fixed via firmware update. I can't even recall any of the conditions. I am of the opinion that if any popular hardware wallet ever sees widespread security issues, crypto as a whole will be in a very bad spot because cold wallets and software wallets either lack user-friendliness/ease of use or security.

Where have you been? I've seen him a few times a week for the past 3 months :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:29:38
I figure he's making moves during times where the price rises quickly (like now). Why not? I would. And have. Looks like BCH's week-long run is starting to taper off. Too soon to tell as the change is more gradual compared to the two last year but if he and many other large stakeholders are not selling during times like this and rebuying later then they are simply missing out on easy money.

I don't see the problem with this either. Most of my profits in 2017 were from Bitcoin Cash during those two spikes. Price was going up every time I hit F5. Made like 200% in one evening of watching the price like a hawk.
Only problem is that while I managed to sell at the peak, some poor bastard bought at the peak.
I didn't get in on Bitcoin Cash last week. I'm sitting this one out. Not risking it. I also disagree with the way Bitcoin Cash is conducting itself but I'm a small fish so I'll take my money and move it to something else with a smile on my face.

I like it even more now because you call it "the thinking dinosaur".
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:27:23
yeah but I can only look back and see that 30% I missed out on.
The other small problem I have is that I am using Coinbase and am Canadian and they offer no ability to sell in Canada. So if I ever want to get out, I've not even looked into how to do so. I've only bought 1eth so far but I feel like I should figure out how to sell should I feel the need.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:29:25
Well done! I am getting there! .088. I bought some of that and NiceHash'd the rest. Just a few more days.
I also bought 1 Eth which for some reason feels like an accomplishment.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:51:18
I'm betting on no. It hit $2900 for a few minutes and it's back to $2875 give or take $10.
When does the fork happen? A few hours? I think it will drop some when that happens.

I signed up for quadrigacx.com. Seems to be working great and it's apparently a Canadian exchange. Everything is CAD.
Sending your crypto is just like sending in any other wallet/platform. Just get the destination address, cross your fingers, and off you go.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:46:57
Quadrigacx.com. However, since mentioning them, I've gotten a warning or two. No problems at all. Easy to set up. I'm a small-time investor and will be starting quite slow and taking baby steps as I learn but no concerns with Quadriga so far.
I've heard good things about coinbase.io but no personal experience.

@_date: 2017-07-22 20:03:52
Without warning you that you cannot sell before you sign up or make purchases. Very unfortunate. I will be moving my eth from their soon enough.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:47:58
They also pulled the ability to sell if you are Canadian some time ago but they do not warn you during the sign-up process OR before you buy. So I bought some stuff and realized I can't sell it. Very shady. I only bought 1eth so not a huge purchase by any means. It just means I need to transfer it elsewhere if I ever want to get rid of it. Very annoying.
Their interface and the whole website is easy to use though. Very friendly, simple UI.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:55:17
Nothing lost except the transaction fee to purchase. It was easy to transfer to my new exchange of choice.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:57:46
I'm not aware of any premiums or fees other than the transaction fee which is 0.05%. Maybe?
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:30:54

It says so on the withdraw section. It's hard to believe.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:13:09
I'll have to compare buy prices next time I make a purchase. Someone else had mentioned that Quadriga seems a bit more expensive. I've seen some differences in prices at certain times but they seem to level out after a short while. Can't say I can explain that but I'll keep an eye out for it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:02:21
So you bought at the peak when I did too, eh? heh heh. Lessons learned :)
I bought at $2800. But only $200 worth as a test. No harm done.

OP said 6 minutes no 60 seconds.
Oh sorry. I misread your comment.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:53:54
Stripped my account yesterday. 
Mainly because I am Canadian and they don't say you can't sell if you are. No warning when creating account, transferring funds, or making purchases. That irritated me quite a bit.
I want to hope all the complaints about them are just because they have a lot of users but it's still a lot of complaints. Nice UI though.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:57:24
Hey. Just letting you know I ended up signing up for this and did a small test purchase ($50CAD) and everything worked out OK. I've not sold yet as I would lose $0.50CAD but it all looks good so far. Funding your account is a bit of a pain but that's the same everywhere but transaction fees for buying/selling in the platform appears to be cheap (0.5%). WAYYYYY cheaper than Coinbase's 4 fucking %!
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:55:41
They're quiet now because they bought at $3500. Everyone should know by now how much manipulation exists on social media. Including memes.

@_date: 2019-05-10 17:59:47
Most bitcoin wallets create a new address from the seed and are not re-used unless intentionally re-used. This is definitely a factor while plenty of other chains like eth re-use. This explains some of the gain but not the loss of others.

@_date: 2018-12-20 18:37:06
If it can drop 40% in a week, it can go up 25% in a week (well, 3 days and counting). I wouldn't bother trying to tie each move to one single event.

The results of 2008 didn't open up shit. No one cares or is acting in a way to prevent the same actions from happening again. Banks shit the bed with shitty loans. Government bails them out. Free fucking money. Tons of people lose their homes because they were too stupid and took on too much debt and banks were too stupid to say no. Companies get funded by the banks to buy up a shit ton of property around the world which just so happens to be having a fire sale. 10 years later and most property value in any big city has increased in value by 100-200% or more. The markets have not only recovered but are up just as much as property in the last decade. Government hardly helped the citizens. Instead they hoped (ha! They knew what they were doing) by helping the banks and large corporations that they would help the general population somehow. But no. The automotive companies are moving operations to wherever is cheapest and the banks continue to do whatever they want. They're not giving out shit mortgages to poor people anymore. Instead they are funding these massive equity firms that are buying up the property and renting it to the poor people. Much safer bet for the banks.
We won't see the banks or government change in our lifetime. Laws and regulation will come and go but as long as the banks help write those laws (which isn't ending any time soon), they'll make sure there are still many avenues for control and the transfer of wealth upwards.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:27:45
It distances you from your country's or government's currency. If you deal in USD or EU or CAD or whatever this isn't so important as these currencies are arguably valuable, stable, viable, mostly successful. They're already represented in a digital manner that you can just flash around a card or your phone and spend as you need. However, if you are in countries susceptible to high inflation AND where you cannot easily move your currency to global markets, bitcoin is an excellent way to try to save your wealth. It may even grow your wealth but that should technically be secondary. When 1 dollar of your currency now only gives you 80 cents of buying power next year, bitcoin can help shelter your buying power because it being a global or borderless currency, it's not impacted by the economy of a single country.
That said, if the US or China or other massive markets shifted up or down, Bitcoin is obviously impacted because its penetration is still relatively low. For now. But the goal and the hope is that later is will be a borderless, global, trustless currency that can be used just about anywhere would having to put in any significant effort.
Lastly, it's hard not to believe the fiat value of Bitcoin isn't going to increase overall if you have a decent understanding of it. Lots of us say we're here for the technology and blah blah blah but the potential of financial freedom is too hard to ignore. We want money. Especially those under 40 that are also old enough to see how the distribution of wealth has been conducted in the last 20 years but especially in the last 10 years. It's difficult to trust large corporations and our governments. We want to stop working before we hit 40. Or 50. We're due for a recession. Autonomy and AI are going to replace a pile of jobs. Traditional jobs are disappearing. If Bitcoin is going to hit $100,000 or even $50,000 in the next five years, this could offer a lot of people quite a bit of freedom from the pressures of shifts in politics and economies and really just about anything. But most of all, it would be ideal to be able to just use bitcoin for real transactions and not even have to convert it to fiat first.
