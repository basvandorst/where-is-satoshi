The site tools used together to pick up a hexadecimal key would work obvious, but it requires the person to be aware of each step, and the process is slow and infeasible if you need to convert many private keys. You would be surprised if you knew the huge amount of private hex keys that people have around. Doing this hand-by-hand 1 for 1 is very slow and would take valuable time on these sites. Not to mention that any site may be stealing your private keys typed in the &lt;input&gt; &lt;textarea&gt; text fields and sending them to their Server via Ajax without page refresh. High risk, having to disconnect the network from the machine to "cheat" would be annoying and yet dangerous by Cookies.
For unitary things we have BitAddress (which does not serve to generate secure paper wallets, there is an entropy limit vulnerability that allows crackers to steal funds from private keys generated with low entropy.)
Already for massive limits with large amounts of Private Keys there are no online tools available, but my tools work like magic pass for large volumes, saving everyone's time.

Yes, this is the simplest solution.

You're welcome. The Python version must be incompatible. Install Python 2.7 and try using the script. After installing, make sure it is in version 2.7, you may need to configure it in the System Environment Variables, or simply run the script from the Python 2.7 folder in C:/Python27/
Once inside the folder then, paste the files of script and use the command: python.exe [mega-tool-pvkmassconvert.py](

Make sure your system is running the script in Python 2.7. Once this is done, ensure that the input data is the same as the input sample file.
Type in cmd: python --version
And see what version it uses.

Correct in part, the project is not an Operating System, it just requires the user to install Python 2.7 and use it successfully. Nothing more, it is simpler than installing a game on the computer. The screenshot images prove to work in Python 2.7 and several users have been successful with this.
Installing Python 2.7 as well as the informed libs is a basic and standard requirement that anyone must pass.
The project is Open Source and works with high volume keys, the speed is obviously changed and that does not make it bad for the job, but it works like a magic pass. Unlike Operating Systems that generally receive a lot of financial incentive to be updated, because my project is free there is no financial incentive to upgrade the code to be 100% compatible with Python 3+.
You can use the version released with Python 2.7 without problems like many other users.
