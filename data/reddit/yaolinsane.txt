why hasn't btc's price dropped with all the recent negative news?  dwolla, okpay, liberty reserve all within the last 2 weeks.  is it because nobody can get money in or out of mtgox?  
what's to stop the feds from claiming all bitcoin related businesses are "facilitating money laundering"?

there's definitely been a lot of bad news for bitcoin lately, dwolla, liberty reserve, okpay.  im sure there will be more.  the feds definitely are doing surveillance on cryptocurrencies.
however, i think the fact that we have VC investment and many regulated startups (coinbase, bitinstant) that are in full compliance with financial regulations should stave off any massive coordinated attack.  At least, I hope so.
worst case scenario is the feds do a "sting operation" by purchasing btc from mtgox, then buy drugs from silkroad, then trying to shutdown mtgox for "facilitating money laundering for illegal drugs".
why hasn't bitcoin prices dropped in the face of all this bad news these last 2 weeks?  my guess, is that the only people left holding bitcoin are the early adopters.
a good indicator of the effect of the federal crackdown, will be the continuance of VC capital into bitcoin startups or lack there of.  also if dwolla can fix its compliance w/fincen regulations and return to serving the btc exchanges then that will mean the feds will lay off our backs.
im just trying to figure if the Feds are going after a select few btc startups or waging an indiscriminate all out war on bitcoin.

Which means he has zero incentive to say that btc can not be used for goods and services.

So where's the best place for Americans to trade btc?  I have coinbase but its not really for daytraders or swing traders

if you're going for slow and longterm growth, isn't it much safer in an index fund?

from their user agreement page: " Coinbase also allows users to buy and sell bitcoin. Coinbase is an independent contractor for all purposes. Coinbase does not have control of, or liability for, the products or services that are paid for with Coinbase services. We do not guarantee the identity of any user or other party or ensure that a buyer will complete a transaction. Coinbase is not a money transmitter. Coinbase assists its users in Bitcoin transactions."
are we at risk of having our accounts frozen like dwolla/mtgox?

Btc china has zero trading fees. That fact makes me question how much of the volume was generated by either whales or HFT bots.

if they cut off the exchanges, that will drive the btc economy completely underground.

I'm sure the CEO of btc china knows more about Chinese btc regulations than you do. It is his job to know what is or is not legal.

im in a sort of similar boat to you.  i have a few $k on mtgox in cash and waiting for the right entry point.  im just not sure when.  if the silk road crash had dropped the price to $50, i would've bought a lot of bitcoin.  
it's hard to figure things out with technical analysis when we have withdrawal issues on gox possibly blurring the volume.  this in addition to obvious price manipulation by whales and bots.
any reason why u think $135 on gox is a good entry point?  you don't think it will drop further to conslidate?

I expect a digital currency offered by Chase to appear more legitimate than bitcoin to nongeeks.
