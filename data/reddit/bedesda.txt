Coinbase is an exchange.

To reset, you must enter a wrong pin code 3 times in a row. You will then be prompted to either create a new seed or use a backup one.

You can use if you have any questions or feel free to send me a message.

Yes, using the interface you can go through the addresses you have that contain coins.

Viruses on smartphones might be unlikely that is true, but it already happened and will happen again. 
Would you take the bet and keep all your BTC on it? That's your choice. I personally feel safer using a HD wallet.

Depending on their infrastructure it might or might not be the case.
But someone could always delete their entire server/backup and you'd lose everything.
There is nothing safer than owning your keys.

They are not. Viruses exist for both iOS and Android.

You would use the backup option.
Via the device, you would then enter your list of words, install the apps via the Ledger manager and everything would be as it was.
Do you plan on getting one?

Actually yes, 4 coins at a time. You can always uninstall an app and reinstall it (or another one).
But their next software update should make this whole process transparent for the user. You would then technically be able to interact with all your coins at the same time.

Charged 35.00 BTC when moving 5.00 BTC? Seems like a faire price to me.

Fees for the transfer or exchange fees?

IMO the nano is a better choice. The product itself seems more reliable to store your keys using the Secure Element tech.
