pewdiepie a famous youtuber overtly and hilariously pushes his own gaming chair which is $399 and he always makes jokes about how expensive it is, "BUT CAN IT DO THIS????" and he leans way way back until its flat. Hence the joke at the top about the dollar bill folding way forward (back)

What all did he share? The post seems edited now

Cash purchase personal loan probably. 20% APR

So you pronounce the “r” ehh?

Lol yep. However if he can afford the payments comfortably I guess it comes down to risk tolerance. Still stupid imo

What DB do you use for billions of records that’s fast enough for brute forcing

Yes that seems slightly more accurate. Although I still don't really consider him that just because he's a dick. Maybe it's because I've deslt with enough assholes in business but in the end it's usually just selfish behavior and looking out for their families. Bad but not out of the ordinary. Sociopaths and psychopaths to me are people who do very insane or cruel shit that is hard to watch or hear about
@_date: 2017-04-29 02:12:40
That's not a psychopath. That's just someone who loves money more than people

Seriously? Don’t be stupid. Much of Chinese business culture says lying is completely OK.

What actually happened? What were you trying to do
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:38:19
If I had any serious amount of coins I wouldn’t keep them on the same computer that I have ANY apps on at all. It’s not all or none here
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:55:15
What’s your point. Lots of apps cost money 
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:36:38
I never said security was the reason... I said convenience. Why would I want to dig in 5000 chrome tabs when I can have a native app. If you actually read what I said I have a second computer where I actually do trading where I have nothing installed.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:09:55
Those 2 things aren't contradictory. Oh right you wanted ad hominem... dipshit.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:24:34
Because some people want a seamless experience. How is that hard to understand? The same reason people use the mail app for gmail instead of using gmail.com constantly open in a chrome tab
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:52:57
I have more than one computer. All my trading happens on my isolated computer that's very strict about what gets installed, etc. On my laptop I am less cautious in the name of convenience.

Probably in my second or third comment in that chain.

I would say the biggest "issue" is that it's not insured. If your coins get stolen because of some malware keylogging on your computer, you don't get it back. Whereas if your money gets stolen from a bank (or your credit card or wherever) you are reimbursed.

The more I think about this, the more I think you should definitely emphasize donations. It never even occured to me you have a donation area.
If someone had asked me, I would have said "oh I'm sure he does", but the thing is most people don't think like that. They're busy mass-installing crap on their computer or someone tells them they should use it.
On your homepage you dont mention donations prominantly (put a huge yellow box beneath the download button),
Also it may have this already but I can't remember... it should nag you after you use it for a week to donate, and do direct links from all payment methods right in the popup itself (fix your dwolla image, ints broken image).
Also don't put "paypal" as lease preferred imo. It's below the fold for me, where I can't see it. Considering I don't use any of the top items I would have closed this page right away... move it up right along with the others and just put it last, and then you can put tiny text below it that says (charges a fee), but imo not anything about being "not preferred". Some money is better than $0, and a HUGE percentage of people use paypal only. You're shunning all those people subconsciously.
Finally, you can put it IN RES itself very prominently. IMO it should go in the left sidebar above all the options, below the search (above "About RES"), or even in the title bar if you make it stand out.
Overall, I think monetization wise you're just missing out on so many opportunities and people just simply DONT KNOW they're even supposed to donate. You really have to go out of your way to think about it, find it, dig for it... and thats going to be like &lt; 1% of users.

Yes you deserve more :| link?

I wonder why its in because it's not
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:54:59
Heres my thought. You provide an AMAZING SERVICE.... theres no question about that. The value for what you give (free) is insane.
It's not like you interfere with the reddit experience, which I think is what most people care about... so, if youre not doing that, then you should hit it super hard in all the spots in between (during installation, during configuration). Those areas are seen so infrequently that I see nothing wrong at all to ask for that skrilla.

Great story. Good ending. Would read again.
