The money just burns in our hands. 
Agree 100%

Let's be honest. If you put that money in a retirement account you get effectively NOTHING. With Crypto, the returns are good. Sure crashes happen all the time, but we just HODL and get past them.
When real crashes happen like the 2008 collapse, all the retirement accounts get wiped out.
TL;DR: Upside: Could make a million or more
Downside: Could lose a fraction of the $10k if it all goes belly up.
You are doing the right thing.

I've 20+ years of IRAs and 401k's. Returns are negligible.
No-one should be putting money into crypto that they aren't able to lose. That said, you were as hell will NOT get rich from retirement funds.

1) Those approaching retirement couldn't HODL. I did, but luckily I wasn't approaching that age. I know may people who lost everything during that time: lifestyle, car, house.
2) Crypto is a roller coaster ride, and is acknowledged as such. Never put in more than you can't flush down the toilet. If you wanted to keep pre-tax money safe, you put it into retirement funds.
3) 401ks and IRAs are considered by many to be 'responsible' and 'safe'. 2008 proved they were neither.

If you add ALT coins, it's a real coin collection
