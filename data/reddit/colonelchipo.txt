I'm not an expert here ... I want to understand the reason why people make themself full node :) So it's not for the money but more for contributing to the blockchain and his community ? With a full node at home you can't have some coins for yourself ?

Hi, 
With this full node at 1Gbps how many coins do you mine for yourself ?

Yes i agree about china, but this why i do not feel comfortable. I'm a holder for sure but i also want to buy the dip like everyone. I miss my chance to buy before the hard fork and i really don't want to miss my chance this week end. I was wondering if it's the good time to buy the dip or not ?

But Electrum is connected to internet ? I want to generate a key offline (i know how to do it) but with my keys after that can i go on electrum and "activate" my account ? and then keep the keys who had generate offline ? 
I hope my english is good ... sorry for spelling errors :p

Maybe i'm wrong about this "branch problem", but if i understand correctly when a fork happens it's create another branch of bitcoin and then you have to be sure when you are buying bitcoin that they are on the right branch ?

how do you buy your bitcoin if you can not use your bank account?

We agree if i'm telling you that the only difference between Legacy and Segwit is low fees ? (and rapidity) but there is no problem about different coins or chain ? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:31:16
Ok i see, thanks you a lot for your help. God save reddit and his community :) 
I have a better understanding now and i'll just buy a ledger ... it's maybe free to do it yourself in a offline environment but it's hadder and really not convenient. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:38:15
Ok ok i understand now :) So ledger wallet is my only solution héhé 
Thanks a lot !!

Ok so only a hardware wallet can manage all my keys in the same interface (same place) and do it offline ? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:37:31
I just don't want to manage 300 differents keys with maybe 0.000002 btc per keys ... i want to manage this in the same interface and do it without internet ...

If legacy and segwit are the same (segwit have lowers fees) why not use the segwit branch ? both are not protected against replay attack so segwit is better for us ? same security with lowers fees

Can i use the same computer but with two different environments : 
- MacOS with internet when i want to work / check youtube etc... 
- Linux without internet but i boot it on my MacBook with a USB key 
With this i can generate my private/public keys offline, store it in my USB Key. Is that alright ?

So if the market cap increases a lot normaly it's because a lot of people are buying coins ? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:30:28
So if market cap increases it's because people are buying coins right ? If people are buying coins, the price increases ? But if the marketcap increase a lot and the price stay the same what does it means ? 
Sorry i try to understand ... I'm maybe all wrong 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:15:15
Ok, so the main difference between Legacy and Segwit is lower fees and both are not protected against replay attack ? So it's seems today everybody can be a victim of replay attack ? how can i sell my coins safely then ?

This is not about Segwit2X ... i don't want to be on the wrong branch, buy or receive bitcoin who are not on my branch .. Legacy one or segwit one (segwit from August ofc not 2x)
