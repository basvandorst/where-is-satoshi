I work in a bar and handle a lot of cash, where can I get a stamp like this?

So I used to work on the largest repo and sec lending floor in the world, built the first repo benchmarking tool the industry had seen, and automated sec lending trader analytics. My team managed $550B, with a B. We were a leading team, but my firm managed $5T, with a fucking T. It's crazy to me how dark the repo market still is, like nobody actually knows true analytics of that market, and it's one of the largest and most influential markets in the world. It's the one market that still has wildly lax oversight, while having some of the most violent impact to overall markets. It's basically the spark of any run on credit, and it cadcades major fuckery across every other market, dries up liquidity, and accelerates panic. That said, there wouldn't be much of a fixed income/credit system without it, so it's kind of a necessary evil.

It's not like they have to pay a bunch of people to work on it for years before it's actually sold. That doesn't cost a boatfuck of money, and it's usually paid for by investments and trade agreements, so there's not other people who need to get paid once it hits market. Your smart phone is a cataclysmic piece of tech, and if you don't like paying iPhone prices, go get a fucking Android like an adult.
