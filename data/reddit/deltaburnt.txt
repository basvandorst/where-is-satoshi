There are ways to implement higher level transaction types like escrows within the Bitcoin protocol itself. Furthermore, even if you needed a Paypal like service, you still have the option of using vanilla Bitcoin at any time (for things like tipping or more anonymous payments).

This really puts things into perspective. I had in my mind some super genius (or team of them) 25-30 year old computer scientist. While the genius part is apparently true, hearing that he had a stroke and deals with cancer definitely takes away the hero/god ideal of him. Hopefully this doesn't make his difficult life any harder (though undoubtedly it will).
I'm also somewhat disappointed that he's a hardcore libertarian (nothing wrong with being libertarian of course), and *that's* what motivated him to make Bitcoin. It makes sense, but I've always been one to marvel at Bitcoin not because of its ability to tell Gov't to go fuck itself, but because of the sheer technical ability it took to make it. There's a lot of people here who argue and talk about the economic side of Bitcoin, I was kind of hoping Satoshi didn't care about that and just wanted to create a powerful new protocol capable of more than just money transactions.
But hey, maybe this is all just a hoax.

Their business would fail if bitcoin fails. If they do double spending they could very well crash the market value and a lot of the current momentum bitcoin currently has.

She might have to wait for a verdict or until she's held in contempt of court before doing that though.

There are far better pools that take 0% fees. I myself am using bitcoinpool because they're transparent and have monthly giveaways (so not only do they not take from their users, they give to them).

I started about a couple weeks ago, that was back when I could have bought for about $5-$8.

Other than when the site is getting DDOS'd I get close to 1 bitcoin and multiple payouts per day (which I suppose is good on a 200 Mh/s machine). But to be honest I am thinking of switching off bitcoinpool because of the pain in the ass pool hopping prevention system (which I don't pool hop but I do get flagged by the system).

No they have money from their archaic systems that can use much better tech developed by other people.

Seriously, if that many computers crashed at once I'd be more worried about the computers regulating hospital systems, defense networks, etc.

Damn, I wish I knew that. I honestly wouldn't have posted if I knew it was supposed to be a surprise.
Hopefully it will be a surprise to those that don't know of bitcoin.

So are there people mining on the TestNet network to confirm these dummy transactions used for testing?

Do something similar to bitcointip and have them fill a wallet the site and the user have access to. Whenever it's time for tipping you draw from this wallet. The biggest problem I suppose is if you're hacked, getting access to those bitcoins would be trivial.

It also proves how speculation shouldn't be used on something that was just meant as an exchange of currency. People need to stop looking at bitcoin as coins but instead as a protocol.

Well I don't see much reason for someone to impersonate Jeffrey Tucker on reddit, and then go around lying about his stance at a company. Not to mention the account is 4 years old.

Thanks! This was my first time getting a tip :)

That's entirely different because bitcoin works differently from credit cards in terms of payment. In terms of storage of both it's incredibly easy to keep safe.

I mined 3.5 bitcoins in the summer of 2011 over the course of about a week and a half. I really wish I kept doing that all summer...

The way I explain how bitcoin can't be respent and how it's verified is that it's kind of like trying to rewrite recent history. If you look at all US History textbooks, they all pretty much agree that the American revolution happened, you can verify it with many sources. If you wanted people to think the revolution never happened it'd be a very long arduous process of destroying the old textbooks then writing new ones.
However more modern events are a little more fuzzy. Not all current history textbooks even acknowledge the impact of the internet yet. If you only get your information from textbooks, you can't be 100% sure on this whole internet thing until more books come out agreeing with what you've read.
Your above infographic explained things perfectly to me when I first read it, but from my experience most people who aren't programmers or computer savvy really understand what it's talking about.

My point is you're getting similar consequences for the same exact actions. Hacking is just moving numbers around same as Bitcoin. Everything on a computer can be equated to moving numbers around.

I wouldn't really classify it as a JRPG honestly. It's more like a visual novel that has some JRPGs parodies, a really depressing, very saddening story, and a very wonderful soundtrack. Don't start this game expecting any real gameplay beyond solving a couple half-brained puzzles.

They can make some small cash now and have bitcoin be crippled, or they can help bitcoin thrive and possibly make money for years to come.

Well to be fair, a lot of OP's point comes to
"People are mean and may want to hurt bitcoin, and the people on bitcoin aren't guaranteed to be geniuses."
Bitcoin is in the same light as Linux. Do you trust your computer to run Linux even though it's completely open to almost anyone to add to it (thought slightly more restrictive)? Couldn't Microsoft and Apple put a lot of money behind stomping out Linux? Wouldn't people want to find exploits in Linux if it gets even more popular?

Even if early adopters benefited hugely with low risk, why is that a problem with bitcoin?
