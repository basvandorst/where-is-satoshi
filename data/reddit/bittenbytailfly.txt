Gains of a couple of hundred can make huge differences to some people. Making money and being "rich" is all relative.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:45:38
Still not the most questionable alt-coins I've come across ...
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:02:06
You seem to have added the last three words to your title unnecessarily.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:15:53
Mine just appeared (21hrs) so maybe they're just swamped. Hope yours comes through soon - best of luck.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:34:48
Not tried that combination, but I sent some Ether to my Ledger Nano almost 24 hours ago and it seems to have vanished ...
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:02:30
I would personally order direct as it's the only way to be 100% - it's probably about the same price but you'll have to wait a little longer.
That said I've sold four on eBay still factory sealed and I'm not dodgy :-)

It's three crypto-years, which are relative to normal stock market years and translates to about 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:34:29
I got down voted for this in the past but basically the old rule of not putting all your eggs in one basket still applies.
I maintain that everyone should have a percentage in crypto, but also in traditional stocks, property, saving accounts etc. The percentage split is ultimately up to you, but every one of them could do in value or even collapse, and there's no safety net in this instance.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:13:14
He could we'll still be smiling ... I decided not to put in at $3.5k because it was "too expensive".
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:35:20
As tempting as is to sell alts there will be a shift (there always is). Historically looking at charts it's easy to look at the peaks and troughs and buy/sell accordingly. If it were that easy though, we'd all be millionaires.
DYOR, but I'm looking at coins I genuinely believe have potential but are suffering due to the BTC bull run. There are some sh*tcoins that probably are overvalued, but some genuine picks that will come back - maybe over the course of a year or so. Ask yourself though, are you looking to invest it make a quick buck short term?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:49:27
The could be some that are genuine, but after attending the seminar and seeing this sort of thing in action I'd be cautious.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:09:42
Give it a week or so ...
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:43:53
I guess it varies between websites, but I attended a security seminar recently and they demonstrated a site that was hacking. Can't remember the name of it now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:17:37
In a year's time it might even be considered a crash!
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:06:59
Think of it as an insurance policy - you get one to minimize the risk. Due to exchange rates and demand, I bought five and sold four on eBay, essentially making my one free.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:15:45
Lesson learned.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:06:38
Psychologically big round numbers always cause resistance. There will be many early adopters looking to cash out at $10k. Which direction it goes after that is anyone's guess!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:09:52
Indeed. I want to see it hit $10k, but I'd love to see a dramatic drop so I stand a chance of owning  at least a small percentage of a coin!
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:35:46
Bitcoin faucets are always popular, and it'd be nice to see one that wasn't shady. Some I've heard of ask you to simply solve captchas, which in turn will be hacking into people's accounts!
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:58:16
Sorry that was supposed to be a reply to my earlier Coinbase comment.
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:31:01
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:06:21
... and then eat it when Bitcoin doesn't reach $500,000
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:18:34
Fair enough. Pretty sure when I did it I just photographed my passport and it was done in a few minutes, but that was some time ago.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:55:05
Then why the hell do they want us to pay tax on them?
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:12:51
Why is Coinbase Pro no longer getting suggested lately? It supports bank transfers in GBP now too, and you can trade and witgdraw with no fees.
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:08:20
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:50:04
I guess if you're feeling creative you could write your own :-)
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:18:54
If you're playing by the rules, (depending what country you're operating in) you may be subject to tax every time you do this. Not to mention purchase fees from the exchange and network fees if you move to a wallet.
Bottom line is this may work for massive amounts but for $20 just hold and try to buy the dips.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:58:18
Correct me if I'm wrong but Coinbase pro now supports bank transfers in the UK directly. You can cut Revolut out the mix.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:14:41
The first rule is you don't talk about it.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:51:39
You'll die from dissentary
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:18:20
Eggs, basket, etc
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:44:56
I bought 5 from the official site, and since there's such a big lead time I sold four on eBay when they eventually arrived (which was sooner than they stated).
After postage costs and fees, I basically got mine for free.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:31:48
It sounded scammy at "a Facebooker".
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:20:59
Approximately twice as easy.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:45:05
No-one can guarantee anything in this market. I'd steer clear personally.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:32:59
If you're worried about ethics just ask yourself what would Jesus do? He liked wine right?
It's the perfect "pump and drunk" scheme!
Best of luck.

Exodus is pretty good. It doesn't have every coin but it has a variety. I use a Ledger for my main ones (Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ether) but Exodus for some of the alts.
Inevitably you end up with a few that don't fit. I use Metamask and a Neo wallet too, but generally try to keep things organised.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:23:01
I managed to convince my wife - she even suggested putting in more - it was easy!
So tell me, does your wife drink wine?
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:16:03
I wouldn't ... it's pretty secure but nothing is 100%. If you must store it at least split it across a couple of platforms (so both would be to be hacked) or encrypt it first with PGP and memorise the password for that etc.
You can't be too careful - it's real money after all.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:40:50
I did say approximately :-)
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:25:55
It's pretty difficult. I think (don't quote me on this) there are about 2,000 words to choose from. So if your seed phrase is 24 words and you split in half you'd still have a hell of a task on your hands guessing it.
If you're super paranoid you could choose a book and just write down the page/word numbers with those words to make it harder.

Make sure you put a little aside for him, so he can afford to have his name changed when he's older.

Pull my finger ...
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:22:11
I got in last year, and the bulk of my investment was put in around $2k, lower than now, but I also put in more along the way. Nowhere near as high as 20, but definitely over 10. 
I'm holding, and I've learned a thing or two along the way. I have a couple of buy orders that are yet to execute - patience is the key.
My overall exposure is tiny compared to some others, and is an amount that if dropped to zero will have no ramifications.
@_date: 2018-12-06 07:15:16
Cheers! It's a nice idea - I'm commenting because I'm keen to see it in action
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:12:09
Probably nobody prepared to admit to it, but I guess somebody must have.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:14:09
I watched "The Big Short" last night - it's an eye opener.
