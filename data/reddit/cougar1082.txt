I'm glad I could help!

Nope, because difficulty will adjust and you'll still have a new block every ten minutes.

In the 90s, I remember MAC cards being everywhere, especially in the Northeast US.  Now they're gone.  Started researching what happened to them and when I read this I felt like this really does give you some historical perspective of why bitcoin is needed:
Bankers agree that MAC is quicker, cheaper and safer than the Visa debit-card system that's replacing it. But Visa is far more versatile for the consumer - and more profitable for banks.

Thanks to Pied Piper!

Yeah, next time I'll see if they can switch to something like Coinbase or Bitpay.

A BTC merchant discount similar to what Gyft offers (3%) would be a nice benefit to consumers.

Lots of Philly metro people on Reddit!

I'm not familiar with all these 2.0 projects, but I agree that XCP would not itself be a security.  The assets created by users could potentially be a security, but not XCP itself.

All the hardware is already bought and running.  If the miners aren't happy just collecting fees they'll switch off and difficulty will drop until everything is back in equilibrium.  No need to raise fees.  Fees would only have to rise if there's too much volume, which is a different issue of scalability.

I may need newborn pictures soon...but two hours in the car with a newborn might be just a little too far.  Message me your website though if she has one. :)

Reddit is not a fan of chiropractors!  Some people think it helps, some don't think they get anything from it.  I say to each his own.  I agree it's questionable but if it seems to help you...

Just because mining is unprofitable for some means the most inefficient miners will start switching off.  Difficulty will drop until the mining market balances out.  There's no problem with mining, just the usual squeezing out of old inefficient miners.

It just makes me feel bad for merchants, which have been living in the bank's high-fee, no-choice world for decades now.

Exactly, if we all agreed not to sell for less than $10k, the price is instantly $10k with zero infusion of money.

Right, switch one paper fiat currency for another paper fiat  currency is somewhat easier because a country can declare that we're exchanging these two fiat currencies at this said rate because we say so.
If you wanted instead to adopt bitcoin, it would be.more like reinstituting the gold standard.  In that case the country would have to start accumulating bitcoin first (or gold in the case of the gold standard) and eventually publicly declare that their currency is now backed by bitcoin at a set rate.  If the country accumulates 100,000 bitcoin and have 1,000,000,000 units of currency in circulation, they can state that each unit of their currency is convertible into 0.0001 bitcoin.  After that the country could leave their paper currency in use but it no longer is just another fiat currency as it now has an asset backing it.

Noob here.  Broke even after the fall which is sad considering I had started buying when it was $150.  Too many excited purchases in the $700s.  Almost ready to quit but something keeps telling me not to give up.  I know now that I can't handle watching the price daily as it causes me to sell at exactly the wrong times.  Does it make sense if I take a small amount of cash, split them 50/50 between BTC/LTC and paper wallet them and forget about them for a year?  It seems like paper wallet is the safest thing to do, especially if you plan on not watching them.

They are a bit slow when you actually have trouble.  I just tried sending 4 BTC to an address and it's not showing up as ever going to the blockchain after 5 hours now.  I emailed them after an hour but I think this might take a few days to get to.  In the meantime I have 4 BTC tied up in limbo which I was planning to keep in USD on an exchange... :(
Coinbase, if you're there, please help! :)
Edit:  Fixed!  I take it all back Coinbase! :)

Can I add another newbie question?  I have some bitcoins already but I was wondering if anyone has a good alert service that notifies them of price changes?  I'd like to know about any dips as it could be a good buying opportunity.  Anything out there that sends alerts via email or text?
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:33:01
I think that's my best bet.  I know I have to give up listening to the BTC-E trolls.  They're always yelling this is the end of the world when in reality they probably have buy orders already placed to scoop up any panic sold coins.  As someone above had said, forex trading is all psychology.  :/

Still learning about bitcoins so I'm sure this is a dumb question, but after you buy bitcoins through an exchange, couldn't you use any exchange you wanted to transfer back?  Or are bitcoins purchased at Mt Gox kept in some kind of Mt Gox master wallet?
