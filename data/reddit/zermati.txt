Ce point de vue est très intéressant ! Je me demande si c'est bon pour bitcoin ? 
Une place de marché dynamique et florissante est un des moyens de parvenir à une large adoption de bitcoin auprès du grand public. Plus les gens investiront, plus le prix du btc va augmenter :) Ce qui est bien entendu de mon intérêt en tant qu'adepte de la première heure.

Can I use the coupon without using bitcoin ?

Give it some time and they'll probably slowly consider the superiority of bitcoin over their  centralized funny money provider.
They are mostly uneducated poors and will buy into btc for the low fees and ease of use. 
Did you know there are 168M Nigerians ? If each one of them bought 1/10 of a btc  it could be huge !

Damn thats a whole 0.051btc you got in donations on a 3 months period. Their loss !
