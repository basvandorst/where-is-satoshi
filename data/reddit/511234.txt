Never put all of your savings into something as volatile as bitcoin. Read the sticky thread about not investing recklessly.
If I was you, I'd buy some now with an absolute maximum of ten percent of my savings. Keep the rest liquid and wait. There's no need to expose yourself to unnecessary risk.

This is my first dip and I'll admit that I'm shitting myself. But on the other hand, I am also very tempted to buy more. My problem though, is that I'm a strong believer in not investing more than you can afford to lose. I've already put enough in that I am comfortable with, but I just know that we aren't gonna see prices like this for a long time.

This is the exact problem I had when I first looked into bitcoin in April. I had no idea you could buy as much or as little as you want and I definitely couldn't afford a whole coin so I just assumed I had missed the boat and moved on.
Fast forward to today and to say I regret not reading into it more is a huge understatement.
