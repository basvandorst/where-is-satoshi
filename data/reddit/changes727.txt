Interesting. Is this just an unofficial you’ve created for friends and family?

Wow nice move.

Man I hear you. Mind if I ask what career you were in?

@_date: 2018-01-06 18:05:11
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:32:42
Thanks. And I very much support that. 
My main concern is on boarding fees to second layer solutions. If it’s digital gold, fine. But if it’s a currency, I just don’t see a lot of the world participating as fees continue to rise as more adoption comes. 
I’ve attempted to ask before, but don’t feel settled on it enough: are there going to be avenues onto LN and other second layer solutions that third world countries / “college students” and the like would be willing to participate? Do you foresee Coinbase and other wallet providers having default connections to LN? Keeping the on-boarding fees negligible? If it’s 5-10-20$ to get on LN, I believe most of the world will look elsewhere. Or simply use existing infrastructure. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:57:54
Yeah exactly the same thinking. But I honestly don’t mind BTC staying digital gold that is secure, expensive, and a store of wealth. I think the concern is that people may push the scaling debate to the point where bigger and bigger blocks are needed and more and more controversy exists, and then at the same time lose the secure digital gold. But hopefully some innovation will come out. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:30:47
Thanks. 
To your point 1: I was under the assumption that there is not only one counter party (but many) and thus never needing to leave LN.
Point 2. So does this leave out a lot of the world? Non affluent people all around the world who would not want to / couldn’t pay the fee?
Point 3. So there’s nothing in the pipeline where I can (as a new user) find a wallet that is already connected to LN, and then never leave LN if I don’t want to? For people in non-1st world countries that again don’t want to / couldn’t pay the on-chain fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:48:00
Keep it coming ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:16:45
Even with rising transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:29:00
Thats a big question. I guess that just an unknown. But if 50% or more of the population is using this currency, I have a hard time seeing it. But if anyone can clear that up for me a bit, that’d be great. I’d love to see them under 1$.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:08:51
I’ve seen it. But doesn’t answer the question. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:38:54
Skip the settlement layer?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:19:33
I like it! And I still like BTC more. But I also feel it’s important that the entire globe has access to sound money. As long as Bcash can sustain a certain level of decentralization. And even if it’s not completely decentralized, will the centralized parties have good reason to destroy it? Idk.  Better that people have access to something as fiat continues its decline. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:28:59
Raising the block size just seems so controversial. I do hope that one or both of these things solves it. And part of me is fine with leaving BTC as secure digital gold, but we may have to drop the idea that it will ever scale...
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:08:11
Do you see on chain fees under 1$ in the future even as this space continues to grow exponentially? Just trying to understand the vision, just trying to understand...I’m 60% BTC and no Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:13:03
Is there no evidence that it’s 21 million? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:17:29
Thanks ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:46:37
Thanks! Can anyone double down on this? I just don’t want to be screwed over when tax season comes. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:23:53
I should know more. (And I’m 1:1 BTC:BCH so far more heavily invested in BTC) but can you point me in the right direction of resources for why Bcash is such a scam? I understand the potential for the centralization issues, and have watched the Andreas Antonopolous Video twice. Any others?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:02:32
Interesting. Do you have any resources or opinions on the downside to that? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:18:12
But if it costs upwards of 100$ to open and close?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:45:24
Is 2mb even being considered at this point?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:34:58
Exactly in the same boat and why I asked. Still such early days. When 50% or more of the world wants in...what are the fees gonna look like then...and thus the curiosity about opening (from the start) a wallet that is already connected to LN? But sounds like that’s not possible... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:58:58
I don’t believe it was because of the 2mb though. More the attempted hostile takeover..
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:29:00
Feel like that would be the best case scenario. On chain transactions just become very rare
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:19:21
LTC almost certainly has a better chance at cheaper fees to get on LN than BTC if I’m not missing something. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:43:33
That potentially makes the fees acceptable to exponentially more people. And like I said, if it’s not insecure, then why would anyone use BTC in commerce?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:44:11
Is the website a scam? Or the currency? From what I can tell, Bcash is simply what Bitcoin was before segwit, just a bigger blocksize. With capacity for more transactions at least at this time. Which as long as it has some sense of decentralization, I don’t know what the issue is? Can you shed light on this? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:49:19
Yes I do hope something comes around to solve it. Would love to see BTC being used by all, but don’t mind if it stays as digital gold. The community will have to figure out what it wants to do though. Right now it seems to me like either digital gold and a payment network for the first world (elite), or something along the lines of raising the blocksize or some other solution to onboard the entire world with low fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:43:04
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:49:16
True. Not quite on gdax tho. Havin a hard time with this 19k sell wall. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:27:36
Question I’m most curious about at that point...are BTC scaling solutions dead? Given 1mb block and segwit
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:24:51
But let’s say that it was 100$ to open and 100$ to close...would people be willing to pay that? I feel like they may find alternatives...
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:42:17
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:31:17
Agree. Don’t see most of the world any time soon leaving custodial accounts. And why I think LN coming to Coinbase and the such could be massive. Maybe some day. But thanks again for your opinion! Wonder if we can get on boarding fees under 1$ with mass adoption..and 1mb. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:26:24
20k next! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:43:50
Thanks! Need to learn about Rootstock more. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:49:37
But again, is the average Joe going to pay 50$ (Maybe more) to open a channel so that they can transact? And certainly many places in the world will not be interested. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:06:36
Definitely a small blocker, but that tells me that BCash wins the transaction volume. BTC simply being digital gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:52:15
You can go to bitinfocharts.com to see that we’re just over 24$ a transaction. And that’s with less than 1% of people using BTC? Probably far, far less actually transacting. I do expect LN to decongest the network in that way, but you add 50-80-100% of the population of the world on top, and are we back at the same problem? That would be my guess, but it’s something to ponder. Many people in the world can’t afford 20$ to transact onto LN and then 20$ more to get their money off. And thus why I am pondering if BTC will simply be digital gold. Which I am fine with. But is it just for the first world elites of the world that can afford it? The other idea that has popped in my head just today is that maybe BTC never leaves the LN and thus never has to inquire those on chain transaction fees. People simply can acquire LN enabled BTC that is already off chain. Is this realistic? Would it threaten the network if the average Joe never left Lightning Network? I would certainly find that to be an imagined solution. But don’t know the plausibility of that and what the ramifications would be. And a *discussion* about fees is healthy for the community in my opinion. Especially new people who are like “wtf so expensive” and become discouraged by it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:27
Need to learn more about BTG. But as someone who’s spent a year in India, most of them ain’t about to pay the Bitcoin fees. And the other Bitcoin could play a useful currency for them. Which I could see as a good thing. Better than their national currency at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:17:03
What I’m trying to consider is if some other currency will be used primarily as commerce (LTC, Bcash, etc.) and BTC will simply stay secure, expensive, and as a store of wealth. Both of which are fine with me. But thinking about it more, I’m having a hard time of believing in the dream that it could ever be used by the masses. Which I’m fine with. I don’t mind digital gold in that way. Just don’t know if I believe in LN working on BTC for most. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:25
Any evidence that they made a whole bunch of fake BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:39
C’mon man I’ve been around the space for a couple years. I know about Segwit. And Segwit is not a blocksize increase, just the ability to fit more transaction data into the block that is 1mb. And 2mb would solve some immediate issues now that wouldn’t rely on wallets providers implementing anything. And again back to the question, why not now if it’s inevitable? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:04:17
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:23:17
Doesn’t the atomic swap require an on chain fee? And again, most people beyond the elite will not be interested in paying that. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:49:43
Totally agree with the 20 nodes being centralized. There would have to be more than that to keep it decentralized. With technological improvements, many more may be able to participate.  
But I think it is no guarantee that on-chain fees will come down to a reasonable level after you add half the population of the world. Even with LN. 
Both being BTC and BCH. Cheaper on chain fees for those who can’t or won’t pay the higher BTC fees, and BTC for the rest. 
There are many things to be seen. But I think both may play a vital role in removing much of the world away from central government fiat systems. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:10:41
Thanks. And already have. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:11:38
Why would they go down? More adoption, more transactions, rising fees...
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:22:28
Why wouldn’t the masses just use their credit card and let BTC be digital gold. Which is fine with me, but not the scaling dream. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:04:41
I don’t think it’s popular opinion? Would you say we need to get the fees under a 1$ at some point? And as the space grows, is that going to be possible?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:26:00
I don’t see even the middle class (very small portion of the world population) wanting to pay significantly high fees just to “free” their coins. I do like the idea of BTC being digital gold, but do I need to drop the idea that it will scale for the masses? It’s looking more and more like yes. But I’m open to new ideas. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:23:48
What about people in third world countries who can’t afford on chain transactions? Is there room for both? And is it still centralized if there are 20 nodes in 15 different countries? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:45:19
Will 2mb destroy the decentralized dream? (While 2mb makes LN onboard fee more accessible) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:05:11
Would you hold off paying taxes on those given that it is not clear?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:22:13
Idk, even with the small amount of users transacting now, you don’t see the 20$ fee continuing to raise substantially? Only thing I know of is Segwit. But if BTC becomes mainstream, I don’t see that being enough to unclog the system. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:45:52
Interesting. I’d be amazed if this is true. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:09:22
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:15:14
I’m more talking about fees to get onto and off of LN...seems like it could potentially be a steep price just to transact
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:32:15
Why not now then? Seems appropriate. 2mb? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:32:16
My question would be why do they need to be saved properly? Are they not safe on LN network?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:34:49
Interesting. Sounds like it could be a bumpy road till LN comes into play. Don’t like seeing Steam, Bitpay etc. moving to other coins. But I’m sure the tide will shift. Would like to see under 1$ to onboard into LN though. Idk know if that possible without a bit of on-chain scaling. Am happy to be disproven though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:23
Do you have any evidence that core won’t keep the current block size forever? Other than just a hunch. And I’m fine with 1mb, it may just weed out users. 
Even if BCH was more centralized than most people wanted, wouldn’t it be far more valuable than current fiat? With 21 million max supply, i.e. no government quantitative easing. A much better sound money than the fiat system from what I understand. 
Just generally think there is room for both. For different demographics and purposes. And for experimenting with different approaches. 
And by the way, how do you quote like that? ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:37:01
Which scales better than BTC. The question is: is it insecure? If not, I’ll take the cheaper fees.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:59:51
I understand the 1mb reason. But it’s still early days and 20$ on chain fees already doesn’t look promising. If we go from 1% of population to 50% or more of the population (even with segwit fully implemented) you don’t see this as an issue?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:54:09
Now that’s something I would like to learn more about if true. Is this what I’m missing?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:12:46
Fees are already 20$. And as time goes on I only see higher and higher fees coming
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:30:07
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:30:09
Bitcoin the money of Kings, Bitcoin Cash the money of princes, and fiat, the money of slaves. What about that? :) 
Any reason why Core doesn’t do 2mb now if it’s inevitable? 
How can you experiment with on-chain scaling on side-chains? 
And thanks I’ll check it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:42:58
I hear you, in the same boat. But again, why does it “need to be packed into the block and added on the chain to have it on the main chain’s timestamp?”
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:15:10
Is this simply an ad hominem? Does he have full control over the protocol? I understand he has a lot of influence. But until I see anything malicious being done with the code, I don’t see why it’s a scam.  All I see is a different approach that might be useful to certain people in the world. And having both might be good for the ecosystem and the general population. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:32:09
I agree. But those fees are becoming cumbersome...and I can only envision them getting worse at this point with more adoption 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:38:26
It has nothing to do with Lightning Network. I’m talking about the on chain fees to get on and off the LN. Which might imo be far more than most people would want to spend just to have to transact. And thus finding other alternatives...and I don’t think 20$ fees at this early stage of the game is lack of imagination. They certainly haven’t been going down. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:56:41
So will those on-chain fees be offloaded to the wallets / exchange who are also LN hubs / or connected to one? Will we never actually have to pay for those fees as long as we have money in those wallets? It doesn’t seem clear to me. But say someone in a third world country (or even college students, etc.), can they download for example Coinbase (or the equivalent) and never have to worry about on-chain transactions? At least to the extent that they don’t want to.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:38:44
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:26:09
Do you think to a point where almost everyone in third world countries will have access to it? Regarding fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:31:56
It’s another approach, which I think is valuable to much of the world. The parts of the world that don’t make 1st world money and can’t afford fees to get on LN. Is that such a bad thing? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:23:43
Honestly, I unfortunately have not and do not have the skills to check the source code for either. I rely on smarter people than I to trust. Which I understand isn’t the best way to go about it, but have no other option at this immediate time. Can anybody point to anything in the source code that would warrant suspicion? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:37:20
Hmm would like to know if this is true. From what I understand it is not though, even though I think you have that option. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:47:40
Ha man. Not trolling. I really don’t see how given maybe only 1% of the population owns some BTC that adding segwit to all wallets will solve 50% of the population owning and wanting to use BTC in commerce. That’s a lot of people. And not every country is as wealthy as the US or wherever you are that you think this would be acceptable. Even people in the US aren’t going to pay upwards of 50$ to transact imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:38:10
And when it stabilizes in the future?  
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:36:11
So big blocks aren’t inherently bad? I can see both approaches. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:34:56
Let’s hope we can find some consensus. Definitely a small blocker, but 2mb been sounding much better to me lately. Regardless, still wonder if fees will be too high for a lot of people to mess around with LN rather than finding alternatives  
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:19:35
Interesting. Can someone confirm this? 1$ fees going through? And how long does that take? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:21:46
I understand that. More interested in BTC scaling at this point tho. And from what I understand even atomic swap requires an on chain fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:08:56
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:59:03
Any chance you’d want to elaborate? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:49:43
Would agree in the sense that people could start to become too impatient and seek other alternatives. Segwit transaction with Trezor almost 3$ on low fee setting today. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:47:37
Want to be able to access it anywhere in the world, thus the cloud idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:53:51
And once it is? Will it just be wallet providers implementing lightning Network ability?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:53:40
Was it lost or stolen? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:07:21
Thanks for you thoughts.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:40:20
If say someone has no clue what order out of the 6 words were missing, is feasible that it could be figured out?  
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:37:03
Feel like I would doubt myself. Did I accidentally change the order of this or that word? Trust myself with 6 words far more. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:48:29
So just wallet providers at this point? Something like Zap Wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:46:28
So all it needs is wallet providers? Not even a soft fork?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:42:36
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:07:31
Should have added the scale, but it is using log scale. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:58:06
Thanks for the reply! So those against segwit2x are thus hoping for some new technology to come along to scale so that block size can stay at 1mb? Any opinion on what point block sizes become too big and therefore diminish security and decentralization? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:54:39
So what’s the benefit of having one more node in terms of fighting off BTC1? Other than helping to secure the bitcoin protocol a bit more.. from my understanding it’s not about securing the network that is the threat (as many nodes already exist), but rather mining hashing power moving over and the bitcoin name being up for grabs..? How would running a node mitigate these threats?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:44:34
So when the 50 day closes below the 200, that’s usually a sign of a downtrend and when the 50 day closes above the 200 day, that usually a sign of an uptrend? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:21:28
What measurement would you be waiting for?
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:52:46
Interested in running a node, but how does it help fight off  Isn’t it mainly mining hashpower that is concerned? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:29:47
Sarcasm...? Want to expand on that?
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:20:08
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:59:13
How does running a node fight against the specific threats of BTC1? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:22:56
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:29:17
Thanks. Who do you follow to find that information?
