I'd say wait a short while, I bought in first time almost 2 hours ago and it's dropping pretty fast according to gdax, my exchange is holding a bit better though. Exciting times ahead!

I put $500 in via Bpay, took 3 days to land in CoinJar.

I am, I should've been in bed an hour ago but ahhhh.. what to do!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:15
How about within seconds!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:02:41
I'm Australian too, just put a small amount of money in Coinjar for the first time!

It's early hours in the morning here, and I can't sleep knowing it's bouncing up and down like crazy!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:28
It's been hovering around $11,700 USD for past 15 minutes..
edit: I spoke to soon

What exchange do you use? I've noticed the Australian exchanges don't react at the same time as gdax.

Everyone needs to stop saying it's going to crash, it wont!

Congratulations, I too just got into bitcoin today by giving a friend $1,000 towards an asic miner. Lets just hope it pay out well! ;)

I saw the show on Today Tonight, I do hope it becomes more widespread, especially in Australia. I have not invested anything into bitcoin due mainly to this very reason!
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:48:00
It honestly feels like that spike happened two months ago.. :/

I honestly hadn't even heard of Bitcoin until today, been doing as much research as I can. I'm interested in it but still a little skeptical.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:18:47
That's exactly right, I think total mined coins is at 12mil at the moment, so we are half way there if I'm correct. Now hypothetically speaking if every person in the world used bitcoin 7billion people, then just imagine how much value a single coin is worth.. it's astonishing!

This is a very nifty piece of gadgetry. My Geforce 8800gts does nothing when it comes to mining, would actually appreciate it if I could make even a fraction without consuming more money in electricity!

Looking forward to this device when it comes out. Hopefully it'll be my entry into bitcoin!

I've been following Bitcoin for most of the year, I watched it raise to $250 before it crashed, then raised again to over $1,000. All that time I never invested anything into Bitcoin, mainly due to the fact it was almost impossible to do in Australia as we didn't have our own exchange at the time. I can tell myself I could have made thousands if I just invested earlier, and it might bring you down, but at the end of the day you still have what you physically have! :)

I would love to see an out sider take the seized BTC right from under the fbi's noses, using a backup wallet. Would make BTC history!
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:55:18
I heard about Bitcoin for the first time yesterday, thinking about buying in a few. No way I could mine it! :/
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:05:23
With the current growth of Bitcoin, he will end up accepting it sooner or later anyway!

Bitcoinwisdom?.. best site I have seen so far for live data, will be using it from now on! :)
