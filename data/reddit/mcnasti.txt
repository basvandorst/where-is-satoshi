Every time a celeb or rich person endorses an investment it is because they put money in it and abuse their position. If you believe one word coming out of his mouth is not because of self-interest you are fooling yourself.

Personally I don't believe that there will ever be a fiat replacement.

True but gold doesn't break when submerged into water for example or doesn't corrupt after 10 years.
Both have their use cases.

If one can become president using that principle another one can be the crypto king.

The funniest thing about tbbt is how defensive of nerd culture red gers when talking about it.

No it's really not. The other day I handled three 500g bars of 999 gold and honestly that is just easily put in a couple pockets. Remember that's worth about 45k € atm and the gold makes it so much easier to transport.

Can someone dumb this down for my not native english speaking ass? I have trouble understanding the financial language and the implications this has on Americans and Europeans (like me)

That entirely depends on the way you look at bitcoin. Many people have good enough reasons to not see it (but some of its competitors) as a viable day to day currency.

But can you really blame people to fall for that? I mean, I have a relatively small sum invested and in the last couple weeks my portfolio made roughly 5% a day. That is impossible to maintain, I would be able to retire in ~120 days comfortably, but people just see how the market just absolutely crushes everything else and they want part of it while not being educate the slightest.

Man arab money in this economy would be quite something.

Sure, these are all viable options. And I am definitely not arguing for gold being being a better mode of transportation than crypto. All im saying is, that both have their use cases. Especially since we have to remember that most things crypto related are not apple style plug and play and it needs a certain lev logo of technical interest to get into it. Personally, I don't see my fiancee or my mum using crypto over Gold (or even fiat for that matter), my dad maybe, but I'm also not very confident there.

I would rather have you explain to me what you are talking about instead of asking me a passive agressive rethorical question to be honest.
