This is why I posted in the first place, to let the community know about the potential issue and raise an alarm signal

Yes, I have discussed with a guy from support...in the last mail he admitted there's nothing he can do and I should contact a wallet recovery service to brute force my password.

Hello Mason and thanks for stopping by. I am not going to contradict you on how BitGo works,what you've wrote is probably the case.
What amazed me was that since the first time I used BitGo I have always used my login password to unlock the withdrawals, thing which I was unable to do this time.
No FUD intended on my side, I just want to make my problem public and maybe inspire your team to put more warning signs in the client so that users like me won't fall in the pitfalls of multi-signature wallets next time.

good story bro, too bad the ATM didn't work...hopefully as bitcoin and crypto currencies gain more traction we'll have better Deposit/Withdraw ATMs

I was speaking from an ordinary John perspective who isn't so accustomed with all the services built around bitcoin, but wants to buy 100$ worth of bitcoins and drink them in one night in his preferred bar which started accepting the digital coins , just because it's cool :) (It really is, isn't it? :)

Although I agree that "no centralized exchanges" is the road to go forward, adoption will not happen over night and a lot of ordinary people are reluctant to wire money and then 3-5 days later to trade fiat for bitcoin from a site, sometimes using a messy and hard to use interface, just because 3rd party non-bank firms are not trustworthy in the eyes of many.
This is why I think a win-win scenario, at least in short-term( 3-5 years) is to see banks providing their willing clients with On-line home-banking packages where they can easy purchase BTC at market price+0.x% commission,hopefully small enough to make it worthwhile to buy BTC.

I see no problem in doing that as long as it's small enough to compensate for the wire transfer fees and off-shore exchange commission.All current exchanges incur a fee for converting your fiat to bitcoin on top of the wire transfers fees.
Doing the exchange operation directly in my bank account saves time ,not having to wait 3-5 days for my funds to arrive and money because I pay no more wire fees. Also at the moment I trust my bank more than I trust an off-shore bitcoin exchange.
