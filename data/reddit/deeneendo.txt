please explain how 399$ are justified for something that a programmer with RasPI with a USB-miner stick can do just as well? 
Especially after the imminent halving?

I bet you reached ROI the same way as me though: selling my cheaply bought primes to new customers, and paying GAW 5% (plus the buyer 5%) for the pleasure of swapping names in a database...

if he's coming, me and my six little friends that can all run faster than him will be there too!

very bad idea. if the people receiving it is not btc savvy, it will end up in the trash and those btc will never move anywhere again
@_date: 2019-03-24 21:07:22
that argument doesn't stick, since how do you know if a coin is lost or not? just because they don't move doesn't mean that the private key to is lost or still known to someone.

I can't laugh at MtGox jokes.

anyone with a calculator should have stayed away from their "lifetime" investment offers, aka scams.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:04:48
you sold without dear need? before it went to 100k? sounds like 2021 is going to be your year of regret.

are you sure you didn't help her pay some ransomware for a locked up computer?
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:43:16
better late than never. Target for 2021: 100.000$
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:29:09
so, where exactly do you live and do you have children/parents/siblings/partners that you are especially fond of?  
seriously, look up 5$-wrench-attack, and then you may want to stop bragging. fuck knows where BTC is headed to in 10 years time.
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:32:07
if you don't write these things down in a safe location, I am sorry to say, you are beyond help.

his mum did not give him enough attention when he was a child.

get yer dirty shoes off that car!
@_date: 2019-04-17 07:59:05
Bitcoin Cash should be next!

I am the true FIST OF THE NORTH STAR!!!  
oops, wrong thread
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:23:30
he can't really shit on the plate he wants to eat from, but all of us should take a mental note and shun this guy from now on.
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:18:43
borderline? more like full-blown! also, pretending to be Satoshi, when not being able to prove it, I mean... come on.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:09:51
be glad you found out about how much they value your being a customer and look for a bank that is not heavily invested in financing wars all over the planet.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:11:56
that sucks hard... sorry for that, I hope you will find a solution.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:44:34
how do you live with the shame? 
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:21:51
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:20:31
are you sure? as in, REALLY sure?
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:19:35
I recommend not bragging about this. When Bitcoin goes 6 figures (lol, or more), it will become a viable business model to find people like you and use force or other means to extract your private keys from you.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:02:38
that's a good way to get all your teeth and fingers broken.
