I know this. But all of the block chain viewers that I have found do not find the transaction when I search by address. There is a transaction Excelerator that viaBTC offers but it requires a transaction ID. So really what I am looking for is the transaction ID from my Coinbase wallet. Unfortunately I can't find it while the transaction is pending. It kind of sucks for me because I used  bitPay to purchase something and the 15 minute timer expired before it got confirmed. This is the first time I've tried to spend bitcoin and I'm not too happy. And I need the transaction ID to submit a claim with bitPay  to try to get my money back. Ugh.

Is there anyway to cancel a pending transaction on Coinbase? If it's not on the mempool yet then I would think I could cancel it. I'll have to contact coinbase  and see.

Yes, but I don't have the tx id. I transferred from Coinbase, and it just says "pending" and I can't figure out how to get the tx id!

1000 satoshis is only 10 cents.

The point is that Layer 2, not being in the current state that is Bitcoin, can be used as currency, fast, and virtually free. Yet it REQUIRES Bitcoin as the underlying value. Kind of like money having real vale only if it is backed by gold. Unlike alt coins that are just lame attempts at an improved copy of bitcoin.

Lighting Nework is the so called "layer 2", (or at least one possible implementation). There are many supremely important key features that are implemented in a layer two, which not only support Bitcoin, but upholds its key vision and value that was originally conceived of by Satoshi. 1) Layer 2 is not a fork of Bitcoin, it is not a copy of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is still it's own thing. Bitcoin is not superseded by, nor replaced by, the Lightning Network. LN is backward compatible, as they say, though it is not a change to the Bitcoin core in any way. It stands on the back of Bitcoin - i.e. layer 2 riding on layer 1. Users who don't want to use and partake of the LN are free do to so or not. LN is not required in order to continue using, evolving, and improving, Bitcoin. Bitcoin can continue to exist and thrive on its own intended path (a path with no current conceivable end, by the way). Lightning Network is designed to follow Bitcoin, in order to retain value. And it can continue to adapt to the Bitcoin ecosystem including miners, users, corporations, and the core developers that make Bitcoin possible. Again, be clear that all Bitcoin users and stakeholders - those who are invested in the long term vision and value of Bitcoin - can still continue to support and maintain the Bitcoin core infrastructure and ecosystem. Nothing has changed. RATHER, the LN builds TONS of incredible features that make it possible for Bitcoin to propagate through into our day to day lives, becoming indispensably and necessarily used for the prosperity of our world civilization. The specific enhancements are developed by the community, for the community, led by the visionaries of Bitcoin who are driven by Bitcoin's value as the worlds real and true money.

I shouldn't say lame. Many of them are inspired, and valuable in their own right. But they do not have the necessary value and reputation of Bitcoin required to retain decentralization, a monetary system not reliant on trust, and all the other benefits of Satoshi's Bitcoin. Furthermore, Lightning Network works with and retains value for all legitimate alt coins, in their own right.

I had the same issue just now. I logged out of gdax and logged back in and the withdraw succeeded.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:30:36
Furthermore, what if I sell BTC on gdax when it rises up to $10,000 prior to the Segwit2X fork, and then buy it back again when it drops to $2000 after the fork? Will I likewise lose any claim to the BitcoinGold, or will gdax go back to my BTC balance at the time of the BitcoinGold fork and credit me with that amount of BitcoinGold? Yikes, very confusing!

There is no process for reinstating playlists that have been deleted. Since it caused no "strikes", there is no way to appeal. This is a problem others have reported for a variety of reasons, not necessarily specific to Bitcoin.
The only reason I can think of that it was deleted was due to the name and content (Bitcoin). The videos were just a collection of public youtube videos that I wanted to keep for myself to review later. I can't recall if it was a private or public playlist, but according to other users they've had private playlists deleted too for a variety of reasons.
The only reason I can imagine is that the topic "Bitcoin" is considered to violate guidelines of youtube specifically the guidelines against "Spam, misleading metadata, and scams".
