Tell one of the owners you want to place on-going catering orders once a week for a year worth $400 dollars a pop. No resto owner will say no to this, then ask him if he accepts bitcoin. If they say no/reject you then ask him where else I can take my business.
Side note - I used to work selling online food delivery to restaurant owners in Canada for A Just-Eat Subsidiary. Just make sure you get the owner on the phone, not a manager.
As far as actually placing the orders? Well just get him set-up and then stop after the first lmao.

@_date: 2018-11-01 15:22:17
exactly, what they'll do is start trading derivates for clients while simultaneously buying bitcoin, drive the fomo like we saw in dec 17 and then dump the shit on everyone while shorting, so they sell high and profit low.

Yes, but not for your alt coins, New money will build their own coins secretly with no chance for the public to join. Because they will have the support of Wall-Street, VC funds and their friends in the govenment, they'll all get rich and scoff at the alt coins from 2017-2018. 
Why the fuck would a top tier investor pay retail for an altcoin when he sink his money into VC's that have closed ICOS that will 6000x from their investment.

@_date: 2018-02-09 21:13:59
You don't get it. They're going to give exclusive access to ICO's now, just like they do with IPO's. "Regulation" will allow 95% of the population to be denied to "make sure of no illegal bullshit or some other red haring reason". Think to buy Uber or Facebook on IPO price, they were so overvalued the massive gain potential is already over.

 is right, regulation is going to allow bankers to suppress bitcoin not liberate it from an-laundering and all the reasons the media tells you they need regulation. CME futures market and more futures options will only hurt in the medium to short term.
Regulation is not good for the average person. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:31:42
If anything this tells us that bitcoin will not be the crypto of the future, it’s unknown  which will
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:07:41
Are you aware of any market manipulation currently happening in relation to CME futures? Is big money trying to suppress bitcoin or drive it down to buy at a discount?
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:40:46
This will further the market manipulation that has been suspected by the original futures that opened at CME in December. Banking combines cannot regulate bitcoin so they will try and control it via derivates markets.
They’re either going to fud it until it’s so damn cheap everyone sells and then pump or try and kill it off slowly

Ya like 75% of my bag recently got into btc though. Heard a good rule of thumb to keep your  % in bitcoin equal to its market dominance.
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:11:26
“Ari Paul, a cryptocurrency fund manager at BlockTower Capital, has indicated that he bought the options while simultaneously selling some of his fund’s Bitcoin holdings”
This is exact reason why the price will never go parabolic again, with the “institutional” money being involved in bitcoin they will create parameters on the price that allow for money to be made on both ends, selling and driving the price down to contract expiration dates.
This is also going to get worse with nasdaq because they are “cash settled” derivates simile to the cme futures.
Don’t believe me look at uranium charts, futures opened in 2007.
