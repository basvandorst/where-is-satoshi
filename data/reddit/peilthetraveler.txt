Yes, there are a lot of Ghanan and Nigerian princes that need to convert their cash to bitcoin.  For every 10 bitcoins you send them, they will send back $50,000 in a certified money order.  Now...as soon as you get that money order, you need to cash it, then send 100 bitcoins and they will send you $500,000 in money orders!   But you better hurry because they only have $23,900,000 USD they need to convert!!

Actually, difficultly of gold mining does increase.  In California during the gold rush, all the gold was easy to get and an average gold miner could pan 1/2 oz per day.  A guy with a sluice could get 10 oz per day.  No way that an average guy could do that today.  Now we have to use huge machines that process 100s of yards of dirt per hour to get the same thing.  It's a lot like bitcoin.  In the beginning, you needed no fancy equipment just a $2 gold pan, but now, you have to spend at least $100k to make it worthwhile to mine for gold.

Think of this way...Imagine you want to build a house.  You get a contractor and you sign a contract that states everything you expect him to do.  If he doesnt do it, you get to sue him and take his shit for not holding up his end of the bargain.  If you didn't sign a contract with him...well, he gets to walk away and you are left with a huge financial burden and no house.
Same with marriage.  You sign a contract that you are going to spend your life with this person.  If it gets broken, you lose half your shit.   
If you don't have a contract...well one person gets to walk away unharmed and the other is stuck with a huge financial burden and no spouse.
Contracts are security.  They help keep honest people honest by making them keep their word.

Links to btcsmart.net  Its a ponzi site.  You give them 1 bitcoin and they "promise" to give you back 80% return (in bitcoin) in 60 days.  You do a small amount like 50 cents or so and they will pay you in 60 days, just so you put all that and more into the next round.  They say they are traders, but if they really made 80% returns in 2 months, do you really think they would need to get scrubs to send them bitcoin to trade with?

I think it has something to do with the mozilla firefox browswer.  I run a virus scan every night with malwarebytes (that i purchased with bitcoin!) and malwarebytes is always quarantining things in the mozilla folder. When I used to use mozilia, my yahoo mail accounts were always getting hacked(spam being sent from my email to people in my contacts) and no matter how many times I changed my password, in a day or two, it was still happening.  Im convinced mozila is the browser for hackers.

No idea what exchange that is.  I can only think of two ways to figure it out.  Email every exchange and ask them if its one of their hot wallets, or deposit a few satoshis at every exchange and when they move your funds into a hot wallet, hope that it moved into the same hotwallet the hackers funds went to (it might not because i think exchanges have a few hot wallets.)

I think what he is saying is when you open a new account at the bank, there are forms to fill out, ID to show, then you deposit your check and you don't have access to that money for about a week, ect yet people still put their money in banks.  
Same with stock.  You dont just deposit $50 and buy a stock...you have to open an account, the money has to clear and if you are lucky, you will be trading in 2 days.
If you want bitcoin the fast way, there is always someone willing to sell it to you today...for inflated prices.   But thats the same with gold &amp; silver.  If you want to buy those now, you go to the local coin shop and pay $7 or $8 over spot for silver and $80 over spot for gold.  If you want the cheap prices (.79 cents over spot for silver or $20 over spot for gold), you buy online and have to wait 2 weeks to get it.

FYI, the places that "store information" or require you to give them information are where you will get the bitcoins cheapest.  If you don't want anyone to get any info from you, expect to pay 20% more for bitcoins.   Even with the bitcoin atms, you are still paying about 7% over spot.

So assuming this is true and the article says it's about 5% of the bitcoin mining network, that means this facility is generating $2.7 million per month minus $1m in electricity for a profit of $1.7m per month. Because it's china I'm going to assume this ware house was much cheaper to build than in the US and go with $10 per sq ft for about $320,000 to build.  Based on the previous calculations, we can deduce that this facility is running 4.42 pentahashes per second.  Now assuming they bought in bulk so they get a huge discount on machinery, lets say they got their equipment for $1k per T/H.  So they probably paid $4.42m for the equipment.  
Total cost to start this farm?   $5.72 million dollars to generate $1.7 million per month in profit.  That would be all fine &amp; dandy if difficulty didn't go up. 
Maybe someone more familiar with how fast difficulty goes up and tell us all when these guys break even...or should i say IF they break even.  (assuming price stablity of course because if they are just mining to hold coins, they should've bought them straight out)

So what you are saying is that the credit card company should eat the loss and let the small business directly profit off fraud?  How bad would credit card fraud be then?  And lets be honest about credit card security...its pretty much non-existent in most businesses today.  I mean, I use my credit card a lot...maybe close to 1,000 times per year.  I've been ID'd maybe 5 times at the most and of those 5 times, they have NEVER checked my signature to see if it matches.  NEVER!  
Not checking ID and making sure the signatures match, is part of the security the business is supposed to do.  20 years ago, they used to check it. When I was young, a business once told me that my signatures didn't look the same because I wrote it so sloppy.  They made me rewrite it like my drivers license signature before they would let me have the goods.   No business does this anymore.

I'm going to try to look at the bright side and say "This is actually good news" and then go on to say something about how those bitcoins were getting converted directly to fiat anyway and now there will be less selling pressure which means higher bitcoin prices.

Will probably measure it in silver.   For instance...in 1964 you could buy a gallon of gas for 25 cents.   1964 was also the last year we put silver in our quarters.   Today, 50 years later, the value of the silver in a 1964 quarter would still buy you a gallon of gas.   It's pretty close with all commodities.  Whatever price something cost in silver 50 or 100 years ago, is pretty much the same price today give or take a few percentage points (due to supply &amp; demand).

Price of bitcoin has dropped exactly 23% in the last 6 months.  Are you really trying to tell me the value of the dollar has dropped less than 23% in 30 years?  FYI 30 years ago a candy bar was 25 cents, a gallon of gas $1.21, average home price was $97k and a stamp cost 20 cents.  Also silver was $7 30 years ago and gold was $360.

@_date: 2014-09-17 15:07:04
I'm sure you are aware, that if you become one of these businesses that just take cash, you end up losing customers which costs you more than the chargebacks you get with credit cards.  For instance...I specifically avoid restaurants that have a "cash or debit only" sign on the window.  My impression is that if a business is too cheap to pay a few percent in fees to get more customers, they surely are using the cheapest low quality ingredients in their food to save a few bucks also.   That and the fact I like using my credit card so its easier to track my expenses every month.
@_date: 2014-10-21 02:18:05
If your goal is to get bitcoin mainstream, why wont you tell us?   
It's either because you are looking to scam us, or you think your "idea" has some potential to make you some money which in case, your goal is NOT to make bitcoin mainstream, just to line your pocket and in that case, whatever you've thought about has already been thought about and done already.

Yeah when I first heard of bitcoin I saw that picture and got confused.  The article talked about how bitcoin is divisible into smaller parts and I'm thinking "are those coins like puzzle pieces or something?  How do you break them apart? Not even going to read the rest of this article cause it's stupid. Bitcoin is obviously some kind of scam.  I'm not shelling out $10 for these things!"   Couple years later I buy my first bitcoin for $734.  :(.  If only they didn't show me that stupid coin, I wouldn't have ignored bitcoin all those times I kept hearing about it. :(

If they don't have the cash to buy higher quality ingredients, it means their recipes suck because nobody is buying enough of their food for them to afford to accept credit cards.

There was a guy in here a few days ago that got something like $11,000 stolen from him and I remember trying to follow the blockchain and this address popped up a few times so it looks like the same guy.   
Bad news is, I have no idea who it belongs to.  Anyways...The exchange he is sending it to is this wallet    it seems.  So basically that 127q3...seems to be the theifs wallet and the 13itfq...wallet seems to be the exchange he is sending it to...in my opinion.

I mocked the guy that sold his bitcoin for dollars.
You then said bitcoin fell more in the last 6 months than the dollar did in the last 30 years.  (This sounds like you are saying the dollar is a better investment)
My reading comprehension skills are fine.  Your communication skills are poor.  For instance...
You said 6 months vs 30 years.   Then you tried to tell me you said 9 months when you didn't, implying you can't read.   Then you tried to tell me it was a "tippo" proving you can't spell(it's typo, by the way).  Then you changed 30 years to 20 years and told me it didn't matter to get the point across.   I then showed you data showing your implication was wrong to which you then tried to cover your ass and talk about bitcoin being a good investment and shitty currency and then just now go on to tell me you never even mentioned investment when you just fucking did by calling it a good investment!
By the way...I don't look through every comment made in a 900 comment thread.  I never saw all your posts because they were replies to someone else, not me.  You would think someone who has been on reddit for a year would understand that. (not to mention the fact your comments were all downvoted)

I'll be honest...I haven't donated to DarkWallet because the guy seems shady.  He is using someone elses property illegally so he is a criminal.   I find it hilarious that he doesnt let himself get treated to a meal, but has no problem treating himself to a million dollar apartment at someone elses cost.  I mean come on...he can't spend a few thousand dollars on an apartment after he raises $50k?   He's a smart guy...he must understand that someone is losing money because of his squatting.  He must understand he is a thief.  
I mean come on guys.  Look at his history.  Expelled from High school for hacking.  Made a living playing professional poker and online gambling.   Calls himself an Anarchist...does this guy sound trustworthy to make a bitcoin wallet?
I have the feeling he is going to make the wallet with a line of code in there somewhere that gives him the ability at any time to dump everyones bitcoins into his own wallet.

Of course you know what the black swan event would be that causes Bitcoin to zoom to $500,000 per coin by the end of 2015?   Complete collapse of the American dollar, zimbabwe style.  So the good news is your bitcoins are worth $500k each.  Bad news is, they have the buying power of maybe half an oz of gold at that time.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:00:05
We held the line at $300 despite bearwhales huge sell wall.  Normally a sell wall goes up like that and people panic and jump ahead of the big order pushing the price down.  $300 is our maximum pain.  Only way we go lower is if another whale eats up the order book.

Actually my sister-in-law had not even heard of bitcoin until I told her a few days ago that I was sending her money in bitcoin.  :)   Of course she lives in the mountains, in a poor farming village that barely even has cell phone reception let alone internet access.  I haven't been to philippines since 2010, so maybe someone who lives in Manila right now can answer this better than me.

The first tip I got was right away.  Maybe 30 seconds after opening the app.  Then its very sporatic.

I have an idea that bitcoins are going to settle at $10-$30.  I think there will be a wave of buying at $90-$150 that will keep us from getting there, but $30 will probably be seen by april.

Yeah, I remember when dogecoin started its fall from 280 satoshis and everyone in that sub was saying that.  1 doge=1 doge.   Its almost like when someone said it, the price went down just a little bit more.
Just like bitcoin is doing now.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:38:48
He said he did it more than once.  I think like 8 times or so.  So really like 80000 BTC he spent on pizza.

He posted this about 10 hours earlier too.

on the back of the ticket is the expiration date.  Usually 180 days it what you have to claim.

Cryptsy is pretty legit in my experience, but they do have issues.  Sometimes it takes days for your bitcoins to show up.  They are pretty slow at customer service and sometimes they will resolve your issue without telling you, or wait a week to tell you they resolved your issue last week.  Its odd, but they've always come through.
They might have locked your account if someone that wasn't you tried to access it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:06:28
So now the poor can invest in Bitcoin.   How's that worked out in every other investment scheme in history?

In my opinion, It seems the payout come faster when there is more bitcoin in the pot.  When I got all those payouts in 1 hour, there was 3 bitcoin in the pot.  When the bitcoin was down to .8 btc, the payouts seemed slower.  Not sure if that's it or not though, but its a possibility.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:34:43

It is different.  How many people were active in bitcoin in 2010 vs today.  When a few hundred people were holding most of the supply, its easy for it to go up.  When you have a few hundred thousand holding the supply, not so easy.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:13:59

How much would you make if you rented that warehouse out vs your bitcoin mining operation though?  And how much you losing on depreciation of your equipment?  160TH...I'm guessing you paid $80k give or take for that?  So you're probably generating 50 coins per month and your profit is $66 per coin (at $218 prices) so thats $3,300 per month. 
Thats a long time to break even on equipment.  Seems to me you need $300 coins to at least not lose money on your equipment.

I want to say that when I read the SEC notes, it was supposed to be something like .2 bitcoins for every share.  Of course, this would mean that because bitcoin is trading at $270 now, the price will likely jump to $54 on the day of trading.
