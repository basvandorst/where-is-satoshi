I think we're past the "risk" point. It'll still be around. You can't kill it. Maybe it's just not the best investment right now. Maybe it is. Who the hell knows?
I'm in your boat. I gambled $100 that it is cheap right now. There are only 21 million of them in the world. Ever. $100 seems like a good bet considering you can't kill it. Anyone who thinks it isn't valuable hasn't used it to make a payment from their smart phone.

"We created and published a universal neutral standard for money. Now lets change it to favor me."

1.5 million 2013 USD per bitcoin. It's based on the eventual realization that the USD is a losing proposition. Nothing like this has ever come along before. The only real threat I see is someone infiltrating the network somehow, and I don't think it's likely enough to worry about.
Governments tend to subvert things they don't like, rather than abolishing them. I don't see that happening with a currency with the ledger in plain view of the whole planet. Any attempt to manipulate the price would ultimately raise it.
I would like to see an option to clean up unused blocks in the future. So nodes that want the full block history can keep it around for historical purposes, but nodes that only want blocks that contain non-emptied transactions are disposed of to save disk space.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:10:39
Lets say Bitcoin goes mainstream and surpasses Visa, and the block chain starts increasing by about 100GB per day. How is an individual supposed to store all that? Literally the biggest disks on earth would be filled in under a month.
We need pruning and we need it before 2016.

It's not weird. If we liked dealing in dollars we probably wouldn't be in to bitcoin.

I think the only way you'd ever find them now is if you could somehow tie a transaction amount or address to a known endpoint, or fix one of their past or future transaction to a known event (e.g. they spent $20 during some BTC-friendly congressional campaign and $20 is one of the donation amounts)
I had some hacker go to great lengths to get mine. Fortunately they failed because of some extra security measures I took, but they started by hacking my reddit password which was entirely guessable (not this account) and getting my real email address, hacking my email, getting my cell carrier info, social engineering the cell carrier to forward my phone, and probably made it past 2fa with control of that stuff. They would have found an empty coinbase wallet (security measure  of many).
Fortunately, Reddit admins are dicks and they shadowbanned that account after 5 years of honest posting. Now I just make up accounts off-the-cuff and use them for a few weeks.

Doing anything will result in some form of centralization. Can you please stop publicly selling the solution as a problem? I'm ok with a certain subset of the population being too inept to "work bitcoin". It's probably for their own good, since they're also easy to steal from the naive.
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:51:07
I agree. I think the best way to look at this positively would be to consider that you still have the freedom to use Bitcoin natively, and since card-likers will be dipping their toe, they'll have plenty of opportunity to "go native" down the road.
Bear in mind, most Bitcoin users aren't running the actual Bitcoin client that Satoshi helped design (the one that forces users to also participate on the network), so it's not like the system is working as designed right now. On the other hand, I don't think it's reasonable to run a full node on my smart phone. At least not yet.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:55:14
I haven't stopped, but I will tell you the conditions under which I would stop:
1. The block size limit is increased (which I actually am in favor of), transactions go up, and I can't keep up with disk usage any more. We'd have to hit a very high number of transactions before this was a problem though. Off the top of my head, a thousand-per-second. I would quit full-noding before we went Visa scale though, and I admit that's a problem for Bitcoin, but not an insurmountable one. Perhaps by then I'd be rich enough to host a giant RAID array. That would still represent more centralization than there is now though.
2. I'm trying to play a FPS on the internet and you guys are causing lag; my full node runs on my home internet connection, which is probably faster than average for the USA. My carrier has done a good job of not complaining so far. I'd fire bitcoind right back up when I was done though.
I doubt either of these are going to happen any time soon, so enjoy.

@_date: 2014-08-20 03:06:13
I would agree, except you're forgetting that dropping blocks could be algorithmically regulated to only happen if the coins have all been verified to reside in another verified block.
I still see value in retaining all blocks as a historical archive, but you wouldn't need it at that point to prove ownership, assuming the block dropping algorithm would be air-tight.

You can call it neckbeard all you want, but I think you're a little disconnected. I think we're right in the middle of a transition to a period where you can actually be mad at your Aunt Betty when she loses her family pictures by not having a backup. That used to be something she'd be reliant on the asperger's kid in the family for. The days of computers being a world for braniacs are over.

3. I understand what you're saying and agree completely.
I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and bitcoind v0.9.2.1-g354c0f3-beta
Is this version out of date?
The server is running other apps and exhibiting absolutely no signs of memory corruption (like I md5sum 4TB of data weekly on the same hardware and not once in over a year have I seen a single bit flip on me)
Hearing that the concensus is that it's me, not bitcoin, is helpful though. I'll see if I can run it on another box and if the result is the same.
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:27:43
You're missing my point. The original spec calls for every client to store the block chain. I don't care how big my drive might be in 2020, I don't want to store the entire block chain on my cell. Unless it hits X size and never increases much. In that case, I'd be delighted to figure out the cost of the cell phone or hard disk that can run Bitcoin. Right now the spec calls for something like:
Pentium 90  
8MB RAM  
infinity MB hard disk

Imagine your parents were on food stamps for a while, or your brother couldn't afford to get his cancer cured.
That's when people generally break away from this philosophy: When they're already in a position where the help of others was *essential* for their life.
World-views are formed early, don't change much in adulthood, and are highly subjective. You'll never get rid of non-libertarian thinking.
On the other hand, without people who desire not to be governed, there wouldn't be much of a society left to give handouts to.
I find that I tend to think like democrats/liberals when there's an abundance (like $1/gallon gas - yes, deep-down I do want to help strangers) and like a republican/conservative when I'm being overtaxed and barely putting food on the table (my family comes before strangers). It's all subjective, even among people who profess one point of view.

I don't think you've fully thought through the implications of creating a bandwagon of hopping to a different, potentially less-than-open-source coin. Once we start that practice, when do we decide to stop coin-jumping? After you cashed out of it and dictated the next one we should all buy?

Respectful of the reasons that are presented for why you did this, but there is no justification for taking someone else's hard work and twisting it like you did. If you didn't employ a sneaky element to your actions, you know for a fact you would be running the only anti-gambling bitcoin node.

I didn't get that the first time. Thanks for clarifying.
There's a small, but significant fraction of the US population (I'm guessing around 8%, based on Ron Paul's share of the popular vote) that feels that dollars are the gamble. And not just in a passive way either. That's plenty of American users to support bitcoin, volatile or not. I'm not even bringing the rest of the world in to the equation yet.

It's value is driven by recruitment of new constituents, just like any currency that a given consumer is born in to the world of.
The difference with Bitcoin is that **we're** not born in to it, and its only bias is toward early adopters (your unborn children don't have the same advantage we do to buy in while it's cheap).
Out of all currencies, it's my personal favorite due to it's permanent status as a level playing field. Regardless, since it's not widely adopted, I find myself tempted to "recruit" people to use it. They might very well have the same knee-jerk reaction I did (and you probably did, then maybe forgot).
The hierarchy is the adoption strata - Satoshi Nakamoto holds a very large number of Bitcoins, initial adopters hold less, but a lot. I'm probably like the 5th strata down, people who tried *shudder* dogecoin are probably 6th, etc.

Maybe you pick 6 people instead of 3 and give each 3rd to two of them, in case one of them dies before you.
I'm sure there are estate lawyers or other services that will mail on death as well, if you're a basement dweller with no friends.

This is an online ledger and the code base is six years old. Confidence in a ledger is paramount for adoption. Frankly, I sweat bullets every time a new version is released.
*Is this the first NSA back-doored release?*
People have this concept that code should be published unfinished and then polished as you go, as if it somehow rusts. At some point (hopefully soon) Bitcoin core should be a finished product that is static for the remainder of its history. I can't think of a bigger risk to user confidence than the accepted practice of changing the rules periodically.
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:27:23
This argument makes me want to puke because I hear it so often.
How is it not obvious to everyone that if a precedent of popular alt-coin jumping was set, that the whole concept of virtual currency would collapse? Do people just not get that money is based on putting faith into something worth putting faith into?
Nevermind that every single altcoin (if you look at a timeline of bitcoin popularity and when they all appeared) is very, very clearly a copycat pyramid scheme that adds nothing to the concept, except hollow gimmicks that could have been achieved with Bitcoin in the first place.

When this thing started, a full node was your only option, so participation was built-in. Probably seemed clever at the time, but obviously smart phones weren't considered as a factor when the original design was put together.

@_date: 2014-11-19 13:26:40
Spending drives the price down. That's one thing I've learned from observation. Every time a large company starts accepting bitcoin, the price drops significantly.
In the long term, it *must* work itself out and you will continue to see a rise in value, but only as people are forced to pay more to enter the market, or confidence in its future goes mainstream. The confidence is the only thing holding the value up, and it is warranted in the case of Bitcoin, specifically because it's difficult to envision a scenario where all users would suddenly decide they were worth $0 in a panic - the only scenario that could really kill it.

Not sure who's downvoting me for having an extremely valid and relevant opinion.
I legitimately feel that building services like this compromises the *decentralized nature that gives BTC value in the first place*. We're always exactly one slippery-slope back to the financial system we have now. I, personally, would lose interest in Bitcoin very quickly if it started down that path . And that's exactly where you're attempting to take it, whether you realize it or not.
I also hope you realize the level of sophistication of the **army** of money-hungry hackers you're about to go up against. I'm not one of them, but I run a full node and they've pulled some very sophisticated attacks against me personally.
If you want to make money on Bitcoin right now, just buy some and sit on it. You don't need to build a service that undermines its integrity.
I'm one of those dollar haters that just wants bitcoin to succeed for my childrens' futures. I'm not in it for anything else. Just to make sure they don't grow up indentured their entire lives.

I had even set up a "forever account" back then, so I could post things and have accountability for my past comments. Five years later I got shadowbanned for posting bot net IP addresses (which are **legally** not personally identifying) and as a result I find myself as guilty as the rest of you of sock-puppeting and posting stuff I probably wouldn't say to your ugly fucking faces. ;)
It'd be nice to have a forum engineered from the ground up for properly assigning credibility to posts. I could probably build it, but I definitely couldn't do it pro-bono. Draper? Musk? Byrne? Anyone want to fund me?

I've been watching the block count and it seems like the network simply creates blocks more frequently if it needs to (e.g. after 8 minutes instead of 10). So block size increase is a non-issue for now.
Another question I have is this: Does Days Destroyed have anything to do with the block count (example: the oldest block can be "forgotten" once all the coins are moved out of it)... Which would mena there's an upper bound on the block count.
I know the miners are processing some ridiculous number of hashes-per-second. Does this make the miner consideration moot for the moment?

I read that Lockheed is going to have Fusion reactors that can generate 100MW on the back of a truck within 10 years. I'll most likely be looking to help poor people when they start rolling those things out. Oil problems will be a thing of the past, and the next industrial revolution will begin exactly then. That's about the time that the extreme "right" will want to take control of all the reactors and create an artificial divide. Most adults are very familiar with the playbooks from both sides. What we seem to suck at is determining which side we should be taking that particular year. Right now, no fusion, limited oil, we need the right more than the left.

They might go for higher than market price if a bidder has a mind set like Tim Draper. He sees Bitcoin as a fishing pole with a worm on it, and a bunch of big fat fish in the pond, with words like Amazon and Ebay written on them.
They might go for lower than market price. The new owner would be the largest holder of Bitcoin, and if it's a new player, they could possibly have a drastic effect on adoption (e.g. CEO of a large tech company buys them).
There may be a big fish that has been waiting for this auction to make an announcement. Maybe Amazon was waiting to win this auction before they announce they're accepting Bitcoin.

We have confidence in the currency of our respective coutries because it was backed by something before it was fiat. Some people see fiat as the rug being pulled out from under the users, and a currency where that can't happen is the next logical iteration of the same concept.
Bitcoin was the first of its kind. All the altcoins, which manifested after Bitcoin became successful, are very clearly trying to simply capitalize on the idea, and most people, whether they realize it or not, have faith that they're never going to be the cryptocurrency of global concensus that Bitcoin can be.
I'm actually curious to see what the *next* iteration is after Bitcoin. I'm wondering if there is one, or if it encompasses the purest possible form of currency. I don't think we'll ever know unless Bitcoin becomes the predominant global currency.

Don't mitigate. I've been working in IT for nineteen years (holy shit I'm old).

Someone hacked my (old) Reddit account and got my personal email. They hacked that, somehow got my cell phone company, tried to forward my texts, and was able to get to the front door of coinbase before I got a text on my (call-forwarded) phone. My balance was empty because that's the thing of value that you shouldn't trust others with.
If I were going to be pissed at anyone aside from myself, it'd be the cell phone company. I want to know how they got socially engineered in to forwarding my phone line. That should never fucking happen.

Although there are enemies out there, you are your own worst enemy when it comes to remembering things long-term. I've seen way more problems caused by too much security than I've ever seen caused by hackers.
That said, hackers are a real threat.
I'd just write a new wallet directly in to a truecrypt volume with a 32+ character password that only you know, which has some randomness to it you can't google for, take note of the public key, send a few transactions to it, then close up shop and deposit to it without ever checking the wallet. When you need money out of it, take more than you need, so you minimize the number of times you interact with it.
Make the truecrypt small and write backups of it everywhere. Hell, email it to people you trust. Nobody should be able to crack it ever, and you might need one of those backups some day.

Sorry - I should clarify my username. I had the same account (tedrick111) for like 5 years, and I got shadowbanned whimsically. I therefore gave up on Reddit integrity (if they don't give a shit, why should I?). Fuckotheclown was the funniest handle I ever encountered in Quake (the old video game) so I adopted it because apparently who I am matters about as much as you'd expect here.
Reddit could have been so much more, but it's just a money grab for investors.

I agree. However, as a concerned citizen, I'd like to know why the US government isn't stepping in to intervene. They've set the precedent that they will bail out a market that's failing in order to avert a recession. Why aren't they bailing us out? Do we need to sue for recognition as a legitimate US market?

So you lost money on Bitcoin. Got it.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:00:15
You send it to the wrong address. So either the checksum catches it, or if it's a large amount of money, you send it as two transactions (a small test and then the rest of the money). If you feel the need to trust a third party, you involve an escrow service and/or use multisig, same as today.
I would expect more from Bill Gates. Moving on...

We already went down that rabbit hole when clients were introduced that didn't run a full node. I think this is a necessary step in Bitcoin growth. There's still value in holding the whole block chain, but now people have another degree they can choose to participate at. Validating transactions mathematically doesn't require the whole chain, and is useful.
In fact, now that I think about it, shrinking the block chain by over 20x is very necessary for another change we've all been waiting for - larger blocks / more transactions-per-second. If it could be said that Bitcoin competes with Visa and the playing field is level...

I read some bad press about Luke Jr. on this sub before, but I doubt he's really a "bad person" and I don't have the inclination to look it up. Comment was half meant as a joke.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:24:04
Mine went through.
@_date: 2015-04-24 13:16:03
Ok I looked up Visa (the credit card company) and found that their network is designed to handle 10k transactions-per-second **peak**. However, in a day, they only do 32 million transactions total, which is an **average** of 371 transactions-per-second.
I think that Visa's peak is an apples-to-oranges comparison though, because Visa must process them as they come in. With Bitcoin, they're stored in shared memory and munched away at as the network can get to them, and they simply show up as "unconfirmed" until it does. So the average speed is a more important metric.
Since the block chain has now been reduced to 1.3GB (almost 30x reduction) at 6 years age, an increase in the maximum block size to 54MB should enable us to exceed Visa's capacity, without burning a terribly significant amount of disk space. I know using the last 6 years is another apples-to-oranges, as the network will get busier, but for reference, it equates to 70GB over 6 years on a pruning node.
I imagine another node software re-factor would entail pruning or compressing the blocks themselves somehow.
At any rate, the future looks bright.
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:54:36
I got the idea from breaking down the trustworthiness of a post objectively. I never mentioned making people pay to comment. I'm in the USA and we hold our first amendment very dearly (at least most of us).
That said, after seeing this subreddit in action, it'd be nice to be able to quickly sift through troll posts.
We'll have to disagree on the degree of echo-chamber this forum is. I don't see a lot of new posts on the front page every day, and most that I do are something new. If you want to discuss the viability of Bitcoin, I think that's already been covered by its continued existence for 6 years. There's an echo we can do without.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:29:34
With dollars, for example, you have very little advance notice about where monetary policy will create the next windfall. With Bitcoin, the playing field is level (so to speak) because you know for a fact exactly where new ones will come from in the future. There's no gaming the system with Bitcoin. I think that's the underlying point that you're missing by getting hung up on whether they are deflationary or inflationary.
Regardless of whether a currency is inflationary or deflationary, there is a market cap, and you only hold a small percent of that. The question you should ask is: "Who controls whether my piece of this market goes up or down in value?"
With dollars, the answer is the federal reserve, who can be heavily influenced by Congress to fund the latest American political BS. With Bitcoin, the answer is a carefully watched, neutral algorithm that isn't going to change.
In a Bitcoin economy, nobody can rob you while that number on your account shows the same.

That's one of the things I'm paranoid about - if you shelf coins that are from before a certain date, is there going to be a point when the community gets sick of preserving the ledger back to that date? I guess I should just move them around every year or so as a precaution, until the whole Bitcoin movement shapes up as a global standard.

You can improve the codebase and still operate on the same block chain. Bitcoin does it all the time.

I didn't confuse anything. The ledger grows and never shrinks. So eventually something *may* have to be done about that. I mean if that puppy ever gets to 60TB, it might take quite a while to validate a transaction with inputs from 2011.

If you look at how things are set up now, it's almost like the government absolutely does not want you to save money. The expectation is that if you don't work for a bank and aren't a company, there's something wrong with you if you are sitting on a decent pile of cash.
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:33:02
This is an easy claim to make, *now*.
You really think they designed this thing *already knowing* that it would take off like it did? Alt coins had the luxury of hindsight, and I'd agree with you 100% on every damn one of them. Bitcoin, OTHT, was and still is demonstrable hard work on the part of numerous constituents, and nothing less.
I wish some of you anti-bitcoin people would reveal your identities so you could be publicly ridiculed later. Your posts are a classic demonstration of "Talk is cheap".

I'm a full node operator. Let's say he pushes this change and I get lazy and leave my node on the non-scaling version. Presumably 4000 of the 7000 or so nodes switches. Is Bitcoin fucked at that point?

@_date: 2015-02-21 15:34:43
1. It's open source. The problems can be fixed. There's a complete record of all transactions, so if you can trace the first exploit, you can make it right.
2. It's open source. Any innovations that another coin offers can be adopted by bitcoin, if they're overwhelmingly important to the "best choice" scenario.
People are so quick to forget the benefits of an open source platform. This is what we make of it, nothing more (or less!)
I think your scenarios are both valid, but there'd have to be some very unrealistic/unfortunate timing in order for another coin to take the spotlight away.

Not to be an asshole, but I wouldn't have posted if I desired to band-aid it in to working condition. My point was to bitch that this subreddit makes constant claims that millions of dollars are being sunk in to Bitcoin development (I realize that's a loaded term) but I can't freaking do a basic sync without a major hassle.
I still believe in Bitcoin's future and I'm going to jump through the hoops to get my node back in working order, but I wanted it on record that the current release of bitcoin-code needs work, and investors should probably divert a few bucks that way.
Incidentally, I'm a programmer ;)

The fundamental nature of the internet is to spread information. Do you really think the ideas of copyright, state secrets, etc. are going to be around much longer?
We're all citizens here, and duplicating bits is not a crime.

Nah, the problem is that the more full nodes that exist, the higher the disk cost for Bitcoin. However, there is absolutely zero incentive to run a full node unless you're holding a lot of Bitcoin and want to give the network value.
If it were like mining, and full node operators got paid, I guarantee the whole disk usage debate would be a distant memory. I run a full node, and at 33GB of storage, it's no big deal. If things scaled up and I wasn't incentivized, I'd very quickly liquidate my BTC and give up on the whole concept.

Having worked in startups in the past, I'm comfortable with the idea of some problems getting fixed in the future. If this problem gets fixed in the future, Bitcoin has a very good chance of getting bigger.
This is **not** an unfixable problem, just an unfixed one, and as I said, right now it's not dinging me hard for disk cost, so it's a future-fixable problem. The minute a regular IT guy like myself can't afford to participate, the concept obviously becomes elitist, which contradicts the very nature of the grassroots movement that started Bitcoin's popularity in the first place.
