This happened to me and I KNOW I was negligent with my API key.
This is a hack on Coinbase's end and the hacker is making thousands as we speak.

It is similar to inputs.io, but you could say the same about coinbase.com, blockchain.info, etc.
Also, we are not off-chain.  Any balance or bitcoin information displayed comes straight from the daemon

To the people whom have registered, we have noticed that the e-mails have taken a few minutes to arrive on sign in.
This is being remedied as quick as possible.

You could say the same about a desktop wallet.
They both have their flaws, whether web-wallets have more is another debate.

Put a freeze on my bank account.  Got a response from Coinbase.
Someone had access to my API key.
Disabled API key.
Scanning computer with Malware Bytes.
I do not think I am infected I do not download Java or EXEs.

Same thing happened to me.
They said it was the API Key.
I disabled it and hit hasn't happened since.
Coinbase reversed the buys on my account.
It wasn't an issue in the end but I've seen multiple instances of this happening and it seems like maybe it could be a discrete hacker.
Meaning a vulnerability in Coinbase that's causing this.
