I believe thousands and growing. Bitcoin is essentially the gold standard of crypto. When it's up, altcoins are up. When it's down, altcoins go down.

It's only been 4 minutes and this post has already aged poorly.

Yeah haha. I know it's pretty much pointless, but gambling a little money on a small market cap is up my alley, and more interesting to me than earning pennies on BTC. Once I'm able to put in more, then I'll be happy HODLing BTC.

Been checking binance constantly all day and of course it pumps and dumps to 7400 while I'm away. Weird.
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:56:27
Honestly it could go either way, but we saw a pretty big pump today, breaking through 6.7k which we haven't reached in a little over a week if I recall correctly. When things like this happen, it could be the beginning of the next rally towards 7k, or it could dip back down a little. Up to you, but know that in the context of the past ~3 weeks, buying right now would technically be considered "buying high".

How bullish is everyone on the end of Q4? Is the winter rally dream still realistic to you?

In 2018, Bitcoin is so much more than a means of transferring money, it's the gold standard of how high confidence in the space is, while still being a working, no frills product. Bitcoin most likely won't be what enables quick P2P microtransactions at coffee shops, or what connects your car to a supply chain blockchain network, or what drug dealers will buy and sell illicit drugs on while remaining completely untraceable; but Bitcoin will be the reason those technologies were given the space to grow.

If I have no USDT and want to DCA a little into some alts, would the least costly way of doing this be buying BTC/ETH from Coinbase, transferring to Coinbase Pro to transfer to Binance for free, then tether up the money I don't put in immediately?
@_date: 2018-09-09 04:49:24
Why do you say that? If you're not putting in more than you can afford to lose and buy dips, not pumps, what exactly can go wrong besides Bitcoin somehow never recovering?
@_date: 2018-09-02 17:43:18
I only have $45 in BTC to get my feet wet. Should I diversify on a couple gambles (Relex, Tefood, etc) or should I just hold it in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:34:30
Is it safe to buy yet?
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:40:20
Can you repeat the question?
@_date: 2018-09-29 04:55:09
I'm a sick fuck I like a quick dump
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:06:33
Want it instantly via debit card which coinbase pro can't offer (only would be putting in $50).
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:29:44
Not necessarily how it works.
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:12:49
Poor guy got a raw deal.
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:59:50
I think it's a good time to be buying most coins that you believe in. Everything took a big hit from the BTC drop yesterday, so most coins are fairly low in comparison to what they were just 48 hours ago. Bitcoin will probably offer lower, more stable returns (relatively speaking), but even at the price it is now, to just double your profits, Bitcoin would have to jump to $12,000 - and if you're doing the right thing by only putting as much money into crypto as you can afford to lose, chances are you won't make an insane amount of profits quickly unless you can afford to put in large sums of money. But altcoins are hit and miss (usually miss in the grand scheme of things), so it's a gamble.
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:12:46
Probably not much different. I don't know much about crypto yet, but what I do know is that mass HODLing isn't going to be what starts the next bull run.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:52:41
That's kind of the risk of alts.
@_date: 2018-09-19 03:49:58
Man loses 10% of his investment in 30 minutes because of bear market! This is why we need fiat. Can't trust speculative investments.
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:39:55
It's good for bitcoin until proven bad, not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:29:52
Honestly doubt it. MAYBE 6 5.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:52:11
At this point I'm enjoying watching my portfolio value go down so I can finally buy a little more once we've hit the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:37:35
And because this is your first post on Reddit
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:03:25
Not exactly made of money right now
@_date: 2018-08-31 05:00:59
Damn, never thought I'd say this after today's dip to 6.8 but we might hit 7k tonight.
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:26:56
Should I buy now or wait to see if it falls down a bit?
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:39:23
There's literally no floor anymore, anything could happen.
