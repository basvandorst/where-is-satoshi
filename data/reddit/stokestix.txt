Does the app show transactions and realized gain/loss now or does it still only do the "tracking"? It's a great app, just lacking the thing that I think most investors are interested in.

Because you would have to pay a fee for the bitcoin transaction, then a fee for the buy transaction. So basically you would be paying more than the price of the product. Not worth it.

"store of value"? And here I think that "Bitcoin is the **currency** of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank."

How old are you? They always charge a lot if you do it offline. Everywhere. 


The amount you are paying is irrelevant most of the time. It takes the same amount of time for an employee to process your order.
This has nothing to do with the banking system or bitcoin. You just didn't bother to check the fee.

If you know how to sign transaction offline, yes. It's basically the same mechanic as a hardware wallet, just more work to do:
1. ledger -&gt; plug in, do stuff.
2. cold storage -&gt; create transaction on online computer, save file, boot to linux with wallet on an offline (FOREVER) computer/laptop (optionally from usb stick), sign transaction, save file, go back to online computer and broadcast.
So yeah, I'd rather pay some money for the convenience.
I did this on an old offline laptop to get coins off exchange while waiting for ledger

When it comes to bitcoin, you should take all the time to become as techy as possible. To be super duper safe, I'd create a watch-only wallet on the connected computer, create a transaction sending BTC to one of addresses in Ledger. Sign the transaction on the air-gapped computer (or on Tails bootable from USB). Then broadcast it on the connected computer.

@_date: 2017-10-09 20:04:16
If you split BTC, you don't get BT2 and BTC. You get BT1 and BT2 and those two cost much less than BTC. You can sell 1 BT2, but you won't be able to buy back 1 BTC with the money.

I am also trying to move my BTC to a secure wallet. I have researched the following options so far:
1. Hardware wallet - if you spend BTC frequently, or just can't be arsed to generate a
2. Paper wallet - for HODLing. Best to do it on a laptop/computer which will never be connected to the Internet again. The thing is it's cheaper to buy a hardware wallet instead of a new laptop, unless you have an old one like me.
3. Cold Storage Wallet - using TAILs and Electrum to create a secure wallet - kinda like paper but a bit more practical (I think?) and without the risk of typing your private key into a connected computer.
I'm torn, because in my opinion if you have more than 3 BTC, you can afford and should definitely get a hardware wallet, but at the same time I plan to HODL long time, so it's such a waste.
I'm new so if something is wrong, someone more experienced please correct me.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:22:26
Whattt? You sure? Gonna check mine.
Did you buy from Amazon or their website?
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:26:36
Use Electrum in Tails from a bootable usb stick (I did this on an old laptop which will never connect to the Internet again). Create cold wallet, write down seed, copy public master key. Install Electrum on Windows and create a watch-only wallet. Tada! Safe as fuck.

I personally wouldn't pay a cent more for faster confirmation, because I chose the lowest fee possible anyway - 25 blocks. I was in no rush. I was expecting 6 to 10 hours, but now it's confirmed after just 4. 
Maybe the website did help. Maybe it didn't. I don't know any way to check. I still don't recommend paying extra fees. That's not how blockchain/bitcoin/Satoshi's vision is supposed to work at all... It's a bit sad.

You want to hold but you also want to time the market and we already told you that you can't. Best compromise: buy half now, buy half after fork. If the price is gonna be higher, you will gain. If the price is gonna be lower, you will also gain in the long term. Win, win.

So if 
1. hard fork goes through, we get 2 chains, you get an amount of BTC equal to the amount of BT1 tokens and made some money (dividend)?
2. hard fork goes through, but BT1 get destroyed, you lost everything but some money from BT2?
And if there's no hard fork, you also get the same amount of BTC and made some free money?
