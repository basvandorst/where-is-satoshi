Bitcoin is a replacements for central banks though, which is much more important.


Agreed, but DAG or PoS haven't yet proved themselves protecting a 260bn chain, PoW has.


Is not thrown away, and much less for nothing.
It's spent doing some work, it's up to you wether that's a worthy work or not, but for others is clearly worth it.

You're competing with cash too, and there are plenty of use cases we can't do yet with current systems that would be possible with Cryptos, but only with pseudo-free tx.

LN and Mimblewimble are not being developed by core, atomic swaps are not meant to be for BTC, they're meant to be used by other coins in order to increase adoption for them...
I hope you're right, but I think all of these will come too late.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:09:22
Atomic swaps? So you send LTC instead of BTC? Sidechains? Those are even further away than LN.
Don't get me wrong, I love BTC, the majority of my portfolio is LTC, I support core too and I understand things can't be rushed, but the market won't wait for 6 months to a year or two.
Specially when those solutions will only partially alleviate the congestion, fees might go down 20-30%, let's say 50% being generous.
But we need a 95-98% drop. Cryptos won't work with fees higher than 5-10 cents, and that's already plenty. They should be more like 3-5.
Anything higher is just buying time. Core needs to either make tx smaller or increase block size, and soon.
Network effect won't last forever and we're on borrowed time already.
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:05:25
How can the block be so big if there are not enough tx to amount 2.26 mb?
Blocks are empty right now, I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:37:34
Vanity address
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:58:06
Well of course, but they're not full as a whole by any means.
The network is operating at 50% capacity on average I'd say.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:47
The problem in my view isn't that there's no scaling solution yet, although we should be way closer than we are now cause this has been going on for well over 2 years.
The problem is that I don't see core taking any steps to it, there's no scaling roadmap other than LN, which is not even being developed by them, therefore, what are they doing? What are they researching? Are they refactoring the code at least? Are they trying to make tx smaller? 
They dismissed 2x cause they needed more time, well they could have started work after sw, and we could be pretty close to it by now (6 months is a long time to prepare an upgrade).
Have they made a thorough research concluding that 4-8mb blocks hurt the network in the long term? Or are they pulling it out of their asses?
Bottom line is: what has core been doing for the past 6 months? Have they investigated proof of stake? They have NOTHING, NADA.
edit: add last phrase
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:25:33
Ah ok, any idea about the nature of these tx?
So the block was full I assume, but fees aren't high cause the mempool is empty, the miner decided to batch all of those tx together in a full block instead of spreading them over multiple blocks, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:29:21
LN needs low fees to work, you will need to open and settle channels relatively often.
People are blindly thinking LN is the scaling solution (so did I, until I understood what it really is and how it works) and they'll realize this the hard way, once it's already too late.
LN is one scaling solution, it's got many great use cases, but it's not good for everything, and it still needs low fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:55
Agreed 100%.
I've also watched all of his videos, and thanks to them I now have the mental strength and certainty to navigate these waters. Also I always think that his is the boat I wanna be in, so while he supports core, so will I.
Even if this generation of cryptos end up getting replaced, the way I see the world now and everything I'm learning at so many levels, I'll keep.
Congrats for your new life BTW!

I mean the efficiency, when will it plateau? 
They're reaching the limit (relative to the broad hw manufacturing processes, not in absolute terms) in terms of chip nm architecture now, aren't they?
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:31:37
Mining hardware's performance grows exponentially every few months.
That means the hashrate needed per BTC mined tends to infinity.
Miners need to constantly increase the hashrate just to stay in the game, regardless of what the price does.
The fact that miners keep staying competitive regardless of the price means miners are long on BTC, and expect the price to increase in the long term.
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:28:26
true true
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:23:48
Sw users benefit from more adoption in reduced fees.
If sw is used by 1% of tx, those tx have lower fees compared to the rest of the network, but they'll still be higher than if 80% of tx were using sw.
Segwit adoption needs to keep climbing for scaling purposes.
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:44:52
And that's the best news possible, but for now OP's question can be answered with the premise that hashrate grows exponentially (although the curve is becoming less steep), right?
When do you expect this to happen?
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:50:43
Samsung chips should level up the market?
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:05:51
Alphanumeric? Fuck that, I only read binary
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:56:23
I don't know what you mean, I suspect we're talking about different things.
I mean mining hardware, the latest ant miner can generate (numbers completely made up) 100 TH/s, the previous generation maybe 50 TH/s.
Its only natural that the overall hashrate of the network grows exponentially due to the competitive nature of mining, you need to have more hashing power than your competitors in order to make good money, and every 6 months to a year, miners need to upgrade to the newer generation of mining hw in a never ending circle, which makes the overall hashrate of the network GROW exponentially, not decrease.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:46:56
I'm pretty sure they do. They pay for the withdrawal fees, so they batch multiple inputs to multiple addresses in the same tx.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:54:42
I see
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:28:04


true that, devil lies in the details
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:41:42
Someone seriously downvoted this? Why?
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:24:31
Yes I heard that too, mining should get more decentralised very quickly
@_date: 2018-05-30 09:20:10
Yes but not everyone has the money to do it.
Think about it
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:40:49
And how do nodes know when the last difficulty adjustment happened?
Imagine hashrate doesn't change in 2016 blocks, how will nodes know when they need to recalculate it?
Isn't that a vector for a 51% attack? Imagine a malicious miner mines a block with a lower difficulty and broadcasts it, honest nodes will reject it, but the attacker start mining blocks very fast due to the much lower difficulty, therefore making their chain longer, hence accumulating more PoW.
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:40:06
Yes but imagine the difficulty is exactly the same, therefore it gets recalculated, but it's the same, can they go another 2016 blocks behind to check? What about new nodes who weren't present in the previous recalculation? Do they go back too?
About the hard fork? Why would honest node fork? They'll follow the longest chain right? It happens on a healthy chain when 2 blocks are discovered simultaneously, and after a few blocks the chain with the more PoW wins. What keeps it from happening with an invalid difficulty?
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:31:01
So new equipment performs worse than the one available 2 years ago?

@_date: 2017-08-04 19:26:49
Yes I meant the network was collapsed, as in there was a big number of tx in general for like a month or so. I'm not fully sure yet what the mempool means at a low technical level.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:15:42
Oh of course! I'm so stupid I didn't think about that.
Blocks had very little tx at the beginning, I'm probably getting to the point in history where the mempool was full and so were blocks, hence the time increase.
Makes all the sense thanks!
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:43:21
Very cool
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:42:38
It was probably a bad choice of words, I'm not a native. I meant busy yes.
So what happens if your node runs out of memory? It won't be able to allocate the entire mempool, do they store unconfirmed tx in disk?
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:56:45
?? What number of blocks? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:05:32
Exactly, then why is it downloading them incredibly slower as it reaches the end of the chain?
As I said I downloaded the first 100k blocks in maybe 2-3 days.
I'm approaching the last 50k blocks and it downloads ~3k blocks a day now.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:17:36
I see what you mean now i thought you meant there were more blocks after the ones I'm downloading, not that there were more tx/per block in last blocks.
@_date: 2019-11-19 09:04:41
If this ends up playing out, I will personally give you a blowjob for free.
And I hope it happens.
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:42:44

Its a serious question wtf? Yearbooks as in the only book small kids have for the whole year?
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:00:16
I mean blocks are taking much longer to download as I get to the end of the chain.
What has the mining difficulty to do with the difficulty to download the blocks?
I'm not validating tx yet, I'm still syncing the chain.
It just have to validate the tx itself and the order of tx within blocks right?
@_date: 2018-06-17 07:04:15

That's not the source of FUD. The market is being manipulated in several ways to a certain degree.
You couldn't blame tether for doing that in an unregulated market like crypto.
The tether FUD is (was) that they didn't have money to back up their tokens and if that came to light, the whole market would go down.
We're almost 6 months into the year and tether is still there.
Not only that, they've issued more tokens, therefore either growing organically or making the lie bigger and potentially more harmful.
I think they're telling the truth.
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:57:28
Yes! 
They've been clearing all of 2018 actually. I've done about 10-12 tx so far this year, all 1 sat/byte most confirmed in the next block.
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:42:43
It has nothing to do with an exchange order.
What he means is a 51&amp; attack by which a malicious miner that controls \&gt; 50&amp; of the mining power attacks the network by re\-broadcasting blocks with different transactions than the original, basically rewinding transactions.

@_date: 2018-06-06 16:20:42
The cost of rewinding a block is just the coinbase what are you saying?
You forgot to mention the humongous cost of owning &gt; 50% of the hashpower didn't you?
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:48:46
The genesis block has no tx in it right? So the differences in the hash can only be achieved by changing the nonce and the coinbase address?
Is this new block empty as well? If not? All of this theory revolves around what? How can someone pre calculate the hash of a non-empty block if they didn't know what UTXOs were going to be included in it in advance?
Does the quantum computer theory implies that this machine could have produced that hash on the fly, like a normal block? But with such a vast advantage that not only has it been able to find a nonce, therefore beating all other existing competition, but one that generates that hash?
How long after the previous block was it discovered? Sorry I'm on phone and I can't find it out.
If the quantum computer theory happens to be true, you know all current cryptos are all dead and there's no replacement for them yet, right?
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:47:08
Has he tried though, captain condescending?
Cause it looks like to me he hasn't
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:53:18
Oh ok. Non-us non-native either.
I thought you were a teacher and that was your students' book
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:40:56
Yes but it's not just the cost of the coinbase, the cost of electricity for reverting just one transaction is huge, 95k doesn't cover it.
Plus there's the cost of opportunity of doing so, since if the attack is unsuccessful the malicious miner loses all of that money and gets nothing in return.
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:56:19
Who's the guy before Satoshi and where's Hal Finney?
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:31:11
But you still need to bribe half of the network to succeed, which would cost an astronomical sum.
I agree it's way cheaper than trying to build up 50% of the hashrate yourself, but it's still stupid money, I couldn't give a figure though.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:05:48
So a high number of days destroyed implies high selling pressure incoming, correct?
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:21:12

I think sending to a sw address doesn't imply constructing a sw tx.
You can send to a sw address as they're backwards compatible, but that's not the OP's point.

@_date: 2019-04-16 13:18:46
Ah I see what you mean now.
Abra is a centralized service that allows for people to buy and sale coins on chain so to say, but you're still using their app. 
And for using Bisq you need to run the wallet or service yourself in order to exchange assets with other parties, it's a protocol.
Something like this?

Bitstamp is the best exchange out there, specially for Europeans
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:04:57
I'm afraid not. Segwit helps no doubt.
But the primary reason for low fees is the lack of traffic. And not because of batching, which does help too, it's simply because there's no movement, volume on exchanges is a fraction of what it was in December.
Once interest spikes again, fees will go back up, probably less, proportionally, due to SW adoption and batching but still way up.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:37:04
I'm not sure what the cheapest one is, it also depends where you live and if you want fiat pairs too.
Kraken is cheaper than bitstamp to trade, but you have to pay withdrawal fees, which in bitstamp you don't...
There are many factors

I start the server with bitcoind, but then I use the bitcoin-cli command to get the server info, is there any other way to do this?

@_date: 2017-09-23 23:04:46
You're right, the getinfo option is no longer supported in the bitcoin-cli command in 0.15. A combination of getblockchaininfo and getnetworkinfo give the same information as before, plus more interesting data about the network and the node.
The node was running fine, I just wasn't aware and thought the  -32601 error was from the server, not the bitcoin-cli command itself.
I'm also tailing the debug.log file, which I hadn't done before, and I can see the blocks being downloaded (still 3k left to finish), and I'm happy to report 0.15 is much faster at verifying them (I started downloading the chain over a month an a half ago on a raspberry pi 3).

@_date: 2017-09-28 07:33:37


yes makes all the sense, that was probably the part I was missing, so long as mining nodes have the new rules, old nodes can broadcast invalid tx, but if these don't get mined it's ok I guess.


So new nodes won't ban old nodes for broadcasting invalid txs in case of a SF cause they know theose txs were valid before but not now? Like a condescending father who knows you didn't know better haha.
So they can distinguish between a now-invalid tx and a straight up scammy tx yes?

Even after let's say 50 years of everybody on earth using bitcoin (I know, I'm just saying) it'd still be impossible to generate someone else's key?

Thanks! I need to digest this info, but I think I understand.
As far as I know, chainsplits happen relatively often due to network latency etc, and the chain gets naturally reorganized after a few seconds/minutes yes?
When one chain of the two gets longer, that becomes the valid chain for all nodes, and they discard the shorter chain, ok I understand.
But then, if new nodes reject certain new tx that old nodes accept, these tx that are invalid by the new set of rules get propagated and eventually mined by the old nodes, which means I could create an invalid SW tx that will get mined, which is dangerous.
What am I missing?

In their own self interest, exactly. Not in the network's best interest. The network needed to scale and it was being blocked in one way or the other.
Hence Bitcoin has (a part of) a toxic community. It obviously comes with size and relevance, the bigger the community the more crossed interests and the more at stake the more radical members of that community become.
I'm not saying it's Bitcoin's fault, but there are members to the community that are toxic, at least to the user's best interests.

Ooh so the UASF was a negotiation alright. Coming back to my previous question, what did miners achieve in this negotiation?
They did not get a block size increase, which is the only thing they wanted and had to put up with segwit, which is what they rejected. Devs in the other hand did get segwit, which is the only thing they wanted and there's no block size increase, which is what they rejected.
What kind of negotiation is that in which one side gets exactly what they want and the other not only gets none of what they demanded but has to accept what the other party wants.
It's not a 50-50, not even a 80-20, it was a 100-0.
And this is a fact, cause there is prove to back it up.

Well of course, no one put a gun in anyone's head, but devs were forced (notice the word) to take extreme measures out of the impossibility to reach consensus with miners.
And miners voluntarily signaled SW of course, but out of fear.
Force needn't be physical.

Bitcoin maximalists will never admit this or even realize BTC needs LTC to survive and thrive together.
LTC will implement Schnorr before BTC and serve as a real world testbed for BTC once again. 
With such a toxic community BTC has, it would be in a much much darker hole if it weren't because LTC activated Segwit first.

He exited Coinbase well before (years actually) he sold his coins and LTC was listed.
You can't imagine how much money Litecoin has made Coinbase, if anything they should thank Charlie.
On another note, what if he sold HIS coins? LTC is decentralized, he's just another user and owes explanation to nobody on what he does with his money. 
Never forget he mined his coins. Litecoin has, if anything, an even fairer initial distribution than BTC, cause the community was bigger back then, and more people had the chance to become an early miner.
Satoshi mined thousands of coins solo, with no competition. I'm not criticising him, far from it, I'm just implying things are the way they are, and it's deeply unfair to bash someone for their personal choices omitting the context, he owes explanation to no one but himself.

@_date: 2018-07-18 11:48:49
Miners didn't give up voluntarily, they did it out of fear of the UASF succeeding.
The UASF was the force you're talking about, and it had to be used as a desperate measure from one side of the community in response to another one's toxicity and lack of reasoning.

I like it, it's not a shitty Bitcoin fork such as gold or diamond.
It raises a fair point and that's the beauty of the free market and open source SW, you can build your own vision and let the market decide. It also help BTC miners on their toes.
That said I don't think it's got much commercial value right now, if I were a merchant and I had to chose between accepting LTC or VTC, I'd chose LTC simply because it's got many more users.
Perhaps when the market is 100 times bigger and there are atomic swaps on the LN there will be room for many more players.

@_date: 2018-07-18 11:36:32
Sure, but that sum might not be evenly distributed.
Segwit was activated after 2 years of negotiations. What have miners given up on? Are they making less money now than before segwit was activated?
However, users and devs have suffered high fees, slowed adoption and 2 years worth of stagnation at protocol level.
Who acted more selfishly here?
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:06:18
Of course, but that codebase sharing goes both ways.
Thanks to it LTC could implement segwit 3 months before BTC managed to, paving the way for it.
Miners might have never agreed to wasn't it for the pressure of LTC already having it.
And the same will happen with Schnorr, MAST and confidential tx. LTC will implement them first.

What a baller
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:00:15
No, what I'm arguing is that I say devs used force via the UASF to force miners signal segwit, and you say that's not force, miners voluntarily dediced to do it.
If that's not force, then why didn't miners signal segwit during the many activation periods before the UASF? What triggered their change of perspective?
Can you prove that the UASF wasn't the force that triggered the sudden signaling? (with 100% blocks signaled, no less)
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:34:24
That's why in retaliation against miners for forcing users to pay higher fees due to a lack of consensus on how to scale Bitcoin, devs were forced to throw an ultimatum in the form of the UASF.
How is that not a toxic community (both parties, not just miners) that'll take their view to such lenghts as to have to force others to do things?
Miners were forced to accept SW cause there was no agreement, devs acted unilaterally and miners could only chose to signal SW or risk a chain split.
There was no agreement cause miners have gotten nothing in return, we have segwit and no block size increase.

That doesn't affect the block discovery rate.
The more hashrate the network has, the more difficult mining a block becomes.
The network self balances so that a block is discovered every 10 minutes on average.
When Satoshi mined the genesis block the hashrate has 0 compared to current levels, and  current levels will be despicable in 10 years time, but blocks will keep coming every 10 minutes.

Ok so BIPs' code is already in the core client? just waiting to be activated.
What happens when a BIP gets finally rejected? is its code removed from core client codebase?
I have heard the SW implementations proposed by 2x and core are different, hence the frankensegwit name referring to 2X's implementation, very poorly code and buggy. Is this correct?
When a BIP is locked in and its code gets activated, how are economic nodes forced to upgrade to the new set of rules? let's say I run a node with core client 0.13, how/when is my node forced to be upgraded to 0.14 rules? are outdated nodes isolated from the network by the nodes that are running the more updated clients, effectively keeping the set of rules up to date?


Yes I agree, I'm not quite there yet technically, but I want to get more and more involved with time.
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:55:35
We ain't seen nothing yet folks
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:31:23


So if I alter my node's logic and make it validate by a different set of rules, other nodes detect that I'm "lying" and punish my node by isolating it, right?
But imagine a majority of nodes don't upgrade to the new client containing the SW logic, wouldn't nodes that do upgrade be considered liars and therefore isolated from the majority of the network that don't know about these new rules?
What can you tell me about the different SW implementations information? is it true or not?


This would imply a HF right? 1mb blocks can be contained into a 2mb one, but not the other way around, hence it's a hard fork because it's a looser set of rules...
Thank you for your responses, I'm clarifying many concepts that were still kind of blurry/I hadn't put much thought on
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:23:30
Yes, I think it's obvious for everyone miners act solely on their economic interest, and don't really care about the decentralization or potential benefits for society cryptocurrencies will bring us.
Those who support miners are mostly other miners/people who can take advantage of this situation and uninformed individuals, I fell for it too at some point and believed core was acting selfishly by not supporting the NYA.

@_date: 2017-07-17 22:16:36
I have a question.
Both the UASF and 2X are trying to activate BIP(9?). Now the rules of the Bitcoin network are dictated by the economic nodes, which are in charge of validating transactions.
What I fail to understand is where is the core and 2x's segwit code? What is the process of forcing nodes to update to the new code so they start validating by the new rules? If 2X gets locked_in, will its code be included into core's client via pull request? How do nodes know whether their rules/other node's they're talking to are valid anymore?
If 2x goes ahead and activates, then UASF wouldn't happen right? Since SW is already locked in...
How could core/miners trigger these processes? I mean where is the code to read 2x's ('NYA'?) flag on blocks and why does it affect the whole network and not just the nodes running 2x's client?
As you can see I'm terribly confused at the technical level and probably I'm mixing things here.
TLDR; how do BIP code gets distributed to nodes once they lock in and how does the signaling/listening for BIPs flags code gets distributed?
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:15:56


I don't care about the core/miners drama, I've used BIP148 and 2x as an example, since they're both trying to activate SW, just imagine they were simply two BIPs.


I know what BIPs are, I just want to know how they work/activate at a technical level.


I have a good enough picture of them, as I said I just want to know about BIPs in general, I've just used 141 and 148 as an example.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:57:21


Grand, understood. Is the 95% figure the same variable as the 95% BIP activation threshold or they just happen to be the same number?


Yes I totally agree, I'm actually happy BIP148 is there, even if it'll most likely never happen, but the community made a point. 
It'll help keep miners on their toes. The good thing is that SW is 100% getting activated.
So if the SW implementation that BIP141 is going to lock in is the "good" one, who's coding the block increase part of 2x? core as well?

This is so true, if ethereum ever bas a higher market cap than BTC (not market dominance), that'd create a terrible FUD on BTC, which would catapult ETH price even higher and BTC plummet.
The scaling debate has to end now or it'll be too late

BTC is a currency, if we don't use it to purchase goods it becomes an speculative asset, which is due to dissappear in the long term

Even better, short them coins and run!

I agree, but even when it scales, if it's not used to purchase goods it won't be a currency, will be something else.
Let's just hope this doesn't happen
