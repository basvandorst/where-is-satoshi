YTD=Year to Date. The joke is that its already 2018 in Australia, so a YTD all time high is just the highest price for one day.

Dude, in some States imply having a large amount of cash on you is sufficient grounds to have it seized by the cops.

Well, it wasn't a problem with bitcoin itself, so he was right, wasn't he?

Except Apple owns their trademark. Who owns the Bitcoin trademark? Is was too "old economy" for you? So now anybody can use the name bitcoin and nobody can stop them? That's the price of decentralisation.

How about the South Sea Bubble, or the DotCom bubble, or the US housing bubble? All figments of an economist's imagination? Bernie Madoff isn't really languishing in jail. 
It's great to believe in a technology, but don't be blind to the risks.

Such a license would be interesting, but without a means to "bless" a particular revision of the code you would end up with the same problem.

If you don't care about any of those things, why not just pay with fiat?

Then YOU should have fucking trademarked the name, but now its too late and anybody can call anything they want Bitcoin. Bit of an oversight, don't you think? Bit silly to build billion dollar valuations on a project that doesn't have the basic legal framework in place, don't you think?

Apple Bitcoin. And nobody would be able to stop them.

...or betamax, or MySpace. Are a lot of people suddenly using Bitcoin for buying and selling things other than Bitcoin?

The earliest Slashdot post I can find about Bitcoin was July 2010.

Really? You can't figure out how to apply concepts like supply and demand to Bitcoin? The technology creates a limited supply commodity with infinite substitutes following a standard technological diffusion curve. Currently it is behaving very much like stocks during the Dotcom boom. Do some reading - people were setting up offices where people could set up day trading operations to play the market.

A newspaper article or a tweet are text, yet can still be regulated by libel laws. Maybe your grasp on Constitutional law isn't as firm as you think?

There is a limited supply of bitcoin but an infinite supply of alternative cryptocurrencies.

This is the same way that the Australian Tax Office has treated Bartercard for years. Bartercard is essentially a private currency and early adopters thought they could use it to avoid tax. The ATO isn't that dumb - you pay taxes on the AUD equivalent and pay those taxes using legal tender ie AUD. Companies should run a separate account for it in their accounting system.
Basically you are taxed on the AUD equivalent. Equally, you cannot avoid tax by being paid in gold, or diamonds or whatever - you still get taxed.

What a load of bullshit. Flow of funds to crypto is not even a blip on the radar for the banks. Restricting bank accounts used by cryptocurrency business is largely due to a perception that they are risky and have a higher incidence of fraud. Maybe a bit of a luddite move but not a grand conspiracy.
* Pundits have been predicting a house market crash for about ten years now, but apparently haven't gotten tired of being wrong. I guess one day they'll have to be right, but listening to them would have cost you a lot of money over the last few years. Yes, we have issues with housing affordability but a major correction is wishful thinking. We've had long periods in the past of stagnant growth, rather than major corrections. Remember, we don't have non-recourse loans - you can't just hand the keys to the bank if you are underwater.
* Cash requirements are different to capital reserve requirements. Australians are using less and less cash, so it makes no sense for banks to hold massive amounts of cash on hand.
* The government guarantees deposit funds, up to, what, $250,000? Countries put this into place after lessons were learned from the Great Depression.
* A Wordpress site that misquotes a bunch of sources doesn't really count as "investigations".
* You ignore the whole mortgage origination market. Banks aren't using deposit funds to make home loans. 
I'm bullish on cryptocurrency as a worthwhile innovation, but this sort of fear-mongering koolaid turns people off because it makes cryptocurrency seem like the domain of libertarian extremists and doomsday preppers.

This whole article and thread is just very bizarre. It seems like nobody has had any actual contact with payroll, even the author of the article. Getting people paid correctly actually takes a degree of effort, especially where people work different hours. Collecting timeslips and keeping track of tax obligations, deductions etc is not a trivial task and would be a nightmare to do on a daily basis. Employers choose a period that makes sense from a processing point of view. In developed countries the actual process of getting money into people's bank accounts is the easiest part of the whole transaction.
Show this article to anyone who actually works in payroll and they will roll their eyes at you at the utter cluelessness of it.
