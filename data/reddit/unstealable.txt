Slick! Starts the user out with the test account so they can spend right away and let's them choose how much they incrementally opt-in with each feature selection. Great way to keep them from getting overwhelmed while helping them small-chunk learn the aspects of Bitcoin.

Al Gore may have invented the internet (cough), but Krugman gave it wings with this beauty: "By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."

This is a great cause but there is no personal story behind the project. Is it possible to embed a video or photos on the bitcoin2fund showing some of the freelancers and merchants? Maybe tell a little bit of their personal story?

Nice wallet! Start-up screen is pretty sweet.
1) I would remove the cumbersome start-up process. If I'm going to spend test coins then why do I need to go through several security features? Maybe create a very quick way to utilize the fake coins (for newcomers) and instead of having the red flashing strip for the recovery words, that strip is pressed to start using real bitcoins. Then the security process ensues and the recovery strip comes up afterwards.
2) I would add the ability to make a note with each payment sent/received in some sort of history screen. When I send the coins, I have to put in the passphrase. On that pop-up you could add an input for an optional note and maybe an optional color. Then show a transaction history in the left menu side.
3) I like that I can spend test coins on cats! Lol. That's a good idea to get people started with Bitcoin.
