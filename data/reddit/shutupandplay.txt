idk maybe its a canada only thing, but you can send money to someone over email or through a text message directly through your online banking . you set it up with a password that ethey have to enter to make the transfer go through, it gets deposited right into your bank account.

naw interac online is completely different. its more similar to a visa debit card. and only 1 or mayby 2 banks ofer it and almost no online retailers accept it or have even heard of it. email money transfer is pretty universal all baks offer it and you dont use your account number or card at all, just log into your online banking enter an email or phone number to send it to, set up a security question select the smount to send and click go. the other person gets the email or text, which liks them to a page where they can select their bank, then that leads them to a page on their own banks online banking website with the transfer info asking for the password, which you enter and the money gets immidately deposited. no fees eiter unless you have a really shitty bank account. its great for buying drugs or just loaning a friend money without having to hit an atm, the only downside it is requires trust on the part of the buyer cause you cant do chargebacks, but im sure ther are some escrow services out there to make it a bit more reliable ive never had an isue however. most legit sells would rather die then have a bad reveiw after ripping someone off and i would never send one to something i thought the least bit shady

Allegedly raped someone, we all know that over 50% of reported rape cases are fake. And considering Assange was/is on americas shitlist, I have 0% faith there actually was a rape, it was just a ruse to get him into facilities that the american military could make him "disappear" from

burden of proof only applies in courts and in science. when talking about everyday facts it is incorrect to use it. i dont demand someone "prove it" every time i hear them say there are stars in the sky...
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:35:41
go ahead and google it bro, this isnt a hypotysis in science in trying to prove to you, its a commonly known fact the burden of proof isn't on me to prove common knowledge. take your head out of your ass

Not idiots, mostly kids who want drugs on the darkweb (ok idiots i guess) use the BTCatms they arent buying to hold they just want a quick transaction that they can understand.

Take that stick out of your ass dude
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:02:27
man that massive amount of btc that moved in one transaction that we now find out bitmain was behind, can this be seen as a red flag
