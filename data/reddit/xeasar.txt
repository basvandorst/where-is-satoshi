Are you guys trolling me or something, or I just can't receive any, because the transaction list is still empty somehow. If you guys have time to talk, I'd really appreciate it, you can add me on Skype.

Further, you can contact me on Skype (supersaiyan10) and I will share screen to show you personally. And maybe you can even help me figure out what's wrong.

It's still on 0. The only way I found of refreshing is closing and reopening the application.

I will send everything back if you want, but I haven't received anything. I wish I have. This is my current screenshot.

Very much appreciated buddy.

.... Dude, I swear I didn't receive anything, I will return to you everything if you want as soon as I receive anything... Here's another current screenshot with whole desktop so you can see time and this thread.

It seemed much easier on 4chan where I first discovered it, sorry for being a newbie.

So, basically, as a student, I can go fuck myself?
