I know that I’m talking about the comment above that the banks could buy tons of bitcoins then short the futures and dump the bitcoins to drive price down comment.

No one needs to hope for a recovery. It’s already back up 34%! Jeez.

Same! It drops 30 one day goes up 30 the next day. If you’re in bitcoin you should know this. Don’t put money in it you can’t live without and when it drops buy more. It’s not for the faint of heart.

Exactly !

Correct. It’s mostly retail consumers. Big guys will come with CME.

Bitcoin up 34% in past 24 hours!

Hodling is the only thing anyone can do. The less they can get their hands on, the less they can manipulate. Right?

If the price continues to rise higher and higher then that means more and more people believe in Bitcoin as a technology and believe it will ultimately takeover fiat currencies...so why would you want to sell bitcoin back for a fiat currency? 
Just

You have no idea what you’re talking about. That drop was not a bubble popping, that was PayPal spliting from EBay into it’s own stock!   
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:25:28
Haha, that’s a good one. Ask him who Bitcoin’s CEO is?
