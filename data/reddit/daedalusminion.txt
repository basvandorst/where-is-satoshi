He's talking about digital money, **not** cryptocurrency.

If you're admitting to what you're doing, no harm done. But to those acting like they're building a new tomorrow, lol.

You know it. As a passive observer with no stake in Bitcoin I fucking love these threads.
It's like an 11 year old placating a 10 year old.

While I agree with them about 'cryptocurrency' and it's uses, I agree with the broader point you're making. The admins seem to be completely oblivious of how to make this website better. 
Ask any moderator just how many times they've begged reddit for features to make reddit better and they've either been shot down or put on the backburner. It's embarrassing and callous to say the least.

Haha, no. If I stake out a rich family's house once they're off on vacation and walk away with items and money, I didn't earn it.
I stole it.
What kind of dumbass logic is this?

An analysis of the jailbreak has already been conducted. It **does not** do anything like that.

Yes but how do you initiate the discussion? Obviously someone is going to post 'wtf it dropped to this' and then comments will flow. But if you restrict **posts about price**, how do you expect people to stay informed?
This is completely WTF.

Genuinely speaking, what is the point of this subreddit then? If people can't discuss how terrible it is during the crash, then what's the fucking point.

Here in Mumbai too a lot of people have expressed interest in such a currency. I'm thinking of starting something up.
