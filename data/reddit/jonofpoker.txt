Just gonna ask for everyone here&gt;
CoinShuffle is gonna mix/shuffle bitcoin? AKA, make it anonymous? 
@_date: 2016-08-24 02:38:29
First thing I ever bought with crypto. PexPeppers! That was Doge tho. Still awesome!
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:03:18
Says the user who’s active in lMFAO
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:20:38
More like, Lemonade ‘Now Tokenized with blockchain technology’
But I get it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:36:57
Whoa, they will cover the loss of funds? That’s some good old fashion faith in bitcoin right there. I’ll be looking into their plans! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:38:11
Ok, I’ll check it out. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:51:15
Awesome work! A little over my head but it’s nice to see some tutorials coming out for LN. The progress has been amazing! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:16:55
Lol, at they are freaking out about 3% drops over there. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:28:03
What button did you press!?!
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:03:21
Read the title. Jeez
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:12:49
There’s that moon math site, it estimates 2020 million dollar bitcoin. Even with its slow down, it’s actually on pace to easily hit that mark based on trends and TA. Although anything can happen by then! 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:15:21
It goes up and down*
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:13:04
It just says a lot. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:40:45
Suck it’s own dick? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:02:51
Ouch, when you realize you could have bought b4 hodl was a thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:30:42
Dude, stfu. No one knows about the 30 day cycle! And that’s it’s starting up in a day or two. ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:46:48
Last number I heard was 10,000. That must have been a while ago! 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:39:10
No I actually know he made mad bank from his drink shilling. He probably has more from water than BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:09:49
Yep, gonna make my last move tonight, goodbye legacy! 
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:33:05
This 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:13:53
Let’s hope! I need btc baby!

Why not? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:12:44
Nice, remember the people are in charge here.

No, Thank You!

@_date: 2018-01-12 20:53:18
I’ve been meaning to check them out. I’ve heard it a great Cbase alternative. Noobs take notice! 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:52:55
Idk If I sound sarcastic or something over txt. I call selling anything shilling because the space has warped my mind. I liked 50 when PIMP came out in middle school, I liked him more when I realized how smart he is. 
He shills water tho. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:03:49
Let’s keep crashing to Payday! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:51:41
Guys, you’re supposed to spread FUD so we can buy in cheaper! Stop presenting the noobs with logic! 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:02:38
I forgot to try this out, I will tonight. Thanks!

You can buy cigarettes and stuff smuggled from North Korea on openbazzar. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:01:18
Yeah, I can’t wait for the tech to allow us to bypass these BS centralizing companies. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:54:42
If you’re going Bitcoin. Be an investor, not a trader. Only 10% of traders are successful. Most people can tell you from experience, it’s better to hodl. And get ready for a wild ride! Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:22:02
AAAAWWWW YEAYUH! MEMES BE DANK!
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:13:55
Check open orders that weren’t filled. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:07:51
Or they are the ones who sold. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:34:02
If shit coins stop getting pumped, good. The best coins grow slow and strong. Maybe we need a bloodbath and some doubt to reign in this nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:06:23
Yeah, beat me to it. Lol. Loving the sale here! 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:50:34
We need to drop more honestly, hands need to be shaken for Bitcoin to remain strong. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:04:48
I think I may have called it,  at about current price w/ fees. Got another buy loaded if it dips again, sub 10k, didn’t think I’d get he chance, good luck getting me to sell these! 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:39:52
Hodl your own keys or perish. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:09:48

So stupid, like people can’t say “yeah I’m playing Tetris, gimme the damn GUP!” 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:20:02
I’m not big on stocks, but I had some interest at one point, and the sub is pretty hilarious. I’ll probably lurk a while, haha. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:36:22
Nope, it has a surprising amount of Mainnet activity. And businesses already using it for micro payments. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:15:52
If you know you’re selling in a year. I’d say CBase is *ok* to hodl. Exchanges are a no. You never keep more than maybe 10% on an exchange. They not only are honey pots for hackers, but they have glitches and lose peoples coins all the time. Be safe! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:43:33
Talk cryptography to me!

I’m waiting on samourai wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:35:37
Btc value up, lambs value down. Once we can 3D print lambo parts, it’s over. Lol 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:08:02
That will be a great movie, and everyone will bitch about it getting facts wrong. Haha
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:15:33
Yep, everything is running well. Innovation is being adopted and laggers and falling behind. BTC looking great in my eyes. ��
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:04:10
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:22:19
Damn, idk man. Cbase and dax are not on great terms with the community, lol. Just start  the long tedious supposed process I guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:18:43
That’s what I assumed. But surely people buy bulk to build PCs to sell. So if that’s the case, a lot of small businesses will be affected, as they don’t have a name like Newegg or Bestbuy to back them up. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:21:47
I bet he sold when it doubled. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:49:06
We need meme support from 13k to 15k. There’s a meme trench we need to vault. It may take some googling and some shitposting, but we can do it, 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:55:38
I agree, we need meme support at these levels. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:22:56
On nom nom! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:50:43
Nice, I’m waiting until I move and have a better internet connection. But I think the build will be a blast!

I was gonna say, decent advice for cable
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:05:58
But this other coin is doing 3x today... /s

Don’t have it with me.
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:32:26
This made me sad. 
Fuck ripple. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:54:29
I was wondering where these posts were. Upvoted and already switched to segwit wallet! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:12:29
Lol, waiting for samurai release. I might jailbreak my kindle. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:28:42
So no farms?

You can see the roll of the tide, use cyclical analysis in conjunction with candles in order...whoa...I’m like so high..��
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:45:10
*Grabs popcorn* This should be interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:32:02
How anyone can follow this ass is amazing. A coin with one developer and a million shill accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:44:30
Multiple times. Although I think it’s been a few months, he might be more bullish now, haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:13:11
As crazy as it that may sound, most can at least agree a centralized digital currency will shift a LOT more power into even fewer hands.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:05:30
I would’ve been impressed if it was spelled correctly. ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:34:53
I like this, maybe I just want people not to attack each other. Everything else is alright. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:58:22
We will find out who he was, but he will never sign another message.

That’s actually an awesome gift. Love the style. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:21:35
Looks possible...
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:59:06
Thanks for the link, I wanted to look into this!
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:47:00
Yeah, it sounds like karma whoring. I dont care, I'm upvoting all fuck Cbase posts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:42:47
Can you escalate a ticket so you jump ahead 20-30 people? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:36:41
Yeah, it was like 5k in October. Time is moving too fast.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:54
I did! ����
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:51:54
Yeah, don’t cloud mine. You could POSSIBLY make money after about year, but this space isn’t slow like that. Just buy and you’ll make way more money. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:42
We can’t stop every 1k, more like 5k now...
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:11:30
It’s just as easy with paper wallet recovery, you just have to trust the device that’s signing the keys. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:31:52
Testnet transactions are already taking place. If you use a segwit wallet, the fee is already less than $1.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:49:21
Coordinated attack’s on multiple fronts. But that’s what bitcoin has always endured. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:41:18
Hardly a crash for veterans. Weak ass hands moving to coins with no development and all hype. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:36:46
This man made me wet, and I’m a dude. 
I might see a doctor tmw. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:38:55

Cool, too bad the freezing will damage his brain tissue?!?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:24:58
Now we need a decentralized FB killer app. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:52:23
Have they release BTrash yet?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:58
Same to vitalik, and probably same to satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:29:39
Ya’ll ready for this?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:16:46
Oh good, let’s clear this up. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:57:32
I didn’t need a reason to delete it, but you gave me one. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:25:48
They just added support. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:55:10
Not gonna be accurate, but I’ll watch to give them numbers and show btc’s following. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:26:47
At this point, bitcoin needs to get companies on board with scaling, I mean WTF COINBASE?!&gt;!&gt;!&gt;!?!?!??
I'd like to see bitcoin progress and not be held back, but money is talking right now... :(
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:32:30
They are centralized AF and run by banks. Why do they use blockchain? Just use a SQL database. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:35:02
Are you retarded?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:45
Are they going to allow fiat on ramp? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:10:41
Hey, libertarians brought me here, I’m all for it
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:59:36
Cool, there will be multiple forks before next feb. people are going to need tools to verify and split coins. Good work! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:43:43
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:34:24
I tried to get on for upvote party and it was crashed. ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:46
And back down, but obv going 20k before New Years. I can’t bring myself to sell my ltc or vtc, possibly because atomic swaps. But what sucks is I can’t dump eth with its kitty network spam. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:48:16
I think 600k is very possible, But other coins will give better ROI. But most of those will fall and be a gamble. apple and penny stocks, either way fiat valoue is declining. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:38:38
They are spamming 5-6 sat transactions and only mining them. You can get a transaction through for almost nothing if you notice what fee they currently mine. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:10
I agree, I bought this morning at 13k, I think that may be our found floor. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:14:38
You kicked my butt into gear man. I’m almost completely into my segwit address. I’m just going about business as usual, but receiving on segwit address and sending from legacy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:47
Going to Gemini with my favorite twins! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:43:54
There are transaction accelerators that can replace the fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:52:11
Honestly, probably gonna hit 14.5 again, maybe lower. When the US wakes up they tend to sell if there’s a pump in the night. But there are a TON of new people coming in from the holidays. Everything will be way up in March.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:46:15
Regulation is a bad thing for btc. Good thing btc operates outside of regulation. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:26:12
First time I’ve seen this meme used in the right context! Fuck ya! Battle harden! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:57:11
Yeah, lol. At least I get the day off tomorrow to catch up on my news. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:32:46
Scaling gracefully
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:05:52
I say wait for fees to go down, but as long as I know the fee up front I’m cool with the third party doing it. I’m not gonna wait to withdraw from polo, haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:47
We’re here. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:28:10
Sheet, why not. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:01:36
Merry Christmas friend! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:38
The fact that it’s still holding and even gaining dominance is bullish AF. I’m starting to siphon my alts back to btc, it’s about to get intense. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:38:43
Oh god, how pissed everyone was trying to sell yesterday at Cbase's BS price...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:40
I used ledger s. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:39
Flip flop the money and shake weak hands. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:58:53
Guys guys, these nerds don’t know about cars. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:52:34
What sucks is when you have half a btc, but half a btc in alts. And you’re not sure if you want to be a 1 coiner, or a dozen coiner of litecoin or something. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:49:30
NOONE said they were thc vapes! I mean yeah, why vape if you don’t get high, BUT that’s not the point! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:24
Couldn’t buy! Damn, such sweet sale. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:47:27
If you have a ledger receive funds into segwit and send from legacy! I’m in the process of this now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:42
Gemini is the winklevii joint right? I’m going there. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:53:10
Lmao, I wondered if they’d put a price point. That alone will set ppl off to buy I bet, haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:01:47
Upvote! Awesome Go CoinGate! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:34
Hohoho! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:02:52
Actually yes, at least a few times a day for a few wells I would guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:38:18
Idk about PayPay 2.0. I’m hopeful for the people to win. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:37:50
I wouldn’t spam them, it only hurts the other people trying to get help.
At the same time, I’ve never gotten anything other than an automated email response. They’ll ask multiple times for the same information that you’ve just provided, and when you provide it takes weeks for a real person to see it. 
Coinbase is fast and easy, but they are too big right now and can’t handle customer service. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:21:34
I can’t think of another one, haha 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:33:42
Ya, hard run, dip in Jan. Then onward and upward 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:47:30
Maybe post txt info and someone could help. But you don’t have it, do you? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:00:30
Working, lol 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:56:47
Final balance:0 
They have been withdrawn. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:51:21
Greed is taking over. People forget the point of bitcoin and are investing in things like ripple, BLEH. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:30:56
You guys are buying right now huh? Awesome! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:38:19
BitKorn The Band ICO
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:57
Only heard great things, I might give them a shot since Gemini is struggling to signup all the Cbase users.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:23:55
Right? I realized this w3eek it didn't jump 1K and I thought, "oh, it's dipping".
Then I look at 9 days ago and realize we're still going vertical, haha.
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:19:27
*Update* Got some gas and a beer after work. 
Totally instant transaction and bought while BTC was on a month peak!
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:58:24
I can’t tell you how important it is to backup and recover before using the device. Luckily I’ve never miswritten a word or anything. But if you ever need to recover, you won’t be freaking out about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:55:19
I do too, I actually was thinking. It’s a lot like getting on a poker table. Your value fluctuates. But you can get out on high if you’re good.the only thing is, It’s hard to tell when the game will end, and new fish always bring fresh money, 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:56:54
Lol, I think between now and maybe Jan 8 is a good time to take some profit. Just my opinion, I am very biased too. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:58:28
I just like to have some BTC as part of my general portfolio. It's nice to know if an emergency comes up I can get my cash instantly. I simply use it if I need fast cash for an unforeseen circumstance.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:10
!remind me 3 days
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:26:10
I used to tell people about half my holdings. Now it’s worth too much, lol. Told the GF we don’t let anyone else in on our investments. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:19:29
Actually looks like they find some after hearing price news and promptly sell them like retards. Dumbass astrophysicists. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:15:03
Are people actually meme'd out? no way
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:55
You can’t buy yet, you accidentally bought btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:31:02
Straight up Black Mirror.
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:09:47
I believe I ordered it Friday Nov the 20th and got it Dec 4th. So 10 business days I guess. I also sent them extra verification the day I applied so that could cause delays if they were busy. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:03:24
Nah he bought at 10k remember. He good. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:25:43
Just have to say, WOW. I didn't think BTC would come so far so fast. I decided to try my shift card, and now after knowing I can use my BTC so easily I'm tempted to do most of my daily shopping in BTC. 
The shift card is really convenient especially if you happen to run low on money and need essentials. I can now dip into my reserve coins easily if I am in need of fast cash. 
Also, I thought the transaction might take a while but it was immediately  present on the shiftcard app and my coinbase account. 
Best of all? I took coins that were at a month peak in value and spent them valued high, instantly, and locally. God Damn, it's happening. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:58:40
It's nice to know if an emergency comes up I can get my cash instantly. I simply use it if I need fast cash for an unforeseen circumstance.

@_date: 2017-12-25 06:58:33
Oh yeah, I just got Twitter and saw this live. Someone asked for the video and he posted it minutes later, def not enough time to fake unless he thought of everything. Which is possible but unlikely.

Thanks for the tip! I'm super bummed I don't have my old dogecoin account because I had a lot of crypto tip bots setup, lol. About to update with first use results! I'll be tipping on here once I get setup as well! :D

Best thing about adoption of BTC is now you can use a debit card that is payed for in Btc. Or make a BTC payment that gets charged to your card. Integration makes BTC strong and stable. :D
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:14:05
Wasn’t it a few days ago we celebrated 35%? Incredible. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:02:25
I think the fees are wavered at this point. Probably kick in next year. I had to pay $10 for the card, but so far havn't seen any fees and BTC has gone up! Also, CoinBase actually appraises Btc higher than a lot of exchanges do, so I think you get a great value for your coin. I'm in the speculative/investor section just watching the headlines with some popcorn. :D
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:30:32

It's essentially a paper wallet recovery and hardware wallet for use. At least that's how I see it. Keep the recovery phrases in a safety deposit box, or bury them at certain coordinates in the desert, lol. If you need to spend you'll be safe from keyloggers and viruses. To be fair though, I trust my paper wallets that were generated from an air gapped computer more than anything. It all depends on your technical knowledge and if you're looking for cold/hot storage. I couldn't wrap my head around a lot of it until over a year in. So if your new, and you have some value invested, go with the safest easiest method of storage.

Bitcoin Cash Update 8/8/17
Modified on: Tue, Aug 8, 2017 at 8:24 AM
Here is an announcement about Bitcoin Cash support: HTTPS://WWW.KEEPKEY.COM/2017/07/31/BITCOIN-CASH-KEEPKEY/
We are currently working as quickly as possible on step number  
If the BCH network appears viable, we will, as quickly as possible, update our beta release to display your BCH balance for each BTC account. At this point, you won’t be able to send BCH transactions, but you will have the assurance that the BCH you get is protected by your KeepKey.
All of your BCH is safe will be able to available once the beta release is published.
The Bitcoin Cash fork implementation has been rushed. KeepKey wants to ensure that your funds are appropriately secured and are taking extra precautions. 
We are doing what we can to make sure the Bitcoin Cash addition to KeepKey software is reliable and works well.  
Thank you for your patience and understanding.

I bought the day before and got paid today, haha

But still a very easy 10x over 2 years I think. It’s perhaps the most solid investment.

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:52:45
7k will break HARD. I’m scared, I’m actually hoping for a drop to 5k again. Once we hit 20k we’ll be off to the races...

For real, we can reach 2 trillion total cap easy, let’s say btc remains 50% dominant...50k per coin is a good conservative top. I’m guessing it can get close to 100k, if it keeps developing, who knows.

Zoom out, we have been steady rising all year. We can still move 5-10% in the short term but that long is so nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:49:27
10% less a
Month. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:26:48
Sure, but USD is probably crashed by then.

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:46:36
I know this comment will be lost to all but the OP and maybe one other person, but look at this chart. It actually is a great representation of our physiological barriers. Bitcoin will hit and continue to hit these goals.
One night I’ll be drinking(like I am tonight), and I’ll think about how bitcoin was under 10k? For so long, and people still didn’t get in, I can’t wait to see so many people prosper from their own personal investments. 
Love you community. 
The btc reddit community as well as the nbc show. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:00:53
My last buy was slightly above that. We will see sub 6k maybe, but once the valves are open, they won’t close...
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:44:50
Being priced in right now!!! 9k this weekend guys! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:29:47
Yeah, if you are hurting for the money, take some out. You don’t have to sell it all. I’ve had to sell some to pay bills. If it drops you’ve made a good call, if you pay your bills and your investment recovers what you’ve spent, then you’re also golden. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:19:37

I don’t like additional passwords, that’s how I lost 10k dogecoin, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:11:38
I couldn’t cohere that, but always keep a stake and realize the math. These coins are highly valued and only 1 in 4 people in the continental United States could probably get a coin before there are No More. And like a priceless piece of art, btc becomes a universal form of value with it’s limited supply. 
Idk, I’m posting a lot tonight because of wine. But guess what. Be a conservative investor in this space, and you’ll make gains 10X a wall street investor. Kids and crypto are king now.

I remember we passed the point where we earned a dollar a day accumulated in value for every day that btc has existed. 
Someone commented, “What about a dollar for every block?”
Im prepared, I’ll sell 15% to pay off all my debts and use the remaining value to invest in different ways.

I respect your opinion, but I think btc is driving the bus. It’s going 10x whether is drops 60% multiple times, or it’s a straight march. I’m diversified in strong coins though. I think you’re gonna be well off investing in most stuff over the next 6-12 months, haha. But you. Might want to come back to a core 3-5 coins that you can sleep at night knowing you’re way up on.

Smart if true. I knew it would dump, but I didn’t think we’d see under 10k. Either way, I put my shit in cold storage. The pump at the end of next year will make this market mature, and the hodlers even more wealthy. 
You can try to time and trade the market. But in the end, you’re gonna want a ticket on the gravy train. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:06:58
I agree, redditor for 5 weeks. ��
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:34:18
Bitcoin is the trust layer. It will take lots of broken trust for people to realize it. Even veterans of the financial collapses of the world, 
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:18:26
5 weeks and -100 karma. Lmao. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:46:17
Well if no one is running the network, My buy wont transfer over. In which case I’ll have to mine transactions. 
My only point is, it will always be profitable for someone to mine. Especially since a lot of excess power is going to run miners, instead of being wasted on nothing.

Lmao, how many time will I read this headline in my lifetime I wonder? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:03:22
Very true, and good advice. I’ll have to check out that read! 
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:09:44
Show me the carved QR code on the back and you got a .1btc from me. XD
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:24:06
Lmfao, no I’ll mine. I’ll take the btc. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:40:43
Oh ok, that’s why we can post about it now, lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:45:49
Agreed, Bitcoin is not owned by anyone. But being purposefully confusing in order to make money from ignorance is basically scamming. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:11:19
Lopp.org will make you a genius, or feel retarded 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:14:03

But of course! 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:43:27
Come on, no one is working on a reddit or Twitter tip bot?!? I WANNA TUO SATOSHI’s! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:24:20
It is truly fraud in every interpretation. I can’t tell you I’m selling you Bitcoin and then send Dogecoin because I’m stupid enough to think Doge is the real Bitcoin... ��
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:38:18
Just so you know, it cost on avg. over 5k to mine 1 BTC. So miners can’t sell below that, lest they loose money. 
Plus the fact that difficulty continues to increase, even with this price action...
I’ll take 5 hits of acid and ride the biggest six flags coaster 5 times if it hits 4K. Just to celebrate my cheap BTC buys! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:40:22
Ok, upvotes for the vid. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:46:35
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:06:03
Anyone else remember waiting on LN for ages?!? It’s so easy to forget. But it’s here my brothers. If you believe in BTC, then you should be stoked to have these buying opportunities! The network is growing and strengthening every singe day. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:23:58
Imagine how far the tech is now.��
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:32:37
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:36:18
I would, lol.
And not just because difficulty adjustment would make it profitable. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:54:39
Good job OP. Let’s get the hype train on the track. ��
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:29:09
It's flirting hard, it's above 1490, around 1496 whenever I check. Here comes 2k!!
@_date: 2015-11-28 01:29:37
Sorry, haven't used Reddit since my Dogecoin days, and thought I'd be able to post a description...
I sent Shift an email saying that not only was the balance not updating according to the btc/usd rate, but the balance had not updated after withdrawing and depositing btc into coinbase. 
They never e-mailed me back but now the balance is updating in real time according to the exchange rate. I'm still keeping my cold storage offline, but it's nice to know that if I get in a financial pinch, I can quickly and easily use my BTC to pay for essentials in every day life. I think it's awesome, despite some people's reservations. Anything moving BTC forward gets support from me! 
Party on Bitcoiners!
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:35:29
It'll trade at that in the US in the next week. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:44:40
Why I didn’t see this until now is beyond me. Astounding, I’ve been looking for ways to spend SATOSHI’s on LN. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:01:16
First up eBay...how fitting. :) 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:51:26
Time to go through the lot and upvote EVERY SINGLE DAMN VEGETA MEME in the bunch! I’ll never not love BTC over 9k! 
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:26:24
Shipping and handling included? .100001 big from me. ��

Awesome! Got 420 fest merch but couldn’t actually go. N. Ga has some libertarian types.

That just what you want us to think��
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:53:12
Bazinga! 
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:01:07
Can't get into my old dogecoin reddit account. Made a new one to upvote and comment. I'm connecting my coinbase now and I think this is freaking amazing. But, I'm following the buy low, spend high rule I set for myself. So I'll have to get more Bitcoin and hope it goes up! I want to see bitcoin surpass all fiat!
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:45:12
Very true, maybe I have it backwards. But I feel like people who acquired low are gonna let their winners ride. 
Noobs who bought at the end of the year either sold already, or now are at the point of hodling. 
Now some BS like MtGox coins being sold at market price can always fudge stuff up...
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:42:01
XD You know you love cumming.  ��
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:09:23
Don't be a pinko, support the free market. ��

Wow, thanks for the info. I'll look into this further tonight. I like to have as much info as possible so thank you.

Redditor for 5 weeks, realize Millennials buy BTC and also watch awesome anime shows. Just be glad it’s not some Fortnite reference you’ll never comprehend.  
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:02:59
Upvotong again for awareness,
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:57:13
I would really love to take a vacation next summer, and only pay btc. That's my short term goal. I know it's been done but how easy is it to spend outside the US? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:38:56
Good on you! Congrats! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:09:18
Tasty tasty crash coin! 
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:23:53
Can you enlighten me? How did ltc 'succumb' to miner threats? I though miners signaled segwit and succeeded where bitcoin couldn't? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:02:53
Time to go home from work and celebrate!!!
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:34:05
Up up up 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:55:03
Agreed, but this is a good meme, haha. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:04:14
Because bitcoin popped. It’d be hard to call it a bubble now. 
Bonds &amp; stocks are on a run that seems very bubbling. Lol 
Not to mention USD steady dropping, which hopefully helps the world economy realize alternatives, so the dollar decline doesn’t crash everything. Including crypto.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:36:08
Jinx it to under 1600 why don't you! �� jk, we all know 2k is here in the next 2 months. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:47:50
I'd say by 2025, if it survives. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:26:55
At least they won't get infected and have to pay ransomware, haha. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:40:02
Shouldn’t this be marked obscene and removed? At least I was went I posted about this...
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:53:19
Tomorrow I'll legislate 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:33:44
Now this is nice. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:30:12
I would play just to get a few thousand bits here or there, the problem is every single location is already claimed and the app doesn't update I guess. There's no limit to the distance so one person or a team can get most of the coins right as they appear. 
Add this to pokemon go and then we're talking.
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:18:29
Haha, can't I just be happy I made $5?
@_date: 2016-07-09 01:28:50
Cause remember he had all his money in gold? Remember it's buried? Remember the accountant? I miss that show...

I withdrew eth to eth address on polo and also received etc. Of course, I bought from coinbase so I didn't attack. I bought more eth after seeing this and transferred the next morning. It just came through with eth no etc. I think they saw the tweets and stopped that shit pretty fast. haha
@_date: 2016-07-27 14:41:24
Just so you're aware many people including myself have verified coinbase sending split coins.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:32:10
