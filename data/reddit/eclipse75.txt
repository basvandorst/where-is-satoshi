Yeah, if you're disconnected from the Internet.

You make it sound as though Linux and OSX have no security vulnerabilities.. A lot of security depends on the user.

yeah, well that's not ease of use and normal users won't know or go through all that trouble.

hey folks. one sector you should try promoting in is online poker. we've been pretty screwed since the doj regulation of online poker. bitcoins seems like a good solution if the value were more stable. me, i just want somewhere to play online poker at for money but no one plays bitcoin poker :(

Damnit, I keep hearing that. If someone is ignorant, that doesn't mean they deserve something like that! And no, Linux is not as easy as 1, 2, 3. I've used it for servers and personal use. I'm using Ubuntu right now on my laptop. Using Linux is not a easy walk in the park. I've always had to use the terminal at one time or another. And not everything works well with Linux. Most normal people just want to do what they need to do. Sure if you have a lot of money invested in Bitcoin, I can see a person more focused on taking extra precautions. Any time someone wants to make a transaction they should load up their Bitcoin cd? Bitcoin would never take off into mainstream if that's what it takes to keep your money safe. If you have your Bitcoin money stolen, you have no one coming to your rescue. If your bank account with Regions or where ever gets hacked, you'll get reimbursed. You need a simple and safe method of making Bitcoin transactions. To load up a LiveCD it also takes a few minutes of downtime just to even switch to the operating system and then it has to read slowly off of the CD. What you have explained would never experience wide use, only possibly for large sums of money.
