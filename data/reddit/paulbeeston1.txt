I have just received my funds today. After politely asking again and due to the rise in price of bitcoin, Bittrex agreed to send my missing funds to my account and it took less than two weeks to arrive. Thank You Bittrex!

This was the final response I received from Bittrex...

I sent BTC from one exchange to a Bittrex BCC address thinking I actually was transferring BCC. Obviously they hold the private key but the customer support guy told me my loss is not great enough to be considered for retrieval. There is no doubt that they will extract it and keep it for themselves.

I wasn't exactly betting on anything, I was holding my BTC and after the hardfork, there was BCC was added to my account and I tried sending the BCC from my quadrigacx account to my Bittrex account but instead I sent BTC to a BCC address.
