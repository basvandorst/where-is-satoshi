The "I'm not interested in actually using bitcoin" case.


No. It's fucking broad. The two sets are identical. If you "can't be arsed" to GPG, you aren't in bitcoin, like it or not.


You give shit-flavored advice of the "taught controversy" variety straight from the USG spamtr0nics playb00k. "Oh I don't do drugs therefor I don't need to be secure." "[Only a terrorist]( would need to check signatures!" "But if you're gonna check signatures, check Tails and Tor and other USG-approved snakeoil."

There is no way to stop non-financial data from being stored in the blockchain; OP_RETURN is a place to put data in such a way that it can be safely discarded by nodes that only want to keep bitcoin transaction data. It is preferable to create a place where non-bitcoin data should go, rather than having it stored inappropriately in places meant for other types of data.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:20:30
"The key to all these things is buy and hold for the next 5 yrs."
Right; that's the key with Bitcoin, because Bitcoin has halving block rewards every 4 years. Dogecoin, on the other hand, has a fixed block reward forever. So it appears, the "key" is to trick some "shibe" into loaning you his Dogecoin, sell it all, wait any amount of time (the price will probably go down over any time-span), then buy back what you owe from the loan. The result? You'll have BTC profit and none of those silly meme-coins.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:53:47
7 transactions per second is nothing; Bitcoin needs to do 10,000 per second to be competitive with Visa. These "meta-coins" add useful functionality to Bitcoin; I believe the market will choose a different blockchain if this hard stance is maintained. These transactions are going to happen; the data might as well have an appropriate place to go.

Voting is done by miners. If you want a vote, you need to get some hashing power, and elect a representative (pool operator).
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:41:14
It's not safe to use alternate blockchains; large mining pools can be used to disrupt competing chains. All these issues ultimately get sorted out by the miners; they have total say over what gets recorded in the history book. If you want to influence Bitcoin, you need to petition the pool operators. If there is an operator who promotes bad politics, you should stop mining in their pool.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:07:27
Not all transactions have the extra 40 bytes; only ones utilizing the OP_RETURN feature.
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:27:19
If counterparty was able  to use OP_RETURN, you could discard their data while still running a full node. Since the Bitcoin core devs spitefully reduced the size of OP_RETURN, counterparty has to keep using methods that you cannot safely discard while still running a full node.
@_date: 2014-09-20 03:58:34
Your point being.. ?
That's like me criticizing bitcoin because 99% of it's trade volume is for itself (day trading it for various forms of fiat) -- don't think for a second that all those merchant adoptions actually amount to anything significant yet. And I'm not making that criticism, even though it's completely true. My point is: so what? Things have to happen at the proper times. A new currency starts off with speculative trading. A stock exchange for that new currency should also start off with speculative trading. Do you think you know what a bitcoin denominated stock exchange should be worth? Put some skin in the game; MPEx allows for shorting. That's the primary focus right now; it isn't some half-baked "decentralize the world" testing ground. A hypocrite apologizes for bitcoin by citing its brevity, but acts as though it were already mainstream.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:17:28
Proposals and votes are all superficial; ultimately the miners get to decide what is Bitcoin. Core features are decided by the hashing power; it doesn't matter what is in a new version if the majority of the miners don't upgrade.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:00:33
Nobody has to store it if OP_RETURN is used; nodes can safely prune this data.
By restricting the size of OP_RETURN, this "unwanted data" has been pushed into the wrong places where nodes cannot safely prune it out.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:25:11
If the 40 bytes in OP_RETURN aren't enough, data can be stored in the form of fake addresses in a multisignature transaction. These fake addresses have to be kept in memory in case they get referenced by a future transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:21:46
The holders of large amounts of bitcoin have a finite amount, unlike the traditional financial institutions which have a practically limitless ability to inject liquidity into the market. There will always be "unequal wealth distribution." At least with bitcoin, you can be your own bank, and have a greater degree of certainty as to what the supply will be at any given point in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:21:07
A merge-mined altcoin is not secure, as proven by Luke-Jr when he used his mining pool to perform a 51% attack on CoiledCoin.
OP_RETURN is not bloat; it can be pruned.
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:10:37
MPEx is a bitcoin-denominated stock exchange. If you've heard of Havelock: it's like that, only it isn't pointless. Erik Voorhees listed SatoshiDice on MPEx, before it was sold to a "private party." 
By "seat," I mean the ability to trade on the exchange. There are no accounts; trades are executed in the form of PGP signed messages, and it costs 30 bitcoin to get your key registered with the trading engine; right now, that's a bargain (compare to the registration fee for the NYSE).
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:33:45
That's nearly enough for an MPEx seat (more than enough if you split the referral bonus with a preexisting member).

This wouldn't prove anything in his story. Someone with greater than 143 BTC can structure their funds in addresses so as to appear to corroborate this story.

There is no such thing in USG-land. Every bank is "too big to fail." It would never come down to FDIC. More money can always be printed.


Well that is the exact future bitcoin is here to cause.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:23:27
Actually, the network is handling transactions just fine. Users who include a decent fee are getting their transactions included, no problem. It still costs less than a dollar to send any amount of money to any person in the world; incredible, I know!

Because bitcoin is working fine, contrary to how [some scammers]( would have you believe.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:21:23
I said **safe** way. FDIC depends on the solvency of USG; it's pretty much guaranteed to fail in the exact scenario it is intended to help. The other guy had a pretty good answer with "home defense," although I'm not sure if that route requires less expertise than a properly secured bitcoin address.

Who even cares over 17 bitcoin? That's obviously not the issue. It's less than a block reward. The point is the colluding miners don't like  properties and they got cocky.

Bitcoin is valuable as a currency **because** it is the best payment system. And it isn't the best payment system for being fast or easy to use or anything like that; it's the best because it it cannot be counterfeited and it cannot discriminate.

The nonce is the correct value for the block because the miner's address is part of the hashed data. If you were to replace with your own address, the nonce value would no longer work.

So BitBet should have instead never made their customers whole who placed winning wagers on this bet? It's not clear that the original, valid and signed, transaction would ever be confirmed, and attempts to double spend the inputs were similarly blocked from confirmation. There was no mistake made. By spending different inputs to the same set of outputs, Mircea taunted the colluding miners to show their hand, and they bit. They took the bait over a paltry 17 coins, which to you may be 34 coins more than your net worth, but in actuality is barely worth the mention. For example, the average MPEx trade is about 5 coins shy of this number. Mega-snore.
You should be [getting your ass in  registering your GPG key, and humbling yourself before the [Lords of Bitcoin]( thanking Mircea in particular for this service his has done for you, free of charge.

Apples are a commodity. I don't buy apples because I "hope they will go up in value." I buy them because I want to eat them. Conversely, bitcoin is not a commodity. I **do** buy bitcoin because I hope it will go up in value. I don't buy them so that I can immediately spend them. Do you recognize the difference? The price is **not** irrelevant; it's everything. The whole point of bitcoin is to be money, and [I'm tired of hearing people say otherwise](

And it's a little misleading to say that you can earn bitcoin by playing; it's more like you have to pay to play. Yes, you can play for free and never deposit anything, but it'll take you more than a lifetime to accomplish anything substantial. It can be profitable to players who can correctly predict which items are undervalued -- the kind of buy-low-sell-high tactic employed throughout all human interaction. It's the most capitalist game that ever has been and I can't get enough of it. I recently placed the winning bid of 0.1265 bitcoin in [an auction]( to buy a new skill and its associated items.
