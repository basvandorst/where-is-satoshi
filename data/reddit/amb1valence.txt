I'm pretty sure some of the finished code for LN got polished up on some github a week or 2 ago, and BCH does introduce some real scalability/centralization problems completely aside from the stupid politics involved.
But I agree, for actual use right now, I don't see a huge problem with using BCH as a medium of everyday currency.

That is interesting to hear dude.
I gotta say this though, one thing stuck out to me reading all that. You’re pegging some of your happiness on your money, whether how guilty you feel for having it (or whatever), or how good you feel giving it away. 
I just want to say your luck/mental health are independent of that. With the car window, it didn’t matter if in another multiverse you were poor, or otherwise just didn’t roll down your car window to give to the homeless guy; it likely would’ve broken anyway once you got to your destination and rolled it down to get some air or something. And then you’d blame not giving to the homeless guy, or being poor, or some other unrelated factor. 
I know you know this. And again it’s great that you’re willing to do those things for people, really. But I’m just saying. You can mentally separate health &amp; happiness from anything financially related. Kind of an r/meditation type of thing that hit me while reading your post.

Totally agree, which is why I’m so excited again lately because of one word.

Idk if you’ve noticed m8 but they changed their fee structure in April and it’s fucked up down and sideways now. 1% maker and taker if you trade less than 10 BTC volume/month. And you have to eat those fees on the way up to that 10BTC limit too, if you even wanted to try for it

This and nothing but this. 
Sentiment does NOT reflect price, or vice versa.
The chart reflects price reflects the chart reflects price.....the chart is all there is and all you really need.

Pleb. As long as you are bearish because of the obvious bullbait, I am buying.
That said, if this makes you buy, then I am flipping in that case as well.

No way. I’m a living example of the guy in the OP’s picture. Before crypto I didn’t know how the stock market worked, no clue what gold was even for - absolutely 0 interest in anything financial, all I knew was get a good job, go to work and save up as much as possible, spend as frugally as you can. Crypto then seized me by the balls and plunged me deep into a rabbit hole that I’m extremely thankful to have been thrust into.
Oh and yeah I’m poor but it was an amazing learning experience. R-right guys ��
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:38:58
Agreed. This is almost definitely the case most of the time. OP’s logic is extremely simplified and doesn’t take into account that whales are, uh, gonna do whale things, which is manipulate the market a bit. Wouldn’t you if you knew you could?
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:12:44
Why does that make a difference?
I don’t keep all my holdings in monero, but if I were to convert all my crypto assets into monero right now I’d instantly become an economic black box to the eyes of any government. 
If EVERYONE did that (and there’s several good reasons to justify XMR or a similar coin eventually becoming the de facto daily use cryptocurrency), the entire crypto market would literally be an invisible formless blob from the point of view of govt’s, legally speaking. It’d be theoretically perfectly usable as a traditional currency, transactions come &amp; go constantly, but all you know about it is that right  there - that it exists, and practically nothing more. 
I’m not sure about you but if that’s not a governing body’s worst nightmare then idk what is. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:57:18
What is a monero??/ 
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:38:56
Well sure dude not right now, but I still think you're totally missing the grander idea here. When it comes to disruptive technologies like blockchain, you can't use the general population of normies and old people, as a metric to answer the question of whether or not cryptocurrencies will really take off. If you look at it that way, and considering the current state of the market, of COURSE it sounds ridiculous. Jamie Dimon would be right, there is currently no compelling reason for Joe Blow to dump his 401k into magic internet money.
You have to use your imagination here. While bitcoin et al., at the present moment, are admittedly not much more than prototypes of an anarchist's overly ambitious and far-fetched wet dream, it's that unassuming yet irrevocably massive *potential* that should make you pay attention.
And don't get me wrong, I knew about bitcoin and some of the ideas behind it as far back as like 2013, but never cared, except for the amusing utility of buying drugs through the mail. It wasn't until the middle of this year that the market completely took off and I took notice, started reading about altcoins and the crazy proof-of-concepts that evolved from the humble meme/joke that was once only bitcoin itself, and I finally got it. Here was a fledgling ecosystem of hundreds of unique coins that each had their own attributes and could be traded as such, like pokemon.
This all right now is utterly out of the cognitive reach of the vast majority of people, as most wouldn't even be able to tell you what ethereum is if asked, so I don't blame you for being a skeptic. But look at the origins of the internet and the way it's completely changed everything around the turn of the century, and tell me you don't think crypto has at least the raw potential to be all that over again, and beyond.

Thanks for this, I was wondering same thing as the OP and totally didn't realize that my XLM are basically the same thing as Ripple.
Too bad it's not on Binance though
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:19:55
Again, why? I’m genuinely curious if you have a good reason to think this or are just not seeing the bigger picture.

@_date: 2017-09-02 05:00:20
It kinda does. I’ve noticed any amount above $100 or so up to $201 has the same $2.99 fee. Above that it increases percentage-wise, but for someone like me who buys small amounts (under $200) it kinda sucks. The wait just for that small amount to arrive at my wallet so I can shapeshift.io it into another alt makes it all the more annoying too. 
I just signed up for Gemini today, got verified without any utility bills for address verification or anything (just a picture of license) and haven’t bought yet but I think their fees are significantly less and without an almost-week-long wait. I think coinbase is behind me now
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:49:03
Ok :))))))))))
I’m not trying to shill monero either btw. When I said I don’t have all my holdings in it I actually meant I don’t have any. BUT the idea is incredibly important, for the future of crypto as a whole, not to mention just really freakin cool
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:43:27
In addition to XRP and XLM which were already mentioned, I don't see IOTA on here anywhere. Their transactions are ACTUALLY instant (due to the fact that for miners to transact, they must verify 2 other, previous transactions on the network, making the tangle network literally instantaneous).
