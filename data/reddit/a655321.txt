This irritates me just reading it. Definitely avoid this scam site.

They never informed him of this, the fact that it is hidden in their terms (the title does not clearly represent the contents) is quite shady. If they offered this in the first place, I would be understanding, however they purposefully did not do so.

So you don't consider holding people's money hostage until they submit documents a scam? Unbelievable. Even if this hasn't happened to you personally, the fact that they would dare even doing so is an excellent reason to avoid the site.

I like your way of thinking

They could very well let you know what documents you require before you give them money, instead of after. I'm not sure how that is so hard to comprehend.

I honestly expect nothing less from Circle. There is a reason that the other alternatives are more popular.

How does it feel to be wrong?
