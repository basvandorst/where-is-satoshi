it's an asset bubble...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:39
because more and more people buy it because they think the price will keep going up.

The fact that dollars facilitate a fuck ton of exchange...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:08
Yes, you can get something like a 0.00000001 bitcoin

If a lot of people started selling then in principle it could drop a hell of a lot in a very short time given that it takes basically no time to actually effect the transaction and for the price to change.

Why is the price rising rapidly (10 fold in a year)?
Is it because bitcoin has become more useful to people or is it because people are buying it because it's increasing in value?
It's already a bubble.

The market cap of cryptocurrency has very little to do with how much value people derive from actually using cryptocurrency to facilitate exchange. 
The price of bitcoin didn't rise tenfold to be 100 times (at least) higher than equally useful cryptocurrencies because it's so much better or more useful in facilitating exchange. It's risen in price because people want to buy it because they believe it will continue to rise in price.

So people are buying an asset to hold based on a return that is accrued solely because other people are buying the asset to do the same thing...You realize that's the textbook definition of an asset bubble, right?

All the people who believe the price will continue to rise.

The vast majority of its value comes from people wanting to buy bitcoin because it's increasing in value.
It's exactly as sustainable as it sounds.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:03:46
That's 100% what's happening...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:37:17
Bitcoin has value in that it can cheaply facilitate exchange without the need for a middleman. I can very relatively easily buy something from someone in another country and, if I so wish, do so anonymously. To an extent, people will buy bitcoin to use it to facilitate exchange.
However, as I said, the vast majority of its value comes from more and more people wanting to buy it because they've seen how much it's increased in value.

People buy gold as an asset because its price *doesn't* tend to change much.
No one buys gold to earn returns based on other people rushing to buy gold, so no, gold isn't a bubble...

Don't let actual economics get in the way of "the fed exists to fuck people over" conspiracy theories
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:42:47
Well, that's what happens when an irresponsible government without an independent central bank managing monetary policy decides "man I don't want to pay my debts and don't really give a shit about fucking over the general population."
As an argument against central banks it doesn't really make sense. Like, if someone hit himself in the face with a hammer it wouldn't be a good argument against the existence of hammers.

The 1930's were just a theoretical possibility?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:58:56
Uh, the value of bitcoin consists entirely of the expectations of future price increases (aka it's an asset bubble).
Also, it was most definitely *not* created to be an investment product. If you make money cashing out at the right time, hey, good for you. That doesn't make deflation a good thing for a currency nor does it make Bitcoin a smart longterm investment.

A general and consistent decrease in the nominal price of goods leads to people deferring spending and investment in favor of just sitting on cash.
The decreasing prices of goods along with the decline in spending leads firms to reduce output and cut their workforce. The increased unemployment results in yet lower spending and output.
Real prices of goods still fall as a result of technological advancement etc. even with inflation (something this picture doesn't capture).
