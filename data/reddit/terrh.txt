Do a whois on the domain.  Probably a waste of time,  but you might get lucky. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:22:34
Yeah, because it's so easy to trade BTC with them offline!
oh wait, no it isn't.

You realize this is false right?
It's still a great idea to reset after purchase, but this is no guarantee of safety.  The firmware could still be compromised.

Several transactions in that block were zero fees.  What's 20 times zero?  
Did you even click the link?
I don't even give a shit about bitcoin cash (or bitcoin for that matter) but at least try to use facts to support yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:18:27
It was stable at $500 a coin...
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:11:01
the 2014 peak was difficult to sell things off at... mostly because it didn't last long, and then slid pretty far quickly and looked like it would likely recover but then never did.
I could have sold in 2014, but sold very little then because of this.
It's definitely wise to sell whenever it's at or near the ATH, but at the same time, people will always regret selling something when the value triples or more later on.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:30
Hey kraken, fix my problems!
It double issued a sell order and sold 200 LTC that I did not want sold.  My balance didn't reflect this (no page loads, no proper balance anywhere) until the transaction had been completed for a long time, so I had no way to know it had happened until the next day.  I submitted a support ticket right away but it's been several days and no response now.   I want my coins back! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:12:15
So every 10 minutes when there's a new block and more new BTC are added to the total, how is that not inflating the number of BTC in existence?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:43:30
... but you totally can still buy it.
There's no way you've done everything interesting.  You've probably done a lot of cool stuff but there's still so much more cool stuff left to do.
Have you ever had a boat?  An airplane?  Restored a 1930's car?   Learned how to fly, or how to race cars?
And that's just transportation - there's a million other different fields of interesting things to do.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:10:43
But if this is a financial system there needs to be financial incentives.
Nobody would mine if they didn't make money mining.  Why should anyone be a node?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:27:15
you mean like the freedom to move my coins for less than half of what each wallet address is worth?
Old bitcoin clients (even the current bitcoin core wallet) uses a new change address every time you spend money.  So if you've spent money many times you end up with many, many wallet addresses.  
For me to consolidate everything I have into a single address would cost me almost $1000.  That's fucking crazy.
Who would not care about this?  Literally anyone with money in this game cares.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:43:09
believe me, it's crazy risky.
This bubble is ridiculous and is absolutely a bubble.

@_date: 2017-12-03 14:22:51
So then, what you're saying, is that if I use my money to buy bitcoins, I should get a tax refund on the money I spent?
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:18:42
yeah!  The dream of 25 million is amazing.  But it's just that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:24:04
If you are going to be upset about a 23,000% ROI because it's not even more then you should just never, ever sell.
Hell, throw your wallet keys away just to be sure you won't sell.

So what you're saying is, BTC will be good to HODL after 2140?
I'll mark that down in my calendar.

I've been mining, trading, buying and selling crypto since 2011...

Except then we still need a digital currency.
Though I'll admit, LTC has worked pretty well for that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:02:53
like me with my antminer!
Paid 2 BTC for 2 of them, got them, bought an expensive ass PSU to run them and after 2.5 months of high power bills I had 1.7 BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:26:12
They essentially stole 200 LTC from me, still no response to my ticket after like 10 days now.  
Where's my money Kraken?

Gold has always been a useful metal.  It's one of the easiest ones to work with, for starters.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:41:12
but it literally never ROI'd
Difficulty increased so fast that even if I had left it mining for the entire 2 more years since then it still wouldn't have made as much as it cost.
And it cost like the equivalent of .1-.2 BTC (at the time, btc was much cheaper) of power over that same time frame too.
So what was the point?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:52:33
I am in club cryptsy... Several BTC worth of different coins of mine on there.  Never going to get them back.
Worth more than my house at this point

They were already not worth running for a while before I unplugged them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:44:03
I think that a bigger block alone can not solve issues long term, but bigger blocks now fixes a lot of problems short term.

The beginning of 2013 was not 4 years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:38:04
yeah, I totally don't understand math where 1+1 still = 1.  
here, read the wiki, it shows the inflation rate per year - right now inflation is around 4%, which is, the last time I checked, not 0%.

Gold failed as a currency because it's not divisible enough.  Have you seen how much gold even $20 buys these days?  It'd be a damn small coin.  
They tried to fix that with bi-metallic standards, but that didn't work either because the gold:silver ratio didn't stay constant.
Silver alone worked for a while too, until people (and the fed) got greedy,  so now we have fiat.
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:54:22
yes, but it's significantly more filled with it than easy to get to gold exists on earth.
There's actually a lot of gold on earth, but since it's a heavy element most of it sunk to the core, where it's absurdly expensive (well, basically impossible) to get to

I haven't, because predictions tend to be worthless.  
Some will always be spot on, because so many people make so many predictions that some are bound to be right.  
I have no idea what the price will be next week, next month, or next year, and I own very little coin anymore anyways (just a few btc left) after losing most of it to cryptsy and mintpal, but I'd bet on $500 a coin before I'd bet on $30k a coin by october.  And I don't think either is likely.

Personally I think it'll be a million a coin by fall, and 6-10 trillion per coin by mid-late 2018.
By 2020 we can expect pricing of roughly a brazillion dollars per coin, maybe 1.5 - 2 brazillion if china is on board.

Issues.  You have them.
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:40:41
Thanks for the reply.  I do see the issue.  It's not that scaling isn't needed, it's that it's reasonably impossible.  Even with bigger blocks, it just can't (ever) scale well enough to be useful.
If scaling is impossible though, then what's the point of bitcoin?
Using off-chain solutions seems like we may as well just not have the chain to begin with?
@_date: 2016-03-06 07:01:37
I did, see above.  Regardless, why would I bother when you talk in circles?
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:14:39
by what logic?
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:37:59
Second layers and off chain transactions may as well not even use bitcoin at all. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:45:11
it will almost always cost, averaged over time, roughly equivilent to how much BTC is worth.
It has to be.
If bitcoins became worth $1m each difficulty would spike dramatically and within a few months a block would cost $25m worth of power to mine.
And if bitcoin value fell to a quarter difficulty would drop like a stone as miners couldn't cover costs until the only ones left mining are the ones that could still make money.
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:03:19
Things like what?
Almost nothing has been accomplished by this subreddit in the last 3 years.   
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:23:07
That's all that it was about the last time I cared, which was a while ago. 
I don't really use bitcoin much anymore because there's no point when it costs as much as PayPal and takes half a day to confirm a transaction.  I'd rather just use PayPal. Or my debit card. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:38:05
That's why the other guy just explained how it's all about storage and bandwidth, right?
@_date: 2016-03-06 06:55:50
Prove what?  That you talk in circles?  I just did.  You just totally denied saying exactly the thing you said. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:32:20
I can already do off chain transactions.  It's called not bitcoin.
If every block is full, why not increase the block size to make it not full?
Furthermore, bigger blocks = more transactions = more txfees = even more money for the miners.  
Artificially limiting the blockchain to tiny blocks will only serve to drive people elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:30:02
Every time halvings happen in major coins,  the price drops.  
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:29:22
It has been technically feasable for years. 
The storage size argument is beyond stupid when I can buy a thumb drive for 10 bucks that fits the entire block chain on it. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:00:55
Oh? What fees? 
Aside from where they charge me to borrow money if I don't return it within a month,  my credit card costs me nothing ever.   
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:01:47

First you said there's no cogestion, if that's the case why does there need to be a solution? 
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:15:40
My point is that if bitcoin is so limited that it's not useful by itself, then what purpose does it serve?
Everyone has always touted it as a cash replacement.  If I can't use it for that, then what's the point?
@_date: 2017-02-05 08:30:17
But if we are using some other network to represent the bitcoins, then really, what do we need the bitcoins for at all? 
Much like how the governments ditched the gold standard and went to fiat currency.  
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:04:21
Gold is expected to underperform for the next year or two, so they are redistributing their portfolio into things that should have more growth.

@_date: 2016-03-07 13:58:52

@_date: 2016-01-03 14:40:41
So bitcoin now is by your definition an altcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:20:39
well, gold has been doing pretty badly for the last 5 years, so it's not that surprising.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:27:19
How much is a coin worth if you can't even use it, anyways? 
When I have to wait hours for my transaction to go through after paying a bigger fee than PayPal charges,  the experiment fails.

Bitcoin has lost half it's value since I got in. 
Nobody in their right mind could possibly trust btc as a long term store of wealth right now and can't until it has a far more established history.

Most of my coins were still in there because I couldn't make the bitcoin client load in windows 8 after an update, and I wasn't actively using them so I just left it on the back Burner.
The ltc and doge I really have no excuse except laziness and trying to play the exchange rate to make money. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:04:55
I don't think your restaurant policy works, because I don't think that currency is a thing that there should be limited access to.
Your solution of "don't use bitcoin" is what will happen, though.  Then N+1 protocols don't really require the N to exist, do they?  There are plenty of other non-bitcoin ways to send money already.  Limiting bitcoin so that it can't be used by the masses effectively kills it.
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:15:55
How?  Because every time I've traded bitcoin to make money I've always seemed to end up with less bitcoin or less money, so clearly I'm doing it wrong.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:00:49
the entire blockchain is 60gb now.
That's already too big for casual users to want to download it, but not even in the same magnitude for a small operation to be able to have one.
Realistically even if every block ever had been 10x larger, I could still run a full node on a $300 laptop, and continuing down the road run it for several more years.
The ever increasing size of the blockchain may eventually become a large problem, but limiting the blocksize limits the number of transactions as a whole, and if people can't make transactions than what is the point of the whole thing?  
Essentially the only way to limit blockchain size is to limit the number of transactions on the blockchain.  And if that's an issue than this entire experiment is a failure.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:37:56
Yup.  And cheques are easy to forge, nobody is going to take one from someone they've never met before and lives 600 miles away.

It worked fine as a currency until recently when all this drama started.  
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:56:04
Has it not already happened?  Would it not be better to stop it from happening regardless?
Bitcoin as a currency is extremely limited in value if it can't confirm transactions quickly.  If I have to wait, even 30 minutes, for a first confirmation, and sometimes transactions maybe don't get included ever, then there's no way I could use it even to accept payment for a coffee.
Increasing tx fees doesn't help, because if everyone has to do it then nobody will see any benefit, there will still be the same number of transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:56:52
How is that my logic? 
It needs to be sufficient for the transaction volume, not infinite.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:51:36

How did you send for such a low fee?  Care to show the transaction?
I meant that there used to be a few local retailers that accepted it easily but now they are harder to find, mostly because (I think) of how much transactions cost over the last year or so.  I stopped spending mine when it started to cost me more than my debit card to use.

So because YOU bought tiny hard drives the entire blockchain has to be tiny?
My 8 year old laptop with it's 8 year old SSD can store the entire blockchain right now with 60GB to spare.  
Any decent spinner can fit several decades worth of storage on it.
Storing the blockchain is a literally non issue unless it rapidly grew several hundred GB monthly.

@_date: 2015-04-12 14:48:19
I would rather have a rapidly depreciating money pit lambo than a used 20 year old saturn, just sayin.

Or like it's only a "few years"
My bitcoin now is worth 5x what it was 4 years ago, sure...  will it be worth 5x what it's worth today in 4 more years?  Maybe.  
Everyone profits huge when they time the market perfectly.  But timing the market perfectly only happens in hindsight and is kinda hard to make predictions of, or everyone would be rich.

have you looked at your bill?
That's not the price you actually pay for power, it's just a (small) part of it.
You generally pay more like 25 cents a kwh and on peak is closer to 30, because of delivery, line charges, debt retirement fee, taxes, etc.  
I just moved to alberta and my power bill went from $200+/month in ontario to $40 here.  Same size house, same stuff in it, etc.  And the going "rate" for power is 7.9c/kwh, but my bill is just that.  No fees, no BS.  Ontario gets seriously ripped off for power compared to the rest of north america.
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:57:07
Ontario has nearly the most expensive power in mainland north amerca and is in the top 30 worldwide.
You don't pay 10c/kwh unless you are getting industrial rate.

how do you figure?
it was a horrible short term investment in the first half of 2014, sure.  But it was a fantastic long term investment.
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:29:03
I have been investing my entire life and have literally never heard anyone ever call a sub one year investment "long term" before.

Really?  There were 50 million computer users in 1960 (14 years after eniac)?
And 50 million cellphone users in 1985?  
And 50 million internet users in 1976?
Somehow I doubt these numbers a little.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:20:50
All those things you just described are infighting. 
Just because you don't like the other guys doesn't change what is going on. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:59:10
Didn't have to pay stupid high fees until recently.  Your argument is ridiculous. 
I want my useable currency back,  thanks. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 13:07:37
I don't think that phrase means what you think it means.
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:15:05
You can pay me $100 to not be your friend anytime.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:07:12
This is largely accurate. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:30:03
Same thing in canada, too...   dollar was basically par with the states and now it's $1.27 CAD to $1 USD.
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:35:59
or it takes time to upgrade stuff....
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:43:37
If I have to wait hours and pay 5 bucks in fees for my 2 dollar coffee, it's lost its utility to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:32:27
no no no you have it all wrong the justice system is fair and  equal  to everybody!

Mt. Gox
Cryptsy 
.. Probably way more but I lost money on all 3 of those. 
If you want to never touch your coins,  sure they are easy to protect.   but if you ever want to use them as a medium of exchange then there's always a risk.  Not a problem with bitcoin,  it's a problem with life in general. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:04:28
I think all the value beyond the $350 mark wasn't real.  Support is strong between $250 and $350.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:53:36
sit on it until it's worth more.
There's no way that your bitcoins will never be worth over $250.  You might be waiting a while, but, eventually, the price will be more than that.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:10:36
How the fuck can I use a coin that costs me more than my expected transaction is worth in fees? 
I've been using bitcoin for years and it's nearly useless now.   
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:54:58
So it wasn't a boom/bust exactly like I predicted?  Because it sure looks like it went down 50% since I made that post.
Enjoy being poor.  I tried to warn you.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:43:44
because people are idiots.  
I posted for people to be cautious a month ago at $1200 and that what goes up, must come down, and that this looked exactly like a bubble to me, and got downvoted to the ground.  
To be completely 100% honest, I don't think it's bottomed yet and I wouldn't buy before it hits $350.  
And even at $350, there's a chance of losing money.  
It's so volatile, and buying high and selling low is exactly what scared people will do.  but it's still frustrating.
For me, I'm neither buying nor selling - I spend mine when I need to purchase things.  It is a currency, after all.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:10:25
Well, I just opened an account there.  Looks like I'm closing it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:05:30
you can't be serious if you think you aren't general public.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:12:17
Maybe, but at least I know where I stand.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:22:40
no they haven't?
The existing peak looks /exactly/ like a boom/bust cycle.
I am pretty bullish on bitcoins now, but I'm not touching any till the price recedes. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:49:19
Right.  Being in IT makes you a skilled investor.  Got it!
(that makes me one too, I guess)
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:07:52
well, for having no idea what I was talking about, it sure looks like I predicted things accurately, and I'm now richer instead of poorer as a result.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:54:22
if you're waiting to get paid to buy bitcoins, you likely can't afford more.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:06:10
yeah, this. 
I don't think the peak was today, but it might be tomorrow or next month.  I don't know.  But it's not going to skyrocket forever, and what goes up must come down.  And it's really dangerous to think otherwise.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:52:46
right at the top.
