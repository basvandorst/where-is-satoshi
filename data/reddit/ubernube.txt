Cars get used for the overwhelming majority of illegal activity by the majority of the population. Traffic-related offences are so common that they aren't even considered taboo by 95% of society.

A fourth option would be to run your own secure bitcoin node on a private server, and use that as a trusted source of blockchain info for all your other clients on less powerful devices.
That would probably require a bit of coding to set up though.

I assume he plans to use powered USB hubs. Only the hubs with miners attached would need to supply significant power, and even then it would only be a couple of amps.

The thing is, they wouldn't know that you'd only changed a single character. Chances are they'd examine the private key, conclude that no transactions are associated with it, then give up. I imagine they'd only try brute forcing through similar keys if they were relatively sure that BTC were being held in that address.

I didn't see any mockery there.
Of course, interpretation is entirely subjective so your opinion may differ.

This is an anonymous bitcoin mixing service which will break the chain of ownership so the coins can't be traced: 
They claim to delete logs after 1 week, so even if their servers get compromised the bitcoins *should* be safe. On the other hand, it could easily be run by the CIA.
It can only be used through Tor though, and they charge ~1% on any BTC that they handle.

Why is it assumed that suicidal people don't want to see a joke? It seems counter-intuitive to say that this isn't the time for jokes. If anything, I'd say it's good for people to bring a bit of humour into a situation like this. I could understand your complaint if it was a joke about losing money or something, but it was just a generic bit of harmless humour.

Yes.
