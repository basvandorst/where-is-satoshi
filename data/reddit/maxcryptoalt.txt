So announce it now and schedule it for three/six months. We shouldn't be afraid to fork if it's for the good of the system. I'm not entirely convinced that a 2MB increase would be the world-ending decentralization event that a lot of people claim.

Not sure how long you've been involved in this community, but the scaling debate and issues have been going on for YEARS. "Six months down the road" was how segwit was sold. Both SW and LN require mass adoption to effectively combat scaling issues, which will take time.
I don't think it would be that hard to convince people to back a core-written hard-fork to increase block size in an effort to alleviate scaling issues.

Literally a single variable/line of code as far as I've seen in the bitcoin source. How is this is technically a good thing?

The gold this site is talking about gets used in electronics/circuitry all the time.
So while child slaves aren't directly involved in bitcoin mining, it would not surprise me if the companies building ASIC mining chips were only sourcing materials from ethical/conflict-free resource-mining outfits.

To be fair, even the core reference client doesn't support Segwit on the UI yet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:30
Are you suggesting if it we continue to let it be unusable, it will devalue so much that it will become usable again as if that's a solution?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:10
If you're only buying something once, you'd end up with two transactions on the blockchain wouldn't you? One to open the channel and one to close it? Isn't that less concise than just sending the transaction directly?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:07
The reference client doesn't even have segwit in the gui yet. This isn't just people being stubborn, we reached capacity months ago.

This isn't repression, it's one of the repercussions of being a hate monger.  He is free to host his own videos, and get his own merchant account. People are free to say whatever they want, but they're also free to be shunned by society when that speech is radical.
Jones is either a lunatic, or worse, a person playing a lunatic to incite unrest and sell "supplements". I don't believe anyone can honestly argue that his is a "diverse perspective" at this point. He's free to keep being a lunatic, but the world will just increasingly ignore him.

If I recall correctly, mining is against their terms of service and may put your account at risk.

I've read a bunch of stuff on LN but I don't fully understand the flow for one-off purchases.
Let's say I only buy one or two items from Steam per year, would LN still make sense? Would I need to load a bunch of Bitcoin onto a LN provider and then use them like a credit card to purchase things quicker?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:27:48
Do you think we'll ever actually reach 90% consensus on any change that would require a hardfork? Or even if we did do you think the community would ever actually let the original chain die? I'm just curious at this point, not trying to argue. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:41:56
You should take more naps.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:22:16
Thanks for clearing that up. What if anything would be the difference between having my LN wallet with one provider over the other?
Your examples above also require Steam/VPN providers/Starbucks to have their own LN nodes or use a payment provider that supports LN right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:49:50
2x code wasn't really that complicated, it just wasn't well-written or tested. Segwit is significantly more code.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:57
Owning a copy of something in perpetuity and renting access to it for a month doesn't really fit in this case. I think it's silly to expect an immediate mass shift towards segwit (it has now been months and even the core client doesn't support it in the gui yet), or even lightning. These things will take time to mainstream, and while there may be political motivations on both sides, even if 100% of clients were magically using segwit immediately, there would still be a major problem, as there has been on and off for a while now.
We're at the point now where Bitcoin is basically unusable in small amounts and it's getting silly/depressing.

Purchasing a coffee is laughable at this point. It's not feasible to do any transaction under $1000, and hasn't been for a while. While it's great I can move 500k around for $50, buying things or dealing with relatively normal sums of money just doesn't work anymore, and appears it won't for some time to come.
No matter what, all the off-chain solutions will require on-chain opening/closing. Even if there were no spam, tons of on chain stuff were moved to off-chain and we had MAST/Schnorr and all the big players were supporting Segwit, we'd still likely be over-cap.
The timelines and impact for the stuff you mention just aren't able to cope with the speed at which people are entering the bitcoin ecosystem.

Also worth noting that this came about after the 2008 crisis, which was caused by greed and bankers. The goal wasn't to recreate the exact same situation. The OP speaks about how even selling instantly to fiat is bad, but what does he think will happen if everyone just holds on to their coins and never spends them?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:41
Interesting. I clearly have some more reading to do on this subject. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:52
Regardless of which side you're on, this is a really bad analogy. If anything, BCH is just adding multiple lanes while BTC is adding carpooling/parallel trains/etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:06:37
It would be 100% practical. Two people wishing to launder money could trade via a third party (the game). There's a reason there are virtually no games that allow you to sell in-game currency for real money.

This is a company who needs 4-16 hours of downtime every week for "maintenance". In 2018. I don't know what's going on behind the scenes over there, but I wouldn't trust Gemini with my data or crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:34:21
I can almost guarantee they are focusing mostly on performance right now. They have been having some serious scaling difficulties and I've heard they have a relatively small team. Adding BCH is pretty easy (since they effectively support BTC/LTC now), so I wouldn't be surprised if that came first. They have less of a financial incentive to implement segwit since they pass the fees on to their users, and it probably requires a lot less testing/security auditing than adding a crypto clone like BCH.

I opened a couple more channels, how about now?

Stop giving these idiots attention.

I got one a while back and I really like it, seems like a quality device. I used it for around 9 months and then switched. One of the main reasons I stopped using it was because it doesn't support custom fees (and as such can greatly overestimate fees). Updates were few and far between.

Why not just destroy your private key, that's the ultimate "hodl".
