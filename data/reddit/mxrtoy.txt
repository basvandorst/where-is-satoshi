Honestly these are good questions. I think a lot of people new to bitcoin share similar questions but they are maybe too nervous to ask as even when a person is clearly not trying to be "rude or argue" just as you made very clear, many responses to such questions can come across as aggressive or confusingly dodgy or like a "get on board or get lost" curt response. Not everyone is than unhelpful obviously and there are some good replies from good people too. But overall I think the bitcoin community can be a bit more patient and try to simplify things a better when answering questions of newcomers or skeptics.
With that said, I think you are spot on in your analysis and a bit more reading online will clarify a lot of things for you. Volatility and liquidity do make the original bitcoin unable to act like a traditional currency in its current form. If you look into the size/time constraints issue you will see why other more "cash" like technologies have been created to compliment bitcoin as bitcoin is still slow and expensive to move around and getting slower and more expensive. 
Bitcoin is nothing like Tesla. While Tesla has its fair share of speculators in the for the short term, in theory eventually Tesla will sell cars and be profitable and a portion of those profits will belong to shareholders whether it pays a dividend or keeps reserves. Bitcoin will never sell anything it made or pay a dividend out of profits.
A reason to hold bitcoin is because you think in the future it *might* be worth more (aka be more useful) than an alternative place to have put your money. Why that may or may not happen is up to you to decide why someone in the future *might* give you more money for bitcoin than the current price.
