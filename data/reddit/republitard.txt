AML is a form of surveillance, and this argument is a variant of the "if you're not doing anything wrong then you shouldn't have anything to hide" argument that gets made in favor of surveillance. Volumes have been written on why that argument is fallacious.
If you're for AML and you're logically consistent, then you shouldn't have a problem with what the NSA has been revealed to have been doing, nor should you have a problem with even more intrusive surveillance, up to and including total surveillance of every single human activity, no matter how intimate.

They're using the word "peg" in a very unusual way. I would normally thing that an asset is "pegged" if it is manipulated so it trades at the same value as another asset. But I *think* the when the author writes about a "peg", he's saying the asset has been locked on the "parent chain" and then spent into the sidechain.

The exact "rules" you're referring to (the AML red flags) are actually a secret.  Nobody but the bank knows for sure why they froze his account, or whether his withdrawing the money had any effect on their decision. If he left the money in, they could've decided (based on whatever secret evidence they were reviewing) to freeze his account with his balance still in the account.
He was smart to withdraw the money, and lucky that he succeeded in doing so. His story serves as a cautionary tale to a large number of other Bitcoiners who trade bitcoins at volume on LocalBitcoins while having no idea that their bank might respond by freezing their funds and closing their accounts.
The bank is *obviously* not subject to anyone's demands. On the contrary, society is subject to banks' demands, as evidenced by banks' ability to extract bailouts from governments whenever they would otherwise go out of business.

Wrong again. It's absolutely legal (and also disgusting), and courts have ruled in cops' favor in the past, saying that the mere presence of a large amount of money is "strong evidence" in itself that the money was obtained illegally. 
Money becomes part of the police department's budget, and property such as bitcoins gets auctioned off, and the proceeds become part of the department's budget. You have to sue to get the money back, and they're allowed to sell your property while the litigation is pending.

Yes, Bitcoins have been seized under civil asset forfeiture laws, but cops have to work a lot harder to make those seizures happen. Since a poker player could transmit his bitcoins back to California before driving home, a cop wouldn't catch him with bitcoins just by pulling him over and digging through his car. Instead, the market would steal his money, since the $350 bitcoins he sent to his paper wallet in California would be $250 bitcoins by the time he got to California.

You sent me a very similar message in reply to one of my comments, so I have copied the reply here ([original reply](


Any argument against one form of surveillance is an argument against all forms of surveillance. Therefore, if you are against surveillance of communications, or against having a government camera inside your house, it would be logical if you were also against surveillance of financial activity for the exact same reasons you're against other forms of surveillance. What you're saying here is that some forms of surveillance are *special* somehow.


AML is anti-financial countersurveillance, period. Bank accounts are under surveillance *by default*, so if you must not be under surveillance, you must launder your money. It just so happens that criminals can't tolerate any kind of government surveillance, so they are highly motivated to engage in financial countersurveillance (money laundering) along with other forms of countersurveillance (using temporary cell phones, TOR, etc).
Because no criminal can tolerate any amount of surveillance, it is often argued by pro-surveillance types that *only* criminals would have a problem with surveillance or conduct countersurveillance. This is the argument you're making when you say the only reason anyone would ever commit the crime of financial countersurveillance is to cover up another crime.


Taking money out of the banking network takes it out of the financial surveillance dragnet. If financial countersurveillance is truly an evil in itself, then you shouldn't want to take your money out of the dragnet anyway.

I'm sure this is true for your average wealthy white person, who got pulled over in his BMW in Beverly Hills, but a poor black man with little more to his name than the $1000 that the cop seized would not be calling a lawyer. He doesn't have a right to a court-appointed lawyer, either, because in civil asset forfeiture, the government is suing *your property*, not you, so you're considered a third party.
And if it is against police procedure to not issue a receipt, it's a minor issue for which the cop wouldn't be punished. If he tried to bring up that point, they'd just go "Oops, sorry we forgot the receipt, here ya go." 
Cops aren't even punished when they murder people in cold blood, they certainly aren't going to get the book thrown at them for failing to issue a piece of paper.


In the US, this is absolutely not true. The seizure can continue if you are not charged with a crime, or even if you are charged and acquitted (this is a subject of reform proposals, which are opposed by the police lobby). Civil asset forfeiture cases only require a low "preponderance of the evidence" standard of proof, which is barely any higher than "probable cause." If you're out at night in a "high-crime" (ie, black) neighborhood with $1000, and the cop says that you were acting suspiciously, that's "preponderance of the evidence," and the government will win in civil court.

So did PRISM, before it was revealed. You could even have argued that the companies involved wouldn't have dedicated massive resources to put backdoors into their systems for the NSA. In fact, before it was revealed, many people were insisting that the NSA was not spying on us, and that to believe otherwise was tinfoil hattery.
Given what we know about the NSA, IMO Occam's Razor cuts the other way: It's more far-fetched to believe that Apple, which has been involved in PRISM since before they started development on this chip, would have been allowed to defy the NSA.


Maybe it was the taxpayer that spent that extra money.


Because now everybody is acutely aware that cell phones are utterly insecure, and so are not using them to send the kinds of messages the NSA would like to intercept. Something like this needs to be done to lull everybody back into a false sense of security so that we'll let ourselves be spied upon again, or in mainstream parlance, they need to "rebuild trust in American technology companies."

Any argument against one form of surveillance is an argument against all forms of surveillance. Therefore, if you are against surveillance of communications, or against having a government camera inside your house, it would be logical if you were also against surveillance of financial activity for the exact same reasons you're against other forms of surveillance. What you're saying here is that some forms of surveillance are *special* somehow.


AML is anti-financial countersurveillance, period. Bank accounts are under surveillance *by default*, so if you must not be under surveillance, you must launder your money. It just so happens that criminals can't tolerate any kind of government surveillance, so they are highly motivated to engage in financial countersurveillance (money laundering) along with other forms of countersurveillance (using temporary cell phones, TOR, etc).
Because no criminal can tolerate any amount of surveillance, it is often argued by pro-surveillance types that *only* criminals would have a problem with surveillance or conduct countersurveillance. This is the argument you're making when you say the only reason anyone would ever commit the crime of financial countersurveillance is to cover up another crime.


Taking money out of the banking network takes it out of the financial surveillance dragnet. If financial countersurveillance is truly an evil in itself, then you shouldn't want to take your money out of the dragnet anyway.

For example, the infamous Kim Dotcom/Megaupload case was about a New Zealander, living in New Zealand, who allowed Americans to upload pirated movies to his servers. New Zealand was perfectly happy to arrest Dotcom on an American indictment and seize his assets on behalf of the US, even though Dotcom never set foot in the US.

If it is *not* moral to accept something that was stolen, this has serious implications for the U.S. economy, which owes its entire existence to the practice of murdering the natives, claiming their newly-vacant land as belonging to the government, and then selling that land to U.S. investors. Those investors accepted land that was stolen, and then mined, farmed, and manufactured things on that land, and those murder-tainted products were accepted by consumers. 
Every time you drive an American-made car down a U.S. road, you're accepting the original theft of the land the road is built on, the land that the car factory sits on, and the land occupied by the oil pipeline that brought you the gasoline in your tank, and you're accepting the murder that was necessary in order to effect all of that theft.

Eventually, a fascist appears and promises to punish all the people who conservatives want to see punished, and conservatives sweep him into office. Duterte is punishing drug users and dealers, and Filipino conservatives love him for it, while here in the US, Trump has promised to punish immigrants and Muslims, eliciting euphoria from conservatives.

Bitinstant keeps the balance on your card as USD. So, as soon as you fund your card, you've already cashed out. Consumers who buy BTC solely to put it on the card are effectively just loading their card with USD from their pocket or bank account.


I never said it wasn't useful-- for those of us who already have money in Bitcoin. This card beats the shit out of waiting for weeks for your money to move out of Mt. Gox after cashing out.
For people who previously saw no reason to use Bitcoin, however, this card doesn't create one. 


I don't think it does anything for the chicken/egg problem. Why should merchants accept Bitcoin if Bitcoin enthusiasts can just pay in USD with this card? Why should consumers buy Bitcoin if the only thing they're going to buy with it is a USD-denominated prepaid debit card?

TFA doesn't just describe the well-known insecurity of 0-conf, it also debunks the myth that you're safe if you listen for a few seconds for the second transaction (there are conditions under which the victim will never see the second transaction until it comes in a block), which you can't do anyway unless you build a custom Bitcoin client.
The authors seem to think that if you run ~3 "observer nodes," (that listen to different parts of the network and report to your main node) then you're likely to catch the double-spend attempt, but they consider that solution to be too expensive and impractical.
They allude to a series of experiments that would have required them to create their own custom versions of the Bitcoin client (to implement the listening period, for example), but they publish zero source code.

Just because they're a Bank now doesn't mean that everybody in Europe is going to want their balance in Bitcoins. At best, they'll take a lot of customers from Mt. Gox, and gain a few new ones with their new air of legitimacy.




They'd have to play the market. If they convert your balance to Bitcoins but don't actually buy the coins, then they have to buy Bitcoins at whatever the exchange rate is at the time of withdrawal, but they'd still have to buy the number of Bitcoins they added to your balance, which would probably be based on the exchange rate at the time of deposit. 
The difference between these two exchange rates could either cost or make them money, depending on which way the BTC price moves while they're sitting on their fiat money.

LOL. The ability to buy Bitcoins that can then be converted back USD in the form of a debit card is not an advantage over just spending the USD in the first place. This is *not* the thing that will take Bitcoin to critical mass.

The article has a point. If the state and banking system decide that they *really don't want* Bitcoin to succeed (regardless of the community's desire to become more mainstream), now is the time to stamp it out. All they'd have to do is what they're already doing in the UK: Freeze the accounts of Bitcoin exchanges on whatever pretext is available, making it impossible to move money from the traditional banking system to or from Bitcoin. If all American banks did this right now, the Bitcoin market would collapse within a day.
Only if the exchange market moves to face-to-face transactions quickly enough will the banks lose the ability to shut down Bitcoin.

It is exactly true, and you admitted it at Step 8, where "Agent C" moves Person A's fiat money by initiating a transaction within the traditional banking network. It doesn't matter whether the transaction was initiated indirectly through PayPal, Dwolla, or what-have-you (which themselves are integrated into the traditional banking network).
People running Agents are vulnerable to getting their accounts frozen, if a government, bank, or payment service decides to do it for whatever reason. It would be worse for those Agents that rose to the top. The top Agent would likely be handling 80-90% of the transactions anyway as the popularity of Agents will probably follow a power law distribution, so it wouldn't be any less centralized than the current market for Bitcoin exchanges. In the end, there would only be a few Agents, and their owners would be well known.

The Bitcoin money supply expands at a well-known rate, with a widely publicized upper limit on the total supply. This is all reflected in the *current* price, which means that the future expansion of the Bitcoin money supply will not create inflation. This is also why the price will not jump when the reward halves in December. Any jump on account of the reward halving has already happened.
When the ASICs are turned on, the difficulty will increase, which will keep the rate of supply expansion at the same rate it's at now. The only difference will be that you will no longer be able to mine profitably with mere GPUs.

Decreasing in value is bad for *this* currency. A merchant who sold a $100 item for 12 BTC last week would only have $60 worth of BTC right now, and thus unwittingly sold the item at a 40% discount. That means that accepting Bitcoins is a bad deal for merchants, which could lead to there being even less you can buy with Bitcoins.
On the demand side, a consumer who bought $500 worth of Bitcoins would only have $300 worth now, even if he didn't buy anything. 
It doesn't make sense for consumers to buy just enough Bitcoins for each purchase (a frequently-aired suggestion for consumers to deal with the volatility), because it takes so long to convert dollars in a bank account into Bitcoins. If it's too dangerous to buy a week's worth of Bitcoins at a time, then it's too dangerous to buy Bitcoins.

If the government is the exchange operator *and* the customer, *and* the laundry service, the merchant is highly vulnerable. This situation wouldn't be terribly difficult for a government to set up.
Suppose that the government buys weed from the merchant, sending the BTC to address *A*. The merchant, thinking he's clever, transfers the money to addresses *B*, *C*, and *D*, before finally sending it to his account at an exchange, which turns out to also be owned by the government. 
Now suppose that the government makes several more purchases. Each time, the merchant passes it through several addresses before sending it to the same account on the exchange, but one thing remains constant: All the money the government spends on the merchant's site eventually ends up in the same exchange account.
The government could do this until enough coins have been returned to the exchange under the same account that they could then use an inductive argument to get a warrant to search the merchant's computer, where they will find definitive proof of who owns what address.
This technique would work no matter how many different wallets the merchant moved his coins through.

It makes much more sense to just use PayPal than it does to do any of the things you suggest. Accepting them and selling them immediately? Too much work for no extra benefit. Persuade a business to accept it? They already accept PayPal, or credit cards.
If there's no reason to accept that "a recently-invented string of code" has a combined buying power of $200 million, then it also makes no sense to think it has a combined buying power of $1, or even $0.00001.

It's written in C. It might *accidentally* contain a vulnerability to an attack known as [smashing the stack]( in which the attacker sends a string that is longer than what the program was meant to accept. This string typically contains machine-language code, and a few bytes to overwrite the return pointer (which will cause execution to jump to the character buffer).
Bitcoin doesn't *have* to have such a vulnerability. The attack could exploit the same vulnerability in your Web browser or any of its plugins, or your IRC client. The only goal is to get arbitrary code running on the same computer as your wallet.dat.

Credit cards, which is what you're talking about, don't offer instant confirmation. They offer instant *authorization*, which is about as "confirmed" as the 0/unconfirmed transaction you receive instantly in a Bitcoin client. This is where the bank decreases your "available balance" but leaves your Account Balance alone.
The authorization doesn't even have to match the actual transaction amount. For example, most Pay-At-The-Pump systems only authorize a $1 transaction.
The credit card transaction doesn't *post* or clear until 3-5 days later, assuming the transaction ends up being successful.

Other countries don't have *software* patents. However, Bitcoin is safe. It says [here]( that the law doesn't go into effect for a year, and it says [here]( that if the "invention" was being used commercially at least one year before the filing, then you can fight the patent in court (though it doesn't say a patent troll can't sue you).
However, if you want to get rich and are an asshat, you can just wait for an open-source project that does something interesting to become popular, and then quickly patent it. Hell, you can even screw a commercial software company. Just look for any software coming out of Europe, where software patents must meet much stricter requirements than in the US, and sue them when they try to sell it in the US.

A typical Bitcoin exchange attempts to match buys and sells each time a new buy or sell order is entered. The exchange keeps a list of all the "bid" (buy) orders and all the "ask" (sell) orders, called the "order book". When there is no match, the orders are left standing. The chart of this order book is known as the "market depth".
Usually, the lowest ask order will be somewhat higher than the highest bid order, so no sale takes place. This also produces the two different prices: The "ask" price is how much you'd have to pay if you wanted some bitcoins *right now*, while the "bid" is how much you can sell them for *right now*. The price provides no information on how *many* you could buy or sell for those prices before causing the price to change.
If somebody enters a bid that's equal to or greater than the lowest ask order, or if somebody enters an ask that's equal to or less than the highest bid, then a trade occurs, and if this results in a change in the price, then Bitcoincharts will update. An exchange will match such overlapping orders with the most favorable standing order, and if that order runs out, the next order will be filled (and the price will change). For example, if there are a few bids in the order book:
     1    BTC @ $9.5
     0.5  BTC @ $9.0
     0.2  BTC @ $8.0
     1000 BTC @ $0.01
...and somebody wants to sell 500 BTC at any price, even $0.01 (you would indicate this by entering $0.01 as the price on the sell screen), then he will sell 1 BTC for $9.5 (which was the "bid" price at the time he entered the order), 0.5 BTC for $9, 0.2 BTC for $8, and the remaining 498.3 BTC for $0.01, and the bid price for BTC will be $0.01 thereafter, with the 1000 BTC buy order only partially filled. The ask price stays the same as it was until somebody puts in a new ask.

Since Bitcoin has an inelastic supply, its price is determined solely by demand. If more people want Bitcoins, the price will go up. If less people want them, the price will go down, because the supply can't adjust to compensate like it does with other currencies.
For Bitcoin to *stay* at $1/BTC forever, there can never be more than $21 million in business done with it at any given time. For Bitcoin to stay at $1/BTC right now, there mustn't be more than $6 million in business done with it.
IOW, the only way to permanently keep the price down is to limit its use as a transaction medium.

Bitcoin seems to avoid manual memory management as much as possible. It relies heavily on STL and Boost templates and macros. 
It also uses operator overloading rather liberally, which Java doesn't support. I'll bet BitcoinJ is full of `foo.add(bar)` and `foo.compareTo(bar) &lt; 0` and such, where Bitcoin Core can just say `foo += bar` and `foo &lt; bar`.
Bitcoin also throws exceptions without declaring them, so it benefits from not having checked exceptions like Java.

This is a weak argument against surveillance.

Drivers would get speeding tickets *every* time they went 1 mph or km/h over the speed limit. Etc. And then there are the thousands of felony offenses on the books that nobody is even aware of.

Satoshi's words, in response to somebody saying "You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography":


A "new territory of freedom" would be a reference to all the restrictions banks place on money in the name of KYC/AML.
Also, he was deathly afraid of possible government reprisals that could have come from Bitcoiners supporting Wikileaks, and he disappeared when Gavin Andresen talked to the CIA.
Perhaps Satoshi's "several years" are up and the US government has caught up in the arms race, but it can't be argued that Satoshi was motivated primarily by the potential for merchants to avoid  credit card fees and chargebacks.

One thing Ripple completely does away with is any pretense of anonymity. For Alice to know that there's a trust path between her and Bob (a requirement before a transaction can take place in Ripple), the real-world identitiy of each person in between has to be known to the previous person in the path. Large vendors would have well-known Ripple identities.

Because you want to build a decentralized *exchange,* not a decentralized version of Craigslist. That means you want to build something that actually mediates transactions between traders so that the traders can't rip each other off. Such a system has to automatically handle the USD side of the trade as well as the Bitcoin side, in a way that none of the participants can defraud.
You don't want to merely push the real problems to another location like Open Transactions or Ripple do-- If using the exchange system requires you to buy a "USD token" from some company in exchange for USD sent using the same traditional institutions that Mt. Gox has found itself unable to use, then those institutions are still in a position of power over the market. They can cut off a "USD token" issuer just as easily as they can cut off a Bitcoin exchange.
The only way to completely remove banks from the picture is to build a decentralized bank. Only if this was possible would you have a way to get dollars to the decentralized exchange without governments and banks being able to interfere.

I'm using Chromium 21. However, this tells you nothing useful.
Drag-and-drop is not useful on GNOME and KDE, even if the browser supports it. This is because the developers of those two systems have opted to remove desktop icons and other features unilaterally deemed "unimportant." 
None of this is discernible from within the browser nor through its User-Agent string. Your form has no way to tell if I'm using GNOME, KDE, XFCE, or another desktop-management system.
Because of the need to manually open a file manager app before you even have icons to drag to the browser in both GNOME and KDE, it's lot of work to get to where you have something to drag into the browser window.

Bitcoin eliminated the need for trust when it comes to currency issuance and transaction verification. You can verify that Bitcoin really will be issued the way it was promised that it would be issued by reading the source code.
Ripple, OTOH, requires you to trust OpenCoin. The only way you can "know" that they're only holding onto the XRP "incase and new issues arise (sic)" is by taking OpenCoin at their word. There's no source code controlling the distribution of XRP, and you also have to trust OpenCoin when it comes to verifying transactions because they control all the servers that perform this task, and have opted to keep the source code secret.
Because of its properties, Bitcoin has fostered a culture that abhors unnecessary trust. Bitcoiners tend to balk at the amount of trust that you must place in a single company in order to use Ripple.


XRP is only a "postage stamp used to facilitate transctions" to the extent that people actually use it that way. Because it has a fixed supply (counting the massive hoard held by OpenCoin and the developers), it has most of the same economic properties as Bitcoin, and can therefore be used as an altcoin. If people are using it mainly as an altcoin, then it's an altcoin, regardless of how vehemently OpenCoin asserts it's just a postage stamp.


Ripple's IOU system, assuming that all its users understand it adequately, can go into a crisis if there is a wave of defaults. Millions of dollars' worth of IOUs can suddenly become irredeemable. This doesn't require that people trust uncreditworthy scammers with large amounts of debt. A natural disaster could destroy enough value to cause a large number of defaults, or a single large IOU-issuer like BitStamp could go out of business.
In reality, Ripplers don't adequately understand the IOU system, which leaves them vulnerable to being tricked into allowing their good IOUs to be switched with IOUs issued by a scammer, which is another way that people can be forced into default.

Their actual behavior is to not touch Bitcoin themselves. The most popular merchant practice is to use a third party like BitPay. The third party does all the Bitcoin stuff, and converts all the revenue into fiat before passing it on to the merchant. This means merchants are already cashing out *daily,* not yearly. This way, merchants can continue to do all their accounting in fiat.

So which is it? The above, or the opposite statement below?


Since OpenCoin controls at least 80% of the validation servers, they control the consensus. That means that they can control *all* the money by simply programming their servers to agree that an otherwise invalid transaction is actually valid. Doing this would allow them to move your IOUs and XRPs without your consent. 


But we don't know it's going to be out in the open. The only reason anybody thinks that is because OpenCoin *says* they will release the source.

To be truly anonymous, you would have to get the counterparty to agree to use encryption in their messages.

Ripple is a *released* product. It has been released in the form of the ripple.com website, where you can trade in XRP and IOUs. When using this product as it has been released, you implicitly place your trust in OpenCoin. The only "evidence" that the Ripple.com product will ever be an open-source project is a body of claims made by OpenCoin employees. These claims only have meaning to those who trust OpenCoin. Even if they make good on their open-source claims, you will still have to trust that they won't flood the market with their hoard of XRPs for all eternity.

"Hard to create an identity that is useful" is enough to put anonymity out of the reach of most Ripple users. Transactions involving an entity like the Silk Road require not only that SR itself remains anonymous, but also that the individual buyers and sellers remain anonymous too, lest they become associated with SR through their transactions or trust links.
Bitcoin remains vastly superior in this area.
EDIT: I created two accounts on ripplepay.com, and tried to extend credit from one to the other.

If you're talking about confirmations, then you're talking about the blockchain, which is managed by the entire Bitcoin network as a whole. Betsofbitco.in can't control when your transaction will be confirmed. It'll get confirmed when a miner picks it up.
That said, if you're using the commandline version of Bitcoin-QT (*bitcoind*), you can use the *getrawtransaction* and *sendrawtransaction* subcommands to re-send your transaction. It's possible that your transaction didn't propagate, and re-sending it can make it more likely to be picked up by a mining rig.

I don't think the government does think that Bitcoin is inherently doomed to fail. Counterexamples:
Senator Schumer, not concerned with the public good as much as he is with his own power, hates Bitcoin specifically *because* of how tough it is. He knows that Bitcoin is what makes it possible for the Silk Road to undermine his authority to prohibit the sale of certain substances. He knows that the government is powerless to trace Bitcoin payments to the owners of the Silk Road. It may be true that most Bitcoin users don't buy illegal drugs, but nonetheless, the existence of Bitcoin reduces the amount of power that Senator Schumer has, and in the eyes of a Senator, that registers as damning criticism. Learning about Bitcoin would only make him hate it more, because it would only confirm that Bitcoin is highly resilient against many forms of government repression.
The ECB publicly realizes that Bitcoin is a direct threat to their ability to set monetary policy to benefit ECB-favored bankers. It could only be a threat if it was extremely tough and growing in popularity. Learning about Bitcoin would only make them hate it more: It provides no way for them to effortlessly enrich themselves and their banker friends.

So, if you have 25 freshly-mined BTC, and you want to "break off" 1 of them and send it somewhere, you must send the whole 25 BTC to two "output" addresses: One output of 1 BTC going to your destination address, and 24 BTC to another address that is also in your wallet. The 24 BTC is called "change." In practice, the Bitcoin software handles this automatically.
2. The Bitcoin software itself supports 8 decimal places. Many sites that handle Bitcoins, however, support much less than 8 decimal places, because they're written by amateur PHP programmers.
3. The rate of Bitcoin creation is controlled by the fact that it's hard-coded into the software. Nothing about this process changes as a result of demand.

You are correct about how transfers to the program works.
Bitcoins can theoretically be broken down to 8 decimal places (so you can have transactions of 0.00000001 BTC), but such small transactions would currently carry a transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC (to prevent spam transactions), which at the current exchange rate is a little more than 2 cents.

So, speaking within the libertarian framework that dominates this subreddit, you mean "Yes," because in the libertarian framework, the government is nothing but a very powerful, well-organized gang, morally indistinguishable from the Mafia. To libertarians, government-authorized force is no different from the naked violence of thugs. 
Therefore when the police arrest someone for not paying their taxes, it's literally the same thing as a bunch of gangsters breaking someone's legs for not paying the protection money. (Libertarians like to focus on taxes because of how easy they make it to compare the government to a protection racket.)

No, it does not allow you to become an exchange regardless of regulations or legal limitations. Under U.S. law, for example, someone who accepts USD bank wires and sends "USD/miscreanity" IOUs in exchange would count as a money transmitter, and would thus need to be licensed and AML/KYC compliant.
Accepting physical cash for "USD/miscreanity" doesn't bypass the problem, either, especially since Ripple is no more anonymous than the traditional banking system. If there's a such thing as "USD/miscreanity", then FinCEN can come knocking to see if the you are selling "USD/miscreanity" without a license.
Also, "USD/miscreanity" is unlikely to be widely transmissible, because there aren't likely to be any widely-trusted IOU issuers who trust you enough to accept your IOUs. Big, name-brand entities like Mt. Gox are the only ones who would be able to issue widely-transmissible IOUs in the massive amounts that would be necessary to run an exchange.
All Ripple provides is a standard protocol for handling certain portions of transactions involving licensed entities like Mt. Gox.

incentive to keep the knowledge of any transaction that offers a fee to itself, as any
other node that becomes aware of the transaction will compete to authorize first and
claim the associated fee. For example, if only a single node is aware of a transaction, it
can eliminate competition altogether by not distributing information further. With no
competition, the informed node will eventually succeed in authorizing and collect the
fee. The consequences of such behavior may be devastating: as only a single node in
the network works to authorize each transaction, authorization is expected to take a
very long time.
The flaw in this argument is that the spender's node, which originated the transaction, has an incentive to propagate that transaction to as many nodes as possible, to increase the chances that the transaction will be included in the next block. Therefore, no miner will be the only one that knows about a transaction.

Since you can't let *all* humans determine the facts (because the people you want to control would use that ability to determine the facts in a way that thwarts the control), you have to designate a special group of people who you believe can be trusted not to break the rules themselves, and to only punish who you consider to be the bad guys.

No, I don't want to die for possessing the wrong substance, or having it planted on me by a cop.

FTFY-- It is not known that they *really* have these instructions, or that the instructions are legally binding.

At least some of those *would* be lost. For example, blacklisted coins are pretty close to already being frozen, since you can't use them for anything.

It obviously isn't enough of a red flag, because I'm seeing long-time Bitcoiners in this sub offer high praise to Ripple.

Mmm, yeah, I'm going to have to go ahead and, ummm, disagree with you on that? Yeah.

The analogy doesn't even work. If you're a Web site operator and you're receiving Tor traffic, you're asking yourself if that's a hacker trying to break into your system, or a spammer delivering trash. So you block Tor traffic to defend your site.
On the other hand, if you're a store owner and someone sends you Bitcoins, you aren't likely to be worried that those Bitcoins are being used as part of an attempt to harm you. Not accepting Bitcoin payments doesn't protect you from anything.

The code isn't open, therefore nobody can fork it.

Before OpenCoin, nobody tried to pretend that Ripple was open-source or decentralized.

Provably fair gambling sites like BitZino can be implemented independently of Bitcoin.

People do get their money seized who did nothing illegal, not only by the banks, but by the police too. They don't always get it back, and even when they do, it's only years later and after spending a very large amount on lawyers. 
None of this is illegal on the banks' or the cops' part, nor did I ever say it was.

Wait until FinCEN gets their hands on it. Since it's fully under the control of a handful of corporations, it'll be easy for governments to force Ripple to become more like traditional financial services, unlike Bitcoin, where that would be impossible because nobody controls it.

So Ripple mining does exist, then, in the form of having a bot sign up for as many accounts as possible to maximize the number of free XRP you are given.


...and this begs the question: Can the Ripple founders create more XRP at will?

In this scenario, localbitcoins.com will have a detailed record of Alice's purchase of the Bitcoins, including the size of the transaction, tied to her real identity (her cell phone), which destroys any anonymity that this method supposedly provides.

Since you already have the bitcoin.org client (which is the program that actually sends and receives your bitcoins), the first thing you need to do is wait for the client to download the blockchain. At the bottom of the window it shows the number of blocks that it has received from the network. When that number matches [the number returned by this page]( your client is ready to receive bitcoins. 
Mt. Gox can be really nasty to people who don't verify their accounts properly. They've been known to wait for you to deposit money into your account, and then freeze it. I recommend buying your bitcoins at any exchange other than Mt. Gox unless you have no other choice, and if that's the case, you absolutely must send them everything they ask for, or be willing to send it if they freeze your account later. They might force you to get an apostille (a complicated, very difficult kind of notary) for your documents, so be prepared for it.
To actually buy bitcoins, you have to send fiat money to your account at the exchange. How exactly you do this depends on what country you're in. The deposit page at your exchange will list a handful of options, and additionally, BitInstant.com is available to US-based users as a way of getting USD into Mt. Gox, Bitstamp (Europe), VirWoX (Second Life), or BTC-e. 
Once you've purchased your bitcoins on an exchange, they typically sit in your account on the exchange until you withdraw them. You withdraw them by copying your bitcoin address from the bitcoin.org client into the field provided on the exchange's withdraw page. You should see the unconfirmed balance appear in your Bitcoin client immediately afterwards.

These were presented as if they were Bitcoin's most important properties, when really they're just circumstances that happen to surround Bitcoin at the moment. Little else was said in the video.

Our political system is inherently lopsided. If you want to make a positive change, such as pot legalization, it takes decades of fighting and a lot of people end up in jail in the process.
But to go the other way, it's easy: If insurance companies want a guaranteed source of income, they just ask for a new law to make their product mandatory. If the government wants to take away our rights, it just needs to wait for a big enough terrorist attack to use as propaganda. The DMCA required no struggle on the part of the MPAA and RIAA-- they just asked and politicians were eager to give it to them. Whatever the big men want, they get without a fight. In another 30 years, 10,000 people might go to jail  to abolish the PATRIOT Act. But by then, the PATRIOT Act will only be a small part of a much larger system, and the government won't even care about its repeal.

Even more unsettling is the possibility that the NSA could alert financial authorities about you just for asking on Reddit.

Formula for naysaying Bitcoin:
1. If the price is going up, complain that it's unstable.
2. If the price is going down, declare it dead.

People will anticipate that the others will sell at $100, and put their walls at $93 to make sure their coins sell first.

You could buy at a $110 "bottom" only to find that the price is on its way to $40, never to recover. Or you could sell at $160 and never be able to buy below $300 again.

The solution to this is to keep a pad of printed QR codes of Bitcoin addresses. Present this to the customer to receive payment, and keep the electronics up front next to the meter.

Aren't Ripple credits loaned into existence by its users?

As far as getting them goes, that depends on what country you're in. Localbitcoins.com is one site that serves multiple jurisdictions.
There are many places to spend them online, but if you want to spend them IRL, your success will depend on where you live, because so far they've caught on more in some places than others.
