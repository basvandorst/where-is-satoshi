Thank you for that tip, RaspPi 2 has 1go RAM so I will try to "bitcoind -dbcache=250 &amp;". 
The thing is, if it runs low on memory it will probably crash. I store the blockchain on a 64go USB drive, I should have done the initial sync on my desktop but I was not expecting it to be so long.

Hope it helps

You shouldn't expect any privacy on any public blockchain, if you want to go laundry with your coins you have better take an extra shapeshift step to Dash/Zcash/Monero. 
Shapeshift has a public contract on Ethereum where the converted coins  come out.
