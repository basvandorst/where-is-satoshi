Yes. I'm just gonna sit here and watch a drug dealer, money launderer and wanna be murderer get convicted. And it won't bother me for a second.

"This unprecedented move lower can only be met with an inevitable unprecedented move higher!"
No. Bullshit. It is nothing more than a possibility. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:36:06
Yeah. Nothing but ridiculous posts how the price imploding is actually a good thing. And in the meantime they are shitting their point. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:22:46
Don't give people advice about things you don't understand. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:35:50
He's too young to understand this. He's going through a phase. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:24:14
It's nothing but price manipulation by the big guys and the small guys following them. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:38:55
If he loses it means you're not allowed to money launder and run drug sites! There goes our freedom! 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:43:44
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:31:16
Everything is a possibility. 10 by next month is. 1000 by next month is. Technical analysis based on previous performance is pointless. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:18:56
A confirmed transaction should take 2 hours? Oh ok. Didn't realize that. I just don't understand why the rest of the world isn't jumping on it already. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:13:23
God, you sound dumb. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:24:10
And there we have the usual i have no clue about investing but i'll use some old cliche quotes anyway guy. They always show up in these kinda threads. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:05:21
Right, just because i don't like people who try to have other people killed i support the state. 
Why are you druggies always such idiots. 
Also he knew what he was doing was illegal. Then stfu if you get caught. 
This isn't about me supporting the government. It's about me not supporting criminals. Try to read that after you sobered up please. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:59:39
As always with these kind of things absolutely nothing significant will happen. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:52:23
Uh wow. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:17:24
Free energy??
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:55:45
And trash post  today. 
This place is completely retarded. This sub is a disgrace. 
Keep in mind this is what outsiders see when they Google Bitcoin. 
Paranoid drug users who support wannabe murderers, broke kids, trolls, conspiracy theorists, price pumpers and so on. 
And you wonder why Bitcoin goes to shit. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:32:20
No, it's perfectly fine. Something losing 80% of its value is obviously no reason for concern. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:41:59
Amazing logic. 
How old are you? 12?
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:27:18
And when exactly is that gonna happen?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:18:39
You think we have crystall balls here or something?
Do you realize this question is asked 5 times a day. Every day? What exactly goes on in your head when you people ask these questions? How are we supposed to know what the price will do. 
And also pretty much everyone in the last 12 months who bought based on advice from this Reddit lost money. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:53:32
Another "fact" pulled out of the Bitcoiner's ass that just keeps getting repeated till everyone believes it's true. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:06:26
And at 800 and at 700 and 600 and at 400 and at 300 and at 200. 
Stop quoting that sentence you idiots. I cringe every time i read it. 
The only people who use it are the ones who have no clue about investing. It's a dumb broke kids quote. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:20:45
You can joke all you want. Fact is you look fucking pathetic making that first comment. Not even mentioning your cultist like behavior where you can't handle any criticism of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:32:01
Why why why do you people just REFUSE to use the search. This is asked 10 times a day. Every single day! You can find your answer in literally HUNDREDS of threads!
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:49:20
20th post today asking when the price will go up. Wtf is wrong with you people? We can't look in to the future! I repeat: we CAN NOT see the future!
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:12:39
First of all stop posting in caps. 
And second asking for advice here is probably exactly the reason why you are holding a bag of expensive coins. Haven't you learned your lesson yet?
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:16:17
Because they delete it you fucking moron and probably send the user's info to LE. If they encouraged it and made it a platform for cp then they would be responsible! And go to jail when caught. 
Jesus Christ! Talking about little children. My 6 year old niece would fucking understand this! Yet you don't. Amazing. Probably brain damage from all the drugs you take. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:13:27
"I disagree with you so you must be a troll"
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:24:53
I see the internet currency of the future is working well. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:32:56
You buy or work for them. Like the rest of us. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:11:50
I thought Wall street would take us to the moon? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:28:49
Yes. And that's why he is being charged with it at the next process in Maryland. 
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:10:05
I saw that quote posted at every possible price point in the last year. I cringed every time just like i did now.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:50:43
Man, this seriously has been asked and answered several hundreds of times. Can you tell me why you people always refuse to use the search?
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:31:55
Stop trolling. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:40:01
So we're gonna post all Microsoft related news here as well?
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:15:40
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:08:38
No. He said that nowhere. Stop being so goddamn stupid in all your replies!
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:40:14
What does that mean? Is there some kind of guarantee that we will go up again? Please share. I must've missed it. 
Yes, just keep downvoting it and it will go away. Fuck reality. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:03:03
Sure. That's the only circlejerk here. There is absolutely no Bitcoin circlejerk here. 
The fact that your nonsense reply gets upvoted like crazy makes the irony almost drip out of my screen. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:33:39
Hard to believe but yes, he's serious. I cringed real hard. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:43:40
After how many days exactly am i allowed to say this?
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:24:10
Hilarious how you are getting downvoted. This place is insane. Truly insane. Bitcoiners are some of the most delusional idiots i've EVER seen. They make a lot of cults look sane. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:05:08
Don't you know? When the price goes up this place is filled with moon posts. When we go down the price isn't important. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:51:05
Yup. Everything is fine. Nothing to see here. We're about to go to the moon. We just need go to down before we go up. This is totally normal. Don't worry everyone. Losing 80% of the value doesn't mean anything!
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:00:41
There has never been a barrier. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:03:03
Do i really need to explain to you that Bitcoin doesn't behave like stocks?
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:08:58
Do you people really NEVER learn or what?
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:25:05
Where is the get rich part? It's been going down for 12 months now. 
Hilarious how this is getting downvoted. The desperation here at the moment has reached crazy levels. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:51:06
99% of this sub. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:57:28
If this is true then people are even more retarded than i thought. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:06:27
Uh so? Why is this posted here?
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:05:26
No. It isn't booming. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:26:18
The devs only had 6 years to make Bitcoin kinda usuable. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:29:00
And as always completely ignoring real life situations. Like this one:
Bitcoin has gone mainstream. And every day 100k's of transactions are done. Millions even. It is very reasonable to assume tons and of stores have their own payment system and require 1 confirmation before you can walk out with that 2000 dollar tv. 
With a block like this 1000's of people world wide will be stuck in a store for 2 hours. 
The examples here are always the same. 0 for coffee and 6 for a house. Well guess what, there are a zillion products inbetween those prices that need a quick payment but are too expensive for zero confirmations. So yes, it is a problem. 
Now watch he downvotes roll in with noone telling me where i'm wrong. As always when reality gets uncomfortable. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:12:01
Because admitting Bitcoin is in trouble is not allowed here. Look where you are man. This is the heart of the cult. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:53:13
Get real. Bitcoin is so ridiculously tiny compared to oil. It's not connected. If Microsoft and the butcher in your street are both doing bad are they connected?
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:35:34
Point out one paid shill here. Just one. That's all i ask. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:50:38
How many times have you said that since 1200?
And why did you invest so much?
Was it because everyone here said 800 is cheap and we'll be at 10k soon?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:28:46
Probably everyone on this sub telling him 1100 was cheap and we would go to 10k soon. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:21:52
Sure. You figured it all out. The only problem is bad morale. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:39:47
Oh wait. Now i'm suddenly a troll. You sad fucking idiot. 
And i don't have a main account. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:52:03
I don't see any new buyers. Could it be that nobody can be bothered picking up a currency that has been going down for a year and is surrounded by hacks and scams?
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:51:54
We reached the point in this sub where i'm gonna have to call Poe's law. 
And yes, that's sad. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:13:19
No thanks. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:46:45
What goes on in your head when you asks such questions? I see it every day here. Who is supposed to be able to answer this?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:10:25
Bitcoin is doing just fine, right?
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:37:11
Why exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:10:32
So your only reason why it will go up again is because you think so?
Uhm wow. 
And could it be you think so because you own several expensive coins?
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:13:08
How old are you?
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:40:33
Don't worry. The free market will sort it out. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:21:33
Sure. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:29:11
No. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:36:00
Yes. If you're a complete lunatic conspiracy theorist. Which we have plenty here. 
But anyone with common sense would quickly realize this would be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:53:53
I don't see the demand going up?
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:55:26
You don't know this. It's based on nothing but hope. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:43:37
As always. Hours after the news has broken and it's been on the mainpage you again post it. I seriously wonder if there is something wrong with you. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:26:26
Affecting. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:30:51
Stop lying. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:22:44
The lower the price goes the more desperate and retarded these threads are getting. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:36:33
Yes. Also for the 10 people before you who posted the same thing. This happens every single time something goes down. 20 people asking if everyone else has the same problem. 
When will you learn to read before you post? Is this really such a hard concept to understand?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:30:42
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:58:35
Wait. My account should be of a certain age before i can apply rational thought? Seriously? How rational does that sound to you?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:40:42
What makes you think you can sell them at a higher price in the future?
Edit: maybe the people who are downvoting me can answer this?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:57:09
Every 15 mins we get this topic. Should i buy or not? 
WE CAN'T SEE THE FUCKING FUTURE!
Nobody here has a crystal ball and knows what the price will do and if you will make money or not! Stop asking this pointless shit ffs!
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:39:06
Goddamnit. You must be trolling or something. You can't be this fucking stupid and be allowed to use the internet on your own. Impossible.
