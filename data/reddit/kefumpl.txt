Ah I see, I was just a bit confused earlier, but I would really want to invest into bitcoin but I'm not sure if now is the time to do so.

Scam? I have been subscribed to this subreddit for a while, and I know there are a lot of scammers when it comes to Bitcoin but it's a bit pessimistic to say everyone is a scammer lol.

You have a fair point, but that would require them switching from Bitcoin to USD or other currencies to donate, I'm just trying to make it easier and make a difference, you know?

Yeah, I understand that, but I would be talking about accepting donations in the post (if I'm allowed to of course) and on the rules it states that you can't ask for donations unless it is for a charity, I just want to confirm they agree to this charity

I see everyone saying atms are bad, for mine it's a 6.4% buying fee, where else can I get Bitcoin that easily? Coinbase is very limited as you have to provide ID and be over 18 I believe?

With coinbase though, don't you have to be over 18 and provide ID and all that to be able to buy Bitcoin? The atm I use charges 6.4% and I just slot some cash in and it goes straight to my wallet

My atm is 6% fee and I don't need to provide ID at all, makes buying Bitcoin very easy

Even if your comment was valid and he enabled all this shit other administrators of the original and people that ran silk road 2 only received 3-5 years, not what Ross got, it's injustice.
