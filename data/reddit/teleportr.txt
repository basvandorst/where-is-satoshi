You need to distinguish *community* and *perceived community*


Maybe weakening confidence is what this manufactured crisis is all about?


Good point! If the (perceived) majority would really be that ignorant then Bitcoin would not work with them (yet). Even though the *technology* has become surprisingly resilient the *sociology* needs to be resilient too.
Forking off a Visa Coin (and see it fail) is a great learning experience though. This form of education can consolidate the community and make it much more manipulation-proofed.

The discussion has been allowed. It lasted about two years.
At a certain point everything had been said enough times and there came up the need for *non-blocked* communication channels to be able to focus on much more important issues...

Not true. A bitcoin transaction is a bitcoin transaction is a bitcoin transaction.
You can create a bitcoin transaction, you can sign it, you can store it, you can send it to the network, you can get it validated, you can have it included and confirmed in the blockchain..
..all time it has been a *bitcoin transaction*.

They are fixing that problem. Increasing transaction throughput.
They are just unwilling to apply a "solution" that would not really fix the problem but introduce new ones.

If it turned out the *perceived* economic majority is different from the *real* economic majority then Classic might need to it! Lukely they already have the code

Lightning Network transactions ARE real Bitcoin transactions. They are not distinguishable.
Imagine keeping your funds in shared (multisig) wallets and exchanging (real Bitcoin) transactions off-chain, such that at any time everyone *could* enforce these transaction on-chain to get funds in singlesig wallets. So there is no need to trust anyone. But as long as everyone is cooperating there is no need to use the slow and expensive blockchain for every micro-payment. It is like zero-conf transactions that are secure. (Maybe one could view them as minus-seven-conf transactions?)
The only drawback is that funds are locked for some time which is a good trade-off for getting near instant payments almost for free.
Lightnig Networks are possible today and early implementations exist. They can scale Bitcoin to planetary scale.

Proirity: Grow faster! regardless if it wrecks the whole network.
Priority: Grow robust! regardless if it takes more time - survive!

Not the ideal outcome, but if a controversial hard fork happened this would be the fairest way to do it.
The network value would split and both groups could make decisions aligned with their priorities. 
Visa Coin could grow fast at max scale to compete with paypal. Would it survive technologically?
Core Coin could remain max resilient and impossible to control. Would it survive economically?
If this happened I would sell my visa coin and buy more core coin. I'm in it for the long term :)

there is a reason Bitcoin is a free and open source software project.
Why hasn't it been a "well managed" company that conceived and developed Bitcon?
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:45:10
If that is the case then scaling is obviously not that urgent. A hard fork would take even much longer then 
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:13:03




Opening and closing channels is done with standard multisig Bitcoin txns. 
You can think of LN as 0-conf (or -1 conf) with trustless guarantees. Funds are (time) locked in shared multisig wallets such that everyone can access all his coins eventually. To make payments we simply exchange signed (real Bitcoin) txns (off-chain) such that the coins that everyone can eventually access change. 
Receiving a payment you get instant confirmation (i.e. guarantee) that you can access your coins (eventually) even in case someone behaves untrustworthy. Txns only need to go on-chain to settle disputes or to move funds between shared wallets for routing topology optimizations. In my personal opinion this is the greatest thing since the invention of Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:08:17
So the attack is to produce blocks that take (too) long to validate?
Block size increases this vulnerability quadratically. Classic/XT introduce a new max txn size limit to mitigate this. SegWit on the other hand increases this vulnerabilty only linearly because the size of sigops are not "discounted". With (linearly) faster signature validation in 0.12 (due to libsec256k1) the txn throughput capacity can scale without increasing this attack risk. Do I understand this correctly?
@_date: 2016-02-05 13:20:06
Yes it's confusing. There are two types of "*consensus*"
One is the *satoshi (proof-of-work) consensus* which miner use to (vote) order txns into blocks to arrive at a consistent shared global ledger. Changes are "consensus critical" in this regard if they change the rules of what is considered a valid block. 
The other one is *community consensus*. 100% is required for *satoshi consensus critical* changes since there is risk of splitting the network if incompatible changes are deployed. 100% *consensus* is not required for changes that are not *satoshi consense critical*. Such changes can safely be deployed voluntarily without any risk for the rest of the network.

Android is (part) open source but closed governance like a company.
I think the point holds that *free software* is not the best model to market polished mainstream consumer products that are "successful" in immediate profits. It's just not its strength. Open source governance excels at delivering technological quality extraordinair that is resilient and solid to rely upon. It empowers and enables enterprises to build products and services on top of it who cater to the needs of paying customers.
tl;dr bitcoin does not need to *be* like a "customer product". That's what's left as business opportunities to the industry. Many smart companies *get* Bitcoin and build amazing products *with* it.  
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:07:10
The scenario you paint actually gives me hope. It would be the fairest way to simply split into two coins that can compete on different priorities and values.
One would value efficiency and growth (at any cost) for fastest possible mainstream adoption. It would be run "economically" like a startup company pushed by speculative mass investor interest. It could very well show the world fast what's possible and even beyond ...
The other would value resilience, sovereignty, antifragility (at any cost) to retain its unique distinguishing *permissionless* and *trustless* nature. It would stay organised like an opensource project where nobody has any power at all and it is technology that determines speed of growth. It would be hard to influence, disrupt or destroy...
I would really like to bet on what I consider more important for long-term survival/success and not having to discuss/share with people who have different priorities. We could try both and see what works better: *Technologists running economies of scale* or *Economists running technology at scale!*
After all nobody can really know how it would play out. This is unchartered territory.
That's why I *feel* uncomfortable projecting such a smooth *happy split scenario*. Mike Hearn once stated that a hard fork could easily wreck Bitcoin. There is a lot that can go wrong that we simply can't think of. It worries me that the very people responsible for Bitcoin surviving up to this point technically unanimously think it is risky. People who claim to know it could be save tend not to have a public track record in defending and maintaining large scale networks on a day to day basis. In any case we would loose a lot network effects even if one coin would long-term survive economically *and* technologically.
The whole debate has huge educational impact on the whole community. It appears to become much more socially resilient. Random redditors now understand technical details of LN! That's why I still have hope that the forces tearing us apart are weaker than the forces tying us together. We are all in this together. Bitcoin becomes stronger.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:17:09


If Bitcoin is not a "nerd product" in your line of thinking but a "consumer product" then your arguments are consistent and understandable.


me too :) Full ACK!


Another way to look at it is that *free software* does not intend to please any "customers". People work voluntarily for *free* and in *freedom* to do what's important to *themselves*. There are no paying "costumers". Contributors scratch their own itches but *anyone* is free to contribute.
Free software *evolves* organically. A streamlined company can produce results much faster and more planable. But *free software* tends to reach much higher quality, robustness and longevity. That's why this kind of collaboration seems to prevail over conventional organisation when it comes to groundwork *commons* providing solid and reliable foundations to build *stuff* upon. Like e.g. successful costumer products. 


Rather than short-term ROI a different metric to measure "successfulness" could be: How much value does a piece of tech provide to the world over its lifetime? In the grand scheme of history Windows/iOS could very well just remain a barely noticeable short blib of relevance. 


Arguably *the internet* runs on linux and tcp/ip and many successful companies build on top of this resilient foundation. Most paying customers do not (need to) know how the IP protocol works or how their android linux kernel powers their opensource browser to send http protocol msges via tcp/ip to get and render dynamic html... Mainstream users operate on many layers above that and pay companies to make *the internet* accessible to them. Open Source technology merely *empowers* and *enables* business opportunities...
@_date: 2016-02-09 08:21:12


That would make transaction fees much cheaper. Obviously cheap fees will drive adoption (because users only care about fees). The price would surely go up and we would all become rich :) Where can I cast my democratic vote for this?
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:31:05
There is so much half-truths, desinformation and misunderstanding floating around that you can't really blame anyone beeing confused. I understand being frustrated having to explain the same issues over and over again but at least we are learning as a community. This whole debate makes the whole community much more resilient against social manipulation. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:52:53


It is difficult to judge this based on online activity as this can so easily be faked. I did not yet meet anyone in real life pushing for hard forks, although this is not a very meaningful metric too ;) My assessment stem from the years-long discussions where a lot of different perspectives changed a lot of different opinions until it converged into a shared compromise that included all of these aspects and views.  


Thank You! I do appreciate that! Your post looks genuine. That's why I answered.
Nevertheless it puzzles me why there is so much fighting. My personal *subjective* experience is that for some it's just about finding anything to be *against* the devs. Many times by using their own arguments from long passed discussions in order to discredit them and make them loose influence. It is just my subjective impression and might be wrong.


Of course this is ok. This is why opensource works. Nobody has any power. Influence is earned by repeatedly proofing *worthy of being be trusted*. You can not abuse trust without immediatelly loosing it as everything happens out in the open. That's why I have a hard time to trust these incompatible fork attempts since motivations, affiliations and communications are intransparent and obscure. There hasn't been any convincing argument important enough to risk splitting the network. Also one does not proof *trustworthy* by launching personal attacks towards people with a long track record of trustworthiness who disclose everything out in the open. Again just my subjective impression.


*Scale-ability* is the *ability* to *scale*. Once the limits to *scale* are reached it is not a *solution to scalability* to simply exceed those limits. "*Real scalability solutions*" increase the systems *ability* (i.e. limits) to *scale*. Yes, I'm playing with words here :)


Did anyone sayt 1MB *is* the limit? I remember proposing 2-4-8 a long time ago. IIRC the disussion has been about *how* and *when* to increase, not *if*. The argument has been that nobody can really know the limits to scale and that we should be cautious. SegWit became possible due to libsec256k1 speed improvments and - as you stated above - scaling is only a side effect of it. The main benefit is fixing technical debt of the past and enabling *scalabilty* in the future...
The technical differences are so minor after all this debating that I can really not understand why we don't just agree and move on. Why fork the community, split the network and risk wrecking Bitcoin? This can not be a technical reason.

I'm sorry. I tried to be unbiased :/ and do not want to contribute to the emotionality.
Please help me become more unbiased. Are you talking about the last paragraph? I do feel that way. How should I handle that? Is it better to not show it?
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:00:21
This is not a power hierarchy but a *network of trust*.
The reason some have more *influence* than others is because they are *trusted* more since they have repeatedly prooven to be *trustworthy*. They do not have any more *power* than you and me as they could not abuse their influence without immediatelly loosing it. *Trust* requires everything to happen out in the open which makes corruption visible and obvious.
It would be awesome to see more companies contributing value and earn trust and influence.

feedback loop:
*design leads development*
*development informs design* 
Are Bittorrent, Linux or Git "customer products"? 
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:55:51
Honest *serious* discussion leads to shared understanding. Shared understanding leads to shared consensus. If we share the same assumtions and information then we will come to the same conclusions. SegWit emerged as *shared consensus* after lots ... of discussion. W.r.t all discussion so far It is considered the best tradeoff.


Clearly everyone wants to scale. The question is *how* to do it the *fastest* and *most secure*.


That's a very good question! Objectively SegWit is  the fastest and safest proposaI so far and does also fix urgent issues and lots of technical debt. So why should anyone (informed) be against it? The discourse looks not to be about scaling, but about political control. Heavy disagreement can be very constructive as long as everyone genuinely wants to find the best solution. Fighting SegWit at this point looks more like desperately looking for arguments to discredit our most trusted and most valuable contributors. Why?


As I understand it SegWit does increase txn throughput without increasing vulnerabilities. This is one of the reasons it's considered superior. What attack you are specifically refering to?


Isn't that great? It fixes urgent issues AND provides more scale?


Yes it is the *"easiest"* and most obvious *proposal* and has been proposed many years ago. It is not a *solution* to scalability as it does not make Bitcoin any more *able to scale*. It just increases capacity beyond what is currently considered the limit of safe scale. 


Yes, we don't have "real scaling solutions" ready yet. So far we only have proposals and early prototypes of "*real scaling solutions*", like IBLT, Weak Blocks, Thin Blocks and Lightening... These proposals make Bitcoin *able to scale* beyond what is safe now.
Let's not further distract, disrupt (and harrass) the people who are able to implement this. We owe to them that Bitcoin survived so far and that it could scale so far.  Let us show some appreciation and respect for that.

Nobody wants to keep blocks at 1MB. That has been a straw man all along.
The debate is about *how* to increase the blocksize in the safest and fastest way.
One side thinks that a hard fork is faster and technology should follow political pressure.
The other side thinks that a soft fork is faster and growth should follow technological maturity.
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:13:56


You are talking about Lightning. Every LN txn IS a standard multisig Bitcoin txn.  There are many valuable applications for multsig txns. Lightning is one of them.
Why do you not want developers to "push" and enable *real scalabilty solutions*?
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:26:52
Is this the above mentioned "attack vector"? How does it work?
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:22:08


Interesting question! If an invalid txn got into a block because it looked anyone-can-spend to non-upgraded ones then that block would probably be orphaned. 
Softforks only ever activated with 95% of miners upgraded which should mitigate that risk. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:46:11
It is truly a sad thread.
Both sides polarize and disrupt open honest discussion. 
All opinions are valid. No black and white.Only trade-offs.
All arguments have been reiterated enough times. At least we as a community understand the security/scale trade-offs pretty well now (in theory). The resulting proposed solutions are very similar in effective capacity increase. So why is there still fighting? Why are we allowing the precious time of our brightest minds to be wasted by forcing them to play politics? Bitcoin is loosing.

These are no formal "definitions" - just two separate uses of the word consensus
