381,203,801 what? I'm sure it will break a lot of different 381,203,801, but probably not 381,203,801 USD.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:53:22
If you could locate wallet addresses of people that are on the inside of a government that frequently bans Bitcoin and watch for those coins to be bought/sold then their could be big profits.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:32:06
Is this good or bad?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:08
Becky could please us all! I got 3rds!!!
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:51:27
Or, maybe they are doing the opposite of that?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:19:50
Blood on the streets!!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:01:49
Di you buy in time? It looks like the price is going back up.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:36:16
What a loser. Checking the value of a Bitcoin versus the USD is so like 2013 or something.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:58:52
That's what old people do too.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:44:54
This is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:01:02
I'm not sure it works this way.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:55:25
Or, if they came after people with their guns and stole all their Bitcoin then they could get at least 65% of all Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:57:10
It has at least 5 meaning.

What happened to Bitcoin prices during last government shutdown?
Monday, Sept. 30 to Thursday, Oct. 17, 2013
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:55:30
I'm not sure that I understand the words that are coming out of your mouth. I'm just going to buy Bob Coin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:23:02
It looks like it is about to dump down to $10,000.

That could have covered their HUGE pension funds forever. But, don't worry, the tax payers will cover it, though!

Pizza will never go up in value and Bitcoin might go up in value so it is a bad trade.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:43:11
I would have to set up a first ponzi scheme before I could set up another.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:47:59
I might actually start eating KFC when I am in Canada now. Probably not.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:06:40
It has lost a larger percentage than $20,000 to $1,000 already. That is a 95% drop. It fill from like $30 to $2 a while back and $1200 to $160. $1,000 is possible.

@_date: 2018-01-24 10:29:13
And it made a lot of us poorer also
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:21:41
I love government regulation. I wish they would assign me certain times to go to the bathroom.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:56:03
I'm 43% sure that you are making this up.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:09:49
No, that is a good point. I'm sure there are many more users that have their Bitcoins stashed away. The price won't go that far down and if it does, it will be a flash crash quickly recovering afterwards.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:48:38
You will have to wait 6 confirmations before eating it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:45:53
So, should we buy Alice Coin or Bob Coin?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:21:32

@_date: 2018-01-02 10:57:07
A "History" section would be nice.

It might crash to $1000 but it will never hit $100 again.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:14:43
It isn't easy being cheesy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:03:34
Whats that? Like 15 Bitcoins?

@_date: 2017-12-27 02:36:58
Approximately 2011
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:10
What's that, like 600 bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:13:46
And it hasn't even hit $100,000.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:40
Bitcoin is so versatile.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:21:49
I would say it is huge news.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:36:44
General Bitcoin users in 2013 were A LOT more technical than the current audience. It has approached the mainstream people and they are not the brightest bulbs on the Xmas tree.

@_date: 2017-12-16 17:52:30
Facebook is one company. Cryptocurrency covers the entirety of international digital currencies. This nothing to be proud of. Once it exceeds the EURO, CNY or USD, then we can start gloating.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:02:38
Didn't it already jump up past 11K and down and then up again already?

a 30% flash crash wouldn't even be news
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:14:13

@_date: 2018-03-02 17:09:43

Isn't that lower? You aren't the brightest apple on the tree, huh?
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:22:04
Why not try to pay your bills with Bitcoin directly?
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:33:53
We are just one of the many alternate cryptocurrency spaces.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:11:02
It was odd that it went up to $20,000 and odd that it didn't crash faster.

@_date: 2018-03-16 08:36:09


Bitcoin has value for many more reasons that this. There are many things that are cryptographically secure but hold no value.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:42:10
Bitcoin is actually very sensitive - it cares about almost everything. I would argue that Bitcoin has bi-polar with its' intense mood swings.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:20:56
COL! (Cry Out Loud)
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:20:17
Start your own new coin or token. There are so very few available on the market that it would be sure to take off no matter what it does.
@_date: 2018-03-05 05:16:19
They are just trying to get higher ratings.
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:35:01
True. This should be moved to r/CryptoCurrency
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:52:14
I wonder what kind of currency that is.
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:22:30

@_date: 2017-09-30 08:02:49
no, because I don't want to be like them idiots in that video
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:08:49
Will GOX ever re-open? I sure hope so. I heard they had some really good trading going on there.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:27:15
We get to go wayyyy back to!
@_date: 2017-09-27 08:52:38
I seen it
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:11:25
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:57:31
if the price stays exactly the same
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:46:01
Is this why the price is crashing? Everybody can finally move their Bitcoins to an exchange to sell without paying a $10 fee.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:42:07
That actually looks more like two of the many reasons.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:26:10
He should get another prosecution for calling our Bitcoin a fraud.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:22:53
True. Also, apples are similar to oranges because they both hang from a stem on a tree. They can also both be peeled.

@_date: 2018-02-15 12:43:23
In some situations, that is true. But, overall, a single human brain still has more processing power than all the computers on the planet combined. This won't be the case for long. Soon, one computer will have more processing power than all the brains on the planet.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:19:48
Is the dip to $3000 expected?
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:51:26
No kidding, huh? What a bunch of morons out there that don't do this.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:01:20
Mother fuck BoA. Them bitches robbed my broke ass! Fuck them mother fuckers! Digital currencies t to the moon!!!
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:37:18
Risky game you are playing! What if the price plummets to $5K and then an emergency happens where you have to sell a majority of them?
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:23:14
sorry, my bad
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:11:54
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:31:36

It's magical internet money.

Nope! Not anymore:

I feel for ya, man
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:04:59
They are so fast to figure stuff out.
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:57:59
not to be rude, but you have the tools for an international revolution but yet you sit on your thumbs 
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:47:32
I'm glad I didn't buy Bitcoin at $3500
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:57:21
Don't all Asian words start with either Sa, Toshi, Naka or Moto?
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:43:20
Bitcoin always crashes until it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:22:29
It looks like a 7 year old drew the picture.
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:31:28
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:04:34
Don't panic sell at the bottom if the price ever crashes 80%

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:31:36
Florida or Georgia?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:43:21
It more like digits.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:28:28
This one shows but not my last. What is the explanation?
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:01:44
What about the market cap in 100 years?
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:21:35
It's not going to be just Bitcoin's market valuation but rather the entirety of cryptocurrencies market valuation.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:23:33
Why would a millionaire want a Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:22:32
Hopefully the price will fall back to $9,000 so we can make some $9,000 memes. That would be really special.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:51:50


I learn everything I need to know from r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:00:34
Bitcoin was created in 08/09, why the government panic just now?
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:18:34
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:30:03
I wonder if anybody has ever created a meme for Bitcoin hitting $9,000?
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:30:23
Completely unrelated.

Bitcoin is like a cat on steroids.

Each "candle" from left to right is a period of time. The bottom of the bottom vertical line is the low price for that period and the top of the top vertical line is the high price for that period. The top and bottom of the rectangle between the top &amp; bottom vertical lines is where the price starts and finishes in that period. If the rectangular box is red then it started at the top of it and ended at the bottom. If the rectangular box is green then it started at the bottom and ended at the top.

Yoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, told me that Bitcoin will be rocketing too.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:09:35
Maybe you should wait for a Bitcoin sale before buying? Sometimes they cut the price by up to 80% for a while.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:03:49
no, i'm pretty sure this is the beginning of bitcoin going mainstream
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:37:28
There will always be enough to pay the miners.

Looks like it is still going to go further up.

Or, they support it just so they can dump their fork coins and make a profit.

Why don't he put his money where his mouth is and open up some massive shorts all across the exchanges? He could short Bitcoin right down to zero and make endless billions of dollars!

It's not too hard to fathom because now $1 trillion is worth more than all bitcoins. Just switch around the dot and look at the graphs. It's forecast to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:23:04

What is that? Like a half percent?

I think Bitcoin is too specific while each other item is generic. "Cryptocurrencies" would be better suited for this chart. Adding Bitcoin is like adding Android or Apple instead of smartphones.

The Easter Bunny says "No!" to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:02:35
If patterns persist like you are suggesting, shouldn't it go to like $6000 before it crashes again?
