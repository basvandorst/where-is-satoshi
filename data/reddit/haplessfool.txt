I agree with you when speaking quantitatively about Bitcoin; however, in an inflationary economy, people add interest to ensure the purchasing value of the principal they lend is maintained - I.e, if the interest rate on a loan I give you is pegged to inflation, when you pay me back I actually haven't made any real purchasing power, only quantity of dollars.
The fascinating thing about a deflationary economy is that these economic systems we're familiar and comfortable with get flipped on their heads. That doesn't necessarily break the deflationary idea, though; people not trusting the deflationary economy is what breaks it.
In the loan situation, I would give you a loan with *negative* interest, tied to the deflationary rate of the currency. You would pay me back a lower quantity of bitcoin, but its purchasing power would remain the same.
The psychological barrier to this working is that people always want more - even when they don't really understand why. For instance wages: they haven't gone up in years, but the dollar has inflated, meaning over time, people are getting paid less in terms of pure utility; however, no one protests or complains because the dollar amount stays the same. A 10% raise after five years seems great! Except if inflation was 3% over the course of that time, they've actually *lost* 5% of their paycheck - yet they profusely thank their employers.
It'll be interesting to see how the deflationary theory permeates through society, and whether this will cause people to think more about the inflationary economy they exist in today.

I've never been as screwed as these guys, but I've definitely been in some serious shit. The smile is a defensive mechanism. When you're completely, utterly screwed, sometimes the only thing you can do is smile and pretend it's all going to be alright.

If you're using Android, get mycelium. If you have iOS, use blockchain. Both have "import private key" options. Create a new wallet. Make sure to transfer to your newly made address once the paper wallet is imported!

That's because the transaction information is included in the information the bank has. Because it's built in, nobody needs to ask you for it. The banks comply, and it doesn't even cross your mind. Only when you are directly asked for this information does it register as strange. &gt;I've dealt in similar figures on my bank accounts both business and personal and was never asked about it.  Maybe I just have a trustworthy face though after the initial account setup I did all banking online.

Can anyone help me understand his cell phone manufacturer analogy? It strikes me as confusing purchasing power with quantity of currency. If it takes one bitcoin to make a cell phone today, I don't necessarily need to sell if for at least one bitcoin to break even; if the purchasing power of Bitcoin has risen due to its deflationary characteristics, I only need to sell that cell phone for an equal purchasing value of bitcoin, not the same quantity.
This is where I think his argument breaks down. Before informational liquidity, sticky prices prevented a plausible deflationary economy. As prices become more fluid due to the market reacting faster to new information, this barrier is lifted.

First legitimate answer I've read in this thread. This, I agree with.

Does cash just fall into your pocket? If you were operating a cash business, you would still need to account for every dollar over a certain amount. Normally we don't have to do our own oversight and accounting; banks do that, except for checks and cash - and checks have a "memo" line (easily abused, admittedly). Cash businesses file physical receipts, even if personally customer info isn't included. We're not working with banks anymore, and yet for Bitstamp to operate legally within the United States, they need to provide the same information that banks normally do. They're asking you directly, which makes it feel strange, since normally that doesn't happen. Point is, regardless of cash medium, that info is requested.

Ah, I see: If potential profitability isn't greater than the deflation rate, there's no point in going into business. This is, of course, only if that rate is exorbitantly high. 
It's inflationary counterpart is that if inflation is greater than potential profits, they might add well spend that money on goods and services right now, ones that will retain their relative value. If few enough people make cell phones, the prices should go up enough to make it worth it  in both situations, though.

The underlying argument against Bitcoin is that inflation *isn't* bad, as it incentivizes the creation of wealth. Doing nothing means your principal is losing value. Investing it, spending it now, etc, all stimulates the economy. Thus, inflation is actually a good thing. *Hyperinflation*, on the other hand...
A store of value that deflates, like BTC, is (once no new coins are being created, we're looking at lost coins reducing circulation and increasing the value of the coins people hold) incentivizing people to hold, as spending later maximizes value. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:06:47
I'm with you in that as a store of value it's too risky. The utilityI see manifesting us in quick conversion for transfer I'd wealth, limiting volatility while still saving merchants from credit fees. In any case, it's too early to tell, and there are still some technological kinks that need to be worked out (block size limits incentivizing higher fees, reducing competitiveness with current payment systems). We'll see!
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:11:31
Can you provide more options besides buying as a speculative investment/store of wealth and buying to use as a payment system? I can't think of anything else they could be used for.
You're absolutely right that the general layman would choose the third option of not using Bitcoin at all; however, it's becoming increasingly obvious that a small bit significant payment  infrastructure is developing - an infrastructure that adds genuine utility to Bitcoin. 
Services like Bitpay allow this infrastructure to exist without exposing merchants to volatility by converting to USD immediately. My argument is that anyone who would convert USD to BTC inherently has incentive to spend, if only to take advantage of the current value in the face of potential loss due to market swings.

While you're right concerning the run up, and the similarity between that and tulips, I think OP is referring to the utility Bitcoin promises, which tulips didn't hold.

Thanks for the interesting perspective! I'm constantly on the search for contrary opinion, in an effort to stay neutral.

miners priorities transactions by fees. The protocol doesn't require it, but increasingly, miners are leaving zero-transaction fees by the wayside.

Thanks for the clarification!

I find a logical disconnect in the deflationary disincentive argument:
If the rising value of Bitcoin is a disincentive to spending it, doesn't that provide an argument for not spending dollars on anything else? Why spend dollars on anything but Bitcoin if you know the price is going up? If your answer is the volatility, you're providing a reason to spend them. The two beliefs are cognitively dissonant. You either believe the price will rise, meaning you've converted all your cash to Bitcoin, or your wary of the possibility of a crash, meaning you'd never convert. The only way these two thoughts reconcile is through a willingness to spend Bitcoins, taking advantage of their current value, as their future value is uncertain.
Thoughts? I'm not a professional; I don't have a degree in economics or finance, however I read quite a bit about it and, in the meantime, have made quite a bit investing in equity/currency. I'd love your perspective as someone who's actually studied the material in an accredited program!

But you can write these state taxes off of your federal tax return. Moot point. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:29:40
Your article completely overlooks the possibility of technical problems killing Bitcoin. If the block size limit isn't fixed, If fees don't remain competitive, then the incentive for mass adoption is lost. 
Never be unwilling to consider the alternative to your point of view.
