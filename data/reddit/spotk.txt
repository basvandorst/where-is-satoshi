Why is this better than openid? They talk about ecdh but that's not really required here. We use SSL to verify the identity of the server and that has wide support on the web. OAuth provides one login for many websites. I just don't see what this brings to the table that isn't already there?

He says that it is not suitable as a currency because it is too volatile. He also calls it insecure. I don't really see why the title says he's speaking positively.
Edit: He is not pro-bitcoin. He is of the opinion that virtual currencies are the future but not bitcoin in its current form. This is the standard line that the old guard has taken around the world. They all want a virtual currency that bends to their will. That is "fixed" from birth by them.

Early in the year there was the transaction malleability bug. It brought transactions to a halt for a 24 hour period as somebody DoSed the network with fake transactions.

All the miners are made in china. All computing equipement is too.

Is there someone you trust who can secure it for you?

This is the problem with stealth addresses. No standard format yet. No BIP. The goal post is constantly being moved. I suggest holding off implementing it until they publish a standard.

No it's saved on to your hard disk to seed the random number generator for when you boot from the hard drive for the first time.

If he were speaking realistically he would not be calling it insecure. It is secured by cryptography and is very secure. It is users who mess up.

Yes. Entropy is generated from disk activity, network activity as well as mouse and keyboard activity during installation. So if you've installed a linux distro you've seeded it with plenty of entropy.


Not sure about armory. Electrum uses /dev/urandom. A seed is only 128 bits so it's ok to use urandom over random. The default for openssl is also urandom.

Zoom out to all time:
It's like there were no miners before this year.

Did you always have 2fa on the wallet or was it without 2fa for a long time in the past?

Get ready to be humbled further then.

Do they use thermal printers? Those will fade over time.

Terrible name:
- 3 capital letters means camel case taken to extremes. 
- Paypal is not going to be happy.

Hardly. They fade within months.

LOL a commitee decided on the name? 
About paypal, I meant because of the name. bitpal and paypal sound similar. Trademark and so on and so forth.

Forget faultcoins. Stick with bitcoin.

Virtual currencies not bitcoin specifically. Don't you see. This is the same thing central bankers in the west are saying. We like the blockchain but not bitcoin. In other words they want to create a virtual currency of their own. One which is shaped by them.

The internet was a DARPA project so a government did invent it :)
