If you know Python or understand code at least enough to know what parts of the tutorial to change out, [this]( gives instructions on how to set up a Reddit bot to do pretty much the same thing.

But could she set up the mail with no help from you?

Not supporting someone who holds a common enemy is not an act of allegiance to that enemy, so no.

The thing is, this sort of thing actually happened when cash was made legal tender. There were several Supreme Court cases over it. So, the same arguments will pass through bitcoin and anything similar until it eventually becomes a currency standard, and then a new, better system will eventually repeat the cycle for however long we continue to use any form of money.

And what would be the benefit of an entire new laptop over an immensely cheaper LiveCD?

No, I'm a socialist.

Because regardless of if you word it with an escape route, the sentence still tries to proclaim that the subreddit is a homogeneous anti-Nooku hoard. That and I often get tired of the reverse psychology give-me-upvotes-to-prove-me-wrong attempts.

While I entirely agree with your point, I feel it necessary to downvote for the last bit of bullshit stereotyping.
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:04:21
Yes, but then when the price plummets, people would attack this because it buys them back into something that is failing. Of course, that's only people who aren't actually committed to bitcoin, but then isn't buying back the coins you spent since you could lose out on sell prices later also a sign of not being truly committed to it as a currency? Would you buy back your holdings in USD with euros after spending the USD in case you buy something for $10 in case you could sell back the USD for €1000 after a few years?

I read it more like if someone had an iron mine, they distributed the iron, and then they had a magnet that just sucked the iron back into their mine for their profit. It's not that they're saying you have to go back to the point of origin to use the coins, just that the source of the coins can take them back without your consent.

Ok, maybe if we can get 2 or so more people, I'll set something up.
I would, but I currently have pretty much no money to spare for the organizer fees as I spent everything on a new computer. I might set it up for the lowest subscription after I get more, but not at the moment.
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:55:57
I know; I never said I was a genius for it; I just said I decided against doing this only for another company to go through with it.

It's like a BTC farmer's market.
  
It'd be great if there was a meetup in Charleston like that. Instead we get the [first police seizure of bitcoins](
@_date: 2013-07-27 03:00:37
I'll likely do that in the morning once I'm not too tired to really think much about it. I always seem to forget about things like Meetup. :P

I use VirWoX, buy SLL (Second Life Linden dollars) with USD from PayPal, then exchange the SLL for BTC. You lose some to exchange rates, but you at least get to buy indirectly with PayPal.
They'll ask for Second Life avatars and stuff when registering, but you can type gibberish and still do all of the transactions without the need of the Second Life avatars.
If you do use VirWoX, I'd appreciate if you used my referral link:

Ok, if I can find 1 more person or so, I'll organize it. Location would probably be somewhere downtown, maybe at Marion Square or a restaurant or something depending on what works out better.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:15:37
Nothing that I'm aware of.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:05:10
Ah, true, forgot about that. :P
I'm a moron.
Probably should just delete this now.
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:54:19
I doubt it; the only two people I told barely know any coding whatsoever and still mock this too.
@_date: 2013-07-26 02:31:53
I proposed this idea to a couple friends back in around May, and they all laughed at me. If this project ends up being a success, I'm going to have a newfound hatred of peer-pressure.
  
But yeah, I am really interested in a BTC debit card and to see if it takes off, as it'd just be so much easier than current phone-based methods. I'll definitely be checking back in on it in August.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:48:39
If it would be browser-based, I'd be good for any JavaScript/jQuery stuff and HTML. Otherwise, I know minuscule amounts of Java that may help, but I wouldn't be of much use.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:18:15
Is VirWoX under DDoS? I haven't been since yesterday when I bought .12BTC, and it seemed fine at that point.
@_date: 2013-07-27 02:42:49
Mostly just because I'm a 16-year-old with little money, time and connections to anything to invest in publicizing it and such, but I might try putting one together once school starts back up in a few weeks and I can get back together with other people that'll likely be interested.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:12:30
Nothing ever really did since all of the interest was limited to what's on this thread, but if everyone else is still interested, 4 people seems enough to do a thing. I can't effectively set anything more than just a "hey, show up at Smoky Oak if you want to talk about bitcoins"-type thing up do to exam season school load and such, but if someone else organizes, I'd be interested.
@_date: 2013-07-28 07:24:38
Up over on Someone's already copy-pasted the original I accidentally deleted over onto bitkoins.com. Cool, maybe it'll gain traction.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:37:31
That'd be great, and if anyone starts working on a website to do this, I'd be happy to help write JavaScript/jQuery and HTML for it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:21:52
Mine, too. I mean, what's the problem with that, since everything on the Internet is true?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:09:30
The excessive typos make me suspicious. I'll try it, but I'm not going to expect it to work until I get something.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:51:19
Yes, I agree that bitcoin or any of the altcoins may not be the final destination of cryptocurrencies, and the contrary is likely true. Standard currencies weren't the final result of currency, or else we'd still be using shekels or shells or something along those lines, so why should these be? I was just refuting the specific arguments you posed against bitcoin in this one thread.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:31:44
Actually, [you can]( it's just not very efficient. The thing about recreating bitcoin and calling it something else is that they are still two different coins that have two different blockchains that cannot be interchanged. Your argument would also invalidate the existence of the US dollar because the euro could be used instead, and if not that, invalidates the US dollar because people can buy the metals and machinery necessary to mint their own coins. However, minting counterfeit coins doesn't even necessarily relate to bitcoin because of the fact that only the coins consistent with the blockchain are valid. The coins would be immensely difficult to the point of impracticability to counterfeit, leaving the US dollar/Euro as the only fitting analogy. With that analogy, notice how the US dollar and the euro are not collapsing due to each other merely existing. In your own words, "you getting it yet?"

Exactly why I'm trying it. If I had to put something other than a recieving address, it'd be different, but there's really no loss. 
I didn't consider the possibility of it being foreign (shit, the 'Murican 'everywhere is America' arrogance is starting to get to my head; get me out of the South before it's too late!), but that would make sense; I'll go with that.
Well, if there's other legitimate ones with it, that's a good sign.
