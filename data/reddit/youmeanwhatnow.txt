Mine start as something similar, I says .dat but I never downloaded it, it's all pre loaded from tails. I could just be a file name as it opens up just like a text file. I've got a script I tried using from the internet and a tutorial. Perhaps I screwed up but I just can't get it to stay working it keeps crashing tails when I use it. Not right away but after a certain amount of attempts. I've tweaked it to the point where it only guess a certain amount and it runs fine and tells me it wasn't found. So I don't know what's up. My PC isn't anything special at all so I'm sure that ain't helping.

I re read that I can send you the values if you'd like through PM if you're willing to. I can try it myself if you'd prefer I just don't know how well my computer will perform after my last time I tried. Your code seems a lot more simple than the other I used! I'm super new to python and have very limited coding experience (basic/VB). Again I can try this myself if you don't wanna take the time right now and understandable it's late here too and I'll trust ya like I said it's damn near gone to me as it stands anyways!
Edit: One last thing I can't seem to find the electrum project on github at least not through search, do you happen to have a link?

I'm pretty positive it ends with .dat, I had been using a python script to try and brute force (complete scripting noob) it just kept crashing on me after a certain number of attempts on tails. I know it's less than 12 characters and I have 6 (maybe five but the last digit is one of two numbers for sure) it's all standard characters.

Nope that's gone too it was on the same page... I only remember one word from it

Actually that btcrecover is exactly the script I was using! I kept crashing on me. It did work but for some reason if it let it go beyond a certain number of attempts it would crash. If you'd be willing that'd be great!

Nope no seed... it was written down but my basement got flooded.
I emailed that guy with no avail so far I'm trying out some python programming through tails and it's terminal application but just gives me errors

Awesome well thanks dude! I'm in a bit of a not having a job jam and this would be awesome so thanks! Next noob thing I don't know how to pm on my mobile browser so I'm gonna google it real quick, meanwhile I gotta get those values for you, I'll be quick!
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:38:51
Oh awesome I'll try it out! Thanks! How many characters does it go up to? Can I limit it with this code?

An example of popular saying: birds of a feather flock together. Opposites attract. 
Both mean the opposite thing. Both can be true neither is any more true than the other or more likely to happen.
