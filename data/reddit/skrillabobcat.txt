Lmao, some of us timed this bitch in 2012 and never sold. For clarity it wasn’t me :)
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:57:48
I actually think this is funny.

It’s basically the Catalina fucking wine mixer every day.
Kicks ass
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:36:17
Didn’t get the wine mixer invitation clearly. I need you to sell 120 choppers a year!!!
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:48:15
If bitcoin did get bought out and propped up I would sell it and buy property.
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:23:11
2017 and still here... this is actually impressive cause I don’t fucking sell.    !!!!!!
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:06:58
Is your dad 32 and have you at the age of 15?

@_date: 2019-07-14 15:44:44
Hahahaha yeah this is true
@_date: 2019-11-04 22:27:12
You are a wallstreetbets type of guy lol
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:11:38
Why not just let it crash so they can run another pump and dump in their lifetime?

The more usage the more it clogs up. Fix the tech
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:11:45
Not when people are speaking in terms of Satoshi
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:59:04
People keep forgetting we won’t be talking in bitcoin. We will be talking satoshis and bits
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:19:28
If bitcoin was adopted you could be waiting days or weeks with a transfer pending and no guarantees on turn around time.
Stop crying
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:09:20
I do not use bitcoin for anything already
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:49:00
Sorry, I’m a dumbass for even saying this on the bitcoin subreddit lol
@_date: 2019-12-06 04:25:05
The not depreciating asset. Dumb Q
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:12:39
For sure. It’s risky potentially is my point. Sorry for the confusion
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:58:07
I was excited about poke and burritos then saw bitcoin.  :)
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:37:46
bigger pockets podcasts day in and day out. and reading on [biggerpockets.com](
also trying to meet people who do it and asking lots of Q. I am happy to walk side by side you in your journey
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:23:04
^ this is wise. I personally make a high income and have rental properties but I still feel the need to put extra $ into BTC and eth because I believe as well it is a great financial tool.
I know some hate defi and interest accounts but I absolutely use them because I want to make more
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:24:40
This is smart to.
Other ideas
- rarely eat out and if you do get small cheaper plates
- make coffe at home and don’t buy it out
- resist name brands and save
- find other ways unique to you and save
You should read tony Robbins book “money master the game” and “unshakeable”
You will get a lot from it
