Maybe.  I'm wiling to spend $100 a month to find out.

Your plan should really be to get out before it crashes, not when.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:45:48
Great article, thanks.  I hope they pump it up another 10x before it crashes.  I could use some more cash for the sidelines.
Do you think that after the dust clears, Bitcoin's actual utility will keep it alive or will Wall St. (or Chicago) kill it?

You are comparing Bitcoin to businesses and GDP but not other currency.  What is the combined total of all of the monetary bases of all the nations of africa?  I'm too lazy to look it up...

I have done so much with my initial speculative $1000 investment.  Buy Bitcoin and USE IT!  By more and put it away.  Use that too!  Utility breeds value as much as scarcity does.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:08:34
I get "how many Bitcoins do you have?".  How much is in your friggin bank account buddy?  
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:14:08
Doing the math on the .5 silver coin, you are essentially paying over $200 for a silver coin.  This makes no sense to me.  Also, why do they "recommend" not to take the private key with it?  Much head scratching.

Indeed.  Good luck!  They sure are purdy...

This is a great plan.  Found money is perfect for speculative investing.  I use the 'cashback' I get from my credit cards to give a bonus boost to my monthly BTC purchases.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:21:02
I hear you.  If I still had the hundreds I've spent and consumed since 2010, I'd be retired right now.  However, I used Bitcoin to purchase things, thereby furthering adoption (this is the excuse I give myself).  Now I make a small monthly purchase, whatever the price and put it away in storage.  In 20 years, I will have learned my lesson and likely be retired and comfortable.
Live for now.  Mistakes you've made are lessons to reap in the future.  Make a plan and stick to it.

From their site they say they will be using Butterfly labs gear.  They have 6TH/s on order from BFL for delivery May 2013.  I don't really believe that for a second.  I would be more interested if they were going to be using technology that is already being shipped.  Seems a bit of a risky investment to me.
@_date: 2013-09-26 19:27:49
I'm currently running the -reindex but the transaction is not listed.  It should be on 05/30/13 but its not.  I'll try the -rescan when the reindex is complete.
Is there anything else I can do?
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:35:16
That was awesome!  Thanks for doing that!
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:26:19
I sent them an email essentially asking how they are sure they will get BFL gear up and mining in May.
@_date: 2013-09-27 14:34:36
If the balance in my wallet wasn't missing 2 bitcoins I wouldn't worry.  Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:51:42
This is great!  People listen to Kevin OLeary because he's a bastard and says his mind straight up.  I'm glad he understands it and is getting on board.  He gets it and that's great for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-26 21:31:32
The transaction detail shows the proper receiving address but in my wallet, the transaction is not there.  WTF?

I can see the file with other recovery programs but can't restore it because it was overwritten by another program.  Can this app restore it?

Do your day trading on Mt. Gox and then transfer to CaVirtEx when you want to cash out.  You'll save the crazy fees.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:20:42
Thanks for that.  Shaking my head a bit harder now.  I have no idea how you get to your conclusion from the text that you posted after the "Section 4."

From the FAQ:
Why do you start in May?
ASIC technology is the next stage in bitcoin mining technology. Various vendors, namely Butterfly labs and Avalon asic have offerings they are currently marketing. Delivery dates given to us by Butterfly labs is late May 2013. Mining begins almost immediately from when we receive the machines.
Why Butterfly Labs ASIC?
Butterfly lab for now have the most complete package when talking about power and power consumption. We are looking to include other vendors to our arsenal. We will only buy machines we feel offer the best value for money and long term profitability.

My story is remarkably similar.  However, my investment in SR was much bigger.  Ahh well, good times no?
@_date: 2013-09-26 20:57:32
I first did the -reindex, then I did a -rescan.
So maybe if I redownload all the blocks again (sigh) it will have better results.  Good think I've got a big transfer limit....
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:38:08
Very true...

You can use EMT at BitLiberty.ca.  They have a site wide $ limit and a daily limit per user of $500.

Fun innit?!
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:46:39
I feel ya buddy.  Its not very active so you really need to wait a while for the prices to sync.  At least now things seem a bit more stable, spread wise so its not a huge problem.

So I've found the missing transaction that is NOT in my wallet that should be. Here it is...
Is there anyway to get this transaction back into my wallet?
@_date: 2013-09-26 20:00:54
You have given me so much hope.  My fingers are crossed...
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:26:54
Oh and a 10% management fee is really steep.

I think im a buyer at $150.  Sagan will know what to do ;)

Thanks for classing up the joint!
@_date: 2013-09-26 20:36:53
The transaction is to the same wallet address that is currently in my wallet, yes.
@_date: 2013-09-22 14:30:01
@_date: 2013-09-23 11:17:35
Yes, I did.  I kept having corruption in the bitcoin-qt client so I blew away the %appdata% directory, thinking that I had my wallet backed up in a few places.  Turns out all of the backups I had were from before I changed my passphrase.  All those wallets I was able to merge but am still missing about 2 btc.  Sad.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:37:11
Exactly my plan too.  I would hate to sink a bunch of money into this only to realise when I get my units that they will take an unreasonable time to return the investment.  I'm the middle of the curve but its a safe(r) spot.

My hopes dashed as the rescan didn't find the transaction.  Any other options?
@_date: 2013-09-23 15:29:08
Will do, thanks for the pro tips.
@_date: 2013-09-23 11:18:43
Ya I tried it and it couldn't get it back for me.  All I got was some .dat files with some weird names and none of looked like they could have been my wallet. &lt;/sadface&gt;
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:20:41
You might look at this a couple different ways.  Maybe the First Sell off is when it was at $30.  Maybe it was some other time.  Maybe its all just bullcrap and ASICs are coming online and having their effect.  Hashing rate sure does look like the BTC:USD prices.

I don't see it in blockexporer when i look at the receiving address or in blockchain.info when looking at the receiving address but when I look up the transaction ID in blockchain, I see it and the records from the sender match as well.
