I had this happen to me a couple times in the past. I finally learned my lesson and started backing up my apps/data with Titanium Backup. It'd be nice if google authenticator stored your info similar to how authy does it. Anyhow, good luck!

Yea...I'm just really waiting for a public statement from mt.gox to confirm what's going on and what their future is.

nodejs &amp; angular
@_date: 2014-04-06 05:02:47
this is probably your best option

Cool man. One of the biggest problems with bitcoin (or crypto-currencies in general) is that most people don't understand what it is (or isnt) and how it works. So any way we can educate them on the subject is great.

use multisig escrow accounts for deposits

Ethereum sounds awesome!

You may have better luck creating a coinbase account and linking your 53 acct there. You can then just transfer ur btc to that acct and sell them there
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:26:49
check out  as well.

Nice. One thing I noticed is your spelling of "Volitility"....should be spelled "Volatility".  I'll take another look later when I have more time.

good point mother of dragons. but amazon's gotta do better than [this](
I have heard rumors that apple was creating their own altcoin as well. probably bs though.

Wow I actually just read about this startup yesterday  on angellist and signed up to the mailing list
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:15:15
lol @ "doggiecoin"
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:55:22
explain like im 5
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:40:22
I believe its still early as there still hasn't been any concrete information regarding the future of Mt. Gox. Also, that 'leaked' document is pretty suspect.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:36:30
have you taken a look at cryptotrader?
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:25:54
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:06:33
You could query the blockchain (blockchain.info) for the address. That should give u the info u need for your graph
@_date: 2014-04-23 01:22:28
this sounds pretty intriguing, gonna wait it out though and see how things go
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:46:54
Why don't they count?
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:56:29
Possibly, although it may not be "bitcoin" but the topic of crypto currencies could be a factor.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:33:20
i've been thinking about taking a look at Go.  How do u like it?
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:28:01
I *think* bit-wasp (bit-wasp.co) may have this implemented as well.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:08:44
thats what i'm thinking as well
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:59:19
I agree. Also, many people don't realize that use cases of the bitcoin protocol itself extends way beyond that of just being used a as a currency.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:51:44
Yea they mention it in the writeup on angel list
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:29:16
I was verified on 2/21 and I actually got an email from support regarding a question i had asked a few days later....on the 24th...
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:19:26
