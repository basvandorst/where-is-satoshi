Ohhh whatever, bitcoin, ETH they're all cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:08:03
Will do
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:24:00
Wait, what's a private key?
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:06:58
Alright. I'll ask my parents tmrw if they can setup an account and cash out the BTC, but if not you might be seeing some BTC in your wallet later lol. (I'll ask for your wallet code or whatever it's called if I do decide to give it to you)
Thanks for the help.

Wait, it is me being reimbursed! Yay! They are just sending it little by little.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:52:52
If i can't find a site I might just send it to you hahahaha.
Do you know of any that don't require id?
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:34:57
It'll be good for us people who want to buy graphics cards at non-astronomical prices! :D
@_date: 2018-04-07 07:19:05
Yeah it is, I'm being reimbursed for the stuff that I lost.

I'm a bit of a crypto noob and putting a load of dots isn't going to help in the slightest.

Well according to the transaction thing it says eight addresses paid out bitcoin to 201 other people, so I guess it was random?
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:18:25
I had 40 pounds worth though.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:10:38
And that's why things like GTX 1080's are still about 1400 dollars when they should only be around 800?
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:03:15
Hmmm, okay. Can you buy and sell bitcoin without id on coinbase? Might have some fun trading currencies considering the money is pretty much useless to me now.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:48:56
Also, is there any wallets that I could transfer the bitcoin to so I can cash it out to my bank account without id? Coinbase requires ID and since I'm only 14 I don't really want to be putting in any of that.
@_date: 2018-04-07 07:18:51
I'll look into it.
