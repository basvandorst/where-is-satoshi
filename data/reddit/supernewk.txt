he could be the richest man in the world.  And now he created another crytpo Stellar to basically give away to the world.  Seemed like he realized the 21 mil cap is a fatal flaw.  
certainly whatever he touches turns to gold.

@_date: 2017-12-20 13:37:56

@_date: 2017-12-15 19:45:57
right but not for us smaller players right?  the big boys would jack up their fee so they get confirmed first.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:48

but Antminer can just flip a switch, then Mcafee goes and all of sudden we a so screwed if we can't move any money. Blocks too small It will be chaos.  Cash has bigger blocks, we wouldn't be able to even goto LTC...is that what everyone is calling 'the flippening'?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:22:43
All hail Bitcoin Cash !

@_date: 2017-08-25 16:20:10

?  dilution...dilution dilution.  You can have the best company yet keep diluting to pay out execs at expense of shareholders...or hold back on guidance and send the stock down.
Insider trading is too much, its tough to insider trade with bitcoin @ the moment.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:10:51
Stocks are a scam.  They close during certain hours so an ALGO can screw majority over that are trying to trade.  Buy and HODL bitcoin these rat bankers are now panicking and buying every stock linked to bitcoin. 
Whats funny is eventually it will be their demise.

Look what Imelt did to GE, guy was a GOD for years and just milked shareholders to live an insanely lavish life....the main purpose of stocks are to give shareholders just a sliver of the pie while the ones who IPO'd make insane gains.  Bitcoin leveled the playing field.  Now us peasants can get the whole pie while those con artists who IPO shares at inflated prices finally start selling to each other and eat each others lunch

But messenger is different than money.  Once a money platform is created most won’t jump ship to the next. They want the safest and most secure 
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:15:58

Silk Road was another good time for bitcoin/crypto.  Seems like only scams/illegal activity keep this going.  Now that its falling apart none of this may even come back.  It should slowly drift to zero

Anyone notice when bitconnect died the whole market died ? Almost as if a scam was keeping this all afloat.  Makes me wonder if crypto is the real scam 
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:23:04
