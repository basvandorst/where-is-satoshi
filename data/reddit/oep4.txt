Your credit card example might be true for a very short amount of time in a specific place in the world.. but not everyone can get a credit card or bank account, and not everyone has access to the infrastructure required for those things.

If they don't, they know a friend who does, or a place they can go to use the internet. That's how it works. Crypto can be stored offline anyhow. Doesn't really require internet access to maintain. Infrastructure required for cryptos exists already as the internet, and most of the world has mobile coverage.What is your argument anyways?

Give me an example. Many people use a services like Western Union to send/receive money accross borders. Have you had any significant experience sending/receiving money across borders? I have. I've lived in South America, Sweden, and now in the UK. Moving money is not easy, takes a ton of time, and often means paying a lot of middle people along the way. I've also used Western Union. It works, but they charge you, and have their requirements, along with the fact that you have to physically go into a supporting branch, and they have to be open.

You don't know what you're talking. Bitcoin transactions can be both traceable (and public) and anonymous, depending on how you perform the transactions.

Well, if you want, you could divide the 21m bc's to $0.0077 each. given the 16 tril.

Cool ad.

But bitcoins can be divisible up to 8 decimal places...so it's not like we would run out.

Why would you need a switchover date? If you had .0000001 bitcoin you still have that, until you want to divide it even further, in that case you will want to update. My technical understanding is limited, though.

Ok, they accept Bitcoin. Does that really make this article worthy of this subreddit?

Fourteen Charged in Million-Dollar ‘Gone in 60 Seconds’ Bank Fraud
Operated in California and Nevada Casinos
U.S. Attorney’s Office October 26, 2012 	
    Southern District of California (619) 557-5610
Fourteen individuals were charged following a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-led investigation into the theft of over $1 million from Citibank using cash advance kiosks at casinos located in Southern California and Nevada. According to an indictment unsealed earlier today, the defendants stole the money by exploiting a gap—which required multiple withdrawals all within 60 seconds—in Citibank’s electronic transaction security protocols. FBI agents assisted by the Glendale Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department arrested 13 of the defendants in the Los Angeles area Wednesday and Thursday.
According to court documents, the alleged scheme worked as follows: defendant Ara Keshishyan recruited conspirators who were willing to open multiple Citibank checking accounts. He then supplied his co-defendants with “seed” money, which was deposited into the recently opened accounts. After the money was deposited into the checking accounts, Keshishyan and his conspirators would travel to nearly a dozen casinos, including the Morongo, Pechanga, San Manuel, Agua Caliente, Chukchansi, and Spa Resort casinos in California; the Tropicana, Wynn, Bicycle, and Whiskey Pete’s casinos in Las Vegas; and Harrah’s in Laughlin. When inside the casino, the conspirators, including Keshishyan, used cash advance kiosks at casinos in California and Nevada to withdraw (all within 60 seconds) several times the amount of money deposited into the accounts, by exploiting the Citibank security gap they discovered.
The indictment alleges that, after the cash was collected from the casino “cages,” Keshishyan would typically give conspirators their “cut”—and keep the remainder of the stolen funds—which were often used to gamble. The casinos frequently “comped” the conspirators with free rooms due to their extensive gambling activity. As part of the alleged scheme, the defendants were also careful to keep both their deposits and withdrawals under $10,000 in order to avoid federal transaction reporting requirements and conceal their fraud.
According to United States Attorney Duffy, the expansion of automated banking services carries risks along with the obvious rewards. She emphasized, however, that her office would be vigilant to guard against cyber criminals attempting to steal funds from unwary individuals or corporations.
FBI Special Agent in Charge Daphne Hearn commented, “While advancements in technology have created a world of accessibility to users and a convenience for consumers, they have also left room for criminals to exploit even the smallest of loopholes. For over 100 years the FBI has kept pace with technological and communication changes in the business world where these types of electronic transactions are the standard and we will continue to do so in order to help protect commercial enterprise and our nation’s economy.”
All of the defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to illegally structure financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements, which is punishable by up to five years in prison, and a $250,000 fine. In addition, defendant Keshishyan is charged with 14 counts of bank fraud, each of which is punishable by up to 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine. The indictment also alleges forfeiture in connection with the crimes charged.
Several of the defendants were arraigned in Los Angeles yesterday, where they agreed to make their initial appearances in San Diego on October 29, 2012, before Magistrate Judge Ruben B. Brooks. The remaining defendants are expected to be arraigned in San Diego over the next several days. A motions hearing is scheduled in the case for November 30, 2012 at 1:30 p.m. in San Diego before United States District Court Judge Janice L. Sammartino.

Er, did you not read the article? The number one reason for creating this e-krona would be O V E R S I G H T. It could be a good step in the right direction. Payment systems could asapt to an e-solution, therefore bridging the current system with the inevitable adoption of a decentralized currency once it's better and more widely understood, ie. once a suitable technology is released that is robust enough to replace a fiat currency for good. Things take time and don't change immediately. Change is often slow and requires steps.

What? Yes, it would be ridiculously exciting. A fuckton of work would get made redundant. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:00:45
Well, yes, because why would the swedish people trust the bank at this moment in time?  At least their general council is elected by parliament, and thefore fall to some degree under the purview of the swedish government, and by extension, the swedish people (democratically elected). What I mean to say is they aren't a private company.
I used swish a lot when I worked in Sweden, and that was between 2012 and 2017, so I saw the decline of cash use first hand.

The SP500 is made up of equities.. with a completely different risk/reward profile than gold. Not comparable. Same reason why it's dumb to compare Bitcoin to other assets. It isn't. It's a new asset class. Period.

No need to fearmonger. I like cryptos as much as the next guy, but comments like this make this community shittier.

Well that's dumb. Gold keeps it's worth and can be sold just about anywhere for Fiat currency, which is still definitely in use.

The best bid or offer is the actual current price. The last bid is simply a fact that tells you at what price the last cross in the orderbook was at.

Good question...perhaps each exchange could have an account at the other respective exchanges, so in effect if I traded on Mt Gox and they couldn't give me a match, my order gets routed to btc-e (through the Mt. Gox account) and gets matched, then Mt. Gox does the neccesaries and I see the reflection of that transaction back in my account. Mt. Gox would be the intermediary here. This may be a simplistic answer, but doesn't it work? It does add more risk... :/

It could ~~easily~~ be coordinated via the FIX protocol...
