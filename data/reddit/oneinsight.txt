No. 0.01 bitcoin. Always 0.01.

The price started to plummet with the addition of CME futures, right when Bitcoin reached its all time high roughly around $20,000.  Currently it is limited to 5 bitcoin contracts, however they are bumping the limit to 10 (see below) 
"CME announced its intention to increase in the so-called spot month position limit for its bitcoin futures contracts in a letter to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Thursday.
The limit would jump from 1,000 contracts per spot month to 2,000 for any single investor. Since each contract is for five bitcoin, the change means a trader’s maximum exposure would double from 5,000 bitcoin (worth about $50 million at current prices) to 2,000 contracts (10,000 bitcoin, or $100 million)."
It's my belief that currently CME is suppressing the potential of Bitcoin, but won't be able to do this successfully for too long.

To those who know the end game and continue to accumulate, I respect you.

One does not exit bitcoin. We wait. ��

Could not agree with you more. We need to exterminate futures and the con artists behind it.

Which is fraud in my opinion but no one's stopping them.

Bakkt is good for Bitcoin. CME however..... Con artists responsible for the drop from 20k, and responsible for now.
