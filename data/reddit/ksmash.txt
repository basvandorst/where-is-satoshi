I started investing a month ago and I doubled my original  investment. Sold just enough to get my original money back. And now I hold for years.

So for me I sold half of my bitcoin today because i litteraly doubled my money. So now I have no risk because the money I have in doesn't exist in my daily accounting. 
Me selling now is probably dumb, but it's the right choice for me.  This is all people are talking about sell only when you've made what you were planning on. But never sell all of it.

Yep doubled both my bitcoin and litecoin investment.  Pulled out exactly what I put into it. I now have an emergency fund sitting and growing for a rainy day.

You can't count chickens before they hatch. Take what you can and don't get greedy.

Yep since you need to convert to $ then back to crypto.  You have to declarw it as capital gains. Annoying but also kind of reasonable when it c9mes to tax purposes.

An army of salesmen is a good way to make a quick buck. 
An army of engineers makes a stable company.
An army of both an empire. 
(I have no qualifications to talk about any of this)

To be fair the FCC is trying to remove regulation.  Not all regulations are inherently bad.

That sounds like disillusionment.  (But yeah I have no idea.)

I know that. Bitcoin/blockchain has really become used to it's full potential. Right now people see it as a failes get rich quick scheme, when the tech is really cool.

Selling is what causes the taxes.

My guess they never changes the last message from when the for was supposed to happen.

I'm more annoyed. My bitcoin friend said to buy at $6800.

No because the oil is the thing with the inherent value. Oil doesn't need faith to work unlike currency.

They could demand that all their oil purchases be done in Petro. So it backed by oil but you can't exchange it for oil.
