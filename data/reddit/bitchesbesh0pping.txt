could you tell me what tools I could use to generate the redeeming script for the witness? I can's seem to find it anywhere and don't have a wallet file to export since I use a ledger nano s.

So I have my private keys extracted. How do you manually sign a transaction with them? I'd pay you if you could explain it to me successfully.

Get a paper wallet so you actually have your private keys. If you keep your coin on an exchange , it's not your coin. You must have the private key to actually fully control the bitcoin. It's really easy to make a paper wallet.

fantastic. thanks

That's fantastic news. Did they make you verify?
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:33:13
that's bad news. So why are you using Segwit addresses if that it is the case? Why not just use legacy addresses until they come out with a solution?

Yes I can login but I'm paranoid about doing so since they are now banning US customers and I have a US IP. I have just been anxious about the whole situation so I thought I'd post here to ask and test the waters first. Do they still allow trading USD for crypto without verification? Because I would gladly purchase BTC and withdraw that. I suspect that they are requiring USD transfers from BTC-e to get verified before converting it to BTC

Bitcoin talk forums are a good place to go talk about scams.

No I meant did they make you verify your identity with Country ID card and proof of address?
