WHATS UP BITCOIN BROTHERS. 
I love you dirty little revolutionary coin believers.  I think this shit is so fucking cool. How cool is bitcoin? Bro I can send this shit anywhere. I don’t need anyone’s permission bitch this shit is borderless.  
How is it that when I talk about bitcoin everyone looks at me like I’m a fucking lunatic??? Bro im not that heavy about it irl..  I just want people to see what bitcoin can do for a big portion of the unbanked world. But even just lightly bringing it up causes people to roll their eyes. Idk what it is. 
Oh well. (:

Bruh I just bought my Trezor on Black Friday, did I make the right choice? Im seeing now that they’ve had some phishing scams and such and I’m just wondering what the community thinks of them. I’m pretty sure I bought off of the main site but I wasn’t that diligent about checking. They had a good deal and I just got it real quick so I guess we’ll see when it comes in.

Hello my bitcoin brothers.  I just watched The Rise and Rise of bitcoin. It’s hilarious to see some of the famous bitcoin people interviewed, almost like reading a book you know the outcome of.  peace out my dudes.
