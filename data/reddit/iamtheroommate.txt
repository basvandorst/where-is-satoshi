If you have to ask, don't you think you need to do a bit more research into the laws before buying one? Don't be one of those idiot foreigners causing aggravation. They're a pretty laid back people and most people follow the laws. When the Japanese do finally crack down on idiot foreigners being incredibly obnoxious, breaking rules &amp; laws, they scream racism &amp; discrimination. I've seen it first hand. No it's not racism, it's because you're a fuckwit.

Yes, security through obscurity -- if spammers can't see that their post is removed or shadowbanned, then they can't know if their attempts are working or not. is by far, a bigger target for shills &amp; spammers, just look at the size of the subscriber bases. Keeping the modlog private allows them to fight trolls, spammers and every other nefarious thing without them being wiser. It's another layer of obfuscation. 
Ever wonder why the admins of reddit just didn't force people to all have open &amp; transparent mod logs? Because keeping them hidden in riskier subreddits works.

This is complete and utter nonsense. Bitmain, as I type this, is the sole producer of ASIC mining chips. They are a literal (not figurative) monopoly. The textbook definition of the word. They have already been shown to have obscured the ownership of mining pools they run, so they could possibly own many, many more. Truth is, we don't know how much hashrate Bitmain controls because we don't know how many ASIC rigs they own - keep in mind they're the SOLE PRODUCER OF ASIC CHIPS. 
It's a massive conflict of interest being the largest mining company and sole provider of ASIC chips. They could, oh I don't know, release chips with slower or inferior tech and hold back the newer ones for themselves. Then release that version when the newer version is in production. Or they could order tens of thousands of chips, hundreds of thousands, and only release a small fraction for sale. Meanwhile, putting those chips into their own mining rigs. 
They've already proven themselves to use dishonest business practices like hide the ownership of mining pools, what else do they do that we are unaware of? Keep in mind this is China, they don't have the same regulations that keep things fair like we have here in the west. 
71% of the hashrate [rests within China]( Bitmain is located in China and is the sole producer of ASIC chips (required for mining). Do the math.

All this nonsense in this thread, and it's odd how people can't connect the dots when it's right in front of them. This is *precisely* why China is cracking down on crypto -- they have strict fiscal controls on its citizens. Cryptos allowed its citizens to bypass those controls.

We are absolutely better off. The world would be better off. 


I'm afraid you misunderstand -- China might be heavily reliant on the U.S but it's not two sided. The U.S could cut China off and experience a minor hiccup. This isn't my opinion but that of a nobel winning economist, Paul Krugman. The U.S relies on China's cheap labor but they don't have a monopoly on cheap labor. Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, even India is starting to get into the game. If China and the U.S ceased all trading, China's economic bubble would immediately crash while the U.S would only experience a minor hiccup. Interdependence is a myth spouted by people with little to know geopolitical knowledge. Paul Krugman: [Who's afraid of China?](

It's actually understated. China regulates what its citizens can and cannot do with their money. They cannot move money out of China without government approval, for example. Cryptos allowed citizens of China to bypass those strict regulations. Now these exchanges will come back online with government officials running or overseeing things and severely neutered.

These days, Jihan Wu **is** a government source. I can't see how they'd allow such a massive mining operation to run unchecked within their borders. They're subsidizing all that electricity after all. No, the state has their fingers in his mining operation. The state has their fingers in *everything* that operates within their borders. This is the one thing non-westerners have trouble understanding. China may be more capitalistic than it was 20 years ago, but it's still not a "free" country. The state has absolute authority.

He did/does have a vision. And it *is* set in stone - Bitcoin's white paper. His vision was purely technical in nature. The problem is that everyone and their mother have tried to tack on their own political agenda in order to hijack his vision. "Bitcoin was created to destroy banks!", "Bitcoin was created in order to wrestle control from the government!" No, none of those things are remotely true. Satoshi was fairly a-political in his forum posts and even expressed concern when wikileaks decided to begin accepting it in place of credit cards. In fact, his very last post on the forum was regarding this and he was afraid of "kicking the hornets nest". Satoshi actively avoided politics.

And in another comment of yours:


Are you 16? I'm honestly asking. Bitmain can threaten to fork and successfully do it because it's just one man (or a few) that can make that decision. They're all-powerful (which is part of the "fucking" problem). UASF requires the coordination of a significant number of random people. There are people who do care, there are people who don't care, there are the apathetic, there are the uninformed there are the uneducated (people who don't fully understand the situation) and everything in between.
It's crowd dynamics -- a UASF is a "last resort" that would only kick in once people are *forced* to choose a side. Once they're forced to educate themselves and forced to care. There are too many people to just "fork yourselves". It's an extremely loose community of semi-anonymous individuals, not a corporate entity with strong top-down leadership (bitmain). 
There would be too much market uncertainty, too much confusion and the price of bitcoin would temporarily tank. It's just not feasible until someone forces or threatens the issue. Nobody *wants* to fork, (except for the Chinese mining cartels, that is) but we would be willing if that's what is required to allow bitcoin to survive. It's like getting an infection in your finger -- do you chop it off right at the first sign? Of course not, you try a whole host of antibiotics and surgeries (if required) to keep the finger. Sure, your body would get used to the new situation, learning to write with your other hand and so forth, but you don't want to do it unless you're required. Unless it starts to threatening your hand, arm or even sepsis (which causes death). A centralized bitcoin would herald its death, go against everything the tech stands for (according to the white paper) and frankly, cause a significant loss of confidence in the currency/crypto.

This dumbfounds me. Befuddles me. It ignores *the entire political aspect*. China cannot be thought of like a western government. The CCP does not rule altruistically or benevolently. They could, if they wanted, march right into Bitmain and any other bitcoin business/farm and seize control. They don't need a reason and there are no laws forbidding this. There is no recourse the business owners can take to fight it, it's as good as over with once the PRC has control. China does not take its national security lightly and they err on the side of caution. To wit: they have a great firewall to censor and keep tabs on its population, they builds islands in the middle of the ocean in order to better project its might, and will snatch small bookstore owners because they won't turn over a customer list. The bookstore owner only made back home weeks later due to the global awareness.
If you think having all that hashrate within China's borders is perfectly OK, I honestly don't know what to say. I'm speechless. It's like saying we should trust North Korea not to do something reckless, because they'll act in our best interests. Frankly, I'm amazed the PRC hasn't seized control yet, given the risk and threat bitcoin poses to their own fiscal controls and ideology. Or perhaps they have already?
TL;DR - China is unpredictable and the PRC can only be counted on to do what's best for the PRC. If bitcoin ever stands in the way of China's ideology...

The majority of shilling on the internet comes almost exclusively from just a handful of different countries. That's because the state themselves engage in it which creates the infrastructure for more independent operations (and hopes that the government will employ them, and garner a fat check). While many countries like the U.S, U.K etc engage in some subvert propaganda, it's typically kept targeted and isn't too "in your face". That's because it would be too obvious -- getting caught &amp; called out on it would look a lot worse.
In China, where the government controls literally *everything*, they can be more overt and obvious with their tactics because even if someone suspected, they're not going to call anyone out on it due to fear. So China has gotten pretty brazen with their PR efforts and it's compounded because they really, *really* care about their 'image' or "face". They do anything to save face and not lose it. 
So that's why China is one of the worst countries when it comes to propaganda and shilling -- it's encouraged at every level and now regular citizens and entrepreneurs can even get paid for it. There isn't that much incentive to be a "shill" in the U.S aside from regular old marketing and "reputation management". There's very little demand or anyone willing to pay U.S citizens to go on Chinese websites and make the U.S look good or mitigate bad news. We just simply don't care what the Chinese think of us. However, China *does* care what the rest of the world thinks about them. They also care because they want foreign investment dollars because they know their export economy cannot last forever.

If you think a company gave someone $25k without a very specific plan on how they wanted it spent, or at the *very least* getting approval of how it will be spent before handing it over, I'd think you're naive. I mean, he could have donated it to the KKK and then the news headline tomorrow would be: "Fox Films donates to the KKK!"
Edit: Just watched the video, he states in the video that's exactly what he did: He told them first what he wanted to do, they approved. The entire thing was part of an advertising gimmick. You made it sound like he did it against their wishes, or unexpectedly -- it wasn't for altruism, he got a shit-ton of exposure and followers as a result.

No idea why you would think that. Chinese are into for $$$. They're not into bitcoin for the decentralization, freedom and anonymity. They have trouble even grasping those concepts because they've never experienced it. Nor do they expect it, the PRC (government of China) controls their lives over there. You can bet your ass they have their fingers in the pot too.

Indeed. Less of a conflict of interest. You don't see the difference between someone controlling Bitcoin who is in it to make money (a businessman) or spread out over a bunch of developers? The answer is the motivation of the parties involved. Whether or not core devs have nefarious motivations or not is moot, we know *with certainty* Bitmain is a business and will do what's best for their bottom line. Core devs are, without question, the lesser evil here. Hell, just splitting up control is the lesser evil regardless of who holds that control.

Bitmain controls all of Antpool, after all, they created it. It matters little, however, since Antpool [acts according to Bitmain's wishes]( so they effectively have control of it, even if they don't "technically" have 100%. If you own 51% of a company, you may not technically own 100% of it, but *effectively*, it's yours, since you own the majority. You can do whatever you wanted to the company.

Then you see wrong? LTC is just about to roll out Lightning while Ethereum practically has scaling built into the blockchain. The more I look at ETH, the more I'm impressed with the technology -- they can even make it so that if someone or someone(s) come close to having a majority of the hashrate, it can penalize them to keep them from centralizing. This is impossible with bitcoin.

It's interesting that you haven't considered the fact that it isn't already compromised by the PRC. The government there knows what bitcoin is, they almost certainly see it as a threat given how little fiscal freedom their own citizens have. A decentralized and anonymous currency? It probably scares the shit out of them. Now they're giving free subsidized electricity to a few mining companies operating within China, and appearing tolerant of bitcoin? Something isn't adding up here. Bitcoin is literally the antithesis of the past 25 years of Chinese fiscal ideology. It's like if a large Jewish temple opened up in Berlin, in 1939 Nazi Germany. And instead of instantly obliterating it, the Nazis completely ignored it. You would know that something fishy was going on..

Along with the positives of bitcoin, people here rarely mention the negatives. And there are quite a few. Like money laundering, tax avoidance, funding crime, criminal networks, and yes, even terrorists. But the big one in my opinion, is a lack of regulations. We might be fine with that but Dorthy the 80 year old neighbor wants her retirement investments protected and insured so banks can't just up and close one day, leaving her penniless. There are thousands of regulations in place that actually protect your money/investments and hell, our entire economic system that we take for granted. These same protections do not come with bitcoin.
Most of the college-aged libertarian nitwits here think it's "big banks and wall street fearing bitcoin because they don't have control!" when in truth, the banks are more scared of getting labeled as money launderers, helping terrorism, funding drug cartels, etc, etc etc. Those things have consequences for big financial institutions, like lengthy financial audits from the government and very bad PR. The former being much more important/scary to them then the threat bitcoin holds. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:37:43


Where do you get that idea? Businesses in China aren't run like they are in the west. They need government approval and if it's very likely to threaten the government in any shape way or form, they're going to regulate it and oversee it. The Chinese government gets to stick their fingers in every pie, and typically do. Especially when it comes to subsidizing all that (essentially) free electricity.
That's ignoring the fact that the Chinese government could just show up one day and either shut the whole thing down tomorrow, or take it over, or even take it over covertly if they have further use for it. They do it all the time.

A theory in the scientific sense is essentially a fact. Were you looking for the word "hypothesis"? More than 50% of the hashrate lies within China. Nuff said, really. And it's only going to get worse; electricity is essentially free for the miners due to the government subsidies. Anyone who mines in China will have a serious massive advantage over anywhere else in the world.

There was no mention of snatching it up for any particular reason, in fact, it was among 4 other "goals" cited in the email, things they wanted to make sure they do, like secure the oil.

**I see many in making this mistake**.
China doesn't need backdoors into their hardware like they would in the U.S, China can literally just go in and take the place over. People seem to forget China is an authoritarian state. They're not like North Korea obviously, but the state has almost no checks and balances that exist in most democracies. However, make no mistake, they have total and absolute control.
Let me repeat that; China could walk in and escort everyone out of the building, and nobody could do anything about it. And this isn't far-fetched, they do it all the time. They've done it to foreign companies operating on their soil simply to steal their IP. China doesn't need legal protection or laws to do what it wants, it already has permission to do whatever it wants on its soil. China could also walk in, tell Jihan "we're going to run things now and you'll be taking your cue from us, you'll stay the front man" and that's that. The kicker is that it's again, completely legal. That's why China had no trouble just scooping up a bookshop owner from Hong Kong and making him disappear for a few weeks. Because that's standard practice.

This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. This particular card? Ok, sure. But if Nvidia and AMD got serious and devoted more than a passing glance at mining, there is no way Chinese ASICs would stand a chance. They simply don't have the R&amp;D infrastructure to compete with those two behemoths. Hell, even if they did, they don't have the fabrication facilities to build their exotic new chip. I mean, they're having trouble keeping up with current demand for their current asic chips, and they're not all that advanced (relatively speaking). AMD and Nvidia's fab plants on the other hand, are straight up world class. Literally bleeding edge. They're just not focused on mining. Instead they're focused on building GPUs for mobile phones, playstations &amp; xboxes, video cards, intergrated laptops, etc etc etc...

Your link pretty much verify's OP statement; just because Nvidia went fab-less doesn't mean they don't design their own chips. They just outsource the construction of them to the bleeding edge TSMC. It's the same company that produces Apple's chips for them. 
OPs point is that these Chinese ASIC companies are just taking advantage of a lack of a market, they're not doing anything revolutionary or cutting edge -- there's just no competition because it is/was a niche market.
In fact, China is such a poor country when it comes to innovation and invention, that if any medium sized company decided to join the competition, Bitmain would be squashed in no time. Hell, as soon as there is *any* competition, they're going to be squashed out of the game. Their only leverage here is the fact that they're practically the only game in town. They're essentially a monopoly. But that won't last very long. 
China is not the country you want to be rooting for when it comes to innovation. They simply won't deliver. Over a billion people and when was the last time you drove a Chinese-branded luxury car, used a Chinese operating system, had a medical procedure developed in China (or was cured by a drug invented in China), played on a Chinese made gaming system, read the latest astrophysics breakthrough by someone in China, had some revolutionary new technology invented by the Chinese, I think you see where I'm going here. Their culture simply does not allow for that kind of creativity and critical thinking. The state itself wants busy little worker bees, not individuals challenging their superiors. That's unfortunate because that ability to challenge the status quo, challenge those above you to do better is what drives many to invent and innovate. It's the foundation for creativity -- people love a good challenge.
The sad part is that China is spending record numbers on research and development across the board in just about every industry. They're quite literally throwing money everywhere and they're not getting much in return. Oh, sure, they're jumping up a few places on most innovation indexes, but with the money being thrown around, they should be in the  spot with a healthy distance between them and number 2. But they're not. They're literally trying to buy innovation and failing even at that.

These outrageous fees are *already* killing bitcoin, look at the transaction volume for bitcoin's competitors. Bitcoin was surpassed by freaking litecoin in volume of transactions yesterday. If people cannot use bitcoin for everyday transactions, a good chunk of its value immediately disappears. And then from that, investors will no longer see it as a good investment, then they too, pull out. It will snowball as people leave this sinking ship to bitcoins competitors. Scratch that, people are already fleeing to its competitors.
