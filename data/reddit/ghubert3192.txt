I'm not sure if when you say "best way to lose money" you mean the most common way to lose money or the most comfortable way to lose money. If you mean the most common way I'm not sure that's at all true, and wouldn't believe it until I saw data indicating that it is true. If you mean the most comfortable way I guess that's just a subjective opinion.
As for emphasizing the risk of holding while downplaying the risk of selling, I think that's a good point. However, I think there's huge emphasis on this sub-reddit on the potential reward of holding with far less emphasis on the risk of holding. I think overall the sub could use some more of that. Also, I don't think the way you think about risk is the same way that I'm thinking about risk. What I'm talking about here, like I said in my post a couple times, is people who would be hurt by the loss of the money they have invested in Bitcoin. Now, if I know I will have $10,000 next year, and I know I will need $8,000 to pay my rent, eat, etc., and I invest $4,000 into Bitcoin, the risk of *losing* $3,000 is far larger to me than the risk of *not gaining* $3,000. If I were in that situation and someone were to tell me, "Tomorrow your investment will either gain or lose $3,000", I'm going to sell it then and there because it's more important to me to have my survival money than to be able to afford extra stuff (I think this concept applies to more than just "survival money", too, which I talk about more in my reply to your 3rd bullet point).
As for the bullet points:
* I think this community is a bit sensationalist in its view of Bitcoin, personally. I wouldn't be surprised if there are a decent amount of people getting into it due to the, "Wow, this thing is amazing! It's going big places!" attitude that you see here and many other places. I just think it's not a shameful thing for people who were drawn into this because of the aura that surrounds it to back out if they're not so sure anymore. Just because someone did a silly thing based off of emotion doesn't mean they should be left out to dry.
* Many people throughout history have been thoroughly convinced that something is going to turn out well, only for it to turn out poorly. I think when it comes to something as important as money (if money is important to you for food, housing, or whatever else it may be) you should always temper your beliefs at least somewhat. There has never, at any point in history, been a true "sure thing". There were people who were 100% sure that the rapture was happening last year. There were people who sold all of their stuff before that because they were so sure that they wouldn't need it after the rapture happened. I'm not saying Bitcoin is closely comparable to the rapture, but just remember that every day people are absolutely sure about things only to end up wrong.
* There are so, so, so many reasons someone might not have bought yet. Maybe they feel more comfortable investing in index funds. Maybe they want to spend their money on travel. Maybe they want to donate their money to charity. This kind of question, the type of which I see a lot here, implies that there is such a thing as "throwaway money". Maybe that kind of thing exists to the super rich, but I don't think I've ever had a single dollar of throwaway money, where I just completely didn't care what happened to it. There's *always* an opportunity cost. For example, I could be investing thousands into bitcoin, or I could be investing those same thousands into index funds, or I could be investing those same thousands into video games. All would be perfectly legitimate choices, depending on what I wanted. I'm investing my thousands into study abroad. That's where the money will be best spent for me, I believe.
* Again, I feel this kind of "comfort" thing falls along a spectrum, rather than being some kind of single point as people often make it out to be here. And again, I don't think people should be hung out to dry just because they do something stupid. And this is exactly why I made my post. What I hate is that there seem to be people on this sub attempting to convince everyone that Bitcoin is a 100% solid investment. There are undoubtedly people investing "survival" money, as I described it before, into Bitcoin. And I expect some of them come on this sub-reddit. And that's why I made my post. People need to remember that there is no such thing as a "sure thing", and that this is a volatile and risky investment they're making. And people should think about the opportunity cost of putting their money into Bitcoin.

But penny-stocks are widely accepted as an extremely volatile and risky investment. That's the point of them. And anyone investing in them should surely be aware of that fact. What I don't like about this sub-reddit is that people are trying to deny that it's a risky investment, and acting like it's a sure thing. 
There's an example of what I'm talking about. At the time of my posting this it has 18 upvotes and 9 downvotes. That guy is just straight-up saying that Bitcoins WILL be successful, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. And people are upvoting it. It's an insanely ridiculous statement, but 18 of the 27 people who have voted on it believe it, and in that sense those 18 people are leading others to believe it as well.

I think it's entirely likely that this "bubble pop" or "crash" or whatever people wanna call it will end up just being another rut along the way, and it's entirely likely that cryptocurrencies are the wave of the future, but my point still stands that compared to traditional investment this is a very risky investment to make, and that people need to be aware of that. There's nothing wrong with that knowledge being public. It's a little freaky to look around this sub tonight and see the vast majority of people just laughing like this isn't a significant event. There doesn't seem to be the air of real concern that should exist in a moment like this. When the American (and world) stock markets started crashing (which is a market with much more infrastructure and safety net than Bitcoins) there was an appropriate feeling of concern. It wasn't everybody saying "Shit, it's over, this thing is done, fuck it", but it was a feeling of "Wow, this *could* be a serious issue", which of course it was, even if it wasn't the end of the world. And for that reason I think that people who have an amount of money in Bitcoins that would hurt them if they were to lose it should seriously consider their moves going forward.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:37:43
But why would they accept it? Historically, governments will *overwhelmingly* choose to keep power rather than relinquish it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:20:58
So basically, if I understand correctly, you're saying that a potential American stock market crash is of greater concern than a potential Bitcoin crash to most people? I'm not sure why that is reason for a lack of concern amongst Bitcoin investors during times like these. I'm not saying everyone should be running around screaming about the end of Bitcoin, but I do think a healthy, balanced level of concern would be appropriate. All I see is people saying, "This has happened before", which is a terribly flawed argument. Like I said in my original post up there, if you would be hurt by losing the money you have invested in Bitcoin then you should be concerned by events like this. And if you don't think those people should be concerned by something like this when would suggest they start being concerned?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:22:13
I understand that that's the point of Bitcoin. This has pretty much nothing to do with my post. It seems like you just wanted to spit a sick one-liner.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:14:40
Perhaps I should have been more clear. It would be in the best interest of the investors if everyone held during a downturn like this, just the same as it would have been in the best interest of people who had money in a bank immediately before the beginning of the Great Depression in America if everyone had just left their money in the bank rather than making a "run" on the bank and trying to get their money out before everyone else got *their* money out, since everyone was concerned that there would be no money left once they decided to go get theirs. That is, of course, in a nutshell what is happening every time the market swings up or down. It's just a bunch of people either trying to get in before everyone else gets in and raises the price or to get out before everyone else gets out and lowers the price.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:35:51
Obviously it would be in the best interest of those who have invested if everyone held. That's the most obvious thing in the world. That's not how the world works though. If you think that everyone who has invested in Bitcoins is going to think about the collective Bitcoin investor community before they think about themselves then you're truly fooling yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:29:54
But unexpected shit happens all the time in investing. It's why so many people get rich off of investing or poor off of investing. If it was possible to just break it down so simply then everyone would pretty much break even because it would be so easy and no one would do stupid things.
Pretty much *everyone* who gets into investing thinks that they're going to be able to "figure it out" better than other people and make out with money. Otherwise people wouldn't do it. It's why diversifying is widely accepted as a good idea. Because you can't just break it down as simply as you have. You're misleading people by implying that the situation is more simple than it actually is.

So my point about Betamax and VHS still stands. Betamax was at one point the dominant system. Then it wasn't. Some would even argue that Betamax was the superior technology. What is it that ensures that Bitcoin won't be "VHS'd"? I don't believe such an insurance can possibly exist. At one point trading livestock for wheat was the dominant system.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:59:56
Yes, it seems highly likely that something resembling Bitcoin will be a major player in the future, but so many people are betting on the idea that it will be Bitcoin and not something like Bitcoin or something slightly more advanced than Bitcoin or something parallel to Bitcoin. It feels like it could be a similar scenario to if I had put all my money into Betamax only for VHS to take over (I know it's a shaky analogy, but I think it gets my point across). I would honestly love for someone to explain to me why I'm wrong, because it seems like a fairly obvious argument to make.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:42:49
Do you truly believe that there aren't people out there (even on this sub) who have invested money that is meaningful to them? Just because people aren't investing their survival money doesn't mean it isn't important what happens to the money that they've invested. If I have $10,000 and I need $9,000 to pay my rent, feed myself, etc, I'm not just gonna randomly throw away the remaining $1,000 on anything.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:54:58
That concept may be here to stay (edit: originally this said "say", rather than "stay"), but you have absolutely no way of knowing that it's here to stay in this exact current form with bitcoins, and that your bitcoins will be worth anything in 25 years, or 5 years, or 1 month. I think this is why people think bitcoin investors are delusional. You seem to see no possible way in which this scenario can turn out anything but positive for you, whereas that obviously isn't true. In fact, you've made a very risky investment.
People just keep saying, "Whatever, it's happened before!", as if that means it's now invulnerable. I could jump off the Golden Gate Bridge 3 times and live through all of them, but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna die the 4th time.

Okay, so what happens when Bitcoin's DVD comes along?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:33:50
Right. My point isn't that cryptocurrencies will fail or succeed. My point is that during my browsing of this sub throughout the night I've seen a whole lot of people implying that investment into Bitcoin is a sure thing, that Bitcoin is bound to succeed, that volatility and crashes like this have no potential for negative effect on Bitcoin investors, and so on. 
I think the problem we're running into here is that people are mixing their investments in with the "cause" of Bitcoin, where they have a desire to see Bitcoin succeed, and are letting that desire affect the decisions they're making in their investing.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:35:50
This is exactly what I've been talking about on this sub tonight. *This* is why people think of Bitcoin investors as delusional. **It does not matter** if Bitcoin is the greatest idea in the history of mankind. **That is not a guarantee that it will not fail**. There are so many factors in play. There are so many powerful influences that may or may not benefit (or perceive benefit) from the success of Bitcoin. This shit is so much more complicated than people are making it out to be.
I don't dislike the idea of Bitcoin. I personally love the concept. And clearly a lot of other people do too. And I think that's why people are so connected to it. But, unless you are either putting money in that you truly do not care about or are willing to lose money that you do care about to further to Bitcoin cause, you need to separate your emotional connection to the success of Bitcoin from the decisions you're making in terms of investments.
One more thing, and I expect this is going to be somewhat of a sensitive point with a lot of people here, is you need to forget about your pride. I believe there are some people here who are saying things and believing things that they wouldn't say or believe if it weren't for their pride. By investing in Bitcoins you essentially bet on its success, right? You went out there and you said, "I've looked at this and researched it and thought about it and decided that I believe it will succeed." And I think there are a lot of people who don't want to admit the possibility that they were wrong. I'm not saying that that's representative of everyone, or representative of the average Bitcoin investor. I just want to remind people that if you've invested meaningful money then it's okay to admit that you're not sure that you were right anymore. No one will think less of you if you decide that it's not worth the risk for you.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:50:07
I'm sorry, but if you have any amount of money invested that you will be hurt by losing you need to consider the fact that this thing *could* legitimately go down and not come back. Bitcoin is not the DOW. Bitcoin is not backed up by the US government. Bitcoin is not "too big to fail". Bitcoin is not guaranteed to come back.
I recognize that the overwhelming consensus on this sub-reddit is that Bitcoin is going to come back stronger than ever, and I understand that, and I'm sure that most of you truly believe that. And I'm not here to say it's going to fail. I have no idea if it's going to fail or end up being the world's currency or anything in between, but *neither do any of you*. And that's the point. If you will be hurt by the loss of the money you have in Bitcoin you need to seriously consider the position you want to take.
I just think it's a bit irresponsible to imply to everyone that they're basically definitely safe when you don't know that that's true.

That doesn't make his comparison a heap of shit. It just makes you stupid.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:03:17
The fact that it's a smaller market doesn't make it less significant that it's less liquid. If you have $10000 dollars in AAPL you'll be able to sell that $10000 dollars ASAP. If you have $10000 in Bitcoins you'll be able to sell that $10000 dollars less ASAP. That (I believe) is his point. The fact that it's a smaller market doesn't make it any less true that the money one has in Bitcoins is less liquid than the money one has in AAPL.

It has been proven time and again that you can not time the bottom. *everyone* thinks that they can time the bottom. No one can time the bottom. Everyone knows buy low / sell high. Investing *is not* as easy as you're trying to make it sound. Do you know how many people bought Bitcoins 5 hours ago (with meaningful money) thinking they were gonna make a bunch of money when the market turned back up? A lot. And do you know how many of those people still have those Bitcoins because the market hasn't turned back up yet? A lot. And you know what? It's entirely possible that those people will never make that money back. This is the danger that occurs when you tell people that investing is as simple as "buy low and sell high". There may only be a 1% chance that the market never hits a new all-time high, but people all around this sub-reddit are acting like it's a pure inevitability that Bitcoins are *the* currency of the future. And that's a dangerous thing to be throwing around.

LOL, what the hell? All of the ***BIG MONEY*** I'm earning right now coaching basketball programs for kids is going to my trip to Japan for study abroad so I can afford to eat rice balls, bread and ramen every day. You think I'm trying to influence people here to sell so I can buy it at an artificially low price? THIS IS THE SHIT RIGHT HERE, MAN. This kind of shit right here is *exactly* what gives this community a bad name. You're delusional. Not to mention, judging by your reply you merely skimmed over my reply to you without attempting to process any of it. You just want to blindly believe what you believe and not accept or consider any other opinions.

$10k in Bitcoins is still the same amount of money as $10k in AAPL stock, so I'd say in practice it's a pretty goddamn important measurement. The point is that people who are investing in Bitcoin are *Expecting* it to act like an established industry when it will not. People think this shit is just set in stone from here on out. People are acting like this shit is GM and has a floor that it can't drop under.
