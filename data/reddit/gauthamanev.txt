Media spreading FUD about banning bitcoin in INDIA. Actual words by finance minister “The government does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin, and will take all measures to curb the use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or any part of payment systems,” . 
Wrong interpretation: Bitcoin is illegal.
Correct interpretation: Bitcoin cannot be used as legal tender. Bitcoin cannot be used for illegitimate activities.

Indians will continue selling for at least 3 to 4hrs because of this FUD. I think the price will continue dropping.
I will wait for a few hours and then buy the dip!
