I've completed multiple wire transfers for significantly more money than this, but I also ensured the names match up, because I'm not an idiot.

Yep, Obamacare definitely helped the economy.... Happy New years :)

Yeah, I bought my gbtc sat around 300... Pretty nice gains this year :). Hodl!

I have it directly too, but I get employer match on 401k so I might as well put something good in there

a bitcoiner who thought the USD economy was doing fine... 3trillion in debt.. print more money.. OK left wing nut, go back to r/btc :)

I wired 20k in with no problem.... Using the same exchange

only idiots believed like-kind ever applied to crypto currency. The law specifically says securities (i'd say cryptocurrency falls under this) and stocks (perhaps under this for the kids who think you have to buy full coins) are not eligible... for the rest "stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale"  if you're a hodler, it's not a taxable event, if you're not a hodler, it's primary held for sale and therefore not permissible to use like-kind.
GOP just made the law easier to understand for the idiots. Personally, i think the idiots should just be penalized by the IRS (that penalty will exceed the gains anyway) but the IRS understaffed, so teaching idiots is the next best thing i guess

Looks like we are the only two who read the article, I was beginning to think I misread based on the other replies lol.

My 401k is very happy with gbtc

You assume he paid close enough attention to which company was being discussed... The typing skills of the two accounts is definitely different from what I've seen

I'm a pretty big fan of Bahrain... It's pretty progressive
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:51:37
Honestly, this makes sense, but I bet it'll be a deal breaker...  
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:16:42
How can you possibly know whether they bought or not... You can't, stop spreading YOUR fake news. No one knows what jpm did or did not do, but since they are intelligent investors, it definitely makes more sense for them to buy the dip than to ignore it.

Ahh that makes sense I guess, but it would still make sense for Newegg to inform users of this surcharge. Of course now I wonder if I have been paying this the whole time and never noticed :(
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:32:31
hah i just recently talked my wife into the same thing but she went for it! got in at 3850 with the biggest investment i've ever stuck in at once.  It was college money, not roof money though.. idk that she would go for a leaky house.... 
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:29:30
awesome! I'll go over it with him, this sounds like something he can handle. or he can just let me manage his bitcoins .... :)  thanks!

"I don't understand math.". FTFY!  :p
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:59:57
I use a paper wallet, so the fees soon my end won't be the problem, but a prior post mentioned bitpays fees, that likely explains it. Still irritating :D

@_date: 2018-04-05 02:17:11
i mean.. filing for bankruptcy is sometimes a genius business decision... trump is a pretty well established businessman..

I'd say you're def clueless; read up on marketing and running a business. Don't let your political views make you seem ignorant.

This is exactly it, you can't get a loan to get a mortgage, you have to have sufficient money (I would assume based on the monthly payment, but I didn't bother asking) in your account and show history
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:23:27
It's just an external bank account, you can see history and amount. That said it is pretty handy. Usaa is definitely the best bank (and insurance company) I've ever used

I don't put my degrees on my resume any more, do no benefit there, but I sure enjoyed the college sluts.

True, but the coinbase records would show if you converted from BTC to usd and then sent to your bank.  I don't use coinbase, so not a big deal for me, but interesting either way.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:52:35
i have it easy, i'm a computer nerd, i play video games and do IT consulting as a job... i just spend my btc on steam and newegg (and another place). no taxes from converting to fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:01:37
that's what im saying, i dont convert to fiat, i just spend the btc. I'm not btcrich enough to have too much i just buy computer shit :)
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:56:18
You can definitely buy drugs with eth... *Cough*
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:54:10
Ah I get what you're saying. Similar to claiming tips.. I did hear the IRS is trying to get a ton of account data from coinbase to go after ppl not paying taxes though...
