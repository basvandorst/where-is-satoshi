Hi guys,
We hold .001 bitcoins so that the transactions go through ASAP. In most cases the fees that get picked up range between 0- 0.0002btc. If that is the case we return the difference to your account.

Good idea. We're looking into it :)

Sorry we didnt get back to you quickly. It's been a little hectic over the past few weeks leading up to the debit card launch.
Yes, coins stored in the vault are guaranteed/insured against any loss that is not caused by our users. We have an FAQ on insurance and the link is added below. In summary, Meridian Insurance, the company that backs our vault, is owned by Xapo and backed by Willis. Willis is one of the largest insurance brokers in the world. 
While this may seem a little sketchy at first it's important to clarify that we've created it this way to separate the assets in case we do go belly up (knock on wood). If something were to happen to Xapo then Meridian, as a separate company, would still exist and be able to pay out claims. We still had to go through the same process with Meridian as we would with any other insurance company -- actuarial analyses, paying premiums, explaining risks/benefits associated with bitcoin, etc...
I know I'm making this quite a long answer. If you have any additional questions feel free to reach out to fernando and I'll be happy to clarify.

Sorry if we weren't clear. Here is the distinction:
- Early Access: You pre-ordered the card from your Xapo account and completed the early access sign up which included inviting up to 20 friends, sharing on FB/Twitter, etc.. More info on that here: 
- Pre-Order: You will receive the card on a first-come first-serve basis. If you dont feel like going through the extra sign of inviting friends please be patient and you should be receiving an email over the next couple days/weeks

We will be adding the fees over the next couple hours. Just triple-checking to make sure we are sharing the correct information with you guys

Hi there,
Fernando from Xapo here. Yes the cards have both a magnetic stripe and chip/pin capabilities. We realize that most of the world uses chip/pin :)
I'll try to chime in and answer as many questions as possible. In the meantime we are working on updating our FAQs before end of day today.

Everyone who pre-ordered the card will be receiving an email over the next few days. There are no additional steps to be completed.
It's just that the first group of emails, aka those that were sent today, were for users that completed the early access signup.

NedRadnad please send your name and email associated with your Xapo account to debit
If you did sign up for early access I will personally make sure you get the invitation link before end of the week.

2 things to note:
- Xapo will be covering the shipping costs for users included in the initial card batch
- Due to U.S. and Indian financial regulations, Xapo cannot currently ship debit cards to U.S. and Indian addresses (all other countries are unaffected). We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. We will begin shipping cards to residents of these countries in the next few batches
