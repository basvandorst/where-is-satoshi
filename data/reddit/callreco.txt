Unlimited block size, not coins.

It's too big of a coincidence, the whole fork debate and suddenly DDoS on Bitcoin.com, crashing of nodes, manipulation of a signed letter. And when all of this happens all we hear from is: lolololololol.

The source is already out. It was closed because of the risk of another attack.
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:46:08
And how are they going to lose everything?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:39:39
Well unless you get more disc space, I don't know how this would happen. I personally do not trust any hosting service for full nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:42:38
Please don't get too desperate and do stupid shit...
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:31:53
Oh snap totally forgot about it...
Edit: My bad OP
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:08:06
Well if you idiots stop attacking other clients, maybe this wouldn't be needed...
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:36:00
Well I am running a full node on my PC all the time. It's not the most powerful either. The only problem you might face is disc space, nothing else. 500MB of RAM is not that much if you have at least, say 4GB.
Edit: Remember that the actual voting is done by the miners.

What happens if I choose to blame Adolf Osama Bin Kjellberg?
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:56:28
Competence about bug hunting, maybe. Although in BU it's going to improve as more people get involved. It's already starting.

Why is this putting Bitcoin as the only "choice"?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:43:56
What does this have to do with the post?
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:29:33
Didn't "xthin blocks" solve the bandwidth problem?
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:52:54
Remind me in 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:48:49
I am talking about xthin blocks.
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:38:03
Yes! That's why I'm commenting on this. Otherwise, what's the point if I myself am not doing it?
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:15:00
How is that harmful to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:24:31
As far as I understand, it allows blocks to be compressed into a very little size, so that they can be broadcasted easily and not take up too much bandwidth. Then when received, they're uncompressed back to normal size. At least that should be the basics from my understanding.

I got scared when he made that mistake.

In torrenting it's best to seed if you want to keep those files around. In Bitcoin it's the same.
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:37:20
True, but isn't there another way then to force this limitation?
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:30:33
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:30:20
Sure, but what about the delay with the transactions confirmations and the bigger taxes?
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:27:26
If they weren't, there wouldn't be any need for Bitcoin to begin with.
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:26:16
So out of nearly 200k people only around 5k are able to? Seems weird to me.
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:41:15
So is this all temporary then?
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:00:03
Wow, so original.
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:18:15
It's normal to be confused about "the current developmental status", this project lost it's original idea. We have no idea where we're all going with all this completely new and unnecessary complexity added for whatever reason.
And if he was trolling, you would know for sure.
