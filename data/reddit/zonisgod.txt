There was some story recently that foretold the idea that banks would start charging for deposits. This is what is driving us to pitchforks.

Coinbase.com will get you your btc in 4 or 5 business days , and then you can sell it immediately and get cash back in your account in 4 or 5 business days. If you have a visa card its a little more automatic, but I don't so I can't tell you how that process works.

This is a pawn shop guys. Half of the business is literally hoping that the people who need dollars NOW are in such dire straights they aren't going to be able to afford to buy back their shit. 
At least thats always been my impression of pawnshops.

I wanted to try and find any bitcoin related "activities" at SxSW this year , because I think these city wide mega festivals are the places that startups similar to bitcoin have flourished. 
edit - similar in size, tech bias, current limitations, and such. Like you said, bitcoin isn't a product or a business, but it's got the grassroots supporters.

I'll sell you a btc for $34,000 dude, don't listen to this guy he's overcharging.

I panicked, bought a ton of laptops. But I used credit cards. This could be trouble.

I like this guy. I'm on his team. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:03:18
Yeah, so advocate for that right ? Lets get better , user friendly methods of keeping btc secure and not yell at people who are skeptical of the security hoops they may not understand.

I wouldn't operate coinbase without the forethought of whatever you do being done days later. It's useful for cashing in, and cashing out, but not quickly.

Snowden helped underscore why satoshi's contribution is so important , he deserves this

I'd love to use bitcoin to buy something - but it hasn't presented the opportunity yet. I had a bunch of money ready to go , but suddenly its value starts tanking. So I cut and ran. I'm waiting for the bottom to buy back in heavier - and when Im ready to buy something, and there's a btc option, you can bet I'll be transacting all the way. 
edit- I bought in at 900/btc. I sold out at 901/btc. I'm coming back in at.. 800 maybe? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:01:06
I had bought higher, so I cut and ran. I plan to regroup and buy back in, probably with more than I had yesterday. Faith is strong, times are tight.

2 mBTC = about $1 , how's that an issue compared to 1 mBTC = $1 ? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:49:57
precedent to say the fed recognizes btc as currency, at least if its attached to a physical coin ?

Is there thoughts on a tablet based POS system too ?

im in this boat. Can't wait to see what the price is like tuesday when I actually get to use my btc ! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:56:44
I agree that there's too much speculative hype and doom and gloom- but the exchange rate is a real concern when trying to use btc in the real world. When it jumps to $1200 and back down to $700, that still affects the adoption. 
There should be a discussion here about the price, where it's headed- otherwise consumers and merchants won't feel comfortable relying on its value.

"Deal with it. Deal with your personal security" - is not how you get the masses to adopt a new normalcy. If the world is to adopt, we can't sit around waiting for the world to catch up on the personal liability and responsibility tip.
