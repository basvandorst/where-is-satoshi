All people who eat die. You're people. You eat. You're alive. That disproves the argument right there, until the day you die.
What's so difficult to understand about that?
It can't be proven that all people who eat die until all people are dead, as all people eat. Asceticism has been disproven long ago, so all people eat.

I mean, I've obliged someone who had the "rape fantasy" thing once. It was mildly disturbing, but \**sigh* if you insist...

Depending on what you're eating, you could survive on the water content of the food you consume.

But... my question was geuine.
God help me, I'm going to be obligated to rape you straight in the face if you answer is "yes" again. No jury will convict me.
Perhaps God can sit this one out. Ride the pine, God... ride that pine.

Only as seriously as is warranted. I do eat food and I do live, so bring it or go home?
Do I live? Would you care to test this, or are you fullofsiht? We can test that as well... guess whose suppositions are going to come out ahead on that day? I guarantee you that one of us contains feces.
Surprise twist: we both are alive and you're double-wrong. Oh snap... you are alive, and in living defeated your argument. Dag. I've never really encountered someone whose argument was disproven simply by LIVING before. Is there some sort of *award* we can give you?

In that case, I've broken your rule because I both eat food and am alive. Until I die, you cannot prove your rule.
Suck some of that logic.

Until humanity is extinct, that has yet to be proven.

Sick like "wicked sick" or sick like "that's awful"?
Ten demerits if your answer is "yes".
edit: I think I've pretty much just assured that the answer's going to be "yes".
