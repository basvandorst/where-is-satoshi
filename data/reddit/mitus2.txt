new exchange? 800'000 btc missing. with 1% fee, a volume of 80'000'000 BTC traded is necessary. yesterday volume on Bitstamp was around 10'000. so for the new exchange to repay the debt are necessary 21 years.

They re spamming since they re (were) broadcasting transactions every 5 seconds. They could reunite the tips in one unique transaction broadcasted evey let's say 3 mins. Lots of fee saved for them, no spam for us. But that's not what they wanted, they wanted to appear in front page of blockchain.info .

ok but the thing i don't get it is: how do they materially are involved in the disappeareance of mtgox's BTC?
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:02:37


AFAIK they are liable only for direct and immediate damages.  secondly what sort of damage they caused?

Hi, i'm a merchant too and i accept BTC in my jewelry shop.
Apart from the promotion that you already stated, i can suggest you to add your shop to [OpenStreetMap](
OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, cafés, shops,..., and it is very used in BTC community.
When you set the tags for your shop remember to add payment:bitcoin YES so customers can easily find you if they want to pay with BTC.
Let me know if you need help adding your shop!
P.S. for everyone: openstreetmap project accepts Bitcoin donations [Link](
