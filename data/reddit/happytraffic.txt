Anyone can build a second layer solution. Open source Bitcoin is still the bedrock/foundation. In theory, you never have to use lightning or any other layer two solution. You're being overly dramatic.

None of us really care to give any publicity to this garbage. A new person claims to be Statoshi once a month. Gossip like this belong in tabloids and on TMZ.

Thanks and no worries. I'm just as sick of these "you'll never see 4 digits again" posts as you. They are manipulative and getting old.
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:35:02
My post is sarcastic for that exact reason.
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:39:43
Just got one. Thanks!

All I want out of life is to be healthy and buy the new C8 Corvette. I'm rooting for you to be right!

I was being sarcastic in my post. I too am tired of these posts. That's why I posted such an oddly specific number insead of 10k.
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:12:05
I missed the dips to 9k while I was at work. I’m hoping this rise is a brief takeout so I can buy and then hold long term.

This is the last time you'll ever be able to buy Bitcoin for $9,991...
Edit: Adding the \s to this post since people are missing the sarcasm. �� I am long, but these "last time under 10k" posts are getting annoying.

Looking at your account, you've had it for 6 years and deleted all history outside of the past few weeks. The only thing you seem to do is act dumb about Bitcoin and then trash segwit and lightning. If I had to guess, you're a troll who is trying to stir stuff up on this subreddit...
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:17:54
It's less about you maintaining privacy and more around the types of posts you've made. Your remaining posts are mostly reactionary and aggressive posts about segwit and lighting. Your comments sound straight out of I'm open to having you learn, but having full blown rants against a technology you don't understand is not going to help that. Telling people and tech to F off is not what this subreddit is about.

I like the blocksize where it is now, especially with Segwit gaining steam. I do not support a larger blocksize.

I’ll buy one if the opportunity arises. The Huracan platform is rock solid.

Red Z51 with flash carbon accents and aftermarket bronze wheels. �� Do I buy the high wing option or just wait for a better 3rd party solution?

If the whales want our coins, that's a good price to hit. I'll be selling a bit at that level to buy a C8 Corvette. I'm sure others will sell then too. Eat up all the coins.

Thanks. Of course, it only pans out if Bitcoin moons. I've been waiting on the rumored mid-engine Vette for a few years now. I'm excited to see it's finally real.
What about you?

BTC is Telecom in the Bahamas where are being destroyed right now. This is unrelated to Bitcoin.
