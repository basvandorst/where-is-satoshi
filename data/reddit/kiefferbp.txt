Just because a fork has more hashing power doesn't mean it is the winning fork. It is only the winning fork if the nodes that matter agree that it is a winning fork; otherwise, coins like LTC couldn't exist as BTC's "fork" has more hashrate than LTC's main chain.

That's because you are anti-educated.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:58:12
Obviously, but I was talking about shutting out Chinese miners. Even if they have most of the hashrate, we can still shut them out. It would be very painful to Bitcoin, but it can be done.
I didn't even mention anything about blocksize. Did you respond to the right comment?

@_date: 2015-06-12 17:34:28
And who gets to decide that it isn't a valid fork of Bitcoin's chain? The nodes. That's my point. We can just say that the Chinese blocks are invalid no matter how powerful their pools are---it doesn't matter that they produce the majority of the blocks if they are considered garbage to the US nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-25 18:43:18
That's why I wrote "download" in italics. I am not against the block size limit, but I think it's foolish that people are looking at the download speed trend and not the upload speed one when the latter is truly what matters. Unless the network speeds are symmetrical, the upload speeds tend to be quite poor in comparison.

@_date: 2014-04-17 15:21:18
Most likely not recently. The only reason why they would have been able to do that back then is because everyone else was GPU mining. 
Also, I highly doubt any one manufacturer would spit out 25+ PH/s of mining equipment fast enough to produce a scare. Their throughput most likely allows them to put their miners online ASAP without issues.

@_date: 2015-06-10 20:52:29
No. His point was that it isn't growing by 3600 coins/day because the unaccounted-for coins are being sold OTC, which is way too simplistic. Not all coins are dumped, and even the ones that are dumped are getting bought on exchanges. Maybe if *no one* buys coins on exchanges the sell volume will go up by the number of coins that are being dumped, but this is obviously not the case.
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:15:59
You're right; he isn't making sense. The true reason is that including more transactions in a block increases its size, which makes the block slower to propagate across the network, which in turn increases the chance of the block becoming orphaned and the miner to lose his reward (as the block is no longer part of the main chain). Due to transaction fees, however, there is a trade-off; there have been some calculations done in the past, but I think something along the lines of 0.1 to 0.2 mBTC per KB is enough for a transaction fee to overcome the potential BTC loss from including said transaction in the block and have that be the reason it orphaned.

Wrong. On any given draw the probability of NOT picking the blue jelly bean is 9/10, so drawing solely red jelly beans 10 times in a row occurs with probability (9/10)^10 and, therefore, the probability of drawing at least one blue jelly bean out of 10 is 1 - (9/10)^10 , not 1.


Wrong. By definition, an event with 100% probability is sure to happen.


A probability of 20? Ha! Good one!

Actually, N in the Binomial distribution is the number of trials made to find a block (which equals the number of hashes, which is really large) and p is the probability that a given hash solves a block (which is really small). You really should be modeling mining as a Poisson distribution.
If P2Pool is expected to find 20 blocks in 18 days, the probability it only finds 14 is 20^14 * e^(-20) / 14! (approximately 3.87%).

What difference does it make if it's all done offline?
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:16:51
I know that. As I said, transactions increase the size and propogation time of blocks, and thus increase the orphan percentage. Consequently, a block with zero transactions is smaller, propogates faster, and has a smaller orphan rate than one with transactions. 
The problem with your theory is that miners include transactions automatically in the merkle root BEFORE they hash, so they are not wasting any work. It's not like the miners are like "that hash didn't work? better try removing all the transactions!" Instead, they do " that hash didn't work? better change the nonce (or something else if the nonce overflows)!" Because of this, other than when there just aren't any transactions to include or the orphan point, there is no point to just make a block with zero fees. It's not like it takes any effort to put them in there (bitcoind does this automatically for you).
Also, to continue with what I said above, despite the orphan issues with including transactions, transactions with a high-enough fee make up for the increase an orphans that they cause, and so it is in the miner's best interest to include such transactions.

Actually, that's the probability of mining 7 blocks before the network mines any, but still. I can mine 8 while the network mines 1, 9 while the network mines 2, etc. and still pull off a double-spend, which is why the probability is much higher.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:06:22
I believe we interpreted the question differently then. When I see the word "miner," I assumed it was a single person with an arbitrary number of mining equipments. You appear to assume that it meant the mining equipment itself. Both are valid, but both also produce different answers. 
In that case, a better wording of the OP'S question would be something like "if a single person has multiple miners, how does the mining software guarantee that duplicate work isn't generated?" The answer to that, I assume, is similar to the one he suggested: perform the work in parallel; that is, give each miner a disjoint set of nonces to test so that, sans collisions, the resulting work would be different.
**EDIT**: Your assumption is indeed the correct one. I didn't read the question title completely, but read the question stated in the additional details.
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:04:44
Kinda too late to sell them though. I still like having them.
BTW, not sure why you got downvoted. You do have a valid point.
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:50:33
I will say transaction fees, but the "goal" is that by the time this happens there will be enough transactions going through the network to have the transaction fees be a sizeable amount (of course, the block size limit would have to increase first).
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:24:09

@_date: 2014-04-06 23:17:04
He said *less profitable*, not *isn't profitable*. Big difference.
Also, what was saying that factoring in the fees, you get less BTC mining Myriad than if you just mined BTC directly, despite the fact that you get slightly more if there are no fees involved. Even with no fees, dealing with a trading a shitcoin just for a measily 1000 satoshis extra---and that's assuming the exchange rate doesn't drop---is not worth it. Instead, why not just collect pennies you find laying around?
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:58:09
Why was this downvoted?
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:00:44


Oh yes it does. If each miner was hashing the same data, the miner who has the highest hashrate would find all of the blocks for the pool (since he can check all of the nonces faster). This would be beyond inefficient. Making all of the miners perform work on slightly different blocks (different in the arbitrary data) forces the data found for each miner to be random, causing the miners' hashrates to be additive. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:18:26
I would say that I am a pretty big VTC guy. I moved a lot of my BTC to VTC  recently. However, I have to play devil's advocate here.


Vertcoin's three P2Pool networks currently make up about 12 percent of the network hashrate; this small percentage is not what I would call *vastly consuming* (vastly consuming to me = at the very least the majority of the network).
Your merged-mining point is moot. I wouldn't call mining a bunch of parasite coins that the average Joe Schmoe miner would just dump on the markets a killer feature. Monocle is nice as a testbed, but that's really the only real benefit for Vertcoin's merged-mining.
As for stealth addresses: Bitcoin should get this eventually, so I don't see what the big deal is with this.

@_date: 2014-04-06 03:59:56
Exactly. Really, the dangers of an insecure blockchain are caused from either a super-low hashrate (most non-shitty altcoins like LTC and DOGE, IMO, have sufficient hashrates to migrate this) or a sudden in-flux of e ASICs that could lead to an easier centralization of hashrate. I remember when ASICs were first coming out the door that an ASIC manufacturer---forgot which---had a small tray of ASICs whose combined hashrate could perform a 51% attack at the time. So much for high hashrates being good, eh?

@_date: 2014-06-09 11:39:29
Right, but the extra blocks comes from the fact that you need to re-write blocks to reverse a double-spend, and the assumption in my post was that the attacker is reversing a transaction with 6 confirmations (wasn't really made clear---sorry). 
Say the transaction I am looking to reverse is in block X and the honest network is on block X + Y with Y &gt;= 5 (so that the transaction has Y + 1 confirmations, at least 6, as it is included in blocks X through X + Y). I would need to re-write blocks X through X + Y and mine the block X + Y + 1, a total of Y + 2 blocks, before my chain with my double-spend is the longest. As a result, an attacker wanting to reverse this transaction is at a (Y + 2)-block deficit because he has to re-work the blocks that the honest network mined to give him those Y + 1 confirmations.

Sure, but you do realize that this is not what the OP said. By saying that Vertcoin has a decentralized mining network and that P2Pool "vastly consumes" the network, he is basically implying that Vertcoin's mining decentralization is unique when it really isn't. Yes, a decent chunk of Vertcoin is P2Pool, but it is still subjectible to 51% attacks as much as any other cryptocurrency. Also, I am willing to bet that as Vertcoin gains adoption, the percentage of the network that P2Pool has will drop like a rock.


The main point brought up by the OP about merged-mining was the extra profits; the Monocle testbed was barely brought up. I am well aware of the benefits of Vertcoin's merged-mining initiative, but this was barely touched by the OP. By the way, to counter the profit argument: Bitcoin has merged mining too, and there are significantly more coins one can merge-mine with.


Yep, but once Bitcoin adds them it will no longer be a distinguishing factor. Also, if I want true anonymity right now, there's Darkcoin.

The 12% figure I reported was taken from [this P2Pool finder]( earlier this morning. Right now, it shows that the three P2Pool networks are hashing at 681MH/s (10.2%), 120MH/s (1.8%), and 23MH/s (0.3%) respectively. So who is over-exaggerating now?


Fair enough, but, IMO, it would have been much better to mention Vertcoin's ASIC resistance stance in much greater detail than you did.


Your OP got removed so I cannot verify, but I'm pretty sure the merged-mining point consumed much more than a quarter of it (you spent several lines explaining Monocle and Parallax for example).

So let me see if I understand this correctly. Say a car dealership wanted to sell a car to someone. What the dealership could do is take, say, 1 mBTC, taint it through Colored Coins, and send the 1 mBTC to the buyer. This 1 mBTC would then represent proof of ownership, and sending this 1 mBTC to someone else would transfer the "ownership documents" if you will to someone else, and this can be tracked because the coin was tainted. Then, if the owner of the car needs to take the car to the dealership for some reason, he can prove that he owns the car by, say, signing a message from the address that holds the tainted 1 mBTC. Is this right?
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:24:44
Actually, the 7 TPS limit is only on how many transactions can be included in a block (only restricted due to the 1MB block size), not the number of transactions that can propagate throughout the network. Exceeding the 7 TPS in bursts is possible and happens all the time; the only issue is if the network can sustain an average rate of &gt;7 TPS, causing an ever-increasing backlog of transactions **to be confirmed**.

Your point?
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:35:42
The post you responded to is perfectly accurate. Also, your "ELI5" post, IMO, is nowhere near accurate and, therefore, probably adds a lot more confusion.
Your post tries to add intuition that events with probability 1 don't always have to happen. To do this, you compared one probability 1 event (drawing a blue jelly bean) to another probability 1 event (overtaking the honest network when you have &gt;50% of the network). One problem: the former event actually doesn't have a probability of 1 as I explained above, so the two events are not comparable. In fact, you won't be able to find an example to prove your point because your point was never true to begin with. Simple as that.
Here's what I think you meant though: take a standard coin and flip it an infinite number of times. You are guaranteed to get at least one heads amongst these infinite coin flips, but if you only flip it a finite number of times there is a chance you will get no heads at all. The same goes with the blockchain. Even though I may have &gt;51% of the network hashrate, I may get extremely unlucky and not find a single block before my hardware craps out on me. 
The point is: while it is true that an attacker with &gt;51% of the network hashrate isn't guaranteed to overtake the honest network in finite time (hence the wording "100% probability given enough time"), as time progresses the probability of him not overtaking the network is infinitesimal.

Yep, but the difference with Vertcoin is that all three networks are expected to find blocks within &lt; 12 hours due to the relatively-small size of their network. Bitcoin's P2Pool network is only expected to find one every 24 hours (more or less), so trying to split that up would trade extremely-high share variance (for small miners) for extremely-high block variance.
It might help if Bitcoin's P2Pool network goes back to targeting a 10-second share time.

Yeah. That was a useless post on my part.
However, suppose the PC was infected. Since the PC is never brought online, the only way for the malware to compromise the private key is if it compromises key generation (avoidable with hexadecimal dice), or if it infects the USB drive and is plugged into an online PC (easy solution: don't. Do transaction signing offline and then submit the raw transaction on an online PC---pain in the ass to manually type the entire raw transaction yourself instead of being able to copy/paste from a flash drive, but if one's paranoid...).

Well, obviously, but the person I responded to said that someone (hinting at GHash.IO) has been caught orphaning other pools' blocks red-handedly, and then links to a post mentioning that a couple of miners were pulling off a block-withholding attack on Eligius which has nothing to do with the selfish-mining point that the person I responded to brought up.

Hackers having the password hashes is bad, but making this login form can make their jobs *much* easier. Instead of having to generate random passwords to try and having to go through all of the salts for each person in an attempt to find a match (which, by the design of password salts, makes it difficult to map passwords to people), they can just narrow it down to a single password for each form submission. What do I mean? Put on your tinfoil hat for a second.
Suppose that they do *not* know the UUID&lt;-&gt;username mapping. They can actually probably figure out this mapping on the assumption that if the entered password is correct (they can verify that this is by running the password through all of the salts in the database, either finding a match with one of them to figure out that the password is correct, or not finding a match to figure out that the password is invalid) and that the password is uncommon (they have probably brute-forced all of the simple passwords), the username entered is probably right too and, therefore, the mapping is made. If this is, in fact, the case, entering in an invalid e-mail but a correct password *could* let you through.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:57:04
Agreed. This is the tragedy of the commons. Miners think "I'm tiny and insignificant, so it wouldn't make a difference if I stay!" 
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:52:53
No it doesn't. If you cannot make enough to pay your electricity bills, you will lose even more money than just the sunk cost of the miner.
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:50:47
properly answered the question. You said that miners don't know that they aren't producing the same work, and your post says that this is the case of SHA256's collision resistance. This is wrong. Miners are *almost surely* not going to produce the same work because they are hashing *different data* (only exceptions are, as you've said, collisions), as explained by Imagining it from a standpoint from someone who doesn't know the answer: miners in a single pool *seem* like they are doing the same work since the data that is being hashed *seems* to be similar (as everyone is working with the same transactions as others are in a pool and the coinbase transaction pays to the same person, namely the pool operator), but they aren't due to the arbitrary data given to each and every miner of the pool in the coinbase. None of this was explained in your answer.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:43:20
Not really. The database leak probably contains salted passwords. If that's the case, when one enters their login information it would be trivial for the hackers to compare the password + salt's hash to the one found in the database. If the hash differs, the hackers would know that the password is wrong and they could make their actions seem legitimate by saying that the password is wrong.
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:12:04
I'm well aware that they can use something like this or cooperate with a mining pool to ensure a speedy entry into a block; however, I don't really see why this is "needed." Just don't be a cheap bastard and pay the few cents to begin with.  
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:48:21
I can't give you an update either. /s
@_date: 2014-07-03 21:58:24


The first part of that statement is fine: the information that gets hashed includes the Merkle root of the transactions to be included in that block; however, your second part is incorrect for that reason: that in order to compute a meaningful hash you need to know the transactions you would like to include in the block ahead of time (that is, you pick the transactions, hash them together to form a Merkle root, take the Merkle root and hash it with other stuff---I know the details but they are immaterial for this discussion).


I'm not sure how the sentence preceding this sentence implies this sentence. Moreover, like I said above, the miner (well, to be more specific in the case of pooled mining, *the pool*) gets to choose what transactions he wants in his blocks.


Again, the miners get to choose what is and isn't in their blocks, so there's no randomness involved. 


Nope. Their only purpose is to reduce mining revenue variance.

12% or 20%, it's still not what I would call "vastly consuming." I am well aware that Vertcoin's P2Pool is one of the best (if not the best), but this was not mentioned in the OP.


Nope. 
You're acting as if Vertcoin's merged-mining is somehow special. Bitcoin has merged mining too. If I had an innovative coin idea and wanted to have the coin merge-mined with another (said one or two coin devs ever), I would rather have it merge-mined with the tried-and-true Bitcoin than the obscure Vertcoin.
And, by the way, I am on your side.
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:33:57
It isn't. I have solely used blockchain.info's wallet, which just sends it back to the same wallet (instead of automatically creating another like what Bitcoin-QT does). I know the malicious one says that it estimates that 0.01 BTC was transacted, indicating that the unknown address is a change address, but I do not own the address (I own 3 on blockchain.info). My theory is that somebody imported my blockchain.info wallet's private key into something like Bitcoin-QT, did the transaction, and Bitcoin-QT generated that address.

If the new fork requires that the attacker's fork must beat the honest network's fork when it comes to transaction priority, then the attacker will eventually lose. It's not as simple as just switching forks like you make it out to be.

Not only that, but you can do what ghash.io did back when they added LTC mining by providing double block rewards (or similar). ghash.io had to tone down the rewards a bit to prevent getting 51% of LTC's hashrate, but a malicious pool would let it continue obviously.

Yeah, but DO has full access to their servers, which includes their nodes. They are essentially running multiple nodes themselves, which is completely redundant. The goal is to have nodes ran by more people, not to have several nodes ran by the same person.

@_date: 2015-07-26 01:34:02
Having multiple copies with a copy for each person is fine, but having 1000+ nodes being run by the same "person" (in this case, Digital Ocean) does nothing. You effectively have very little control over your DO node, since DO can fuck with it at will if they wanted to.

Your input/output logic is incorrect. It is perfectly valid to, say, use 5 inputs to pay someone with 1 output. The thing is that the difference between the sum of the inputs and the sum of the outputs is the transaction fee. If you have 5 BTC in inputs and only 1 BTC in outputs, you end up having a 4 BTC fee. The solution is to have another output that sends yourself 3.99xx BTC so that the difference is small enough for a reasonable fee.
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:11:34
The problem is that you are expecting the growth to continue for another 20 years. It might, but it might not.
