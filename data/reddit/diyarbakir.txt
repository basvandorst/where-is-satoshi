Huobi had a 1185 btc buy just moments before that.
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:49:40
He could pump the price to 1000+ again without worrying about it :D If I were him I would buy everything up to 1000 just for fun.
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:32:42
You will sell it back tomorrow probably.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:12:14
Proof of buy please ;) Otherwise bs.
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:32:59
I think you will be fine. Just wait until some new announcement from Gox. You can't do much about it right now as you're stuck I guess.
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:52:43
Fck off with the China ban man. They ban bitcoin every week.
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:11:01
Up we goooo.... until the next China ban of course ;) Maybe this time they will shut down the exchanges.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:16:22
How is this breaking news LOL. We have been hearing this since December last year! Nothing new.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:23:40
Sure man, say goodbye to your coins and give them to me please :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:36:02
Are we going to create a separate thread for each Chinese bank that bans bitcoin? We know this already. Get over it. China is still buying. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:50:30
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:16:17
Stop the spam.
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:41:26
Yes, I am starting to lose hope. This is just bs man. As soon as the market starts to recover a little bit it is followed by a crash.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:38:07
Panic is happening :) get used to it. It is quite common in this market. It will go back up soon do not worry about it.
@_date: 2014-08-18 11:45:42
309 !!!
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:01:41
Can you please provide a link stating that the China ban news is true? :)
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:52:18
Karpeles will stay. Gox will stay and enable withdrawals. Part of their customers will leave but enough will stay to keep Gox up and running. They are not going anywhere.
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:00:44
Hope he didn't sell :D
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:06:19
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:10:10
Of course you should not sell if you can afford to lose the money. Just hold for a few years and see what happens. Could be a life changing decision.
@_date: 2014-04-04 10:01:25
I have not seen any exchange with faster deposit or withdrawal times as Kraken. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:39:47
For mainstream adoption we need people to trust the whole bitcoin infrastructure and they need to be confident that their hard earned fiat (or bitcoin) is safe when they store it (either locally or somewhere else). I think this is a huge issue with bitcoin. A simple mistake or event could make you lose a fortune. Even if you have several encrypted backups of your bitcoins, even if the exchange is supposed to be "the most reliable exchange in the world", there are still numerous things that can happen. However, when you store fiat at a bank, usually there is some kind of guarantee (or insurance) that covers your losses (not all) to certain extend. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:02:09
We don't need China man.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:10:07
Much more lucrative than robbing a bank I guess. Smart guy. Bad, but very very smart ;)
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:53:58
Ask the general public if they've ever heard of Bitcoin before. Now ask the same question for any other altcoin :) You'll have your answer.
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:23:23
Panic. That's all. 
Bitcoin has survived many crashes and always came back stronger.
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:37:08
Make a screenshot for future reference :D would be fun. We will hit that some day. No doubt.
Edit: 
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:22:25
Apparently Bitcoin does not need any promoting at that campus anymore ;) smart kids already invested in their future.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:33:32
I think this is the bottom... 520 :) We will bounce.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:34:17
It shouldn't be that hard to twitter something like: 
"Stop the panic, we're still here".
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:16:32
I lost a lot on Litecoin. I basically bought at the top in November 2013 for 29 EUR each. That is a lot :) But, no regrets at all. I have always believed in Litecoin being a good alternative to Bitcoin because it has a much smaller entry point for new investors.
Why did I buy litecoin and not bitcoin? Simple. I thought I missed the bitcoin train, read about litecoin and decided to buy. I think that many people think (and thought) the same. 
BTW, I am not writing this for a tip. Just wanted to say that I believe in Litecoin and I hope a lot of you still do too. Thanks ;)
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:32:20
I can imagine that one day Hollywood is going to make a blockbuster movie about this. This is really great stuff man.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:50:51
This is old news man. China banning bitcoin every week lol.
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:15:54
..., according to people with knowledge of the matter, ...
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:02:02
It's just a matter of waiting for the next big bad news. I think we will have more and more bad news this year and the market will crash to pre-China prices. Maybe I am wrong. Let's hope I am wrong because whatever happens, I am holding my coins :)
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:47:24
Is this even possible?
@_date: 2014-03-24 09:22:13
Colombia lol. Who cares about Colombia man they even ban chocolate when they don't like it :D 
@_date: 2014-05-09 10:06:21
They made someone rich beyond our dreames. At least if the thief holds on to them for at least several years. Probably he/she will sell them in small parts over the next few years. That's what I would do.
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:25:08
Gox is controlling our lives at the moment.
Just refresh Gox news. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:32:30
I am going to lose some money again because of them. This is the 3rd time already man fckng noobs over there. Going to transfer all my coins back asap. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:10:49
These guys also said that bitcoin was even worse than the tulip mania and that the bubble would pop soon.
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:22:55
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:41:19
With todays computer power, yes you are right. But think about the future. Chips in your mobile phone were supercomputers 20 years ago. So just imagine 20 years from now, we have access to supercomputers and these kind of calculations are "normal". What would happen then? :) Is Bitcoin prepared for this?
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:46:01
Gox will now announce they have a fix in place :) Mark just sold all the GoxCoins he bought for cheap and made some good money.
@_date: 2014-05-15 08:23:41
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:46:06
So can anyone please explain in lame terms what this actually means?
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:40:47
They are not hacked you moron.
@_date: 2014-03-24 09:24:44
Or you could just learn Turkish for a change LOL.
@_date: 2014-03-24 09:29:38
Kraken is very professional but they need more support from us :) 
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:56:53
I have similar experiences with Kraken. Always had my money the same day. Very good.
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:54:54
OMG it's not a glitch. It was actually bought by someone :D
@_date: 2014-04-25 08:11:16
Remember what happened when we cut off from Gox prices? Gox went down below $100 and all other exchanges stayed at the same price levels without dropping. We refused to go down with Gox. Can't we do the same with China? Maybe we should. Just let China play their own game.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:38:41
If this is the crash on fake news, what will be the impact of real news ? :)
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:23:54
I want to believe that bitcoin will break $10k one day. But looking at the current trend, the bad things happening lately, I can't even imagine the price breaking $1k any time soon :) I think we might even go much lower than the current prices. Maybe even as low as &lt;$100.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:32:00
Panic... panic panic panic that's all.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:36:47
Why are the big exchanges not making an announcement?
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:18:56
Of course he is not evil but he could at least give his customers some more info on the situation. If it's bad, just tell them but don't leave everyone in the dark like this. But i agree, he's not evil and probably tries to do whatever lies in his power to make the best out of it (whatever that would be).
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:54:43
Never invest more than you can afford to lose or actually, willing to lose. We have all been shouting this from the beginning. It is a risky investment. Too bad you made this mistake but do not worry. It is just money :) life goes on, with or without it. Sorry for your loss but keep your head up and move on. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:44:51
Gox? What's that?
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:51:32
We already have several threads with the same issue. It is a small exchange so it is not even worth mentioning to my mind unless you want to create some more panic ;) 
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:44:41
You're missing a lot. There are people who invested a lot of money into btc and they are on the edge of losing it which drives many of them crazy. Like literally crazy. Look at the prices on Gox. Mark and his team can end the panic if they want and save lots of people a heart attack but instead they decide to be silent and leave their customers in the dark. If they are solvent or not doesn't even matter at this point for the main target they're heading at which is their own END. Gox is finished.
@_date: 2014-04-30 13:57:47
Lets ask them if they are willing to do so ;)
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:10:06
Still no confirmation :) FUD.
@_date: 2014-03-21 11:26:57
Litecoins were sold for 1 CNY a piece? WTF happened on Huobi?
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:49:20
That's what I suggested before in a comment.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:15:58
Can I use it to print a shirt? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:25:24
could you help me too please. Ticket number 306032.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:55:29
Same here. Ticket number 306032.
Kraken why o why the bad service? Come on dudes. Deposit €500 is on hold.
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:01:19
I think there might be a hack indeed. All coins lost :( otherwise they would have given us an estimate on how long the downtime would take.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:03:57
It is my first and only account here so please don't do this. I am just wondering sincerely why people jumped on the BTC train knowing that Satoshi already had a huge pile for himself? Maybe the correct term is not premining I am not sure but my question is still the same.
