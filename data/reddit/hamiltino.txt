I completely disagree, bluechip shares get the most investors because they are stable and less risky. Precious metals are also another example of this. The less risky and more stable the currency is, the more investors and users you will see.
Remember money should be a store of value, if the value fluctuates its hard to call it money because I can't recommend people to use it if keeping value is important to them. We are talking money not ROI.
The road to mass adoption is stability. Remember it does not mean investors can not profit, it means the currency caters to what the world needs which is a way to opt out of the banking system smoothly.
If there is no major financial collapse within 1 year, another unstoppable currency will take its place and truly change the economic landscape.

Since i know you guys are always looking to invest in the next big thing, do yourselves a favour and checkout out maidsafe if you haven't already. They are building new network protocols that decentralize the internet. Safecoin will be the appcoin that the network will use and its not based on blockchain technology yet still manages to be completely p2p. safecoin does not burn electricity to secure the network, it will have no tx fees, no blockchain bloat and will be completely anonymous.

Why use bitcoins in a way they will never succeed in: daily consumer purchases. When bitcoins are volatile, they are limited to more niche uses like paying for things anonymously, gambling, remittance, online tipping/donating, hedging against fiat inflation, tax evasion, global money transfer and a medium for investing in other crypto projects/developments.

A ledger which gives MASSIVE precedence to chinese farmers and early adopters is not a ledger i want to be apart of. I would be ok with it if it didn't really effect me but it DOES!!!
Wait till we get a more robust ledger or bookkeeping mechanism less subject to volatility, then we can catapult ourselves to exponential adoption. Please don't be a bitcoin cultist as evolution in money is coming and i don't want to see it slow down because you can't let go of something due to some kind of emotional attachment. 
Dynamic creation rate, system reserves to buy and sell, transaction fee burning according to market conditions. This will be the future, lets get there instead of thinking bitcoin is all or nothing. Innovation in market dynamics is king!!
Of-course bitcoin can become less volatile, if its the only currency we transact in, it won't matter. Remember that it would take 30+ years for that to happen, why the fuck wait when we can get there in 10? This is where my concern in the bitcoin community lies, they would rather get to the destination in a car rather than a plane.

Safecoin has features which are desirable; no transaction fees, anonymous, instant transactions(no confirmation time) and has no blockchain bloat, allowing it to scale to 1000's+ of transactions per seconds compared bitcoin which can only handle 7 tps. The safe network requires users to contribute resources such as bandwidth and space in order for the network to work(this is where safecoins are important). Maidsafe has basically re-rewritten many layers of the current internet infrastructure(primarily the application layer and the transport layer). Application developers will be paid by the network according to how popular there apps are. If there is alot of get requests then they get paid more safecoin, you can see that its a new business model that allows developers to not have to focus on marketing or ways to monetize their products.

You don't understand, the system should increase the creation rate and give coins to the holders if demand is significantly exceeding supply. So instead of making money through an increase in the price, the holder makes money through an account with more currency units.

WRONG, This only applies to blockchain based currencies. Bitcoin could never replicate some features such as no blockchain bloat, no confirmations, no tx fees, complete anonymity; features of a p2p non-blockchain currency called safecoin due to be released soon. Maidsafe, look it up. Its all about ROI, if you can't see that then you are blind. Coins don't need to beat bitcoin in order to get massive ROI. Bitcoin doubling is a big deal these days, for a smaller market cap currency, doubling the value is nothing, it can go up 5x+ with ease.

Imagine that there was 1 million kg of gold in the world. 90% of them were owned by 10 people and the rest were owned by the masses.
Now Imagine there was a new discovery of platinum, its intrinsic value was the same or similar to gold. The total was 1 million kg but the distribution was much better where 90% of it was distributed evenly amongst the people and 10% was owned by 10 people.
Which would you choose as a currency?
Now for me the perfect currency is to provide stability in price (users would get interest on balances instead) while the current monetary system exists. This would make it easy for people to transition. Once the monetary system is obsolete, stop creation of any more units and interest . Do you want to kill the banking system with a blunt object or a knife? The answer is obvious, both will work but one will be 10x more efficient. Life is too short, lets make sure we change the economy as quick as possible.

If you have over 51% of the network, you can do alot of harm:
I quote: "An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain."

I think with blockchain based cryptocurrencies, bitcoin will retain its dominance unless it gets 51% attacked. For cryptocurrencies in general? Very likely, although I am very much interested in non-blockchain currencies which still retain a p2p distributed model. Maidsafe and the safe network will be really interesting. Looks like it will be a very disruptive technology/network. 
Bitcoin's code is ever changing and so it's code will be changed if need be.

It doesn't matter how big the hashing network is(centralization), its just miners solving meaningless "sudoku" puzzles. If you don't believe me, look at what proof of stake can accomplish, albeit it has problems such as the nothing at stake issue but there are cryptocurrencies which have taken steps to solve this; ethereum and bitshares are examples. They don't need any hashing at all and they can be as secure as the biggest pow SHA256 mining network. The adoption and infastructure/services effect is a better indicator for bitcoins relevance. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:46:26
You could always send a private key over sms. That way you are not relying on a central service. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:36:42
What do you mean by network effect? Hashing power or adoption? If the latter i agree, if the former i disagree. Or does network effect just mean that user adoption is creating a bigger mining network.
EDIT: network effect as being user adoption making the coin more valuable, ok i got the definition wrong.

I thought the idea of sidechains was to keep your value in bitcoin. So if i move some of my bitcoins into a sidechain, the only way i could loose money is if the actual price of bitcoin falls. But your saying that i can put my bitcoins in a sidechain and still loose all my bitcoins if the sidechain gets devalued from inflation..etc. The only other way i can see sidechains maintain there value if it worked like that is if the production of coins is evenly distributed to to all coinholders in order to maintain the bitcoin-sidechain peg.

This is 10x cheaper than paypal fees and looks like a much faster payment processor.

I have another important question:
As you know, the maximum amount of transactions the bitcoin network can handle atm is 8 per second (will increase in the future). If this takes off, and is adopted worldwide, the amount of transactions worldwide would exceed 8 per second. Does using coinkite to coinkite payments go through the bitcoin network or does it only go through the bitcoin network when you make a withdrawal?

@_date: 2013-11-17 10:35:25
The fix is to use blockchain.info for both the sender and the reciever. Confirmation times will be still the same, however you will be able to see the transaction instantly and the risk for double spending is negligible for small transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:14:32

Yeah, i don't see how it is good news. Its not the worst news in the world though. If you are not allowed to use bitcoins for its intended purpose than whats the point of having them. I still think a lot of vendors will still accept bitcoin as payment in china as it is extremely hard to regulate.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:40:43
So am i right in saying that using the card, will allow for instant secure transactions without having to wait for confirmations?

-Complete anonymity

This will take off like crazy.
