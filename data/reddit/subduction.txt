I'd be happy to listen to observations in the context of people's beliefs, even if I don't agree with them, if they would actually bother to take a few hours and really learn how Bitcoin works, or ask questions until they do.
The most common destructive statements here don't come from political views, they come from people stridently advancing completely stupid ideas based on a limited understanding of how Bitcoin is designed and a complete lack of interest in improving their knowledge.
It's thoroughly maddening and very destructive to the movement.

It's a great idea, but the only problem is that QR codes are fairly resilient to corruption, but not very resistant to deformation.
They will have to make sure that the t-shirt is fully smooth to scan it.  They will need to pull it tight, and understand that the likelihood of an anonymous scan as they're walking by is fairly low.

Ah.  Well your last paragraph clarifies your position.  If you don't think the statements in the newsletter that Ron Paul defended are racist then you are exactly the market he was looking for when he published them.  Either racist or dumb.
If you have had as many of these discussions as you claim then it surprises me that you have not read the newsletter itself.  Okay, that was my only lie.  It doesn't surprise me at all.
If you had, you would know that the "laughingly calls a criminal justice system" quote is from a racist tirade talking about how *whites* are the persecuted party.
In years and years of "discussions" with Ron Paul fanboys I have come to expect ignorance, blinders, and outright lies, but you seem to be trying to set a new low.  Go read the newsletters themselves and prove to yourself that you're wrong and save me the trouble.

There are lots of reasons why it isn't working, I don't disagree with the fundamentals of what you're saying, but the reality is that it is not working as designed.
The safety is in invested in an untrusted system, and this is not an untrusted system.  Even people voluntarily setting up with p2pools is not a solution -- an untrusted system needs to work and protect the network even if it's being populated by people hostile to it.
That is not the case with mining, so we just end up with a bad trusted system.  We should replace it with a good trusted system.

I wouldn't use multiple codes -- I haven't tried it but that might confuse readers.

There is every story here, because all your metaphors have nothing to do with the fundamental security model of Bitcoin.
Untrusted systems cannot rely on rational actors, or rugs being pulled out, or dictators benevolent or not.  Bitcoin is intended to rely on *mathematical* security, not the intentions of the participants.
Please don't perpetuate the nonsense that this is no big deal -- the fundamental security model of the entire currency is not functioning as it should.  If you don't understand that then you don't understand the model.

That would bring their hashrate share to zero and instantly pop a Ghash.IO over 51 percent.
That would make news and no one would take Bitcoin seriously again, especially the institutions it needs to become mainstream.

@_date: 2014-01-09 17:13:54
Since you haven't been reading my posts, I specifically did not warn against a 51 percent attack. I warned about the dangers of focusing on an attack when it was more likely to be market forces in the mining community that caused a 51 percent failure, eliminating any credible participants' faith in the security of the system.  That is what's happening now.
Mining has not worked -- it has *functioned*, processing transactions, but we are currently functioning with a *trusted* system, exactly the opposite from the system as designed, and the system from which Bitcoin's security arises.
And can you please try to have a civil discussion without characterizing me as "whining?"  I am someone who cares about the future of Bitcoin and am concerned about the state of the network.  I don't understand your need to insult me in addition to adding your view. 
And how can you possibly say that people concerned about a pool exceeding 51% percent, requiring a group of *trusted* participants to actively move their mining away from that pool to avert a full failure, don't understand how Bitcoin works?
The fact that this has happened before is exactly why this needs to be fixed.  This is not the untrusted system it is supposed to be.

@_date: 2014-01-09 17:30:59
That's a good explanation of a trusted system.  A system where you have to try to guess between good guys and bad guys.
Mining is designed, however, to secure the network mathamatically against bad actors with very distributed hashing, so you don't have to guess who's good and who's bad.
In its current state Bitcoin security is not functional as designed, and that's a story that should be under scrutiny by the media and anyone else.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:30:32
I am enjoying how you repeatedly say that there is no story here, and then for some reason link to a very good discussion detailing why this needs to be a grave concern for the future of Bitcoin.

Exactly -- an untrusted system doesn't need policing.  If it needs policing it is, by definition, a trusted system.
It needs reform because we're functioning with a trusted system now, but everyone is pretending it's still the untrusted system that was designed.  It isn't at all.
p2p pools look great, but I don't see many people taking action on getting a simple implementation in place.  I have just this small hope that for all the downvotes my Chicken Little routine might attract it could at least bring attention to the need for action now.

Mathematically, sure. But this is fundamentally a consumer product.  The currency needs to have the confidence of ordinary non-ideological users, and that's not going to go over with soccer moms and people who just want to pay their mortgage.

That, like everything else you have said, is entirely wrong.  First, it even says it's from the newsletter in the article (emphasis mine):
Citing statistics from the study, Dr. Paul then concluded **in his column:** "Given the inef! ficiencies of what DC laughingly calls the criminal justice system, I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal."
Second, if you had any education on this topic whatsoever, rather than being a typical, blind, under-educated fanboy, you would recognize that quote as being from a 1992 Ron Paul Political Report "Special Report on Racial Terrorism."  Column one, paragraph three:
Look, I don't mind having to have this discussion over and over with you fanboys, but you don't even know the basics.  You're embarrassingly dumb. It's pathetic. Please at least do your own cause the courtesy of knowing about this before you engage in a discussion.

Thanks for clarifying, but it's time spent in the radiation field that matters, which makes round trip time and time spent on the surface a very significant issue.
Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector estimated that on a six month round trip to Mars and a 500 day on-planet stay astronauts would be exposed to 1.01 sieverts, slightly over EU limits, putting them at about a 5 percent higher cancer risk.
That's 0.64 millisieverts of radiation per day on the surface and 1.84 millisieverts per day on the trip there.
For comparison, the low-Earth-orbit ISS astronauts are exposed to about 0.41 milliesieverts per day.  High earth orbit astronauts are exposed to levels much closer to open space.
Radiation risk is cumulative, so the time they have to spend traversing the large distance is a very big factor in the mission.  It's one that could be coped with, but it's still a significant consideration.

Trust is being placed in the miners and groups of miners.
As ghash.io's share increases, we have to trust them to either voluntarily lower their share or, if they exceed 51 percent, not abuse their power.
Or, if people want to prevent that, then armies of trusted miners need to be organized to move away from ghash.io to "save" the network.
A proper untrusted system should be completely independent of the motivations of the participants.  No good guys, no bad guys -- just participants that are structurally limited from taking advantage no matter what their motivations.
As intended, Bitcoin mining is a proper untrusted system if any one party has a low share of the hashrate.  That is not, unfortunately the case now.

What I also haven't done but you have, however, is assert that the Bitcoin security model is just fine being "protected" by pool operators kept honest by their participants, which reveals an incredibly profound lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works.
That lack of understanding is exactly why I posted what I did in rather than or the forum.   It was the hope, clearly futile, that people like you would educate yourselves on how Bitcoin works and stop saying blatantly dumb things.

I feel like most people who use Bitcoin might at least recognize new leading or trailing characters, but it's the QR code I've been worried about.  There's really no way to glance at that and know if it doesn't match your address.  
I was logging into my bank, and they present an image you have designated as an additional authentication factor.
I was thinking we should have an option to have an image of your choosing in the middle of the code.  That would prevent simple QR substitutes from giving you a code you don't recognize.

Sorry, but that's not my argument.  My point is that all this discussion about jewelry is an interesting discussion of the dynamics of the jewelry market, but gold is a raw material for those products.
They are welcome to store value in jewelry, many people do, but that is not the same thing as storing value in gold.  They are storing value in jewelry.  
Those who store value in gold *sell it* to those who add value to it and sell it as a significantly different manufactured product at a price much higher than the sum of its parts.

No one is attempting double spends because the only current reward is a sandwich. Once larger transactions are involved attempts will be more common.
And double-spends are trivial to attempt, especially if you have a wallet designed for the purpose, and a complete lack of provable criminal intent means they can be attempted repeatedly.
The advantage of Ripple is that it will be supported by major banking and credit firms. It will have widespread adoption by major companies within a year.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:39:39
Yup -- I think all that is on their radar which is why we're talking about it, but they need to be able to estimate timeframe on adoption before they can invest in it seriously.  That's the tricky part.

I think the opportunity is greater right now for small businesses.  If working with them could pay for my palace on the Moon and my rhodium-plated Ferrari that's where I would be focusing.
You could put a just-add-water instruction set together for them fairly easily, and then do what I'm doing but on a local scale.  Make contact with local fraternal organizations, Chambers of Commerce, and networking groups to give a presentation.  Then companies pay you a reasonable fee to implement it, both tech and training.
Local business benefit most from the main benefit of adoption right now -- it's newsworthy and allies them with a subculture who are looking for ways to support people who support the movement.  
Find a guitar store that's competing with Guitar Center and get them implemented.
Then the last step on your list should be call a local newspaper or TV reporter to come to the store and report on this crazy thing they're doing.
After you've done twenty or so implementations and you have it down to a science then you come back to me and we can franchise your system nationally/globally.
It's just sitting there waiting for you...  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:00:33
Yup, they've been on my radar for a while.
My only objection to them is philosophical -- I just don't like the idea of falling back to systems that require a trusted party in a system that has it's appeal in a lack of trust.
It's compromising in the idea of bitcoin to wedge it into the mold of a traditional banking system.
But again, that's just philosophical.  Whatever gets yes over the hurdle. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:29:31
I think you're spot on.
It's not something I share in an official capacity, but with my current understanding of things (and although I'm technical I'm not a network engineer) it would be fairly trivial to implement a dishonest wallet that would automate an instant race attack to complement any transaction.
You'd be successful 50, 30, 10 percent of the time, whatever, but it's easier than trying to shoplift a widescreen TV.

Actually it's not that simple.
The people who were predicting the rosy future added to the encouragement of people who were deciding whether to put down large amounts of money on mining equipment at the time.
I, and others, who were advising caution were always met with a laustcozz-style barrage of how totally fucking nuts and clinically stupid we were to believe that difficulty was going to continue to rise.
These weren't academic pissing matches, they were making baseless, reckless predictions to people who were going to lose real money as a result.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:16:29
They definitely can, but the problem is that doing it online doesn't give them much information about the challenges of implementation at retail.
It would be a separate thing, rather than part of one continuous roll-out.  If you're a Bitcoin enthusiast that doesn't matter, you're just happy their in, but it matters to them because online and retail implementations wouldn't cross over much.

Thanks for making my point for me.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:24:24
Well my desk is a little too stacked to get into a wide-ranging political discussion, but...
I don't think there's any inconsistency with Bitcoin and liberal beliefs.  The potential impact on social justice issues alone is tremendous.  For people to have a way to collect and hide money from people who might control them, whether it's a repressive government in Burma or an abusive husband in Saudi Arabia is something that could change the world. 
I made a post on this sub about a week ago to begin considering making fully-secure and hidden wallets, encrypted, not discoverable even by authorities using forensic tools, so that people in repressive situations could begin keeping money for themselves.
I was told by multiple people that it was stupid and to shut the fuck up, but I suggested it.
And are companies or CEOs incompatible with liberalism?  They're incompatible with the cartoonish stereotype of liberalism that conservatives put forward, but not the genuine philosophy of the left wing.
Companies are just collections of people.  Their ethics are a reflection of those people.  The part I object to is the common idea that when you are part of a company you check your morals and discretion at the door and need to act "in the shareholders interest" even if it means fucking everyone over you can.  That's not the way it has to work and it's the goal of liberals in business to dispel that myth.
Because of several prominent examples, CEOs are harder to defend as a breed. But the egregious dicks aside, most of them are good people in a hard job, responsible for the employment, success, and dividend income of hundreds of thousands of employees and millions of stockholders.  The decisions they make could determine whether a large number of elderly who have company stock in their pension funds can make their rent.  Or whether their employees can afford college for their kids.
So can I defend some of the so-called "excesses?"  Yes I can.  When you have someone that critical you put them on private jet.  You don't have them waiting at an airport for commercial flights.
Can I defend some of the "excesses."  No.  You do not send that plane to pick up her Bichon Frise from a dog spa in Aspen.
Again, it's not the institution or the role that should be condemned.  Condemn or praise individuals for their actions.
Anyway, that's the short version, believe it or not.

That's to be expected.  Many merchants sign up well in advance of rolling it out for use, and when there has been a big burst of sign-ups like this the proportion of those not-quite-ready-yet signups will be higher.
Also, the primary drivers of Bitcoin sales is still the Bitcoin community, not casual visitors, and it takes a while for enthusiasts to find new vendors.

Hi all, another person experienced in mining here.
Although OPs heart is in the right place, this advice is nonsense and will lose you quite a bit of money.
There is currently *far* too much mining capacity for the number of transactions, even with the rise.  So the system is doing what it's designed to do and slowing everything down to compensate.
This ensures that very nearly *all* mining equipment, and definitely mining equipment available to home miners (under, say $15,000) will never make their money back and will lose you thousands of dollars.
The rise in Bitcoin value in no way justifies mining.  If you believe it will continue to rise you should buy them directly, not buy some machine to make them
How about mining to support Bitcoin, isn't that a good reason?
No. Bitcoin doesn't need more miners, Bitcoin needs people buying things with it.  The best way to support Bitcoin is to purchase things.  In one action you support merchants and you support miners, and you give the press something to talk about other than a speculation bubble.
Again, OP's posting in good faith, but this is bad advice.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:17:36
Ignoring for a moment that you didn't even try to answer my question, even that statement is completely false.
How do you envision Bank of America?  As a big stack of bills in a vault?  BoA is a ledger made up of credit and debit balances to hundreds of institutions, including Capital One.
If BoA "goes under" then Capital One will be required to repay their debts to BoA to satisfy BoA's creditors.  If they don't have enough liquidity then one of the decisions they can make is to "go under" themselves, and pay out all your hard-earned money to settle their debts.
That is exactly why we have the FDIC, specifically because banks *can* take your money and pay back other creditors.

If they do it at all there will definitely be a tested roll-out, but doing something in an ad hoc way just isn't an option for them.  
Any limited tests that happen would be testing the *exact* way that they would roll it out chain wide.  So they have to figure out how they would roll it out chain wide, build the test systems, test those test systems to make sure they can be integrated with their full systems, develop training programs for cashiers so they can test that training, etc.
They can't decide whether or not to sneeze without a million dollars in exploratory costs.

I'm talking about giving people the tools they need to use bitcoin if they live under repressive or totalitarian regimes.
When a totalitarian government controls and steals from the entire economy it would be an important shift for ordinary people to be able to hide funds.  Especially if they could escape over borders.  Then they would have their own money waiting for them.

A consumer market for gold jewelry is not remotely the same thing as speculation on gold.  
Any individual piece of gold jewelry contains very little gold. People buy jewelry because of the value of the piece as a whole, and the craftsmanship, not the market value of the gold they would retrieve if the melted it down.
It is not in any way primarily a money store/investment.  It is primarily an industrial commodity.

Buying shares in mining is a different question -- that's a separate economy from Bitcoins themselves and does have some available market information.  It all points to it being a looming disaster, but that's a different discussion.
Please however, explain to me exactly how ASIC miners hitting the market will cause Bitcoins to go up.  They are fundamentally unlinked except for mining new coins, which actually *lowers* the price of coins.
My concern, as with many other people here, is that you are involved (and worse, *investing* in) something you don't understand at all.

It's a good analogy.
What to consider, though, is that they can't invest in inevitability with no estimated time scale.  The minute they put a dollar into something that dollar has to generate a return for the company.

Thanks, but I'm not an outsider -- I'm actually pretty educated on this, which is why I'm asking the question.
I don't hold Bitcoins because I'm an investor, not a gambler.  There appears to be as much information available to draw conclusions about Bitcoin's future price as there is to draw conclusions on the future numbers from a roulette wheel, and I'm curious why people think they're doing this.
I'm happy to keep an open mind and willing to accept the idea that I might be missing something, however, which is why I asked.
For example, you say you keep track of hash rates for mining companies as guidance for how the market will react.  What do hash rates have to do with Bitcoin price?

@_date: 2013-11-26 03:19:59
Great post.
1.  That is the essence of it, which is why we're not seeing any large first-movers yet.  The only (only) benefit to companies spending the money to adopt it now is that it positions them as an innovator, leader, and pointed directly at a smart young market.  Exactly why you won't see Walmart in any time soon.  My guess is that the first big brand in will a high-profit margin, low-transaction-cost retailer that is pointed directly at a younger upscale market.  Panera, maybe.  I think Whole Foods or Trader Joe's or Best Buy would be on it in a second if they didn't have large transactions.  But none of those people will be in the room.
2. Large retailers won't take the risk of 0-confirmation transactions, even small ones. It's just a non-starter. Part of the reason I'm there, however, is to fix that.
3.  None of my folks would worry about that, and that makes me happy because I haven't given that one second's thought.
4.  Volatility will be a significant issue in this meeting. This has to be sorted before they will participate.  Large retailers can't have their prices fluctuate every hour on the hour.  You think Target is busy on a Saturday?  Imagine the crowds if they accept Bitcoin and the value falls by 50 percent in a day.  They'll get cleaned out.
5.  Honestly?  Hate to say it, but not our concern.  Customers have to be responsible for their own security.  If the transaction doesn't go through, or comes back as a double-spend, that's a different story.
Good questions.  Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:28:27

I don't think your reason is the case.  Banks have shown repeatedly that they're just fine with making money off of new financial innovations.  Bitcoin will be no different.
I know the conspiracy stuff is more fun, but my opinion is that it's the uncertain regulatory environment.  They don't know what the government will do or how they will enforce existing laws, so they won't get deeply involved in it until they do.
I think it's an important distinction because clarifying the regulation and getting regulatory guidance is something that the Senator can substantially assist with.

It's all good thinking.  The one aspect to add to where you're going with this is that companies their size are rarely interested in being first.  
They are more than happy to have smaller players in the market spend their money to test the waters, confident in the fact that when they move they can plow everyone under.
The usual equation is that they lose far more in costly mistakes than they lose by missed opportunities.  Even if they don't, costly mistakes are hard red numbers on their income statement while missed opportunities are always open to debate.

That's not really the case with race attacks, the biggest risk for 0-conf retailers.  Those are not difficult to implement at all.

I'm an establish consultant in the digital space.  I had these same meetings with executives about the Internet in 1993, but back then I wasn't a respected anything.  I was just the only person who knew it who could speak business rather than computers.  Prodigy hired me in 1993 because I was the only person they could find on the East Coast who knew HTML.
I found my first brochure recently.  It was a Q &amp; A format, and the first question was "What is the Internet?"  Funny.
The purpose of this meeting first and foremost is to define the issue for them.  They need to know in very plain terms what the potential opportunities are, what the potential risks are, and what forces are manipulating them. that's why coders or encryption specialists don't have these meetings.  You don't have to be the greatest expert on every minutia of Bitcoin (which I'm not) -- you need to know a lot about Bitcoin and a lot about their businesses so you can help them bring the two together. 
I'm completely with everybody here on the double-spend issue, and I can see how some of my responses could be taken as someone who doesn't understand them and is unreasonably worried.  But...
Part of their response, and it's a correct one, is that we haven't seen double-spend attacks because there hasn't been any fast 0-conf transactions worth attacking.  Trying a 0-conf double-spend attack right now will net you a Subway sandwich. 
Wait until Best Buy takes Bitcoin, then you'll see some of the greatest minds in America sorting out effective ways to execute medium-probability attacks for 0-conf transactions.

Having talked to them about it when they implemented it (I have retail clients, so I was curious) it's because they didn't trust their employees to check properly for counterfeits.

How, exactly, is price ultimately based on cryptocurrency technology?


Yes, which is exactly the same amount of information as "the roulette ball just landed on red 13."  But no one pretends they're investing in roulette.


How does an advantage over other currencies give you information on price?


Even if I accept that premise, on what information are you basing any assumption that adoption will increase among business in the future?


Yes, but those pontificater's statements are based on *absolutely no information.*  At least the pontificating nitwits in stocks or currency speculation can point to fundamentals that provide the basis for their nitwittery.   


My apologies, I sincerely promise that my intent was not to be sarcastic, but any calculations based solely on premises are only as good as the premises.  I am honestly, in good faith, trying to understand why people are investing in Bitcoins when every rational measure indicates that it is no more than casino gambling.
And at least casino gambling has defined odds.  Bitcoin appears to be a complete black box -- you put your money in one end and pray more comes out the other.  That's not investing, that's pay and pray.

You can raise the probability of a race attack without dumping directly to a node by manipulating transaction fees.  It's not ideal, but when there's no cost to the attempt then any probability is fine.  
The only loss for a failure is that the consumer pays for the item they intended to buy anyway. Other attempts they get away for free.  Even if ten percent of attacks succeed that's a respectable take.

Litecoin's a step forward, but it's not a complete solution.
Yes, they reduced the block time so you get a 1-conf faster, but Litecoin confs have a lower confidence level than Bitcoin confs.
So with Litecoin it gives you a less reliable result faster, which doesn't feel like a big step forward.
What I do like about Litecoin better is the mining model.  I think it will stay more distributed for longer and avoid this ASIC train-wreck we find ourselves in.

I've discussed it in some places before, but no worries.
It's not a popular suggestion, but the only solution I can sort out is a central, trusted authority to manage mining share levels with checks and balances so that the operation of that authority is transparent.
To be what it is, Bitcoin itself, on the currency side, needs to be decentralized with no monetary authority.  I don't think that's true for the mining side.  It's not ideal, but a less-than-ideal but well-implemented trusted system is far better than a failed untrusted system.

No question that the transaction will be recorded as a 0-conf transaction in just a few seconds.  But miners adding it to blocks is how we get our confirmations.
So if my retail transaction is sent without a transaction fee and my double-spend transaction is sent with a transaction fee then you raise your probability that your double-spend will win the race.  If your retailer has let you leave the store on your 0-conf transaction then you just won.

That's the stereotype, but I can tell you from ten years of working with C-level executives at global companies that the greatest *pressure* is on them for short term results, but these people (well, most of them) do have long term vision and are very thoughtful about every challenge in a wide variety of horizons.

No it isn't.  It's 12 percent of the global yearly gold consumption.  If you add in jewelry manufacture it is 64 percent of global consumption.  Only 32 percent is official reserve and speculative holdings.
If speculator confidence ended in gold (and there are some experts wh o feel it has already) the price would drop, but to by no means catastrophic levels.  It would actually be a good thing for manufacturers.

Why in the world would you do that? It just doesn't make any sense.
You are going to convert every available dollar you can possibly afford to put at risk into Bitcoins as soon as possible to get them as cheaply as possible.
Then, when something comes up you have to buy, you aren't going spend any of those Bitcoins, you're going to pay in dollars to keep your Bitcoins where they are.
You are also not going to immediately convert dollars to Bitcoins in order to immediately spend those Bitcoins because you would be taking on transaction fees and a pointless series of steps for no reason whatsoever.

More than enough time to be out of the store on a busy day, but I'm not trying to oversell the risk or that there aren't potential solutions, only that "this isn't something that we need to worry about" won't be the long term answer.

Yup, saw that and it's a good thing, but none of these folks would integrate with something like Bitpay.  They would do their own.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:46:38
Yes, I'm not worried about a split. Just a 0-conf race attack at the time of the purchase.
We would have to specifically test for suspicious ways the payer could be trying to slow the good payment down.  Sending the first payment without a transaction fee, for example. The double-spend transaction gets sent with a transaction fee and it has a decent chance of winning the race.  We'd need to test for suspicious circumstances.
But the upshot is that we'll never *eliminate* the 0-conf race attack risk, only diminish it to acceptable levels.  That's a basic limitation of the Bitcoin solution.
What acceptable is will be the great debate.

That's not accurate.
Gold has value not just as an investment or trade vehicle but as an industrial and manufacturing component.  Much of the value of gold is speculation, but if confidence in gold went to zero price would still not go to zero.
If confidence in bitcoin goes to zero then its price goes to zero.

They've already shut down one virtual currency.  Totalitarian regimes, even ones flirting with free market reforms, don't react well to something they can't control.  That's the whole point of having a totalitarian regime.
If this gets big enough they will search for ways to get it under their thumb.
If I were the Chinese government (which I'm not) I might put very tough penalties on usage of bitcoin at the same time I announce a new Chinese-led virtual currency for citizens.  Exchangeable for hard currency through a state-run exchange, but a different block chain.

You buy Bitcoins on Monday.  You decide you need something from a vendor on Wednesday.  There's no way you are going to spend bitcoin on that thing.  You will spend dollars on that thing to keep your Bitcoins where they are and appreciating.
You buy $200 of bitcoin, that's great.  But when the day comes to spend it you're not going to touch them.  You are going to pay in dollars because you will not get rid of an asset that is appreciating so fast.

Let's make this more simple.
1. You have put as many dollars as you feel comfortable with into bitcoin. Not, of course, exposing your rent money to this crazy market, but you have faith this rise will continue so you're fully invested.
2.  You now have Bitcoin holdings and dollar holdings.
1.  Unfortunately, your car's water pump just failed and you need to pay your mechanic $300 to fix it.  But your mechanic is cool and he takes bitcoin.
So at a time when your Bitcoin holdings will be worth $1,000 today, $1050 tomorrow, $1,100 the next day, and your dollars will be worth $300 today, $300 tomorrow, and $300 the next day.  Are you going to pay your mechanic out of your bitcoin reserves or your cash reserves?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:38:05
I think it's amusing that you think central authorities don't have a hell of a lot of skill and experience in staying central.
When a totalitarian state is trying to make a point about people adopting a behavior that threatens them they don't give people tickets and fines.  They grab the first fifty people they can find who "just swap bitcoin" and they shoot them and make sure everyone knows why.
After they do that a few times what do you think people will do when they "don't have Yuan on them?"  They'll go get Yuan.

That is the attraction here, but then also consider the costs involved in training, for example, every cashier at 1,900 Target locations in how to accept Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-29 09:57:55
That's not true at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what I said.
What I said is that the incredible appreciation happening now is locking people into a hold position.  Essentially *forcing* bitcoin into a singular role as an investment vehicle because no rational person will spend something that is appreciating at ten percent per day.  They will leave it where it is and stores accepting bitcoin won't get any transactions.
So saying that I see bitcoin only as an investment vehicle shows that you didn't understand a word I said.  I was expressing my concern that market forces were pushing it in that direction, and that was a bad thing for the currency.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:16:14
Transaction fees will affect how fast transactions make it into a block.  Different miners will have different transaction lists, and one way to manipulate your probabilities is that you pay your retailer with a zero fee transaction but put a fee on your double-spend transaction.
The miners that have your retail transaction will be more likely to leave it out of blocks for longer which increases the likelihood that the miners with your doublespend transaction will win the race.

Of the 2,300 metric tons of gold gold mined every year only 34 percent is official reserve and speculative investment holdings.

The *transaction* is added to the memory pool very quickly, but it can take up to ten minutes to get its first confirmation and over an hour to get enough confirmations to trust.  That is not the case with Ripple's consensus system.

2.  No question about that, but implementing it for them isn't a trivial process.  Often times companies of this size don't need, or want, to be first.  Part of that discussion will be about their involvement in driving adoption.  If they stay out waiting for the perfect ROI picture then it may never come.  If they get in their involvement changes the ROI picture for everyone.  Decisions like that are why CEOs get the big bucks.
3. This will be the central subject at hand. They need a road that protects them from significant financial risk while still positioning them well for when the time is right.

Yes, that's definitely the goal, but don't underestimate the very impressive level of idiots we have these days.  They can screw anything up.

Every sensible merchant will have wait for conformations or, more likely, not adopt Bitcoin.  Major retailers can average 300 $60 transactions per hour *per store.* They will not allow 0-confirmation transactions, especially when a batch of automated double-spend wallets get released by hackers.
Ripple isn't crap, if you think it is then you aren't clear on the technology in the slightest.  You are going to see announcement on Ripple adoption that Bitcoin could only dream about in the next six months, neither consumers nor retailers care one bit if it's centralized if it saves them money, and no one cares that the business kept Ripples anymore than anyone cares that Facebook kept stock.
I'm a supporter of Bitcoin, but trying to support Bitcoin by pretending Ripple won't be a powerhouse isn't going to help anybody.

That's fine -- that I can at least understand because there are discernible market characteristics that you can use for some analysis.  They're super thin by any measure, but at least they're there.
And no -- proper, thoughtful investing is nothing like gambling.  People disagree on conclusions they draw on available data, but that data is, by and large, available and accurate.  Earnings information, P/E ratio, book value, management experience, category and competition data -- they are concrete measures that you use to draw reasoned conclusions.  Even currency speculation offers comparative data on national economies.
Bitcoins are a black box. You put money in with no idea of what is contributing to long-term failure or growth. You say to read the forums, but you don't even know whether individual demand is driving the price.
So no, proper investing is not gambling, it is a risk, and an educated risk at that.  Bitcoin appears to be the same as casino gambling because everybody thinks they have a system, when in fact they have no information whatsoever.
And just to highlight my point:

Maybe they're just kidding.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:21:09
Sure, but that is speculation on jewelry, a finished good for which gold is a raw material.
Which is exactly my point.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:42:44
And when people start receiving import goods with no apparent payment vehicle how will that go over?
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:01:10
This is the exact same process that is happening when you do business with a Bitcoin Exchange, or a credit card company, or retailers sign up with a merchant processor or banks do business with each other.
The difference is that it will Just Work for people who want it to, but actually gives *more* control to people who want to manage their relationships.
What you're trying to position as a weakness is actually a strength of a Ripple.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:04:42
I have every expectation that block size will be changed.  If it isn't then we might as well declare this a hobby and move on.
And my understanding is that if you're focused on 0-conf transactions, transactions without a fee leave you much more exposed to a race attack.
All good points, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:34:07
Yes, and if you're managing an investment account that is appreciating at 10 percent per day or more you wouldn't pull any money out if it to go buy something if you had other options.

This is really unbelievable.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:42:10
But that's just speculating on the currency.
What bitcoin needs is for vendors who accept it to have a thriving business as people pay them in bitcoin.  With bitcoin appreciating so sharply no one in their right mind would spend Bitcoins when they could just as easily spend dollars that aren't appreciating at all.
We're counting down to the day when the headlines are "XYZ Company Reaches One Year of Accepting Bitcoins.  'Only Two Transactions' Says CEO."

Just the opposite really.  You get to this position by not being afraid to ask for advice from any available resource.

I'm not talking about propagating to nodes, that happens right away.  But it propagates as a 0-conf transaction.
Then miners have to include it in blocks to get its first confirmation.  *That's* where transaction fees matter.  A transaction fee is much more likely to be put in a block before one without.  It will knock the retail transaction out.  You get your double-spend money back and the retailer is out of luck.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:24:40
But it isn't at all.
These relationships exist in our current banking system and are far less controlled.  I understand that you may be coming at these ideas for the first time, but what do you think happens in our current financial system when a major player fails?
It is seriously much, much worse than could ever happen in a Ripple system.  It's so bad that the US government had to step in and just flat out promise to insure people's money if their banking institution fails.  Ripple allows far, far more controls over relationships that are already based on ad hoc, uncontrolled "trust" among institutions.
Hearing you complain about this is like watching someone who is hanging by a thread say, "wait, you want me to hang by a rope?"  It's more than a little absurd.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:15:25
Then everyone should be prepared for a major upward correction.  Or a sideways correction.  Or a correction that fakes left, and when we all go left that correction says *"Hollywood!  Too slow!"* and goes right.
Corrections are dicks.

I've had at least a hundred discussions on so-called libertarian "principles" on reddit and elsewhere, and they only end in one of three ways:
1.  The I'm not *that* kind of libertarian:  "I'm a libertarian from the Belgian-Hawley-Smoot-Beyoncé School, so I actually agree with you, but I'm just telling you what *they* believe..."
2.  The absurd lie: "Yes, I would definitely let my child die of dysentery if it meant protecting American's property rights.

It is not the same thing at all.
Jewelry is the product of a craftsman.  It is not a commodity.  It is the craftsman that adds the value.
Go to your Mom and suggest that she melt down her jewelry for its component parts, see what kind of response you get.  Compare the price of a Tiffany bracelet to the same weight as a handful of diamonds and gold.
Jewelry is an added value manufactured good for which gold is a raw material as surely as gold-tipped monster cables are.

Again, you didn't even understand the experiment or the thread discussing it, in which it's flaws were discussed in detail.


Yet again, (and again, and again), the same exact thing is true in the financial system you currently participate in, and you are actually at far greater risk than you would be with Ripple.  Ripple protects you *more*.


For that, I'm thankful.  Every time you have opened your mouth you have embarrassed yourself.  I completely agree that it's well past time you quit trying.

It's related to the potential reward.  Right now trying to get away with hitting a store that accepts fast 0-conf transactions will net you a sandwich.
If you were to see someone like Best Buy, Home Depot, or Ikea start accepting 0-confs then you will see new methods, and especially tools, to implement effective race attacks right at the checkout counter crop up overnight.

Has in the past, but you can't invest in hindsight.
When you speculate on a company you are looking at its fundamentals in addition to a number of other factors.  When you are speculating on a currency you are looking at national economies and finding instances where their strength or weakness is not in alignment with the price.
Bitcoin is currently giving you *no* information about its price related to anything.  Speculate if you choose, it's your money, but don't chalk it up to anything but guessing and praying.

No you don't put money you know you have to spend into bitcoin because that's not risk capital.
You are going to put every penny you can possibly risk into bitcoin, but if you are putting money that is not risk capital, money you know you will have to spend, into bitcoin then you're not a rational actor.
If you have your rent money five days in advance you are not going to put that rent money into bitcoin.  You are putting your risk capital into bitcoin, and once it's in you're not going to spend that.

Those are all the right questions but I don't pretend to have a proposal I have confidence in.
I've gotten about as far as being really sure that what we have now is driving itself off a cliff, but I haven't really had the chance to think in detail about how a replacement would work.  And honestly, I'm not sure I have the experience level on the technical side to know that any solutions I propose would be right.
What I can be sure of is no matter what anyone proposes down that road, nooooobody's going to like it.  So unless I have a brainstorm in the shower that I'm willing to defend to the last man I'm just going to stay in my foxhole on this one...  :-)

If they were investing in the currency that might push them more, but they're in the transactions business.   They can afford to wait until someone else has gone out on a limb, tested/built demand, and then they move in.

If that were the case they would never have run the transactions through their own merchant account.  They might as well turn themselves in.
Additionally, they would go to all that trouble for something they could only do once.  One or two more complaints on that account and they will be shut down by the card company and likely face charges.

Yes.  You should be taking Ripple very seriously.
Not as a competitor to Bitcoin necessarily, but it will siphon off any companies and industries that want to take advantage of improved fee structures and low inertia but want more stability and faster large transactions than Bitcoin can provide.

How would you describe buying a gift card??
How would you describe sending funds via Western Union?
You do the same exact thing every single day and it's terrifically more expensive and what's happening behind the scenes is incredibly more Byzantine.  When you buy an Amex gift card you have extended a trust relationship to them *with no protection whatsoever.*  Ripple does that very same thing only it gives you much more control.
If someone explained how writing a check for something actually worked in that level of detail you'd be looking at fifteen pages.  Ripple can do that with only that system.  It's a tremendous advance and simplification over the existing system, you've just never been exposed to the ridiculous mess that is the current system so it sounds complex to you.
That's why Amex and the banks are jumping on it, it's enormously streamlined for everyone.

@_date: 2013-11-26 05:28:43
Yup, but that's tricky for retail.
The fundamental question is which price is allowed to flop around?  Is a television $1,600 or whatever that is in Bitcoin, or is it 2 Bitcoin or whatever that is in dollars?
All their accounting is in dollars, they are paying for their inventory in dollars, so the pegged one would need to be dollars.  So that means their entire PoS systems would need to be set up to check the current price of Bitcoin on every transaction.  Essentially be fully enabled for two parallel currencies.  That is not trivial.
Are there ways around it?  Could they make money by offering a fixed conversion rate in their favor?  Sure, but it's messy thing for them to implement.
It's not impossible to solve, but these challenges are why companies aren't just leaping in.

We need to solve some fundamental issues first.  Lead among them is the fast-transaction 0-conf problem.

I'm positive on the future of Bitcoin as I always have been.  I definitely don't want anything I've posted in this or the other thread to imply otherwise.
I think bitcoin *mining* however, is fundamentally broken and needs to be redesigned.  It is designed to be an untrusted system, but with two organizations controlling 57 percent of the hashing it is operating as a de facto trusted system.
That needs fixing or the future of bitcoin really doesn't look very good at all.
