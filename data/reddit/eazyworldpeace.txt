I saw this a couple of months ago when I was there, i was curious but didn’t go check it out. I figured it was some novelty shop that just used bitcoin in its name but had nothing to do with bitcoin.
What is it? I can see that you can buy bitcoin there but is there something else to it?

My belief is that we will see a “Bitcoin 2.0” appear in the coming years that will be stable, easier to adopt, and compliant with existing financial systems. What that’ll look like I don’t know, but I don’t see bitcoin as it is right now, including other cryptocurrencies, ever becoming widely adopted anywhere - no matter how many Twitter zingers get posted online.

No, it hasn’t changed the world. Most people don’t know the first thing about it, and a lot of the people who do know about it think it’s either a joke or a quick cash grab.
The emergence of blockchain technology is what’s changing the world and it’s applications aside from currency have huge potential.
And about Bitcoin having already “won” - don’t fool yourself. The only way we can demonstrate that a “non-governmental money can work in a decentralized unstoppable way” is when it becomes a stable currency that can actually be used be those outside of the cryptocurrency enthusiast circle. None of this has been proven yet.

I remember seeing a Bitcoin ATM when I was in Vienna, thought it was really cool. This was before I bought any crypto so I didn't have the chance to try it out

I definitely understand the uses beyond regular day-to-day transactions but it’s funny to me when I see redditors talking about moving $10k+ across borders like this is a real problem they’re dealing with
