If you lower the difficulty, the miners with the hashpower will still mine them first, but they would be getting more bitcoin in less time, which means we would get to the max in much less time. So only if the price of bitcoin drops to a price to where the big miners can no longer make a profit, will there ever be a chance for the small guy.

So, they just prevent you from selling your bitcoin for USD and they are off the hook? Is that how this works?

Same here. Bought 2 @ $20. it rocketed to $1200, I sold it. My withdrawal from Mt Gox never came through.

I bought 2 when they were $20. Then sold at around $1200. Never got my money out of Mt Gox. I don't mind losing $40, but I sure as heck am not going to gamble thousands as I suspect it's a matter of time before everyone gets Goxed again.

Isn't the only thing that gives Bitcoin "value", is more people "investing" in it? An ETF will certainly be good for Bitcoin, at least short term ...

There, i fixed it for you ...

I see what you did there ...

I bought 2 BTC sometime early in 2013 (I believe, can't remember exactly when I bought them) for $40 each. I sold them in Dec for a little above $1000 each. But when I tried to withdraw from Mt. Gox, the transfer never happened (obviously). I did get a notice in the mail about the class action suit against Mt. Gox, but I just wrote it off as an $80 loss and never bothered responding. I am interested in the technology, but I learned my lesson early about playing with real money in an experiment. I see on the front page, to this day, 3 years later, people are still having issues with these exchanges.

Which means it actually is a self fulfilling prophesy to some extent. Of course other events will set things in motiion, but as soon as everyone sees a "trend" on the charts, they react accordingly.
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:40:23
I just used a debit card today. The transaction went through in 3 seconds. Yeah, I know, old skool ...

The problem is that minimum wage jobs have spread to all kinds of industries where adults work.

So if I buy Tether for $1 USD, I can sell it for $1 USD? I am only a casual browser on this Bitcoin sub, don't know anything about how Tether works.
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:30:58
The problem is, companies who are exploring block chain technology are developing their own blockchain. So not sure what that has to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:27:46
But once the Tether is initially bought, what is the real point of even having a reserve if you can't cash them in for USD from the issuer? So the issuer just holds on to that USD money forever? I know it's to give legitimacy to the claim that 1 USDT = 1 USD, but in the end, what happens to all that money just sitting there?

If the marginal rate is 70% for income over $10 Mil, how much more in taxes would you pay if you make $10,000,001? The answer is 70 cents. I will never understand how poor people think that this is so unfair to wealthy people. If you make $10+ Mil year, this increase is not going to affect your life one bit.

"But then the fees turned out to be reduced by more and the market collapsed."
Are you sure it wasn't the other way around?
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:22:25
So you think, for instance, the US would lag behind if they made Bitcoin illegal? Talk about a cute fairytale ... ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:45:40
I won't disagree, but the point is Bitcoin will never replace fiat, because once banks/governments feel threatened by Bitcoin they will either make it illegal to use Bitcoin, or create their own blockchain which will be easier to adopt for the masses, as it will just be somewhat seamlessly integrated into the current digital money system.

Blockchain has a future. Bitcoin, not so much ...
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:53:08
When crypto currency takes over, it will be in the form of a bank/government created crypto. Bitcoin will just be the model used.

He doesn't have the courage to do what? If he is the real SN, then the genie is already out of the bottle, and he can't just chicken out and go back to anonymity, as if everyone would forget. Posting this message makes absolutely no sense. Or perfect sense if you are a fraud ...

Yeah, if someone other than Satoshi got ahold of the keys, I don't think their first though would be "Hey, now I can make everyone think I am Satoshi". Their first thought would be "How can I cash out all of these Bitcoin".
