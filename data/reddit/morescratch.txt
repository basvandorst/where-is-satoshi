That’s the voice of reason folks.

Who cares. We don’t need ETFs.

I don’t think any of us were ignorant or unenlightened, we just happened to stumble upon an idea that has yet to be understood by everyday people. Just because we have seen the future, doesn’t make us better than those that haven’t. Most people don’t have the interest or inclination to study the value proposition of cryptocurrency. Success depends largely on our community to shepherd the masses towards a future where value is controlled by the individual and not the corporate elite. Judging others is just judging yourself. Be kind.

What the hell is going on? We are headed in the opposite direction of where we want crypto to go. We need to rally together and build the infrastructure that will increase adoption. If we don’t, morons like MC and all those crooks who run the central banks will do it for us - to their benefit. All this ETF BS and SEC approval BS is insane. We don’t need them. If everyone adopted Crypto overnight then the system would be forced to change. We need to put all those  corrupt  DB’s that run our financial system out of a job.

Sell what is needed to cover costs and hodl the rest.

Highly dependent on electricity cost. It’s costing me barely 4K to mine 1 BTC right now. Stop spreading FUD.

Scrap metal? I don’t think so. My sense is that the difficulty will swing in my favour soon because it really is a losing game for a lot of small operators. In which case it can go to about half of where it is now and I will still be close to break even. Mining was profitable when the price was at a dollar BTW. The only thing I am worried about is the next generation machines, but with price being what it is they will come out at a favourable price - which means I will actually expand operations.

It’s not a scam. It’s proven its utility over ten years. No one ever said it was a get rich quick solution, that’s just how the greedy played it. It will live on and soon you will come to realize that you’ve missed the point and the opportunity. I remember people saying that the internet was a fad and that cell phones would never catch on. True. Sad.

Not as awkward as if you told them to buy GE like I did. I wish I told them to buy crypto at least it will be around next year.

Isn’t that what lightening provides?

“The death-knell of the republic had rung as soon as the active power became lodged in the hands of those who sought, not to do justice to all citizens, rich and poor alike, but to stand for one special class and for its interests as opposed to the interests of others.” - Theodore Roosevelt

It will more than triple. Try 10x price multiples if it becomes the new gold.

Death knell for PayPal.
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:54:40
BTC is rarer than gold so it’s conceivable that it go much higher no? Human nature being what it is.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:17:15
I get your point although I don’t think arrogant is the best word to describe such an approach. I agree that censorship is not a solution however.

Distopian viewpoint but not inaccurate.

It’s not confusing at all. I’m just looking for solutions and if there isn’t a solution then there isn’t a problem. BTW why don’t these criminals use a privacy coin? Are they that stupid?

You need to take the long view. You will recover all your losses and them some if you wait. My guess is that mid January we will see market stabilization and shortly there after a mild pump because of FOMO due to Bakkt etc. Remember that historically speaking the block reward halving in 2020 will initiate a bull run. You haven't lost anything until you sell.
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:59:05
True. So long as you are paying no more than $0.05USD you’re still profitable. Difficulty is going down every two weeks as well. Mining was profitable when BTC was $100. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:51:42
Not he hasn’t. He still has 10BTC.

Good point.

But exchanges are decentralized now. At least the ones you should be using.

I went to the bank to ask for $17k in cash for a contractor that only took cash payment and they refused saying that they only allow $4k max cash withdrawal per day. This was a commercial account. Insane. They are done. The rise of private money is here and the growth rate in the developed world has a parabolic curve. That’s 70% of the worlds population that has only known crypto. Let that sink in. 70% of the worlds population will do commerce with crypto - NOT worthless fiat. The death knell has tolled for the banks. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:01:30
My point is that mining is still profitable. Not everywhere mind you but that’s been the case for about a year now. Difficulty is dropping.
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:55:37
Same with fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:01:38
Bye bye crooks. You’ve robbed millions of hard working people. Shame on you. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:47:23
It’s worth it to be in Denmark IMO.
