Sorry for my ignorance but how does a stop limit buy/sell work? I get limit buy and sell but how do I use a stop with it?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:39:21
It’s not same for eth

i see... so essentially from stop to limit is you accepting any price to buy/sell the qty you want. I get that... what i don't get is why if i set a stop limit with a stop above my limit px then i don't get hit with fees if it fills. 
ex. now i want to buy at 155 stop with limit at 152 and px is at 150. the px goes up to 156 and i see my order as limit order, then it drops down to 150 and i buy at 152 with no fee.

I totally screwed myself thought bch was going to 6k or more, sold everything and went to trade it. Market opened and the limit buy price was not even used. Feel like an idiot and lost 600$

I got burned thinking there was a turnaround at 350 :(

Ok so I just tested this with Eth px at 151. I set buy stop at 152 and limit 155. It executed a market buy at 152.5 what’s the point of setting a stop and limit if just sell/buy market.

That’s exactly how I set it up yet I’m getting hit with fees... on their support site they state this will be a limit order so shouldn’t have fees 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:41:37
Why do they execute at the stop price though? Shouldn’t it execute at limit?

Very helpful /s

Well I put in at .00194 xrp eth yay... so annoyed 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:06:29
Well the other way my orders never fill. I pot in 15210 limit with 15200 stop and when it drops it never hits 15210
