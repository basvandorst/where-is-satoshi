I don't think that a goal of Bitcoin becoming a world currency is attainable. The elite  that "own" the world will not let it happen, at least not in the current form. It just not manipulative enough... I would be happy if all of us can keep Bitcoin as an alternative to the fiat be it in the current form or whatever form they will morph it to. 
But it seems to me the bigger problem is the fact that even people that do "believe" that Bitcoin is a worthwhile project in it's fundamental properties, still looking for a day when they can "cash out" back into fiat. I know that attitude might change at some point but when? If it will be used primarily as as an speculative asset we are going nowhere.

What make you think they will be spending BTCs once it's at $1000. They will just wait for $2000...  I suppose it will workout one way or the other. It would be nice if more people would actually use the bitcoins for more then just mere speculation not just ones at the SilkRoad.

The same here. Stability in price will encourage more use for the tangible things and less on speculation. I think "cashing out" should be more of  converting BTC into goods and services rather back in fiat.

It's o k. I wouldn't want to have BTC at $1000 in the month. By the end of the year is fine though :-)

They are not stupid, just the ones that think that ICE carriage will never replace the horse and carriage. They want to feel things in their hand and test it with their teeth.

Good point but there got to be a reason for you to hand the fiat, right?
What it is it then? If it is to just to withdraw a short time later with a hope the other handing their fiat after you will bid up the price, well then it nothing more then a pyramid scheme.

See my response to scrambledgreggs. I don't need scientific background to have common sense. Actually never mind, forget about common sense, I am just an unenlightened unbeliever in the benevolence of scientists who of course never motivated by mere human lusts of money, recognition and fame or just simple self-preserving desire to keep a job.

If I understood you correctly your argument is that fiat is taken for granted because of stability it provides. Is that your argument? Because I just can't see, no matter how hard I try, what stability you are talking about. 
Just don't interpret any of the examples your have sited the same way, as a matter of fact my interpretations are completely opposite.

If Rolling Stones will at some point have an article on Bitcoin I'll will bet my Bct it will be a long the lines how bad of an idea it will be. They will talk about Silk Road, gambling, child pornography etc., and most of the readers will completely forget about this article which by the way did not blame USD for the problem...
There is automatic self-censorship in the media when it comes to a certain worldview when it comes to anything than might threaten the existing power structure, be it gun control, transparent monetary system etc. and everyone knows, by straying of the reservation keeping the job or advancing in ranks becomes problematic.

There is a lot of things I don't understand. Lets see, no clue what a complicated financial instruments in the form of derivatives are or how the climate works (unlike the scientists who in the 70s where scaring us of global freeze and now, well you know) or the AIDS HIV issue and many other things that I don't understand. But I am not alone, seems like the whole history of science is nothing but a series of whoopses on most anything. Just look at any courtroom in America today. You will have completely opposite things urged by two opposing sides, both using science to "prove" their point. But I know my arguments will be lost since I am talking to a true believer. How do I know? Well I am a man of faith myself. Good luck.

Humans have not done it for thousands of years. There is a difference between crossing the genes of the same specie of  plants and introducing the genes from animal world. But whatever, if worshiping at the altar of science is your thing, knock yourself out. Once you and your progeny suffers the consequences I am sure the priests from the other temples (Merck, Pfizer...) will have a scientific solution for you for a certain fee.      
@_date: 2013-03-08 05:10:11
Enlighten me, because some how I think to mess with produce genes is not exactly a good idea.

I didn't argue that it's doesn't matter at this point. My argument is it should not measure the success of the project exclusively. In other words the objective for me is not to reach an $XXX..=1BCT

You keep repeating the word hoard as oppose to save. I think the word "hoard" doesn't apply to Bitcoin and here is why:
-a supply or fund stored up and often hidden away (Webster definition)
-usually applicable to something most people can't go without (food staples, fuel etc) with hope to jack up prices later.
 Bitcoin as a commodity is not essential to anyone for existence. Besides anyone hoping for Bitcoin to become the only medium of exchange in the world is dreaming, nor should it be a goal. Just as with anything else the best course to take, is to let market regulate the rate of exchange between different medium of exchange be it gold, silver, Bitcoin, dollar etc.
 
As far as your main concern with Bitcoin Project - "people hoarding the currency" instead letting it to circulate and be invested for betterment of life...
 Well firstly, investment is already happening:  , even in this early stage of the whole project and secondly as it has been pointed out by someone here earlier, investing to expand the economy is not necessarily good just for the sake of it. Here in the West we already consume at the level that made it almost almost religious experience (lines in front of Apple stores etc) brought to you by inflating currency.
 Mind you what is being spent is not something that most of the buyers have "hoarded" previously but just getting themselves even deeper into servitude of debt, courtesy of infinitely inflating currency.
Just my 0.00000002 BTC

Don't mean to be rude but just that line above is enough for me to stop responding to your nonsense at this point. If you think that inflation is suppose to stimulate anyone's interest in saving, I don't have much to say except you need to do a lot of reading and thinking. And also there is no reason to save if things will cost x10 a decade later.
P.S. Not trying to be condescending, but you come across as some one who is very sure in opinions that you hold, yet they're lacking in common sense not to speak of anything deeper.

This is exactly the dentist I would want to see. Sounds like the dentist you are going to, doing to you what Monsanto is doing to your food.
