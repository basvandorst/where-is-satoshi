Either way that looks super cool!

I like it, super helpful... but no Beto?

Nice, it's is sold there... but to they accept BTC as payment?

Isn't he a heroin addict these days hiding from the US and living on a boat? Is anything he says these days even important anymore?

Wow, it's your money to do whatever you want with it. That is the whole point. Big brother much?

What a crock. McAfee doesn't know who Satoshi is. He is just trying to stay relevant!

It's a scam, they removed it. That was a good thing for everyone in the long run...

This is really interesting, but looks super complicated. I looked into it and I still really don't understand how to go about playing!

This is really cool. I keep hearing that people want to try to expand that. But seriously supply and demand would be better for us all in the end if it stays this way.

Wow this is really cool! Way to go dad for introducing this boy to the entrepreneurial world! And about bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:05:34
Lol, I like it. It is simple but straight to the point. Looks like that was the intention.

It's weird, you are not "really" paying in crypto. The card basically converts your coins to fiat when the transaction is made to pay in fiat...

This is an irrelevant question... he is not Satoshi
