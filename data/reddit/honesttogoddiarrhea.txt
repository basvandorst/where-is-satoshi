Once funds are withdrawable wil BTC crash or skyrocket? Methinks crash since people may desperately need any fiat.

If it's from  coinbase how Is it possible they got ahold of the email? I've only used the email for those two sites.  Is this all public information somehow?

Holding while the price tanks = making money lmao ok kid

It's not. I have an addictive personality. I tell myself I'm just going
To hold and then like an idiot I get bored and decide to play Mr. Wall Street. It always backfires.
When it dropped to 4,600 the other day I sold off at 4,800 and thought I made a good move. Then I started trying to make trades and ended up losing, had I just held I would have made a good amount of money by now. The same logic applies to my mindset though. I feel like the one time I do hold, that's when it's going to crash to $0. It's the most sickening mind game.
