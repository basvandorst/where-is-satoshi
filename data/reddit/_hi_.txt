Good lord how does this cringy shit get into my feed.

Not refuting the links you posted, because I'm not going to read them. I know people who trade for a living using TA, and have done so for years. I refuse to write them off as statistical anomalies.

I wonder why hedge funds employ technical analyst. TA is such a broad subject, I think it's a bit silly to completely write it off as entirely useless.

This is an impossible argument because you can't really define TA in any meaningful way. How do you research something that is so broad and undefined? 
Did they historically test every indicator? Did they historically test order flow analysis? Every bar pattern, chart pattern, and moon cycle?
If people don't like TA, that's fine and they are probably largely correct to write it off in favor of a more fundamental analysis. I just get annoyed at how people want to paint this subject as black and white.

I appreciate the response, and don't disagree with any of it. Something of note is that bitcoin is a very inefficient and irrational market, which while skimming one of the research papers refuting the uses of TA linked somewhere else in this thread, it did say those are the exact markets where TA might find more success.

Hey, honest question because I don't really pay attention to this sub. Is everyone here cool with baseless FOMO like this (just because the format is different), or is it just the FUD that y'all don't like?  
People bash bitcoin because it has a lot of flaws, not because they are "jealous" lmao. Posts like this just lead to an unhealthy circle jerk. Oh look, my bitcoin investment is solid because some guy wrote a long post that is entirely based on his "feelings". We good dog, look at his personal projections!  
Like there is nothing inherently wrong with this post, I just worry about the mental health of the common bitcoin holder if this is showing up so highly in my feed.   
And yes, I'm currently invested in bitcoin with a non trivial amount of capital.
