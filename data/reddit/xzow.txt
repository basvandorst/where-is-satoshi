A free scam that requires you to do research, watch out
better HODL while btc tanks to 8k instead of profiting from the alt market

I got 2.5btc from mining dogecoin back in the day

Is it certain that it's lost?

I tried to open my old wallet which is 0.11 and it shows my bitcoins immediately
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:15:48
Is this going to give me access to that money or just going to show how much I have?

You're telling me to get a new kind of wallet. I would rather just keep using bitcoin core as I have been. How is it supposed to be updated? 
I pointed it to the old directory and put the wallet.dat there and it updated without the money, I then tried to use a backup directory and it did show the money. I'm confused but I'm updating that one now. 
I also tried to copy paste the newer blockchain to shorten the syncing but it gave me some error, so I guess I'll just have to wait.
And yeah, it has money.

Alright thanks bro, I was just confused why transferring the wallet.dat did not help.
