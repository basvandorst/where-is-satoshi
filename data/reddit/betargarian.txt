Not quite, but it varies per institution. Many schools will include tuition bumps to pay for desirable university improvements like a $30 million recreational/fitness center to boost enrollment numbers and improve retention. Many schools will issue a student fee on top of tuition to pay for new facilities like these so they can claim they didn't raise tuition. It's your typical political bullshit stuff, you know.

Edit: obviously budget cuts are bad and cause tuition to rise but let's not put all the blame on that (that's essentially what I was trying to say)

If I ever heard someone make that claim I would knee jerk too but fortunately I've never actually heard anyone say that.

No you were exactly right to correct him. He took a fair statement ($30k avg) and ballooned it to something completely false ($60k avg) to make a point that has already been made repeatedly in this thread. Exaggeration has to at least be rooted in truth before it becomes a lie, which only adds fuel to the "fake news" fire we all love to talk about.

I think there is some gray area here. True state funding has decreased and increased tuition was a result. But if you break it down more you'll see the increase was not on par with the funding drop in most cases. So Politifact would rate your statement as partly true.
