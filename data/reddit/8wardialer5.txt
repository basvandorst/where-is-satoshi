I don't know... I think there is a lot of FUD around the fees narrative. Surely there is a problem with that, I agree, but i personally know more "just hodl it" than "high fees" people. 
I mean, there is plenty of cheaper and widely accepted crypto (LTC?), if the fees pain is real, lots of people would be using, but they are hodling them all

Sure it is, but let me say that not all 2nd layers are the same. This one just throws away all bitcoin major advantages.
Converting all your BTCs to a bunch of 5 dollar bills would be another one for example.
I think the rationale is if you believe in bitcoin long term goals or if you search for a get-rich-quick scheme. For the latter also the 5 dollar bunch is a viable option...

Security means also disaster recovery, so:   
1. The 12 words hidden around the house are another big "no" in my opinion. Thefts, earthquakes, floods, fires... Better safe than sorry.
2. Don't trust your memory: it can be an useful "cache memory" for checking your funds without the hassle of recovering your hidden 24 words seed everytime, but definitely not a long term reliable solution (Alzheimer?). 
In my opinion the most secure way to store funds is to split the 24 words in N unique parts of which you just need M for recover your complete seed. Then put all of them in different secure locations (banks or similar, no "homemade" solutions). The size of M and N is up to you: 2 out of 3 can be a good starting point in many cases and give you a good safety margin in case tomorrow morning one of your banks disappears out of the blue (not literally, just to give you the overall idea).  
Then store your "daily use" copy using a password manager, good encryption, a long passphrase and a secure token (or certificate) that can be stored at home in a safe.
Also don't forget to include detailed information for the recovery together with your recovery seed.
**Bonus point**. Are you paranoid? Keep reading and you will be: *how* are you "refreshing" your memorized 24 words seed ? Are you repeating it out word by word? What if Siri/Alexa/Google whatever leaks?

Negative interests are great for the average Joe (banks will give him a mortgage easily). The average Joe is poor, so he doesn't care about wealth taxes. The average Joe can pay directly with his card, phone, or whatever.

The first article is behind a paywall but the first paragraph states that cannot be seized. The second one doesn't say anything, but the last one says clearly that "the perpetrator finally agreed to forfeit the coins".
If I give my key to you (or my password, if I'm not storing my bitcoins securely) you can move my coins as you wish. Otherwise, good luck!

I believe that censorship resistance is the greatest feature that bitcoin has to offer. It cannot be stopped and it cannot be confiscated: that's great and, talking about money, it's true for the first time in history.  
BUT... I don't think that the censorship resistance alone could bring any benefits to the adoption (and so to the price). How can I say that? Tor. Think about Tor: it's a great tool, can help you circumvent online censorship, protect your privacy and communicate safely. But how many people are using Tor browser daily?  
Privacy is a great product, but it doesn't sell.

I mean how can bitcoin save the-average-guy from hyperinflation? Rich people can simply buy more bitcoins than him and Bitcoin whales can sell more bitcoins than him. Probably you're right but I just can't figure it.

I  think we're mixing facts with personal hopes here. Don't get me wrong, but also gold is scarce. The only "new" point bitcoin is bringing to the table is the censorship resistance.  
For your second point, i totally disagree. Taxes are lower now for rich people than 50 years ago. And while wealth taxes can save you from the escalating social inequality, Bitcoin can't: a financial whale is a poorly-taxed whale, a bitcoin whale is a untaxable whale.

@_date: 2019-06-21 15:19:24
Redundancy is also a factor in security.
If I have to do something like this, I would split the private key so you only need M of N shards to recover it entirely, with M something between 2 and 4 and N=12.
If you spread the shards well enough you will be safe even if a big ass meteorite will blow up the entire California for example.
Keeping 12 different unique pieces of information is counterproductive from this point of view: keeping it simple, the more location you are using, the more likely one of them can fail and since a single failure is enough to make the entire chain fail you are weakening your stored information in comparison with a single location storage (that's why RAID 0 can be something fun to play with in your basement workstation but terrible for a server).

Exchanges have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies. We need to stress this concept a lot more.  
Everything "bad" related to (legit) cryptocurrencies happens in exchanges.   
It's worth nothing to have built the biggest and most secure decentralized transaction ledger if we continue using exchanges or bitcoin ATMs  or crypto-credit-cards or any other kind of "single point of failure" system.  
It's kinda as having a secure encrypted disk drive and then store unencrypted  backups somewhere.

1. Hodlers
2. Exchanges
3. "Fees": or better the huge amount of cut that the ATMs or coinbase-like platforms take (so, not actually bitcoin related)
4. More in general: all the trusted third parties that are scamming the hell out from people wanting to buy bitcoin whithout having an idea of what is
You want to increase adoption? Start adopting it by yourself:
1. Your friend wants to "buy bitcoin" after years of hearing you talking about it? just send bitcoin to him from your hot wallet directly to him, instead of saying "ok, cool go to this exchange, register yourself, validate your email, complete KYC process and then start to buying bitcoins using bank wires"
   1. oh, you keep all your bitcoins in a cold storage? Stop pretending and start "adopting"
2. Oh that store has a huge "buy bitcoin" sign? just walk in and buy something to show your support instead of posting a pic here 
   1. oh you don't have a hot wallet for spare purchases? Stop pretending and start "adopting"
3. You see a new bitcoin ATM? Burn it down! Hey, i'm just kidding, don't do this for real... But bitcoin ATMs alone are not helping bitcoin in any way. 
Yeah, I know, I'm bitter but this is not directly aimed at you OP, it's just generally speaking. I believe in the "be the change you want to see in the world" philosophy.

Meh... I agree with OP.  
In my opinion bitcoin acceptance rate has nothing to share with the number of hodlers or bitcoin ATMs.
To be honest, also the number of "BTC accepted here" stickers is not relevant... People using bitcoin is the only metric to consider.
Near my workplace there is a "pizza shop" (I don't know ho to exactly translate "pizzeria" in English) with the "BTC accepted" sticker. The first time i went inside I was like "Cool! how many BTC transaction in bitcoin per week?" the answer was "None. In years".

Block size it's not a dogma, but vertical scalability sucks.

Again, we can have bigger blocks in the future if needed. Things aren't mutually exclusive.

Currently there is nothing innovative in BCH, no interesting concept, and all the hype comes from the Bitcoin name and  narrative.

See guys? It's working!

moonmath: you can't buy the Moon when Bitcoin reaches a Lambo.   
But you can buy many Lambos when Bitcoin reaches the Moon!

Yo dawg! 
I heard you like crashes...
@_date: 2019-05-02 07:24:35
Thanks for the list, i will go through it hoping to find my next exchange :)  
I will definitely give a try to Bisq, it's not the first time i see it's suggested here.
@_date: 2019-05-02 07:44:51
Short answer, yes.  
Long answer: Without the KYC procedure, the exchange and the CC provider are two separate entities with a different set of my personal data, and i'm fine with this.  
The CC company knows where I live and will know that i'm sending 30 bucks to "[moonlambo.com]( but doesn't know what i'm buying. On the other hand, moonlambo exchange knows that i own 30 bucks worth of bitcoin (or litecoin or monero... this is not the point) but doesn't know where I live.  
The government can enforce both of them to give my personal data? No if they operate in two different countries.  
An uber-haxxor can violate both the systems and take my data anyway? Theoretically speaking yes, but you will agree with me that keeping personal data split across multiple platforms reduces the risk insted of keeping all your eggs in a single basket.

So just like the real one.
@_date: 2019-05-02 07:31:05
Thank you stranger!
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:36:25
Hey, I hate KYC and started a thread to discuss pontential alternatives.   
Probably you will find some of the replies interesting: [

*like i like my women*

This really killed me!
@_date: 2019-05-02 07:29:15
This is another interesting suggestion, thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:51:55
And I'm adding nothing, indeed
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:14:19
To buy the dip
@_date: 2019-05-02 07:28:07
You forgot the kids!   
Yeah meetups or bisq is the main take-out message coming from this thread, i will give a try. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:15:01
Thanks, BTM is another of the recurring suggestions here, i will check it.
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:15:59
Definitely one of the recurring suggestions here. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:17:53
Italy.  
I will try at meetups as already suggested, thanks!

I woke up this morning, my baby was gone. I woke up this morning, Lord my baby was gone.
I thought that she loved me, it seems that I'm wrong, yes, I am wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:34:16
So you live in the not-so-distant future?
@_date: 2019-05-02 07:30:47
I understand it, but it sucks.   
As someone else said, I must proove myself innocent before purchasing... It's not this way that it works in democracy.
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:47:16
We missed you so much, kid!
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:06:58
Thank you Santa!
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:11:56


Exactly this.  
Also, Thanks for your suggestion.

Hello Joanne, I don't want to be rude, but in this thread you are representing my nemesis.  
I know that you need advertising, but doing this in a thread started literally to ask alternatives to the service you provide doesn't seem a clever move.  
Best regards,

The only problem is that when the Vegeta indicator was defined, scalability was not considered. It performs badly above 9000.
The roller coaster guy is much more scalable.
It's like the IPV4 vs IPV6 situation.
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:16:06
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:28:33
LMAO that would have been great
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:50:31
Much more euphoria.
The only thing I remember after the crash is that this place was full of "Chinese new year" theorists and "Wall Street bonus paycheck" also.

It can ruin the aerodynamics and messing up the downforce is not good at certain speeds.

It's all smooth (somewhat) once you're on board, but the onboarding process is the real pain :)
