btc-e dump was hosted on numerous "password" search websites.
You were able to search people who had accounts in btc-e.com by email,username or ip.
searching * would get you list of all the "staff" accounts along with IP's, and then you would be able to search what other accounts are tied to the IP's itself. I suppose most of those  accounts were admins as well, however dump did not specify if account was admin or not... but same IP's having accounts for both domains, and also evidance that both were leased in softlayer, and hosting IP block was leased under same person name "Ilya".
btc-e dump was first leaked to famous password search platform - leakedsource
