I’m not sure a single exchange would do that. Only a very small portion on coins are ever take out of an exchange (as a portion of of all orders)

Fees and confirmation time is somewhat irrelevant given BTC hasn't been a "payment" coin for at least the past 2 years. If you want to do payments, use altcoins. They solve the fees and confirmation times very well. BTC is a store of value, and as a store of value the network will sustain single monthly transactions.
What I mean by that is, seeing at BTC is the benchmark and ""gold standard" in crypto. It will be the place the majority of your crypto wealth is stored, with monthly atomic swaps into the altcoin world for spending.

@_date: 2018-01-29 12:15:06
Kinda agree but what needs to be understood is that the fee is for a permanent record in the block chain (duplicated MANY times around the world - forever). The theory around it all is very interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:14:09
Ok say your a pal of mine and I owe you 5btc( doesn’t matter how much they are worth but just as an example). I can open a channel with 5btc my end and 5btc your end. So if we close now, you get the 5btc I owe you, and I get the 5 back which are mine. Now the reason I might give myself some btc is that I might want to send you some more in the near future, or use your other channels to pay someone else (the NETWORK part of LN). Total capacity is at 10btc. So you could send me any amount of btc up to the amount you have on your side of the channel. (Technically it’s a request as you can’t push coins my way). Btc can flow backwards and forwards hundreds of times, each time updating the signature technical stuff of the chain so regardless of what point we close we have the correct amount of btc each. 
What’s smart is that I can commit btc to you if you commit to pass them on. So I may end up sending you the final 5btc, but they are only because you have committed 5btc into other channels on my behalf. 
What’s interesting to me about LN is the bigger picture with exchanges and merchants. There’s no need to have a permanent record of all your purchases on the chain.

@_date: 2018-01-20 11:34:34
This is genuinly one of the worst comments I've read all year.
Complaining that fees are based bytes is one of the most short-sighted and ignorant comments about the blockchain.
The blockchain isn't about how much the UTXOs are worth. It's the method of STORING and VERIFYING a transaction.
Fees are high because spending fund on the BTC chain is arguably more secure and 'worth' more than any other chain.  
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:03:14
I’ve seen the data and I get it, but I’m just skeptic over the significant part. I don’t believe a single exchange could have such a big impact. High fees are because others are paying high fees. If all transactions right now where 1 sat, 5 sats would almost certainly go into the next block, regardless of the mempool size. Also number of transactions are not exactly proportional to the size of the pool (in mb) as a single transaction could theoretically fill a single block. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:21:43
Understand that LN still has plenty of work to do, it still doesn't "just work" - you need some tech know how. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:38:21
My hunch would be it's not worth to consolidate if the value of BTC against USD increases 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:54:20
No, as the channel capacity is only 100, you can’t go over that limit without opening a new channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:21:40
Well BTC has outperformed bcash since its ''inception''
ETH outperformed BTC from It's inception up to June 17' where if you bought at any time since that point until Oct 17 you lost against BTC.
ETH may be at its all time high in terms of absolute value to USD, It's still quite a bit behind in terms of all time high against BTC which is king.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:07:19
Yes. Each channel has 2 numbers, your balance and the other persons balance and you can’t exceed the total capacity. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:46:44
Assuming you subscribe to the idea that the value of the coin will  increase (mid term) then spreading you buy ins will give you a lower base value - the cost you have put in, than just buying in once every couple of months.

There are too many factors to decide if a coin will make it in the long run. Including luck.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:07:43
I don't think that you understand that LN current state isn't about scaling its about getting a network going that WORKS. It was only a couple of months ago when I lost testnet coins during a channel close. Plenty of bugs a testing needs to be completed before anyone thinks about scale.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:26:06
It’s not so much about permanence, it just doesn’t scale. The current chain growth is absolutely predictable.
Slightly off topic but also what’s not understood is what centralisation is, and the true trust factor of level “0” and level “1”
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:02:23
Yeah kinda, there’s 2 number in play. Your balance and the other parties balance. Say you have 1btc and the other has 0. At this moment you can only send using the channel as there’s no capacity to ‘receive’ more. You could spend .5 over the course of the month meaning .5 on both ends. You can then send an invoice (important to note payments are made using invoices — both ways, rather than addresses) to anyone within the network for the .5 topup back to 1btc. As the other party in your channel has the capacity to send .5. Only limitation is that the chain from that third party to the sender has the capacity in each of the hops. 
Hope that helps ��
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:14:12
Altcoins are not 'bad' - shitcoins are.
Bitcoin is a store of value, it's what it does best. If I want to spend then using altcoins MAY end up being the best way to do so. Being able to store your value in BTC, and for example, instantly swap into LTC to buy some food is great for both myself whom is trading out of BTC and the other person who may be turning their LTC hot wallet into a cold storage BTC. 
My opinion is that bitcoin will always be a network and have demand. value is very subjective, and very much relative to buy/sells rather than the absolute value of the coin.

Next layer IMHO will the the "brokers" - In a similar way to the large network providers provide connectivity to the web. I can't see the likes of coinbase etc managing channels. They would want one big fat channel for the "fixed" onchain fee into the LN. Its possible the brokers end up being just power users with liquidity rather than a company depending on how the economics play out. Once these are in place, true applications can be created.

Very interesting as it also possible that the payment companies will connect with the individual company nodes to support the supply and connections. 
So many possible layers. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:51:13
I had the same concern, but I believe that the network is always going to have a positive amount of coins in it, and you can only spend what you own on the network, so I don't see it being a problem at all.

@_date: 2017-12-27 10:51:35
Given the network is essentially a mesh, couldn't the payment make a different route? and in theory the opposite way through a node to re-balance, providing there are enough hops? (ignoring any possible fees associated.)
In production I don't really perceive any issues at the sending or middle nodes, only the nodes that are very heavy receive such as a  store.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:31:43
LN will work on mainnet but isn’t ‘ready’ yet.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:20:53

Pretty sure this is the answer, I've seen her many times on TV talking Bitcoin - she knows what it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:53:01
If you mean connected to her hub via own node and channel then yes, but then I would ask why you are sending $5000 through LN rather than on-chain cold wallet. 
I'm talking about hot wallets that exchanges use, that are not technically wallets. Grandma can receive your LN as normal and fund her account. Grandma can then spend the coins through the hub owned channels. 
More to the point about re-balancing.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:33:23

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:09:47


Exactly, and you would trust your private key with potentially tens of thousands of dollars at a single point of failure. 
It's not about backups its about what has access to your wallet and private key. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:02:28
The UK already has this - assuming it works in a similar way. They are effectively “off-chain” transactions, and we will see crypto “banks” do the same In the near future. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:49:10
Agree in quite a large way. I think us geeks will we fine overall with LN channels. For me real magic starts happening when we get the next level and we start using our 'Coinbase' wallets to pay LN transactions. 
(Substitute Coinbase with any other exchange if you like.)
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:08:26


For swaps between coins yes, but not between fiat or goods (real or digital).


 
You don't trust a node, as a node is inherently trustless by the network consensus, what you trust is the entity that provides the node to act fairly. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:55:49
LN is an open standard, where anyone can run a node. It's a second layer to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:51:14




Not true, the node creating the channel commits the initial funds + fee. But can also "send" as part of the channel opening
So $1000 channel opened with $100 as the initial transaction (so 900/100 split.) At this point if the channel is closed you get 100, as thats what we have both agreed on, and I get the 900. I could open a channel with 1000/0 split and for you to use that channel I would have to send funds to you first. 
I also personally don't think it would be advisable for your employer to open a channel with you specifically. Unless they want to start dealing with the opening and closing of channels to balance out the liquidity of the salaries, otherwise onchain would make more sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:29:22
lets be honest, at this point everything is still a long term vision. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:55:03
Ok I will bite.
So you have a machine that is 100% offline - how do you update the software? or move the transaction over to the other machine? Network can be compromised, USB? Also can be compromised. Type it manually? have you verified the encrypted package? I hope you see that you can't possibly be 100% secure .
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:06:11


LN still needs wallets, so it's unlikely a user would only ever have the specific amount of bitcoin for a single transaction. 
Also from what I understand, but I may be wrong is that each coin in the network is part of a signed contract so even if it is used as part of a third party transaction, you still have your coins that you can re-contract elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:58:49


Crypto is decentralised and you control your own "money" (read:store of value)
Sending a couple of quid to your mate or paying for a meal at a restaurant has been solved, but sending money across the world to pay suppliers in china even with using the likes of alipay can still take 3-5 days to clear. paypal can take upto 10 days in some instances from start to finish to clear.
Crypto model of storing and sending something of defined value to anyone or anything is very powerful. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:57:47






Am I correct that the channels are time locked to 8 hours of no activity? before they close themselves and settle?

LN is not a big switch.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:29:41
Which is precisely my point.
I think you, and others are taking the whole trust-less thing too literally. At some point you have to trust someone. Be it the initial transaction of bitcoin into your own wallet or delivery of goods for spent bitcoin. For the normal retail consumer they are not going to run their own nodes, if they have to they just won’t use bitcoin. So creating trust-less layers gives users the option of whom to trust,  be it an exchanges, the Amazons of this world or yourself (nodes, channels, backups, security etc)
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:57:30
Thanks for this explanation, one concern. I assume the wait can be skipped and confirmed on the main chain straight away? How does the fees work In this case? Also I assume because LN will be a part of the wallet system that there’s not necessarily a need to commit changes to the main chain? Also would the 10 day thing mean that my LN wallet empties itself after a certain period? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:02:30
lets be honest, you shouldn't really be storing all your crypto in the same address anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:26
Wallets are not addresses, a wallet is a collection of addresses. What he said was technically false. Also this is the entire pool of addresses, so is going to be VERY top heavy. In the US, the top 1% holds about a third of all wealth. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:59:01
Valid concern but the off-chain management of coins is inevitable. 
Given the core of the network is "on-chain" you don't NEED to participate with anything like this if you don't want to. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:28:35
I understand that, but how likely is Alice going to node with a single user rather than an entity + user?
(say coinbase, starblocks and Bob)
Ultimately I don't even see Alice, Bob etc even running nodes and they piggy back onto seriously hot wallets provided by their exchanges.

Just like Core, the average user will not run a LN node and open channels. The power of these tools is they let YOU decide who you trust.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:02:21
LN is an open network layer so it’s completely optional if you use it or not.
Changes to core effect everyone, LN effects those who participate with LN itself.
Secondly I used Coinbase as an example, many bitcoin “owners” use Coinbase regardless of your or anyone else’s opinion on the company.
Buying, spending and receiving bitcoins from a single app with low fees and fast contract times is what we need to maintain the current pace going forwards. 
Importantly you can run your own bitcoin node and LN node and participate in the trust-less way you always have done.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:56:21
Bit silly that, my understanding is that dont use bitcoin to hide from your monetary obligations. Example: Taxes, debts, bankruptcy, court orders.

I personally think it’s important to have the dual option as opening a channel for single use doesn’t make much sense. Given the concept of payment channels are bi-directional.
Pay with Bitcoin
Pay on Lightning Network (Bitcoin)
Hopefully in the future cross chain payments are common enough for a rename to Pay on Lightning Network.

I don't think it matters how much they have to be quite honest, because I can't see either of them ever being in a position where liquidating such a huge stack give them any short term benefit over the insane long term leverage they already have. 
Most interesting thing about both these parties is they both mine BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:05:10
It is 'priced in' - I've been through the past TWO and very little happened.
A comment further up mentioned about the bear market but that in itself had little to do with the halving.
One of the best properties of Bitcoin is the known supply, we know theres an average of 1 block per 10 minutes, we know the block 'cap', we know the total ever supply of coins, and we know the rules around the halvening itself.
It's very easy to predict and know the supply of coins at any point in time, be in 10 days or 10 years. 
Just looking at the last 10 blocks, the block reward is 80k whilst the fee reward is only 1k.
This has an huge impact in the profitability of mining, but not the price.
It's also easy to see the role fees play in regards to the price of a token.
Basically we already know.

Joking aside, these are the steps that need to be taken. As with running full nodes, not everyone will need to run a LN node.

You are right on some points. I think he’s smart because he never debates or discusses with anyone who can counter his arguments. The pump strategies are pretty much on point - although personally I would have missed one of them out. He’s also smart enough to mine BTC to either support his personal finance, or pump BCH- or even both. On the point of the naming debate, he knows that he can’t ever call BTC Bitcoin as this will kill the narrative that BCH is the true Bitcoin as outlined by Satoshi - effectively making BCH (as is) pointless. BCH would of had bigger success had they stuck to their principles, and again I think Ver knows this hence why he’s so attached, it has *some* value. 
Lastly, because of this BCH will also never really disappear.
Ver will lose the war but I don’t think he will go broke doing it, he will just move away from BCH - possibly into some other scheme. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:22:11
I think you are missing one of the key points. Trust and authority.
In the real world trust is earned via peers, family and friends. Online, we are told who to trust by advertising, "peers" or the networks themselves.
By building an identity layer (identity is not the same as an individual - and multiple identities could represent a person) you can create a much fairer trust model, and from that allow for a better authority of what should be right or wrong (technical rather than morally).
Now its not without its downsides as a verified identity could be used in some kind of social rating such as that in China.

I *think* vertical means something that has more than one layer, An example of this would be a retailer that makes some of their own products, where typically someone else would.
I would then *assume* the implication is that the likes of bitcoin would then impact these businesses in multiple ways
I hope if someone has a better understanding they could.

You are kinda there but you missed that you can’t consolidate 20-30 living people into one. You can consolidate transactions (LN). Many including myself agree that block sizes will need to increase *at some point*. But 32mb (even 8mb) blocks aren’t without their problems.

Im with you on the first point but there are so many other factors with running a business with cash. Counterfeiting, staff theft, wrong change, counting it up, visiting the bank, insurance for cash on premises, accounting.

I will get hate for saying this, but I believe most will go custodial. The normal user cant secure an email or social media password never mind manage a key to Bitcoin.

Although I honestly don't think onchain fees will ever get that high (you can do math to workout how much the cost per coin will be,  effectively sustain that level is higher than $1m).

Well your Reddit history would indicate you are here to simply troll, but to give you the benefit of the doubt, and others that may be interested in the same question:-
Bitcoin cannot scale forever in a single direction, and ultimately both BCH and BSV are trying to achieve bigger blocks. This can only possibly go so far. I and many others have personal opinions on what the blocksize should look like into the future, but TODAY, even with 1mb blocks there is plenty of space for onbording tens of millions of additional users.
Bitcoin works by every single node needing to have a complete and up to date copy of all transactions. There is absolutly NO need to store extremely low value transactions such as coffee payments on the blockchain. You are not solving any problem that exists today by completing low transactional value in this way. Cash works, Visa works, and both are effectively free to do in the EU. (Banking in the EU is highly competitive and EU directives allow anyone to have basic banking at no cost )
What LN does, A second layer solution is to allow you to open a payment channel with another peer on the network and use that channel to send payments back and forth offchain. When you are ready to settle, you simply close the channel and a single transaction is sent onchain onto the network to update your bitcoin address.
Not only does this make transactions effectively free - (you dont need to pay for block space) you get added privacy in that because your individual transactions are not on the blockchain. Only the difference is recorded when you settle. This introduces huge plausible deniability. A LN open/close transaction onchain is very easy to spot and because of this, you can't actually deduce who ultimately received the funds, only that you used a LN peer for facilitate the transaction. 
If you want to receive your wages or sell a car in Bitcoin, sure use the base layer - you want to have the security, but using the likes of LN is similar to taking cash out of your bank. Your spending is more private as its not recorded publicly in the same way. You don't have the same transaction fees associated with each action either.

If you are slightly interested In what bitcoin may be about have a go. you can get a fraction of a bitcoin, move it to a wallet, buy a few small value items online.

I’m not saying that if bitcoin is high fees WILL be high, in saying if fees are high then bitcoin MUST be high. If people are paying $50 for example, then most transactions today won’t take place. If you do work for me, and it costs me $50 to obtain bitcoin, then $50 to send it to you, you also need to be willing to pay $50 to spend the revived funds. So unless that transaction is worth, say 100,000, then why would we transact on bitcoin?  You can take this further and see that the total sent per day would be so high that unless the market cap itself then moves north the ratios and models won’t fit to allow 50$. So if you force the incorrect logic of 50$ then IMHO the value of a coin must go to the moon.
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:52:04
You got suckered into thinking blockchain is what makes bitcoin what it is. Whilst it’s important data structure. The magic really comes together with the PoW which allows for true decentralisation. Once you go past this you can then see how not just individuals, but also entities or pieces of software can ‘own’ value with no external control. 
The whole turn governments upside down is a tad extreme, but it certainly changes how monetary systems are used and controlled.

Thing is it doesn’t matter WHO mines, or even HOW. The rules are set and miners can’t abuse that power whilst maintaining the same level of profits. There’s a certain game theory that keeps miners in check.
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:32:18
it can never be fully priced in, and also the futher out you get from the halving the bigger the external impacts are too price (regulation etc) than simply supply.
Also the supply BEFORE the having is still quite high, its unlikely at current demand (even if we assume the investors see the same results as we do) have enough capital to absorb the existing AND new supply. I honestly we will see a 10x event, but will likely take another 2 years to happen.

Good question really, impossible to tell how much really, but It's certainly less than $200B.
Depending on what point in time you focus on, $1 can move the market by anything between 5x and 20x I've not seen the calulation recently but I suspect we are now much closer to the 5x. I would talk out my arse and say a 10x average applies meaning $20bn invested to date. This assumes the investment is against the entire supply to date. This would also include the cost of electricity and arguably even mining machines also assuming they where used to mine at a 'fair' price. 
If you are interested, take a look at stock to flow model. People use its to try and predict the future price, I mostly see it as an interesting view on who the price is effected by the supply constraints.

You can backup the states when a transaction takes place. Watchtowers also provide intermediate support against “bad” states. Static channel backups also allows “co-operative” force close. 
I get it’s more complex, but this is the trade off for having cheaper and more private transactions. LN is also optional. It’s not like it’s an inherent risk with bitcoin itself.

Libra isn’t trying to beat Bitcoin. Bitcoin has limited UX in the immediate future. Most people can’t keep email and social media passwords safe nor can they backup files correctly so I don’t expect them to manage a Crypto wallet.
Custodial solutions like Facebook will see bigger usage, at a cost.
Libra is in the mobile payments space, just look at WeChat and AliPay. This is where Facebook wants to be. Not a traditional bank account. Crypto is what will allow this to happen otherwise current regulation for a centralised database just wouldn’t work.
Visa will be back. Visa is the link between devices/cards into the banking system. There’s no reason why Visa couldn’t allow traditional cards of Mobile devices in the same way Apple Pay works to interact with Libra wallet. This is also even cheap for Libra as they can bring the leger in house without needing to link and interface with traditional banks. 
I get the Criticism for Libra, and personally I’m willing to take the risk with. Bitcoin itself, but globally I understand what Libra can do. I’m not sure the privacy argument makes a difference even though it should.

Don't listen too much to what Reddit says, theres great content here, but also kids who just want to get rich and don't actually 'get' Bitcoin.
I would say firstly, play around with Bitcoin itself, try LN etc. This will give you a better understanding of how Bitcoin works more than just sitting on sats. Bitcoin is fantastic technology.
Listen to some podcasts, there are so many great speakers from all different walks of life that have fantastic views on the future of money and tech.
Continue with YouTube also but don't take either Podcasts or YouTube too seriously and hang on to ever opinion as some kind of fact. If you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right, question it and research it further. 
Join Twitter if you haven't already. Loads of great (and shit) content there also. It does tend to focus around personalities rather than specific subjects - but again if you are critic, it can be insightful and allow you to keep on top of all the latest developments.

2140 isn’t even relevant it’s over 100 years from now, Bitcoin will barely exist 30 years from now when the numbers still stack up for relativly low fees. Also if the fees are high then the transaction values AND coin price will also have to be very high otherwise we would see lower hash rate. Meaning lower fees again.

Taxing ones income works because it takes money from those who can afford it the most. I find it interesting that you mention sales taxes as this is actually less fair still because it means a rich person again pays less taxes relative to ones wealth.

LN has issues sure, but this specific issue is also stupidity. If he really lost 4btc (32k$ I might add) you have to think he should take better care of storing this, rather than just taking old backups and pushing it to production. Had he used static channel backup, there would have at least been a decent chance to recover 99% of the funds.

First point is the most important. Plenty of cheap transactions where going through during that time, but as the clients just couldn't work the fees out correctly, keep suggesting inflated prices for estimated confirm times.
Point 2 is the same as high volume to me. Point 3 is mostly irrelevant as its too costly to keep sending 'spam' transactions. If you want to genuinely inflate the fees you need to spend millions a day with no reward.

If you don’t have a HD wallet and send coins to a new address, your previous backup is invalid. Exactly the same situation here. His backup is old and no longer valid. Neither makes Bitcoin or LN broken, just harder to use. Static channel backup are specifically designed to minimise the risks (not eliminate). Being your own bank with $32k, and not doing sufficient research is not other people’s “fault”. Theres a reason traditional banking still exists.

Depends what your view is, crypto is very hard for merchants full stop. The beauty of LN is its a open standard that solves some of the problems for little compromise. LN is NOT ready yet, only those who wish to destroy LN claim it’s ready.

This isn't true. Being your own bank has too many risks. This is why Fiat is primarily stored in banks. This is will also be true for Bitcoin in its function as a digital cash.

There’s an interesting post from a few hours ago explaining how the trans fee was potentially inflated due to the difficulty/hash rate and empty blocks.
We are limited to around 140mb a day on chain - not including any Segwit or out of block wizardry. If a empty block is mined we have lost the opportunity to use that space. Secondly if the hash rate is too low for the difficulty we could be looking at slower blocks.
It’s not difficult to start seeing a 2x or 3x increase in the block chain over the next 18months to start really pushing the limits even if LN is in full swing, LN has a specific use case being currency transactions - store purchases etc. 
Personally I support the bitcoin way rather than bcash was but I’m open to bigger blocks as we grow.

Take two steps back.
Manipulated volume, Are the charts filled with fake buy/sells, or are the exchanges trading with themsleves? or both?
Either way, given the BTC pairs, and general arbitrage across the entire class, even if you did have a low volume exchange with 100% legit transactions, how do you know that the price hasn't been effected externally? You don't. 
Aside from this issue in itself, a chart doesn't tell you anything about the external factors, from both a retail and institutional investment POV.

NFC payments are not instant, and even with Faster Payments they still can take a few hours. The fact is the majority of bitcoin ''transactions'' will happen offchain. Much in the same way as NFC payments today are 'offchain'.
The reality is Aunt Maureen isn't going to know how to setup encryption and secure her devices correctly. Third parties look after money, and have done for centuries. Having a hot wallet tied to an online bank account is reality.

Personally I don’t think there’s much new money available right now. Newbies have been burnt and are broke, day traders probably continue as normal, and hodlers also probably have little new capital to invest after dec, and given we are only a couple of pay checks into the new year for some.
End of this month into April I would expect some new money to come in after the relative stability of the past 6-8 weeks. Nice climb into August, maybe a dip in sept and ATH for the final Q.
Again just my opinion but I don’t see how the whales can manipulate as much if there’s nowhere near as much fresh money. Just read what Coinbase said yesterday about growth.

Great logic my friend ��
Fraud is when you knowingly sell something that is not as described. The BTC blockchain is NOT called Bitcoin Core, which is the start of the deceit. The search description is “Buy Bitcoin” also the domain name is buy.bitcoin.com yet neither options are clear on what is actually Bitcoin. YOU might understand which is which, but the average Joe on the street won’t even know that Bitcoin Cash is a thing. Deliberately incorrectly naming Bitcoin and not even explaining the difference IS fraud.

As posted elsewhere LN is for specific use cases - transacting like a debit card. On chain is a transfer of wealth - in and out of cold storage exchanges, persons, business invoicing etc etc.
We also importantly need ‘low’ fees to open payment channels or the concept of LN may go beyond the principles of Bitcoin itself.

@_date: 2018-04-08 00:45:42
Currently there is no valid business model around LN **at the moment**.Fees are too low, and can easily undercut by someone else. Just as some BS numbers say you took 10 sats 100 times a day - as the cheapest route, totaling 1000sats, so around 7 cents, you just arn't going to cover ANY costs at that level. Lets say someone else comes in but charges 9 sats, with exactly the same capacity for 100 transactions, immediately - with the current routing, they would be used almost exclusively over yourself. 
Now, **in the future** it may be viable to get paid to provide liquiditiy into a businesses end node, and have capacity in the middle to other large nodes. Much like internet peering today. Even at something silly like 0.25% - providing you have enough liquidity in yourself, you can EASILY cover any kind of on chain fees, plus hosting.

That's the point, YOU understand Bitcoin, your average Joe on the street doesn't. It's very easy to type "Buy Bitcoin" into your favourite search engine, see the name Bitcoin.com - along with the description of "Buy Bitcoin" and proceed. When you land on buy.bitcoin.com there is no distinction between the two tokens, and given the NAME of the site, and REFERRING description, there's a perception that they are BOTH what we consider as BTC, not BTC and a fork. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:22:26
Not sure they have ran out of money, but they are certainly leaking millions a day if you consider the bitmain angle. They know they can’t spend their way out of this so they have to be more clever this time around.
I consider these scam artists quite clever in the narrative they have spun, but they have played their wildcards at absolutely the wrong time. If they played them as we start going back up, they can ride the BTC wave up to a ATH where as playing them over the past 6 months just means they have created a depressed period that will be difficult to buy out off. I guess it’s easy to look back at now though.
I know it’s slightly off topic but it always gets me that both bitmain and bitcoin.com mining pool both also mine BTC.

I'm not talking about how bitcoin is used - I agree with everything you said, EXCEPT, how do you secure it? and I don't mean by obscuring the problem. Passwords have existed since the 60s and we are no closer to solving the CORE of the problem. We have certainly made things harder to crack with the likes of 2FA, but they are still prone to MITM attacks. More importantly how do you secure a private key? Go too far and you cant recover, use something too simple and it WILL be hacked. If you can solve this problem I'm sure you will have not issues getting a job at Google/Amazon/Apple etc.

My personal opinion echos that of CNBC for what it’s worth. I expect the next 6 months to be a growth period. So I would be looking at buying now, hold for 6 and sell.

Threads like this are interesting because it's like saying the internet is about sending emails and cat pictures. Not that email isn't important but it's a very 2D view of what the internet is, and how it has changed society. 
Cash is physical, and fiat has been solved by using cash OR cards with NFC. Here in the UK I have cash, i have multiple Visa cards with NFC and all transactions happen IMMEDIATELY and are reflected almost immediately against my many accounts. 
Chasing the dream to replace fiat is not the end game and you also need to explain to the person on the street WHY crypto is BETTER for them against FIAT. 
What Bitcoin will do is give us new ways of thinking about how we hold value, how that value works, and how we interact as a global economy.
For the person on the street, it changes how they will view their pension, or even potentially provide a UBI.

Sorry, didn't really explain much as I was typing from my smartphone.


It's about choices, for us in the west, I'ts not really a problem using third party services to process our transactions - we can afford it. The true power is YOU are your own bank and processor (or atleast the network that you are part of is). Where the likes of PayPal may take high fees, or cause problems with chargebacks, YOU have more control.


Silkroad died because the owner was stupid enough to link his dark web identity to his real world identity - but that irreverent. Again, the desire to process you own payments is very powerful and it means governments CANT stop you - even if it was made illegal.


Store of value is not the same as being immune to inflation/deflation. It means that if you have 1BTC, It cant be taken away from you because of its fixed supply, immutability and cryptographic keys.
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:03:58
I think you are right in some ways. Just as the average buyer of bitcoin uses exchanges, I can’t see a world where the average user will run LN nodes. The power of payment channels is the pipes between entities. Merchants like Coinbase will build on top of LN at some point.

I don’t think that Bitcoin will replace fiat, but a crypto currency WILL back a global currency. (I believe this is China’s next power play)
Still unknown how far the currency aspect of Bitcoin will go, there’s certainly credibility for it as use for digital goods/services over fiat - no intermediary services required. Just look at how silkroad became so successful.
Anyway, store of value is where Bitcoin is right now, many will disagree and also use it as a negative for Bitcoin, but it’s fact (IMHO)

Trademark has nothing to do with fraud. I don't know where this meme came from.

Bitcoin.com uses Bitcoin Core as a label for Bitcoin. This goes against not just every other website that "sells" bitcoin, but also how the name Bitcoin is used conversationally.

Aside from never risking more than you can afford to lose. The way I see the market at the moment is we are still only a few months from the ATH, we have had a steady few weeks of around 7k, and all this with VERY little new money coming in. Over the next couple months time we will start seeing fresh money with fresh hope. Soon as we do we will climb pretty fast.
Speculative trading is what will drive adoption through store of value. I have no doubt the fundamentals  are there, it’s just impossible to perceive where everything will end up. IMHO

Good question, I have unspent UTXOs that are from 2013. I have an old wallet that is “dust”. I have seen calculations what consider that address as lost, but on the flip side there is certainly plenty of coins that where moved much more recently that are genuinely lost.

@_date: 2018-12-22 13:36:45
Whats also great is the mempool doesn't know this transaction has taken place, only your node and the receiving node knows exactly where the payment has come from. If you make multiple payments only the balance is only recorded in the blockchain, and the receiving address might not even be the individuals you sent payments to.
@_date: 2018-12-01 02:26:15
I'm hopeful about Crypto - and right now Bitcoin is the only real token to hold.
That said, the TRUE capabilities of Crypto are barely comprehensible. For me it's the ability for transactions of immutable value to be made across the globe instantly and direct. Right now if you think about how you make payments today, they all include a third party to function - even if you consider cash withdrawal from your bank account.
Being able to send directly allows not just individuals, but entities and even software to interact with and control units of value. 
Once we understand this we can start building use cases that have never been possible before with the backing of the global internet networks - beyond just the crypto network.

I don't think you understand WHY Litecoin is nothing. Just because It's TECHNICALLY better, doesn't make it a better crypto-currency - and before you argue about being 'silver' I will de-bunk it.


Bitcoin doesn't have a problem with slow confirmations, It's still faster than than any traditional currency (minus cash of course, but Bitcoin isn't cash)


'better'? As far as I know Bitcoins algorithm cant be reverse engineered.
ASIC? What's your problem with them? If predictions are correct we can look at a 100x increase of hashrates etc making Bitcoin MORE secure (makes it harder for this 51% FUD).


WHY do we need a 'Silver' to Bitcoins 'Gold'? I've yet to hear a convincing argument.  Bitcoin isn't an investment or commodity market, its a CURRENCY. 


10 Mins is a long time to wait? Granted It's a problem if you are talking in-person transactions. But there are middlemen who provide APIs and wallets that make it 100x easier for those receiving Bitcoins as a payment.
You say Litecoin is 4x faster. Thats still 2.5 Minutes of waiting, and when you are talking business. Time is money.


Here we go, again, It's all about those who wish they had got into bitcoin MUCH earlier, and those who have already invested in GPU who feel they are going to get left behind with ASIC.
Well, thats your fault for thinking you can make a quick buck of buying mining hardware. Bitcoin was not designed to be some kind of ponzi scheme where you can buy in then cash out at the cost of others. It's a virtual currency.
Litecoin is pointless. They are worth less today than they where 12 months ago.

Mt.Gox need to breakdown the tasks involved in making trades. by creating an account, adding a trade, whatever API call is made, SHOULDN'T slow down the trade process.
Front: Web servers load balanced to accept API calls and normal web calls
Middle: central database that simply stores data - API call records etc.
Back: trade servers, either share the same tasks, or split the trade process into pre and post trade actions. Process each API call as they come in and actually place the trade.
I know this all sounds fantastic on paper, but Mt.Gox really need to look at their whole process, taking 0.6% fees or whatever PER trade is not acceptable if they are not going to re-invest.
Regardless of a DDoS if you can make a API call successfully that trade should go through within seconds.

the 'true' price is around $15 imho.

I bet it will be a cut of that fund rather than the full 100%   Either way though, not sure if this is excellent or something to worry about.

You can move your blocks etc to an external drive. You can copy a full node, ideally you should have same version on both clients, but I’ve never had much luck in the past.
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:02:56
Doesn't matter, you can magically turn $100 into $10,000 without luck.

Bitcoin is full of people THINKING they know what they are talking about.
Thats rule number 1.
As for becoming a utility, I can see it happening naturally - thats not to say its a given. When you have massive amounts of money being put INTO Bitcoin, its only natural that the smart folk will see it as an opportunity to to get a slice of that money.  I'm disappointed on the uptake of businesses accepting Bitcoin. Mostly comes down to web hosting/VPN services which is weak.
Bitcoin has a long way to go, and all I can say is to anyone is don't put it more than you can afford to lose, because ultimately its a gamble.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:42:34
Often, no. But its certainly one of the reasons why I choose to use my card for many web transactions. knowing that I can claim my money back.
Another point really is that it costs the other side money when a chargeback is performed, which is ONE reason why PayPal get iffy with virtual goods. 
The receiving merchent can decided to cut of the supplier of goods if there is a significant number of chargebacks, discouraging bad practice.
Anyone can accept bitcoins for any reason.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:59:30
Bingo, only takes a slow summer of little growth on the retail side to make bitcoin less interesting from outsiders. Imagine a point where the only goods you can get with your coins are digital currencies on WoW or D3.
@_date: 2013-02-08 19:57:24
Exactly, I put few pence into Bitcoin because I think its a wonderful idea and want it to succeed. PayPal and the likes are the bane of my existence. Noting like someone taking a cut of your hard earned cash.
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:17:56
Exactly, again, this isn't a vendetta against bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:58:48
I moved coins a month ago that hadn't been moved in 18 months. No special reason apart from they where the next lot to be used.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:48:23
Seriously, whats with the talk about 'walls', they only exist in your mind. The 130$ '''''''wall'''''' this morning consisting of THOUSANDS of bitcoins didn't do anything to the charts. .
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:55:24


On which side? because using credit cards doesn't have to be expensive to the the customer, only the retailer - of which I will never be one so quite honestly I don't care about this point.


Sure, last summer I bought some clothes of a 'reputable store' (Decent reviews etc), totalling around £60. Product never turned up, so I contacted the retailer and they effectively ignored me, after about 60 days in total nothing ever happend and the store had disappeared of the net. Contacted my card provider, filled in a few forms within a couple of weeks my money was returned.
I'm not taking sides on any of this, I love Bitcoin as much as everyone else. but there are honest pros to having a closed accountable system.

I didn't say the price will drop, I'm just saying what they are really worth. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:04:09
If you could have guaranteed the sale at 240 sure, or even knew that it was going to drop to 70, sure. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:59:43

Housing is needed, Bitcoins are not needed. 
@_date: 2013-03-17 22:41:29
For once I agree, to me it shows there is clear demand at present for Bitcoins - and should be left at that. 
Take from it what you will, but personally it shows that the crazy price of $47~ could be easily higher.
Means nothing long or short term, because unfortunately nobody can really predict the future.

Worst part is screenshots like that can be faked.

Whats the best way on an iPhone to scan and pay using BitCoin?
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:46:57
If bitcoin fails the others have NO chance, it shows that at this point in time theres no demand for a currency like this.
@_date: 2013-02-21 12:46:10
Valuable for what? Why should I use Litecoins over Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-02-22 18:24:20
Fine, I value my bitcoins at $1m each.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:31:09
It's been funny watching all the miners 'get out' over the past 18 months because they keep seeing it as unprofitable, yet they are making more than ever.
@_date: 2013-02-21 10:03:40
Don't kid yourself, Litecoin wont take off because it's trying to be a Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 10:02:28
This is why idiots are going after Litecoins. They think if they get in early they too can have make up for not getting on bitcoin early enough.
@_date: 2013-03-06 11:15:49
I agree 1hr is a long time, but you have to consider that in real world banking, transfers can take days to be confirmed. Your bank just "trusts" that the source - typically another bank, will fund correctly giving you instant access.

Back pedalling? Are you serious? I said the true price is $15 which I will stand by, also why would I sell all my coins to are595 for $16 if the market itself thinks they are worth more? Doesn't make the slightest bit of difference to me. 
0/10, Please try harder.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:26:07
It's possible, but to think that my coins could ever be worth $10m easily just sounds ridiculous.
$1000 is not too far fetched if some of the bigger investors consider Bitcoin as a 'safe' place to put money, and BIG retailers decide they want to accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:03:01
50 years?! Be realistic, Bitcoin needs to sort itself out within the next 5 if its going to have any real legs. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:10:20
Technology moves so fast, in 5 years anything could happen, and by that time Bitcoin needs to show real strength and stability.
The only true thing thats driving bitcoin at the moment is the massive inflation.
@_date: 2013-02-21 14:16:18
I specifically said bitcoin. this disussion is about Litecoin vs Bitcoin. If you want to argue about virtual currency vs real money then I'm game, but not in this thread.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:46:47
Care to explain why that matters ;)
@_date: 2013-03-26 11:26:45
Surely that would mean MORE fees? possibly even a % of the transaction?
@_date: 2013-02-22 18:32:17
Why? When I can hit Bitcoin-24 and sell them for $30 each.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:03:39
Chargebacks are important feature of a CC. Sure there are costs associcated with CC's but you get features for it, and this is one of them. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 18:30:01
Potential. Potential means nothing. I'm potentially a billionaire but would you take 1% of that potential wealth for $10,000? No.
$15 is very solid if you consider the true growth, difficulties and historical data. Not to say that Bitcoin will crash tomorrow down to $15 but you might find that the value stagnates for a few months until the true value gets close again to the 'market'.
Having a market value higher than what Bitcoin is really worth isn't healthy as it presents more of a risk to those who accept Bitcoins for transactions - not great for Bitcoin as a currency.

Don't be an arse, Facebook runs on apache and php ( be it not quite a stock installation ) and they don't fall over everyday.
Mtgox needs to re-write their trade algorithm and add a few more servers.

Quick note relating to current/past miners. Even though at the time their rates may have been 0.1 btc a day (so worth maybe $1-2, 0.1btc is now worth $13.39 - Easily more than it costs to 'make'. So who is to say that even though you will only 'make' 0.05btc they wont become the equivilent of $10 a year later. Just a thought.
If anyone is going to get a ASIC, be aware it is another risk if you consider it a method to 'make' money.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:03:11
First off thanks for the reply. 
The beauty of Bitcoin is that the 'value' is completely unpredictable. You could also look at it in another way and say the prices decrease before you get your delivery, and grow again afterwards. 
If I had $1250 to 'waste' right now (I mean, don't risk what you cant afford to lose) I would go coins. but I wouldn't say an ASIC is the 'wrong' choice.
