The buttons don't look very buttony, and the gradients on them are ugly, imo.  The rounded corners on the different windows feel cheap and cartoony.  Your logo needs some work, a slab serif typeface definitely does not convey a casino kind of feel.  
When people play a game that simulates a real table game, they want to have the look and feel of the table game.  Every online casino I've ever seen looks something like this:  .  Here's a screenshot of my employer's iOS blackjack game: 
I like simplicity in design, and some of those examples may be too busy, but I think your site is too simple.
I like the design of your cards and the animations are nice.
Your site needs to be fleshed out more.  Right now it's only usable by people who know the rules of blackjack and know what bitcoin is and how to use it.  This obviously hurts your potential market.
Casinos are all about the whole experience, you need to try to simulate that with better design.  You need sound, too.  Chips moving, cards shuffling, cards dealing, and any player action needs to have an associated sound.  And the sound has to be very pleasant and not become annoying after repeated listens.
Sorry for all the subjective terminology, that's the best I could do.

If your business becomes profitable, (or maybe even before it becomes profitable) you're going to want to hire a professional graphic designer.  The design currently presents an image of a cheap, hastily thrown together website, a message I'm sure you don't want to convey.

Yea, my overnight mining didn't appear to affect my balance with slush's pool, and I woke up to it also saying it couldn't communicate.  No idea what's going on.

Someone claimed to have the DB on some hacking forum a few days ago and was trying to sell it.
Sorry for the vagueness, I don't remember where I found the link.

CPU mining is a bad idea.  It's probably negative expectation given the difficulty of the network.  It would probably cost more in power to mine with CPU than the value of bitcoins mined.

There's no such thing as a risk-free investment.  Then by definition, any investment is "gambling".  The main thing that matters is whether or not an investment has positive expected value.

Any reasons specifically you think this?  Seems like a crazy assumption to me.  I  think if you moved the market by buying $150,000 worth of bitcoins at once, the sudden increase in price would prompt many people who think it currently valued properly to sell their BTC to realize their profits from the overvaluation.

This is one of the applications that was completely obvious for Bitcoins from the get-go.  I'm surprised it took this long for what appears to be a good implementation of Bitcoin payment to appear in this market.
