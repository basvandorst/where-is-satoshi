their website is insecure.
@_date: 2011-07-05 07:28:15
will it be cross platform?
@_date: 2011-06-21 20:11:52
why does it have to be a US site? bitmarket.eu have USD exchange and people can use whatever transfer method they like.

Yeah why would anyone choose security over looks? Those tradehill users are mad!

We don't know that. That's hell of an assumption to make since every person we deal with is in another country and we don't have any real control over anything. What I can only confirm is that my bank is not at fault.

it might take a day
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:48:28
Good questions. I've learned my lesson.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:12:31
No, no and no but I used the same password on bitcoin24 and vircurex... I deserve this hacking.
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:42:08
what's that thing you were talking about encryption and what's a change address?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:22:02
The "Details of Payment" problem was not from my side. Somehow it got lost in the middle. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:12:35
btc24 and vircurex both I didn't use for a long time because I switched to mtgox
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:49:02
No mail. My password is 10 digits with random number and letters.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:13:00
Paranoid is what I will become.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:11:20
No can you elaborate please?

I deposited $5K in 18.11.2013 via international wire transfer.
To this day I heard nothing back. It doesn't say my money is on hold. They don't respond to my tickets and they keep closing them. I'm getting more and more convinced that BTCe is a scam.
**EDIT**: I called Mayzus Financials and they either didn't recieve any money or my ID was lost on the way and they don't know who the money belongs to. Now I'm going to my bank to check it. 
**EDIT2**: I've got written confirmation from my bank that the money left my bank and went to Mayzus via New York Bank. I'll call Mayzus again with this new information.
**EDIT3**: Mayzus Financials is investigating and trying to locate the money.
**EDIT4**: Mayzus confirmed that my money is in BTC-e's hands but they don't know what to do with it because somehow in the process of SWIFT transaction the information about the account details was lost. According to Mayzus this happens a lot and is due to intermediary banks. Now I have to somehow proove that my BTC-e account actually belongs to me. We'll see how that goes.
I must say Mayzus was really helpful and friendly. For people who are asking me for a contact just call their Czech office. I recommend you to first get the needed information from your bank since Mayzus will ask for it. I've also sent them my ID and proof of residence just in case.
Their recommendation to prevent this in the future was to open an account on their websiate (free) and send the money there first and then transmit it to BTC-e. This way if there is information missing or any problems they can handle it.
**FINAL**: My money just showed up on my BTC-e account! That's all thanks to Mayzus.

what application is this?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:10:58
Yes the last part is how BTC-e identifies you. I must say this whole "notes filed" thing is disappointingly unreliable. In my case the intermediate bank was "BNY Mellon" and they just decided to omit the "notes field". Unbelievable...
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:49:13
Nope and it was dumb.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:24:18
Just call their Czech office. They know what they are doing and they are very helpful.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:11:01
yes. fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:38:55
can someone ELI5 why he lost he bitcoins?
