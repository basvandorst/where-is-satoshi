What's the possibility of Satoshi tossing a few bitcoin out of those untouched wallets to help out the Mt gox victims?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:54:44
Just over 23 coins. Oh god, I cannot breathe, I just learned about this right this moment.
Is there no recourse for us? No class action lawsuit?

Dear Hollywood,
I will provide my first hand account as a Mt Gox victim in exchange for bitcoins.

Is there any conceivable way this guy isn't gonna get assassinated?
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:21:01
Good. Now we just need to wait for the part where Karpeles takes a bullet to the head.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:36:33
You know, hypothetically speaking, if a picture of a dead Mark Karpeles surfaced with a bitcoin wallet QR code included I might *accidentally* donate a shit ton of BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:30:14
Hmm, wasn't it rumored he died or something?
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:51:45
So eh, whats the consensus on this looking legit? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:37:03
I wonder who will play his assassin.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:58:28
Is this international phone call another scheme by Mark to recover the missing bitcoin by charging ridiculous rates?
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:14:58
does this have an implications for legal repercussions for Gox or compensation for victims?
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:21:13
Stand tall, my $10K got goxxed. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:12:50
I think you mean: you have some misplaced butt soreness and you think the salve is in the hands of gox victims for undefined reasons. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:52:46
I don't find this particularly surprising. Facebook was built and managed out from under them, it looks like bitcoin will be too.
Sorry twinklemen, being absentee managers isn't gonna fly in competitive markets that require active work. You might have more luck sleeping on your cash mountains in some protectionist industry that protects the fattest and lazy. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:00:37
fuck. Maybe I can recover some lost bitcoin by giving an interview as a victim. Lost 23 bitcoin myself, PM me hollywood.
@_date: 2014-05-21 06:47:14
Hah, I had +23 bitcoin on MtGox. Guess how many I have left now?

Fair point, but I've also been wary of China's advent of "ghost cities"

No surprise here, the Winklevii twins, who are already members of a hoity-toity ivy college fraternity seek to ingratiate themselves with another secret club; the government.
These roaches want spotlights on everyone except the corners they inhabit. The solution is simple: DO NOT USE BUSINESSES USING THEIR WHITELIST.
@_date: 2013-11-16 08:37:16
Ask them why they need to constantly recreate their secret society club in their professional lives with their less open version of Facebook, and now the bitcoin "redlist".
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:15:58
Even at my 10BTC a day limit, it's hurting me. Good job though, OP, maybe it'll save someone.

Are we not concerned by the fact that the rise above $900 was almost certainly caused by artificial pumping as it had occurred during America's daylight hours? Especially when the U.S. only accounts for 2% of exchange transactions?
