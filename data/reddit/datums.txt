This is actually good news.

It's amazing how quickly this community has forgotten about Mt. Gox. You could argue that that wasn't bitcoin's fault, but you would be missing the point. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:41:23
Willfull blindness, nothing more. The mt. Gox issue is bad for bitcoin, no question.

Exactly. The smart money is totally not getting out *right now*. It will be really easy for bitcoin to recover from weeks of devastating headlines that undermine trust in the fundamental security of the protocol. We just need to convince people not to google 'bitcoin' before they decide to buy in.   
  
Edit - If this comment seems a bit out of context, it's because it is. I was actually replying to another comment (yay android). The comment was something along the lines of "This is actually a good thing" in an obviously sarcastic tone.

Frenemies at this point.

Posted in the wrong sub. Thanks for being a cunt though.

It is extremely unlikely that they stole it, because it would be next to impossible to get off clean. But it is very discouraging that they have not yet been able to solve whatever problem it is that they have. Worse still is that they cannot even provide a rough timeline for when transactions will resume. This tends to suggest that whatever the problem is, they have no idea how they are going to fix it.

But that would spoil the elitism. The same elitism that compelled someone to post that comic. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:28:00
There you go again with that "fiat/stick" business. Don't you understand how alienating that nomenclature is?
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:44:32
All right. Maybe I'll try commenting here again in another 6 months or so.

Do you not see the irony in quoting Warren Buffett?

Where is "here"? Do you even know what bitcoins are? Do you know what dollars are? Can you understand why the relationship between the two is important? Do you even *lift*?

If this is your investing philosophy, you probably shouldn't be investing.

You are talking out your ass. Borrowing money for a project like that would be extraordinarily easy. The last thing you would want to do is advertise something like that to the public.   
Also, there is nothing in the statistical data to say that asic chips are online. The hash rate would not track the price. They would go in opposite directions.

At this point, is really does appear that the whole concept was something of a scam. It definitely had the look of a get rich quick scheme, with an unbelievable return on investment. If you think about it, who would sell a machine that literally makes money, which can pay for itself in a month? If you had a machine that could print $10,000 a month, would you sell it for $10,000? Of course not. Just make sure you learn from the experience, and remember - if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

You can take it as a '6' if you like, but that won't make it so.

You actually just called someone a "noob" on the internet, in bold. Just let that roll around in your head for a few moments.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:00:39
You're being downvoted because this sub is rife with confirmation bias. They don't want you breaking up the circlejerk. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:52:52
This right here is part of the problem. Bitcoin fans so badly wanted to be right. Well, turns out, this time, they were wrong. And now we have all these excuses and conspiracy theories. The truth is, too many people convinced themselves that currency speculation could be easy. It isn't.

In 2012, he backed the idea of minting a trillion dollar platinum coin to circumvent the Republicans on the debt ceiling.

This subreddit has become such a fucking circlejerk. 90% of the people here have no idea what they are doing. You should be happy that your investment declined by 50% in a day, and the exchanges were all frozen? Good luck with that philosophy. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:32:56
The problem with this sub is that you upvote stuff like this, but then downvote a story about JP Morgan creating a bitcoin alternative. This sub should be about accurate news and information about bitcoin. By upvoting positive stories over negative ones, you create a skewed version of reality. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:18:33
I was also euphoric when the price was dropping. Because I somehow magically knew it was because of the speculators. Even though the cause of the crash is as yet unknown. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:56:46
You know what would be nice? If the "Bitcoin" community weren't a bunch of smug assholes. Unfortunately, it turns out that they are all have doctorates in economics and cryptography.

The link to the press release is not working right now. That says it all (It's 9.24 Eastern)
