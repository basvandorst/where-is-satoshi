You can buy BTC without using the same centralized platform. You can buy a BTC on bitstamp, on BTC-e, on localbitcoin, you can buy a BTC to your friend... You just need to diversify the place where you get BTC.

It will be the case if the bubble explode. And this is not the case yet.
You can name something a Ponzi scheme if in fact, someone just disappear with all the money. And with btc everybody are involved in the possibly ponzi scheme... A ponzi scheme isn't a bad thing. It is just when someone use it to scam everybody. But to much people are involved to create a specific scam like Madoff did.
