There are other countries like Iceland where energy is both renewable and dirt cheap. Since bitcoin mining is location-independent, that's where all commercial mining will be done in the future. So not that wasteful after all.

Exchange USD to CAD... fee.
Exchange CAD to USD... fee.
Send an international CAD transaction in a timely manner? $40 fee please and that will take a few hours to a day.
Oh your business wants to accept electronic CAD payments from people? You're going to need to pass our background check, keep money in escrow, rent equipment from us, and of course pay fees on every transaction.
It's pretty much like any foreign currency at this point except cheaper.

Silk Road was the reason most people got into Bitcoin in the early days. It was the killer app.
@_date: 2014-09-07 11:19:27
Yeah they're going to refund you, because it's their own fault their system is so insecure and they know it. I can't encrypt my credit card info, it's right there in cleartext on a stupid magnetic strip that I share with every merchant and embossed on a plastic card that I carry around with me.
And at the end of the day, all that fraud protection is *not* free. It raises prices on everything that you buy since merchants have to maintain extra margin to pay credit card fees and cover the occasional chargeback.

People who work at Bitcoin companies? I just sell them on payday. It's actually cheaper than getting paid in USD since I can sell them for CAD directly and avoid the USD -&gt; CAD exchange rate fee.
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:03:14
That would be better than anything I've seen so far but still:
1) Takes 6 days
2) $1000 limit so it's really more of a 0.5-1% fee if you're spending more and even higher if you're sending less. A lot of people sending remittances don't really have a lot of money and might only be sending a couple hundred at a time which would be a 2.5% fee.
3) This is sending USD from abroad. The picture isn't clear but there might be an inflated exchange rate that applies where they make more profit.

The rest of your points are valid and I agree with them but I don't see how there's any extra accounting work accepting bitcoin versus paypal for example. It's all just USD in your bank account at the end of the day.

You don't have to pay for the fraudulent charges but you have to waste time on the phone reporting it missing and then lose access to your account until they can mail you a new card. All this inconvenience to you when it's some merchant's fault your details got stolen (and the CC companies for designing such an insecure system) is just wrong.

It's mostly a gimmick but it's actually cheaper for me this way since my pay is denominated in USD and converting USD -&gt; CAD has much higher fees and wait times than selling BTC for CAD directly.

You're thinking of an exchange. When you bet on sports with a bookie (or retail forex with a buckethouse) your bet is against the house. The house hopes that they get equal bets on both sides so they can profit risk-free off the spread. If they don't, they need to go out and hedge their risk.

@_date: 2011-12-16 06:14:14
When has it happened before? What was the outcome? It seems different to me now because it's Dwolla's money you'd be stealing and they'd be more willing to reverse transactions to get their own money back.

Unless you're doing this for fun, at current exchange rates the electricity required to mine 1BTC will probably cost more than buying it on Mt.Gox.

Buying USD and/or Gold used to be illegal in a lot of communist countries. Of course, like any contraband, you could still find it at high markups if you knew a guy. I presume the same thing would happen with bitcoins if they become illegal in some (but not most) countries.

I would generate a new address on an offline computer and print the unencrypted private key and put it in a safety deposit box.
This is nice because you can leave it to your heirs in your will and there's no risk of losing or forgetting an encryption key.
This doesn't work very well if you want to hide the btc from the government or your spouse or if you want to be able to spend them without driving to the bank.

Consider a poker site that allows people to buy in and out using BTC in addition to USD. Currently they either need to maintain a stockpile of BTC to facilitate withdrawals or they need to go to market and buy and sell whenever they do a BTC transaction. The former exposes them to the risk that the price of BTC goes down and the latter is very expensive because of the huge bid/ask spread and fees compared to fiat currencies.
If professional traders start trading bitcoin it would dramatically lower the spreads and improve liquidity and allow companies like the poker site to hedge their bitcoin exposure. Net win all around.

In practice CC companies just stick the merchant with the chargeback and a nice fat fee on top.
I guess I'm not a bitcoin fanatic because I agree that it's currently a terrible currency and unsuitable for true instant transactions. However, just moving money from A to B with no government interference or chargebacks is a monumental innovation. If bitcoin does nothing more than that it will still be one of the greatest achievements I can think of.

You can make up any number of plausible and unverifiable excuses for how you obtained $10 in bitcoin. The hard part is coming up with a plausible excuse for where you got $100,000 or $1,000,000 which is what Satoshi Dice solves.

The public key is visible on the outside so you can see that there is 1BTC somewhere that's been untouched for the life of the coin. Of course, you're still trusting that the guy who wrote the coins put the corresponding private key inside and didn't make a copy. I just bought one as a fun souvenir, as I'm pretty sure most of his customers did.

This is actually a bias in human nature known as loss aversion.
Although losing $500 and not taking $500 are exactly the same thing, they feel different to us. Poker players in particular have to work hard to overcome the instinct to make a safe bet over a risky one when the risky one has a higher expected value.

They can (and do) buy and sell foreign reserves to stabilize the value of the currency.
For example,

There's nothing wrong with that. Not everyone can handle the price swings.

The spread is the difference between the bid (the price at which one can immediately sell bitcoins) and the ask (the price at which one can immediately buy bitcoins)
That said, I don't see how MtGox profits from a larger spread since they make straight commission and don't care what the spread is.

Say you sell drugs for bitcoin (not on Silkroad).
You can launder them using satoshi dice as follows:
1. You sell a small quantity of drugs for a small quantity of BTC (~$10)
2. You immediately bet it all on SD at 1000:1
3. Repeat steps 1-2 until you win. At this point you declare your lucky gambling win and withdraw it legally on your verified MtGox account.
High variance, but simple and cheap.
