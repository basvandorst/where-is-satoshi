@_date: 2018-01-27 04:36:43
you know why this is probably accurate and they are indeed longing now?
  
Let me prove my point, here.
  
Bitcoin was $10K.  Wall Street then jumped in prior to futures launch.  It ran to nearly $20K because they were taking positions.  They opened short contracts and sold their positions that the bought on the $10K to $20K rise.  During this, many retail people were panicked and sold out.  All of this ran us back down to $10K.  the true HODLers were there before Wall Street came in at $10K.  Now we are $10K, again, and, again, the true HODLers are still there, holding the $10K line.  and Wall Street has probably already sold their positions.  See what I mean, here?  Now Wall Street buys back in again after taking their long position.  And we run to $20K and higher.
  
If they took a *short* position here, it wouldn't make much sense, because they're probably (in my scenario, at least) already sold out of their Bitcoin position.  Do you need a Bitcoin position to buy futures?  No, of course not.  But can you manipulate the market to go the direction you want, to line up with your contract, if you buy Bitcoin, as WELL as futures?  YES.

Thanks for sharing it.  love the frame choice, the color is great!
  
If anyone has any questions, feel free to hit me up.  I'm dropping a brand new piece tomorrow featuring Satoshi's white paper.  I'm *super* excited to share it with you all.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:26:13
you do.  It's called the [lanham act]( which the 'Right of Publicity' falls under.  You can [see here]( for further details on this law.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:47:19
I am so very pleased to present this to you all.
A few weeks ago we reached out to Andreas Antonopoulos, requesting to make some artwork for him.  We were very excited that he gave his approval, [which you can see here](
We have designed two versions.  There is the typographical black/white version (V1) and then the typographical, blue water colored version (V2).  Each piece is limited to 50 worldwide.  There are two sizes available (so 50 of each size), 18"x24" inches and 24"x36" inches.
  
Prints and canvases are available on this page, if anyone would like one:  
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:32:08
The print is photo paper, printed on 100 lb polar white paper, it's quite thick, almost like a postcard.  it's matte.  The canvas is printed, literally, on canvas paper.  The canvas paper is then stretched around a 1.5" thick wooden frame.  So the print is not framed, the canvas is framed.  Both are beautiful.  Shown in the picture is the print version.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:57:27
[here's an album of some more pictures with close-up shots](
  
This piece was extremely tedious and I'm really proud of how it came out.  When you get up-close to the poster, you really can't see the Bitcoin logo; you mostly just see the letters of the whitepaper, as the yellow is so close to the grey that is used.  But when you step back 5 or 10 feet, it pops significantly.  I think it makes for an incredibly fun conversation piece.  And if anyone hasn't read the white paper, now you can do so while staring at a piece of art! :)
  
It is available as both a print and a canvas.  They are limited to 50 worldwide (50 prints and 50 canvases).  Each print is hand signed and numbered on the back.  Each canvas includes a hand signed and numbered certificate of authenticity.
  
[You'll find them here on my website](
  
*edit:*  wow. thanks for all of the kind words, everyone.
  
and yes, I meant to say typographic art.

We did this as a hand-painted, oil on canvas.  We then took photos of it to make prints.  There are only ten prints available (of each size, available in 18x24 or 24x36 inches).  Each print is hand signed and numbered.   is reserved for our private collection so, technically, there's 9 prints of each size.

It was hard on the eyes and was really difficult to notice the B logo from really far away.  I also tried to use the orange for the bitcoin but that was also difficult to read close up.  the yellow/black/white combo ended up working perfectly for what I wanted to accomplish - close up, hard to see logo, far away, totally obvious logo, and a beautiful contrast with the black/white.

“There are almost 200 currencies of the world, but there’s only one international currency. There are almost 200 currencies controlled by central banks and governments, but there is only one mathematical currency today, and that is bitcoin. We are going to build more of them. Cryptographic currencies are going to be a mainstay of our financial future. They are going to be a part of the future of this planet because they have been invented. It’s as simple as that. You cannot un-invent this technology. You cannot turn this omelette back into eggs.”

you're missing the point he made.
  
The difficulty to mine Bitcoin adjusts every two weeks.  Every two weeks, it's much easier to mine Bcash than it is Bitcoin.  During this time period of difficult mining for Bitcoin, all of the FUD comes out about fees and transactions.
  
Do I think fees/transaction speed needs to be fixed?  Sure.
  
Will it be fixed?  Yes.

That’s not what the meme implies. It doesn’t mean you’re struggling to buy groceries. It means you’d rather buy BTC than spend money on anything else.
  
Side note I’m not blindly buying. I’ve been buying since January 2017. ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:54:40
Exponential growth. Its much easier to go from 10k to 11k vs 1k to 2k, right? 1k to 2k is doubling, but that same 1k increase at 10k mark is only 10 percent. The higher the price goes, gaining a few thousand per week actually wont be very difficult.
  
A lot needs to pan out. But if this many new wallets keep being created weekly, lightning network rolls out, perhaps a few etfs come, and further large companies adopt btc for payment, I believe we will certainly see 100k this time next year, and thats my conservative estimate.
But it also depends on where the dollar is going. That can contribute to the move as well.
  
**Tldr**: 100k end of next year is more than likely happening, i give it 90% chance. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:07:48

you're right.  it's not ready.  but I faith in the developers, perhaps next year Lightning will roll out and help solve a lot of the current problems.  I think volatility will slow after we reach the $100-$150K mark.

it's very hard to say.  I've been watching gdax closely.  120 coin buy at $12K this evening.  Sooo could that be because they are expecting to go long and HODL tight? or could they be preparing to go short and then dump that position?  I have absolutely no idea.  All I know is that I believe in the technology and the network.  So I'm not going anywhere.

question for you or anyone that knows, since I'm about to buy it.  Is volume 2 just an update to volume 1?  or is it entirely new talks?  if I start at volume 1, will I be reading mostly the same things on volume 2?  Or should I definitely get *both* ?

I don't think there is enough, either.  16M in circulation now, satoshi having 1M, at least another 3M burnt, lost, or hacked (bitfinex, mt gox), and probably another 5M in cold cold cold storage.  There's probably, at best, 7M coins available to exchange.  That's my rough estimate/guess at least.

1M new wallets created each and every week.  21M coins total, but only 16M in circulation right now.  At least 3 or 4 million coins that were lost or burned.  1 million *probably* held by Satoshi, but definitely, as seen on the blockchain, sitting in a random wallet that no one knows who's it is?  4-5 more million coins put away in cold cold storage, people who are NOT selling until the price is much, much higher.  This leaves you with just 3 or 4 million coins left to exchange, yet millions of people coming in to buy each and every week.  Massive Demand &gt; hardly any supply.
  
it *will* hit $50K and much higher next year.  You say we don't know, but, we do.  You just have to look at the simple math!

posted this before but will post it again as it's relevant:  
  
Exponential growth. Its much easier to go from 10k to 11k vs 1k to 2k, right? 1k to 2k is doubling, but that same 1k increase at 10k mark is only 10 percent. The higher the price goes, gaining a few thousand per week actually wont be very difficult.
  
A lot needs to pan out. But if this many new wallets keep being created weekly, lightning network rolls out, perhaps a few etfs come, and further large companies adopt btc for payment, I believe we will certainly see 100k this time next year, and thats my conservative estimate.
But it also depends on where the dollar is going. That can contribute to the move as well.
  
**Tldr**: 100k end of next year is more than likely happening, i give it 90% chance.

Yeah.  capitulation, chart wise, would pin bitcoin at around $1k, right?  Max pain.
  
But I'm talking about what feelings are brought on by capitulation.  Running things up and getting excited, then running it back down and losing hope.  True capitulation is the feeling of wanting to give up and throw in the towel.  And when the price runs up and down multiple times with no real sense of direction, that feels quite a bit like capitulation.

this is exactly true.  I've noticed that you should always do the opposite of what the market is making you feel.  Just like you said.  If you're super excited and it's going CRAZY GOOD, that's probably sell time.  If you feel down in the dumps and wish it would end, that's probably the buy time.  But regardless, I just HODL. :)

He had said it in conversation on the BitcoinTalk forum in July, 2010.  Post here:  
The full context of the quote (he was replying to someone else on BitcoinTalk, and had quoted them in the message, that is the 'quote' section):
  
The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

*Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.*
  
See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.

funny you should say that.  I am releasing a special Oct 31st release to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the whitepaper.

No.  Not really.  Not at all, actually.  it uses a high temperature process to transfer the image to the metal and it's then treated with a high-gloss, reflective coating.  So again, no, it's not a print.
Print:  "produced by a mechanical process involving the transfer of text, images, or designs to paper."  key word, paper.  This is not paper.
  
You redditors sure do like to argue as of late.  This place used to be a really fun community several years ago.  Now it's just arguing for not much of a purpose.
  
Anyway, to each their own.  Art is subjective.  Some people will spend $300M on a Warhol piece, while others say it's not justified to be worth more than $100.

This quote:
  
"24/7 Market – 70% down…. It’s been emotional ladies and Germans but I am officially tapping out. Will leave 5k in this shitshow and see where it goes but the trading…no more, can’t do it. Don’t have the emotional fortitude. God speed sailors."
  
That is 100% capitulation.
  
When the majority of the market sounds like this person, that is usually the time to buy. And when everyone is euphoric, that is when to sell.
  
Right now is not the time to throw in the towel. If anything it is the time to pick it up.
  
But I do understand the emotional toll it can take on a person.

Many of us are here to stand for something and Bitcoin is that stand; standing against the modern slavery that is the banking and financial complex.
  
If you're not happy with the network and you think it is failing, learn to code and contribute to the community. Build something. Make it better. 
  
This sounds like classic capitulation / typical market sentiment based on recent "bearish" events.
  
New technology does not get better in a matter of months, or a matter of years for that matter. It takes decades. You are looking at the wrong timeframe. Zoom out of your chart. 
  
And btw your "lack of adoption" is straight FUD / bologna. I am a business owner that adopted Bitcoin several months ago and know of at least ten business owners in my circle who have done the same, and it is snowballing.

I respectfully disagree.  Bitcoin was created out of the need for an alternate currency because the dollar is backed by absolutely nothing.  I think the dollar will eventually collapse and cryptocurrency will take over.  That is, if the banks allowed it to happen.  which is possible that's a no.

one guy said:
  
"Lol these arent parallel situations.. Bitcoin has no real advantage over other money it's just a pain in the ass to use, impossible to value, &amp; carries an exorbitant amount of fees. You just think it's cool"
  
It's extremely easy to use; copy an address and send your coins to it.  It doesn't get much easier.  Everything has a learning curve - even your Bank of America debit card.  Imagine being in 1943 and receiving that by a mail courier.  New technology sounds like "a pain in the ass to use."
Value?  Let's talk energy consumption from mining - if you want to try to place a 'hypothetical value' on Bitcoin. Value can be generated by subjective user experience, regardless.  If one person finds it more valuable to own, the one person will pay more for it.  And thus, prices fluctuate based on this model.  
Exorbitant fees? 26 cents to send $5K is exorbitant? ��
And yes, of course we think it's cool. We finally can control our own finances without a third party.  There's no one to say "no, you can't do this."  "No, you can't participate in that fundraiser."  "No, you can't associate with that political party."  "Sorry, we are freezing your funds."  Your damn right it's cool to control what you want, *when* you want.

Regardless of "if we're still in a bear market" or "if we're back in a bull market", in my personal opinion, it won't matter whether you bought at $3K or $20K 10 years from now.

??  Doesn't sound out of context to me.
  
First quote:
"Eventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we’ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so."
  
Second quote:
  
"We are committed as ever to making an ETF a reality!"
  
Sounds pretty promising.
  
At the end of the day, though, Bitcoin never needed an ETF to be created from the ashes of the financial collapse and fly from a fraction of a penny all the way up to nearly $20K in less than 10 years.
  
I still don't think it *needs* an ETF.  It would be neat, I suppose, for people wishing to invest into it for their IRA's, but it's not a necessity to ensure Bitcoin's survival.  My personal take.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:52:33

They're fun conversation pieces that can be kept unloaded or loaded if desired.  We recommend, if loading them, to keep them within a fireproof bag and inside a safety deposit box.  They are not intended to be carried around loaded.

well, if the price keeps going up, then no.  if I can mine .25 BTC, that's .25 of what the current price is right now.  my mining capabilities never change, so if the price goes up, I'm not mining .25 BTC anymore, I'd be mining the fiat equivalent.  one L3 can mine about $600 right now.  if Bitcoin is at $20K, the L3 is still only mining $600 (if not way less due to difficulty increases).  So at the end of the day, holding the 1 Coin was a better ROI

the problem is how do you know where the real crash is?  we just had an over 30% drop and we are right back up to ATH's.  So if it starts tumbling 30% again, let's say after it hits $100K, how do you know it's not going right back to $100K and higher?  It's almost impossible to time the market.  I'd love to hear your thoughts because I'm genuinely curious.

I could.  My power is quite cheap.  but if, in four months time, Bitcoin is worth $20 or even $30K, then I'd only have mined about $7K worth, and thus lost out on $13K+ had I just held onto my 1 coin.

if anyone is interested in a print, this piece is limited to 21, signed and numbered. [available here](
  
(and yes I can accept BTC as payment.  you just have to message me your order details, website host doesn't offer it at this moment)
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:23:12
I would donate to this and say we create a wallet to do it. Question is how to guarantee the person would follow through with the ad. I'll think on this, maybe I can work something out with some people I know in the industry. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:47:18
yep, exactly!
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:57:36
any interest in selling it as a print?  We can print it out and market it for you, make it a limited piece.  :)  just let me know.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:02:41
 I shared the filtered version a few days ago and a few people requested seeing the unfiltered original. This piece is based off a previous design of ours from our incredibly talented artist, Devin Schoeffler.  We've recreated this piece to be Bitcoin-related by adding a coin in his hand and reskinning the skateboard with the BTC logo!  
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:00:40
well said.  I think the same way.  my concern is not knowing when to cash out.  1 Bitcoin at $100K is pretty appeasing.  But you wouldn't want to sell and see it at $1M just a few years later.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:11:03
yep.  it's my artwork.  [here is our original](
  
I just revamped what we had and made it Bitcoin-related.  I am the copyright holder of the piece.
  
It's from our "VIPER" pieces which we released about two years ago (VIPER - Vast Interplanetary Expedition and Research).  I was also working on a comic series last year related to the artwork.  
  
[here's a press article about that series of art, including that piece, in case you'd like proof](
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:41:26
I'm very curious to see where it takes us. I'm not certain if I'm excited for it or concerned; not sure whether the price will plummet or sky rocket.  Or perhaps just stay stable.

I think they're also increasing the transactions on the network to clog things up and make it seem Bitcoin is in a bad position.

I don't know.  I spent the majority of yesterday watching GDAX and I saw some MASSIVE sales going through, 250 coins at a time, one was 334.  I have no idea what's going on, other than what we said might be a coup
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:50:32

Just go to Coin Market Cap and search for the coin you're interested in looking up.  Then click "Markets."  You'll then see where the volume is coming from.  I've noticed that the pump and dumps, with all altcoins, always comes from the Korean exchanges.

what's up everyone!  I was messing around with one of our older pieces of space artwork (I own [LynxArtCollection.com]( ) and wanted to revamp this one to be Bitcoin-related.  Reworked the old design into being this.  Hope you enjoy it.  I'm quite happy with how it came out.

Forget gift cards. Its not just about buying things online.  What about sending money to family or friends outside of your country? You're in US, your family member is in Australia, and it's a Satuday. You need to send $2K.
  
What do you do?
  
Western union limits the amount sent or charges a huge percentage, like 10-15%.
  
Bank transfer? Forget it, will take a week.
  
PayPal? 3% fee, plus another 2-3 days for funds to clear.
  
Bitcoin? Less than 10 minutes, minimal fee. 
  
We just need more adopters so the receiver can then turn around and instantaneously pay some bills or whatever else with the immediate payment.

@_date: 2019-04-25 01:56:12
Understood.  The decimal is quite smaller than the actual dots on the design, however (which are all the same size and not varied), so we didn't see this as an issue.

Lynx Art Collection, in collaboration with our artist Edison Moody, is proud to share with you our most detailed art piece we’ve ever released in the 5-year history of our company.
  
This piece required over 200 hours of time between art details, art direction, sketching, and digital painting. 
  
It is limited to just 40 prints worldwide (of each available size) and 40 canvases (of each available size).
  
[Prints and canvases available here](
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:29:28
Yeah!  You're welcome.  Definitely one of my favorites.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:19:50
Completely nailed it.
  
And you are spot on about the inflation of the dollar.  People always "ohh but it's 2% per year ohh 2%"... no.  I'd venture to say it's even higher than you mentioned, most likely 10-15% per year.  Very scary indeed.
  
Fiat currencies are not designed to last forever.  Many have already disolved due to hyper inflation.
  
USD is a ticking time bomb or rather a ship that's taking on a small leak.  Eventually the ship *will* go under.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:39:48
this might sound crazy, but it's true:  any time these talking heads disagree with someone about what the consumer should purchase or invest in, *you should buy it.*  they're very clearly *against* bitcoin and that proves to me that it's a worthy investment.  
  
See you at $100K in 2 years, Fox! 
  
(and by the way, if we want to talk about bubbles, uhhhh...have we taken a look at GOLD's market cap?  or the average household's DEBT?)

@_date: 2019-04-21 13:12:08
Reason being is the canvases cost us nearly $300 to make.  We use actual wooden frames and hand stretch the canvas around the frame.  Some companies opt for cheap cardboard.  The framing and stretching is a big process.  In addition, we have to take into account packaging, shipping, employee costs, handling, etc.  The remaining amount goes towards the donation.  Normally, that would be our profit, which really isn't too much when the canvas is limited to only 21 in production and will never release again, versus a lot of art out there on multiple large platforms who offer unlimited pieces and sell the same exact thing thousands of times over.
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:55:28
those are just the holograms to affix over the keys you print.  we don't generate any keys.  users can generate their own keys and affix them to the metal wallet if they choose to do so.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:47:07
They actually have a $258M insurance policy.  All customers holding coins in their hot wallets are insured.
  
Don't flame me.  Just sayin'.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:34:40
It looks that way, but it's actually not!  We've sold the same thin line design with x100 .1, x100 .5, and x100 1 BTC wallets with no issues on any of them.  They're quite structurally secure.
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:53:06
That's exactly correct. Just make sure your printed code is placed face down onto the metal.  Otherwise when you peel the hologram the hologram residue will peel the actual key.  Print the key onto paper and then place the key facing down.  After peeling off the hologram, you can flip over the original piece of paper you placed down and it'll be 100% intact.
  
We recommend not printing the QR code itself but rather the actual digits to the key.  (This way it's the size of the hologram)
@_date: 2019-04-07 20:46:11
We plan on doing this for future releases.  We started with this hologram because we wanted to first gauge interest.  Custom Level 2 or 3 holos can be in the range of $2K-$3K which would substantially raise the price of the product.  So we figured we'd start out with some basic holos and, if they are popular, we may do some upgraded Level 2 custom holos for future releases that have entirely different designs.  It's leaning that way.
  
Thanks for the constructive criticism.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:07:10


Nice! :)
@_date: 2019-04-24 18:20:31
unfortunately we don't ever do re-releases, all of the items are limited, I'm sorry.  We may at some point do a completely different design, however.
  
Edit:  downvoted?  "how dare you not make re-releases of limited art!"
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:27:31
The piece is limited to x21 matte prints, x21 metallic prints, x21 canvases, and x21 metal panels.  100% of the profits from the sales are being donated to the WeAreAllHodlonaut Legal Fund.  We estimate approximately $15K in donations if we can sell out of the artwork completely.
  
For those interested you can find it [here on this page](
  
And by the way we happily accept BTC payments, directly on the website. You'll notice the option during checkout when you're entering payment info!
  
By the way here's a GIF of the metal panel medium so you can see how cool the reflection is:

lol we didn't generate any keys.  That's just a sticker.  You print your own keys and then put the hologram over them.  We are not responsible for generating keys for utmost privacy to the customer.
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:59:10
Nope.  We don't generate keys.  It's literally just artwork printed on plastic.  You can generate your own keys and affix them to the art, if desired.

If you had a paper wallet, how would you store it?  Of course fires destroy it.
  
That's like saying "Bitcoin, in case of internet failure it's literally worthless."
  
Or, better yet, "Fiat, in case of a fire it's literally worth the burned cotton value."
  
Store paper wallets and/or any other physically printed keys in fireproof boxes.  Preferably in a fireproof box within a safety deposit box.

Great point.  I'm a big advocate for hardware wallets, but was just noticing the news article regarding their insurance earlier today.  A safer bet for those who are confused about handling private keys is by purchasing GBTC in your brokerage account.

They fees are not for us.  They are for hodlonaut due to the issue of him being sued.  Google it and you'll find all kinds of huge articles about it.
@_date: 2019-04-26 21:25:10
You generate your own keys and then print them out to be smaller than the size of the holograms (standard sheet of paper).  Then place those keys face down on the back of the metal wallet and then peel the holograms and affix them over the paper that you placed face down.
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:22:28
Yes, most likely.  Laughing beached seels are highly sought-after for their rarity and can bring in excess of $3-$4M.  I believe he may have purchased a beached seel during the last bull run.

 “with a close above $319 (July 12, 2015 high) two days later.
The follow-through to that positive trend change was strong and BTC went on to reach an all-time high of $20,000 by December 2017”
  
If this same exact pattern repeats, that puts bitcoin at approximately $330,000 per coin by approximately December 2021.

Bitcoin taking over would not be good for any of Buffett's portfolio positions.  I'd venture to say that's why he doesn't like it.  It's pretty obvious.  He is a huge shareholder of Visa (over 10M shares) as well as several large banking institutions.

Hope you all enjoy these!  I made this version of our cold-storage wallet to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of Bitcoin, January 3rd, 2019.  The wallet is limited to 62, each signed and numbered (the number 62 was determined based on the first two numeric characters of the hash from the Genesis Block).  More than half of the available numbers have already been sold.  [More details here for those interested](
  
*Side note:*  For utmost privacy, we chose not to generate any keys.  Holders of the wallets can generate their own keys and affix them with the provided hologram (affix private key with hologram, affix public key with a small piece of tape).  These are printed on plastic and are the same exact size as a US Currency Note.

Correct.  That's why it clearly states in the article, as well as on page two, that "GRUBS" was created, which is "Global Reserve Units, Bitcoin Standard."  This was done because Bitcoin cannot possibly be valued in USD terms if the USD has collapsed.  It's mentioned on the first page and goes into further detail on the inside of the article.

This is, of course, a fake/mock newspaper I made with fake articles written in the year 2044.
  
You can find more details on the paper or even buy one of the physical copies (they are limited to 200) [here on this page](
  
I also made a [novelty website]( to go along with the paper.

haha, thank you. here's a great step-by-step process to help the "I must hodl forever"
  
1) pay for item with Bitcoin hodling (helps add to the transaction volume, so we're both helping the Bitcoin ecosystem).  
  
2) buy Bitcoin in amount that you just spent, using worthless fiat currency.
  
3) Sit in happiness that you still have Bitcoin *and* some cool art.

Parent here (and artist of the art OP posted).  No clue what the fuss is about; some people are weird.  Our daughter specifically asked to pose with a Bitcoin poster at one point in time, and she's 6.  She loves being a part of the artwork and learning about what BTC can do to contribute to the world. Just yesterday I was reading through my Encyclopedia of Physical Bitcoins and she saw the book and said "Daddy, that's Bitcoin!"

The year is 2022.  As hyperinflation consumes nearly 90% of countries and nearly all banking cartels begin to crumble, the Global Governments align together to begin bailing them out.  Chaos has taken up in the streets across the entire planet.  
  
The United States Marines has split.  Many Soldiers and Commanders have gone rogue and aligned with the Freedom For Humanity platform.  These soldiers have now begun leading the Resistance in overthrowing the Global Governments and Banking Cartels to finally remove their enslavement of mankind.
  
Freedom For Humanity Soldiers are equipped with chemical warfare-resistance gear, an advanced exo-skeleton that offers nearly five times the power and strength of a human without the advanced armor, Night-to-Day switch technology (which allows Night Time to be seen as clear Day), and many other resistance features.  
  
If you'd like a print or canvas of a Freedom For Humanity Soldier, they are limited to just 50 worldwide (only one size available, 24x36 inches).  You can find them [available here](

the people that shout bubble about Bitcoin are not realizing just that - that it's not like a stock of a company but rather a new technology.  It's like saying the internet is a bubble, or microwaves are are a bubble, or ovens are a bubble, or cars are a bubble.  Technologies do not become bubbles.  They eventually get replaced by better technologies, sure.  But this is the technology that will replace the banks (or at least offer some solid competition)
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:09:37
**Sure.  I picked the quotes that meant the most to me and then I put them in what I thought was the best order for them to flow together.  Here you go:**
  
The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.
  
If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry.
  
A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.
  
Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen.  We don't have to worry about a chain of custody of communication.  It doesn't matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself.
  
Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.
Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.
  
The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use.   If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you're associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under.  If you posted under a handle that you haven't associated with your real identity, then you're still pseudonymous.
  
For greater privacy, it's best to use bitcoin addresses only once.
  
Sorry to be a wet blanket.   Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard.   There's nothing to relate it to.
  
With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.
  
The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.  It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.  If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
  
I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.
  
As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation.  0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens.  At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature.
  
As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.  Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.
  
When you generate a new bitcoin address, it only takes disk space on your own computer (like 500 bytes).  It's like generating a new PGP private key, but less CPU intensive because it's ECC.  The address space is effectively unlimited.  It doesn't hurt anyone, so generate all you want.
  
We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.
  
Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.
  
Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge.
  
But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally.  It shows 1.00 but internally it's 1.00000000.  If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places.
  
If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point.  Same amount of money, just different convention for where the ","'s and "."'s go.  e.g. moving the decimal place 3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00.

Posted this on BitcoinTalk and wanted to share the details here as well:  
  
Hello everyone!  
  
I’m Frank, owner of [LynxArtCollection.com](  
  
I’m so very excited to share with you our newest crypto art.  This new piece features the ‘Bitcoin Guy’ heading to the moon VS a ‘Fiat Guy’ (our own creation!) going into the center of the Earth and burning up.  The total worldwide distribution of this print is limited to 100.  
  
We’ve been in business for a little over five years now, focusing on pop culture, science, space, and history artwork.  We’ve just gotten into making new art prints for crypto and this one has got me especially excited.  It’s funny, it’s an awesome conversation piece, and it’s the core of what we all believe.  
  
Here’s what it looks like!  
  
All prints are printed on a beautiful 100 lb polar white photo paper.  This is a very thick cardstock and feels much thicker than the average paper used for prints.  It displays colors very vividly and crisply.  All prints are 100-year archival.  
  
All canvases are mounted and framed with a .75” gallery wrap, all handcrafted right here in our lovely city of Saint Augustine, Florida (our prints are printed here, too!)  
  
The available sizes and mediums are as follows (plus shipping):  
  
Poster Print -  
11x17:  $19.95   
18x24:  $29.95  
24x36:  $39.95  
  
(plus $6 shipping domestic or $20 shipping international)  
  
Mounted Gallery-Wrapped .75” Canvases-  
16”x20”:  $169.95  
18:”x24”:  $189.96  
24”x36”:  $269.95  
  
above prices include $20 in shipping.  
(plus $6 shipping our checkout system will charge you.  If you are international and trying to order canvas PLEASE contact us first so we can quote you a shipping price)  
  
We DO accept BTC as a form of payment.  You can easily pay with BTC by taking a screenshot of your order from the checkout page and then e-mailing the order to us at:  info (a) lynxartcollection.com   We will then promptly reply to you with our BTC wallet address.  
  
Link for purchasing:    
  
If you’d like to check out our 500+ reviews, please check here:  
  
  
You can also read some of our Press articles.  We’ve been featured on DailyMail, Nerdist, All About Space magazine, Discovery Channel, and many others.  Those articles can be found here:  
  
  
Please allow 5-7 business days for your print or canvas order to ship.  Some orders may ship much quicker, but please do allow at least one week for us to process the orders.  We are a husband and wife team and will work as best as we can to ship within that timeframe.  
  
I hope you enjoy this piece just as much as we do.  The more we all both transact in BTC as well as offer new BTC collectibles, the more adoption we will continue to have as a community.  And of course, our website does allow checkout via any major credit card.
If you have any questions or would like to put in an order, please e-mail us or feel free to shoot me a message.  I’d be happy to answer any questions.
Best to you all and of course, TO THE MOON!

For those interested, it is available as both a print and canvas, limited to 50, [found here on this page](
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:12:23
I think a lot of people appreciate the acceptance of Bitcoin.  And lots of people want Bitcoin to grow.  When we use the network and transact in Bitcoin, it only helps Bitcoin's further adoption rate.
  
Furthermore, I think it's also a combination of us starting to make Bitcoin and crypto-related artworks.  Prior to these, we were focused on Space, Science, History, and Travel, and were dedicated to those categories for the last six years.  So it's fresh, new art combined with adoption.
  
Just my personal take.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:04:14
Transfer bitcoin to us &gt; replace your bitcoin stash with worthless fiat. ;)  we are working on a bitcoin guy going to the moon and on the same piece of art, a fiat guy crashing into lava lol. Really excited to post it here when finished.

nope.  I don't use any type of software, filters, etc.  I go through letter-by-letter to adjust their colors.

@_date: 2018-07-14 16:14:31
You do realize that us accepting Bitcoin and continuing to make Bitcoin-related artworks is the epitome of contributing to the Bitcoin community, right?  It helps adoption of Bitcoin - helps spread the message.  
  
I recommend building something yourself.  Whether that's coding or making an art piece.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:43:38
yeah!  very excited to be part of the transactions going through on the network.  more transactions and more people spending with BTC means it's always better for us.  hope more companies will make the same move.
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:53:10

Why are you here?
  
From your comment history, you clearly hate Bitcoin:
  
*"I prefer to let the bank keep my money safe and get reimbursed for fraudulent actions. Bitcoin had several double spends in 2013, so secure....All it requires is one remote exploit in the OS and your money is gone, everything."*
  
So, I ask again, why are you here?

sounds like Gold was set up intentionally to take BTC from unsuspecting buyers.  That is startling.

It's a common tactic, especially from people lurking around here that are truly foaming at the mouth about Bitcoin.
  
When the person does not have much of an arguement, they can attempt to get the person they are debating to derail by telling them they are 'angry, hostile, or that they "need to chill out" (even if the person they are attacking is responding in a completely normal tone or language).
  
It's a psychological attack tactic.

Look, mate. You’re not going to get me to stop making new Bitcoin art and sharing it with the Bitcoin community. If anything it gives me energy to want to make a piece specifically about you and your negativity, and perhaps I will �� After all, that's why I made the "No Coiner" art piece; someone else gave me the energy for that.

I’m all for the cash app and what Jack has done, but in reality the cash app price is still higher, I believe 1.5% or sightless more. The best option is Coinbase Pro. Pro.coinbase.com and you can place a limit order or buy right at the current ask with no fees.

Not sure what that means.  People are welcome to spend their Bitcoin on our artwork or whatever else they'd like to spend it on (i.e. Overstock).  There's nothing illegal about accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.  We happily pay all of our taxes; I have nothing to fear from your out-of-place comment.

But.  In reality.
  
It's actually quite possible, judging from what the last bull run did.  $300 or so to $20K?  That means if we did the same percentage jump we'd be around ... *chokes*... $190K

It's hard to say.  Bitcoin has never been through a financial collapse.  However, it was created from the ashes of one.  It started at fractions of a penny and ended up to where it is today.  People in 2009 were also limited in investment ability and somehow they still bought into the idea of Bitcoin and took it from nearly zero to where it is now.
  
I see both sides, honestly.  But I do think it would act as a hedge to any economic meltdown.
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:16:30

They wouldn't have had signs running all along the escalator guardrails at consensus that said "virtual currency is coming to ebay" if it wasn't happening.  They're definitely doing it.  They said last December it was coming but that it wasn't "quite ready yet."  It's coming.  And once they do this (just like Square did), and prove that they've gotten orders in BTC and have X amount of profits from it, guess who will follow suit just to keep up?  Amazon.  This is exactly how we get mass adoption.

A) They have no clue what they are talking about
  
  
B) They're intentionally trying to scare off retail buyers.
  
Bitcoin is going up because Bakkt announced futures launching in July.  Bitcoin is going up because ebay showcased that 'virtual currencies are coming' soon (at consensus).  Bitcoin is going up because Fidelity is opening up Bitcoin trading to institutional investors, 47% of which said they had interest in buying BTC.
  
Oh, and volume.
  
No volume?
  
It had the highest trading volume it's *ever had in the history of Bitcoin* the other day.

Ruined gains over what time period? Bear markets have lasted several years on end for Bitcoin. Yes, someone who bought last December is at a loss. It’s hard for me to think that will still be a loss come 2022-2024. Bitcoin also ruined gained when people bought at $100 and sold at $13 ��

Oh also.  If you send a check but you need to cancel it.  There's a stop payment charge of $30.

Yep, exactly.  If USD collapsed tomorrow, I agree, BTC would not be ready.  It would not be able to handle all of the transactions.  But work is constantly being done, especially with layers such as Lightning.  I can see it being possible in 10-20 years.  Same as how with the internet in 1990, we couldn't watch videos.  Now that's the majority of people's time spent on the internet.
  
From transacting with cows, to seashells, to silver and gold, to fiat currencies, to ... Bitcoin?  It's definitely possible.  Most certainly, in my opinion!  And if we talk tech, looks at just how many people are staring at their phones all day?  It seems to only make sense to use that same device to scan and pay for an item rather than pulling out your wallet and using a card.  Of course we do have 'apple pay.'  But more and more people will start to realize that there is no middleman involved in BTC.  Fees are extremely cheap, and there's no worries about "overdraft fees", "maintenance fees", "bank runs", etc.

yield curve inverted. this is a significant sign.  In addition most cycles operate in 5-10 or even 10-15 year cycles.  All markets move in cycles.  See - Bitcoin.  Bull market, then bear market, now upcoming bull market.  Stocks have had their bull market phase.  Bear market will come, eventually.  Typically once the yield curve inverts, it's about 1 more year until the market flushes.  So I'd say by the end of next year, markets will have tanked.  And that's fine, they'll go up again (within 10 years after the flush.  Example being the 2008 flush and now everything is fine again.  Or the 2000 flush and everything was fine again around 2006) - but probably not the best time to invest for longterm holdings right now.  I'd keep 'dry powder' on the sidelines and scoop up when everyone is truly panic selling - I'm talking when it's a 50% correction.  We also have to take into consideration the November 2020 election.  If Trump is *not* re-elected, believe it or not, the market will dump.

Oh, those people?  Those are the ones who will be piling in at $50K realizing that they missed out.  They'll hold when we hit $100K and think that they're suddenly geniuses.  The price will then tumble to $20K, they'll be salty, and sell for a loss.  They'll then go on to proclaim that Bitcoin is dead (again) and that it's a waste of time and investment.
  
...Years later it will pump past $100K and people with the same mindset will follow the same pattern.
