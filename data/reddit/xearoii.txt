Sounds good for small business, but what about the big dogs? They aren't paying retail bank fees like us. When Pepsi pays a supplier they aren't hurting from fees.

We (you, me, anyone else) don't know the chance of profit. Definitely don't invest all your savings. I'd do maybe 2-5% if you really want to get your feet wet.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:39:26
True lol
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:45:16


Not really, no
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:30:30
But credit cards offer 100% fraud liability (i.e. someone steals my identity, or # and I get refunded) and charge back if vendor scams or sends wrong item.
Bitcoin offers 0% fraud liability, or charge back. 
The fees suck but damn if you need them they are quite nice. They also incentive sellers to provide what they state they are selling as the buyer has a charge back ability, and dispute ability.

Why would you pay current btc value. Makes zero sense
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:39:28
Bitcoin isn't a foreign currency. Do you have any case law to cite to prove if a contract paid in BTC at $100/BTC would be enforced at $1k/BTC if they didn't follow through with the contract and the value of BTC fluctuated?
At point A he is paid $50k value in BTC. At point B it is worth $1.2m value in BTC. Why would a contract be enforceable based upon a 20x fluctuation and not at the original paid out value?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:37:46
Wtf damn. Thought it was anti PayPal and big banks etc
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:06:08
There is no way contract law would require him to pay back millions instead of $50k

Yeah, I know what fluctuates means. If I do my business in BTC and it fluctuates up in value, now my cost to acquire goods increases. It hurts both ways.

Yes, great idea. You should probably take this very niche market and offer it to a niche payment!

Is there any other market that has this forced downward pressure on the price of a particular asset/currency? I thought Bitcoin is deflationary in nature; thus, there is forced upward pressure on the price? 
Even if the supply constricts and there are no others created, isn't it still inflationary in nature if hundreds of thousands, or soon millions of dollars of BTC need to be purchased to keep the network/miners running?

Any more info on this 14 day record that's really neat
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:49:10
How does that help ecosystem? 
Typical purchase...
+1 BTC to Merchant
-1 BTC to you
+1 BTC to your rebuy
-1 BTC to Merchant cash out
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:55:31
But they lose money holding it as well? If it fluctuates 10-15% in the course of 1 day - 1 month then I lose my entire profit margin.
If a merchant gives 10% off then that is most likely an incentive that was already priced in to their product. Typical debit/credit transactions aren't more than 3% anyways.

Quotes from that post are hilarious...
"I hope they are not keeping people's exchange accounts under one address."
"And I hope they aren't going around spending people's exchange account bitcoins!
My hope is that the 440k bitcoins are revenues generated from commissions and they are slowly divesting them into dollars (or some other currency.) But it seems crazy to me that they would hold onto that many coins in one wallet, and also it seems crazy that they could earn 440k bitcoins just in commissions! There are ~7.8M bitcoins in existence now; it is scary that a single entity could hold more than 5% of all bitcoins."
