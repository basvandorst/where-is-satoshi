Fork of bitcoin. If you held bitcoin during the fork then you already have some.

Easiest way I found is to install Coinomi wallet, add Bitcoin Cash coin with your private key and lo and behold there it is. They have access to Changely from the app if you want to exchange it for bitcoin or ether or something.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:55:57
It's nothing to do with your bitcoin. It just uses the same technology so if you have a private key with some bitcoin in at the time of the fork, immediately after the fork your would still have your bitcoin but also then have some bitcoin cash too.
You do not need to move your bitcoin. You just need to use your private key to get access to the bitcoin cash.

Also the speaker placement is a bit dumb: I keep covering it with my finger when playing games. They should swap the mic and speaker.

The London Olympics really highlighted to me the risks of allowing a large company to control money: they can, at a whim, impose limitations on its use or sting you if you want to do something but happen to be a customer of a competitor. These organisations are effectively acting as an oligopoly in milking the populous via disloyalty fees in one shape or another.
Both commercial and government factions alike seem to be trying to push us away from cash and onto these electronic payments despite the risks of exploitation and the massive loss to privacy. Everything you buy on your credit or debit card is recorded and visible to both your bank and the card issuer (Visa/Mastercard/AE). This means that you could end up associated with criminals even if you thought you were trading with a bonafide business.
The beauty of cryptocurrencies is that it takes away the need for a central authority at all. It is controlled by both nobody and everybody. Amusingly it's actually *more* transparent in that all of the transactions are completely visible to everybody, although somewhat anonymous in that extra information would be needed to tie the addresses to the people involved.
The biggest worry for me with these crytocurrencies is crime. What if I end up, unwittingly, receiving a payment that is later proven to be stolen money:
    A → B → C ... Z → me
If party B has stolen coins from party A and then paid them on, in a legitimate transaction to party C and eventually they end up with me (again in a legitimate transaction), could not the authorities not seize cash from me if the criminal is eventually caught? This is something that rarely happens with cash due to the serial numbers not being recorded during every transaction.

Doesn't mean that the buy and sell rates have to be the same. Just like foreign exchange, some places charge a fee whilst others use the spread between the bid and offer prices.

So feel free to invest.

I'm saying that the Olympic tickets could only be bought with a Visa card because they were a sponsor. Public money built that stadium so it's even more infuriating. The selling of only particular products inside I can deal with but the tickets? Is not on.

Could you not keep a copy of the private keys? And tell the recipient to transfer to their own address?

Sorry, you see the Chinese decree as an attack not a positive? So you're saying that's because they consider it a commodity (like gold or silver) rather than a currency. Does that effectively outlaw its use as a currency then?
Edit: I've just [read this]( It does, indeed, seem like they've outlawed its use for purchases and therefore limited its legal status dramatically. I would definitely expect that to lead to Chinese speculators selling off.
Maybe my wish for a price correction will come true then!
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:13:44


Why would this create a top? Surely its legal status would cause more speculators to buy, no?


What promise? Are you suggesting the rise was due to the the foresight of it being legalised in China?


What do you mean by this? You want to see the effect on prices when a large country declares the current illegal?
