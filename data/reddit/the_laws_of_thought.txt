The binaries are downloaded via sourceforge, which is over HTTPS.  Keepass.info is informational only.  Not sure if it really needs to be HTTPS.
I am not sure about the binary array issue, that is beyond my paygrade. :-)
I have been using Keepass for many years now, and haven't had any issue using it, nor any breaches in my own security (knock on wood).  KeepassX is also an option though for people.
You do bring up good points though, unfortunately, everybody needs to do their own due diligence in the arena of personal OpSec.  Research is wise.  
The code is all open source though, and as a non-programmer, I am putting my trust in the idea of open source--that hopefully some group of people are looking at the code for security flaws.

The problem getting **into** cryptocurrency from fiat is that most if not all payment methods besides cash are reversible.  The cryptocurrency community by-and-large understands this fairly well now.  
The only ways around this are using cash, or trading with people who are a known quantity, i.e. reputation system.
That said, I still think BitSquare (name soon to change) is the best exchange on the planet at the moment.

I second KeePass.  Avoid "online" or "cloud" based password managers.

It doesn't matter to me anyway.  Bitcoin is better off without an ETF imo.  Bitcoin is traded 24/7 worldwide. (i.e. not just the U.S.)  Piddly pukes in suits can scratch out a living in the hen house of dirt and scraps that is Wallstreet.  Fuck them.

The SEC works for Wallstreet.  Why would they let Bitcoin into their club?
