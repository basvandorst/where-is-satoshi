Calm down everyone knows it has not succeeded yet nor has it failed.

One step at a time. You cannot really expect these businesses to hold such a volatile, new currency. If more people/companies/charities continue to join the bandwagon, eventually everyone will accept bitcoin. That is when 'cashing out' will recede.

I have a portion of savings in bitcoin that I consider exchanging back now and then. It would be at a 30% loss at this point. 
I regularly question the centralization of mining and bitcoins ability to scale up and keep transactions cheap. There is also the threat of multiple governments cracking down on the free market that currently exists around cryptocurrency. While this will not kill bitcoin, it will have a strong effect on the price. 
These are definite threats, but I believe in open source technology. These threats also create a high risk/reward investment; so I will either be a bag holder or see a nice return in a few years.

The comments here only show how hilariously accurate this comic is.

This is exactly it. Maybe wall street has not jumped in, but there are many deep pocketed traders owning the market right now. People on this sub discount technical analysis, but it becomes self fulfilling.

I think most people here are hopeful for a future where many people use bitcoin as an electronic cash. 
If the majority of people use it, the uses are endless. As one of the other commenters said, pay anyone, anywhere, anytime. The usefulness of cash with increased security, portability, and divisibility.

I would say "just use it". Accept it, buy goods, and donate to charities that accept it.

I have made two purchases from you guys, best green tea I have ever had. I am looking forward to trying the macha that I ordered during your promotion.
I was unaware of your belief in bitcoin; now my purchases are even more satisfying.

There is not much demand beyond speculation in the bitcoin space right now. Holders and traders are speculating while those using the protocol are mostly exchanging for other currency. If the majority of traders think we need to test the bottom again, it will be so.
