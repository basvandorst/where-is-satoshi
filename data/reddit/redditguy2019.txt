The misinformation of this post is ridiculous.
Since yesterday someone is spamming **a lot** of 0-4 sat/b fee transactions.
Anything above 4 sat/b is cleared instantly.

Would Bitcoin mixing (is this the correct term?) not cover their tracks, at least partially?
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:59:35
He is right though.
Making a clowns of ourselfs to make bcash look bad... it just makes us look stupid.
We are better than that.

Can you stop with the autistic screeching already.
REEREEEEEE MUUH BITCOIN FAK SKAMER VERRRRRRRR REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Everyone on this sub already knows that. It is as redundant as saying 1700x is faster than 1600 on amd sub for example.
Thus I called it screeching. It is pointless and it is desperate.
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:57:47
**Screeching facts is still screeching**. The information content of this 'infographic' could be surmised by listing the 3 sources that refer to BTC as Bitcoin Core, and saying all other sources use the proper name.

I reckon it's fear personally. See he resorts to spamming "Put your money where your mouth is." multiple times? They can't really figure out what's going on, but they're trapped. They are looking for any validation they can find, because they lack the cajones to stand on their own. Yelling from the sidelines. Getting more and more bitter.

I see a mentally disabled reddit user who cannot debate in a civilised manner or even read with comprehension.

To be honest, if bitcoin were to rebrand, there would be no way it would go back to the top. There are so many altcoins with better design but lacking brand power, like xmr or even eth.

lol. My bitcoin says otherwise. You're the one squealing from the sidelines dude.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:24:40
You will not hear unbiased opinions and especially not in here. Both subreddits have fanatic mentalities and will call you a troll if you disagree with them in the slightest. You are better off googling for some reliable sources in this matter.

Wow you understand now? 
I am a hodler, I just made an assumption for argumentative purposes. I was trying to explain it to you but apparently refused to read/understand what I said.

Clearly you are not strong in your reading comprehension.

If a currency is susceptible to such trivial attacks then maybe the fault lies in core design of that currency?

I smell a thought crime ban incoming.

Read what I said carefully. Reading it slowly and underlining key terms will help.
I never stated that this is my opinion. I made an assumption for argumentative purposes to prove what you are saying was inconsistent.
It is all very clearly written, you just have to read it and then process it with your brain. The second part is the important one.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:46:06
Even if bitcoin was a ponzi scheme why would anyone short it while there are still people pouring their life savings into it, thus increasing the price.


Is just a stupid thing to say. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:54:03
That is fear talk. Clearly you are not strong in your convictions.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:47:37
Hahaha, Put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:27:20
OK, my mouth is that it is a ponzi scheme and I put $1000000 on long bitcoin because I think it will have enough new fuel (new people coming in and pouring more money) to account for another 6 months of price raise before it crashed to $0. I plan to cash out with big profit in 6 months before it crashes, this making money from newcomers to this ponzi scheme.
Now see the argument?
It is possible to think it is a ponzi scheme and still long bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:03:57
You do not necessarily need bitcoin to do that. You can already do it with a MasterCard/Visa card.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:06:22
I cannot find the exact article I was reading, but I added two articles which have similar findings.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:39:12
You would need at least 10 words (assuming 170000 english words in use) to cover all 2^160 addresses.
I would rather stick to standard bitcoin address format.

I know right, and people say voodoo dolls don't work. I hit 95% accuracy with them.
I hope I do not end up like Giordano Bruno.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:10:36
Nice which craft.
I personally use voodoo dolls to predict and understand trends and prices. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:13:37
Assume your voodoo has predictive edge over randomness (market is inefficient).
It means you can use this edge to make money.
It also means that if you share it to the public, the public will want to make money off this edge, correcting the price to an efficient level, thus dissolving that edge.
Now you no longer have any edge - no predictability.
**Assuming** that you can get any edge over billions of dollars computing power and teams of professional traders in the first place. Which is a hugely bold assumption.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:03:10
Are there really people who still believe in technical analysis despite overwhelming lack of scientific proof that it works better than random guesses?
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:37:16
This is getting ridiculous.
Why are people treating bitcoin as an object of cult? It could possibly yield to (not yet discovered) superior digital currency system. It could be made illegal in your country. There are multiple things that can go wrong.
Seriously, stop brainwashing people into thinking that that bitcoin will and absolutely must rise to astronomical prices.
