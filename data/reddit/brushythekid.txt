Go to 100 stores/bars/restaurants/etc with a phone and Bitcoin 
Go to same 100 stores with a brick of gold. 
Tell me how that works for you.

Its because everyone in Bitcoin or most are so young and impatient they've never experienced real investing and the long term game. 
If you understand Bitcoin, blockchain and crypto in general and believe its going to impact the future as much as it will then you buy and hold and wait for the world to catch up... or you think its BS and you dont buy... all these other young idiots (90%+) that dont know a thing about investing just keep talking about companies and what they think they are going to do based on nothing more then a thought in their head. Lol 
Its weird.

Yeah a lot of those people that popped up like that were a lot of the ones who were in BTC pre 2016.. unemployed could easily be replaced with retired some of the time

Yep, yet that .1% was enough market value and industry upheaval to create new and lucrative job opportunities for the other 99.9% that were still busy learning the necessary skills and technology while failing in their attempt

Or.. “I’ve worked a decade in X Industry and now I see the potential of Blockchain” ... Do I start a company? Eh... Do I invest? Eh... Can I find a sweet ass project and offer my expertise in my field in an effort to get in the Blockchain ecosystem while learning how the tech works and getting to meet other projects? That seems cool.

I sold 80% of my holdings in 2016 happy as fuck and still have more than 97% of people around here.. if it's 100k tomorrow then I'd be a rich happy mother fucker. 
However, I was speaking to the 90-95% of the community that only got in around ~2017 and then trapped in this weird echo chamber of crypto bullshitters and unemployed Twitter avatars with their negative based view points praising crypto as this miricle that's going to save them... Because they went from broke ass idiots to having their first 100k cause they caught a shitcoin lmao 
It'll take time. Bitcoin is the only truly valuable asset to come from crypto thus far... And It's not flipping the US government anytime soon. Haha just grab some coin chill.. and hope we get some truly different Zuckerberg/musk/bezos type mother fucker involved. CZ and Vitalik are great but we are so incredibly early most people don't realize what they could actually do in crypto if they started to look past "BULL RUN COMING 2019" Ohhh "BULL RUN COMING Late 2020!!" 
Have you gone to a crypto conference before?
Lmao the people there are borderline flat earthers. Fake ass crowds of losers who act rich and have 500 credit scores and had their parents buy their tickets

It’s 2025... the US economy has taken a slight downturn but we realize the obnoxious amount of stuff that actually goes right on a day in and day out basis to make the economy continue to work.... 
The world still hasn’t reached economic collapse... people realize there’s always been a doom and gloom group of people.. 
The majority of crypto projects have failed, some still remain, CZ is still running it, Vitalik is still the clear head builder, Bitcoin is still obviously king...
It’s at $6200 still bouncing around....
All the loser kids that were unemployed in 2017 realize how sucked up into this sub culture they let themselves fall... 
Get a grasp on mother fucking TIME. 
If you arent actively BUILDING SOMETHING USEFUL in crypto then GET THE FUCK OUT, STOP TALKING ABOUT PRICE, AND GET THE FUCK ON WITH YOUR LIFE. 
The timeline on all this shit is way longer than any of you kids that witnessed 2017 understand.

Simple issue of Privacy vs Secrecy. What do you want? 
Common mistake by the majority of folks that don't really look into the way the current system works. It's outlined simply in the original Cypherpunk Manifesto. 
“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A Private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” 
It goes onto give simple examples as well....
“When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees …….. Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.”
When you travel across the country and pay the gas station in cash... you remain "anonymous" If you use Paypal, Mastercard, or Visa... you are being traced, dotted, and watched the entire way. Does the gas station attendant really need your name and address?

We are still establishing the store of value long term. Gold is a $7 Trillion industry and no one spends it like that. 
Let bitcoin establish value longer and let the development get better then it will be more like Gold that you can spend like cash as well.
Right now the only way you can pay for anything (like Gas at a gas station) and remain anonymous is with cash. If you pay with a card you are telling them gas station who you are etc.. is that needed? 
Patience is key. The bulk of people that remain aren’t spending because they see a future where every Satoshi counts.

Spending bitcoin isn’t “contributing to the bitcoin economy” if you think mass adoption is everyone spending bitcoin all over the place you are wrong. Spending is the exact same as selling, even worse actually, as you are trading the future monetary standard for what? A bag of Doritos and an iced tea? 
That’s the entire point of bitcoin. By holding it you are putting faith in the fact that it’s deflationary and not inflationary like the USD that’s increased supply by 6.2% this year alone. 
You are taking complete control over your financial goals which involves NOT SPENDING BTC OR $$ on useless shit at all period. 
Bitcoin is a 50-80 year project. Changing the global monetary system as we know it doesn’t happen over night. “Mass Adoption” as people want to invision isn’t a goal for the next decade.

The blockchain is still being developed. That scaling issue will be solved, you get this right? The energy point is completely wrong. 
I’m sure your TV is set to CNN at all times buddy
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:25:39
Let’s just say the fact that you are even aware of bitcoin and on a bitcoin forum in 2018 all but guarantees your adoption by 2023. 
There is still such a small amount of people aware of bitcoin. Time is biggest factor at play. 
All these kids throwing memes around and thinking they understand Technical Analysis and day trading are just unfortunate casualties along the way

Again those energy numbers are missing a ton of factors. And are just as “scary” when looking at pretty much any industry. That’s a change that’s happening globally as well. The majority of new facilities are being powered alternatively. 
Takes a lot of power to secure the largest computer network ever conceived while changing the way the world looks at money. 
Have you added up all the power being used in the current “money” system? Wouldn’t even know where to start calculating

Do you know how the dollar works, even a little? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:33:22
Bitcoin is a $100b ish market cap. Gold is $7.7T market cap and NO ONE USES IT. 
Spending bitcoin is one very small layer to the overall goal. Using bitcoin at stores and restaurants is the items inside the boxes, inside the crate, on the ship. 
Bitcoin is the ship, crates, boxes, and the captain all in one. We’ll get to the packages being sent in time. But for now it’s effect on the overall scope of what’s happening, is minimal

No one who really knows what’s happening with Bitcoin are arguing for Bitcoin mass adoption yet either, we are still slowly proving it to be a reliable store of wealth globally. 
Only uneducated lazy fucks on this forum that came in 2017 thinking they’d get rich.

How many transactions do you make in gold each day? It’s a $7.7 trillion dollar cap you get this right? 
Bitcoin isn’t about tons of daily transactions, and won’t be for a decade or two. 
 The US dollar increased its supply (decreased your worth by 6.2% this year alone) and since we went off the gold standard that’s only getting worse. 
Poor people are getting crushed by the dollar while high earners are forced to become investment bankers on the side JUST TO PRESERVE THEIR WEALTH, NOT GROW IT, JUST PRESERVE IT. If you make more USD then you spend you are forced to buy real estate, bonds, stocks, anything other than keeping dollars. 
The need for a highly deflationary store of wealth is only growing globally as more and more state backed currencies fail to preserve the wealth of their residents 
Do you know countries still settle large debts using Gold and ships? It takes months and costs tens of millions of dollars to transfer that wealth. 
The Information Age is way beyond ships filled with gold bars my man. People just don’t change overnight. Bitcoin is an 80 year old project that got a completely wrong reputation because of the 2017 bullshit hype 
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:30:34
Not arguing for it tomorrow. The majority still seems to think making it “usable” is where current development it at. That is very wrong. We are still establishing a store of wealth. 
Are we ahead of schedule? It appears to be so 
When “mass adoption” happens it will be decades from now. Only the large multiple bitcoin transactions will take place on the main Blockchain we use now. Most micro transactions will take place on parallel Blockchains utilizing satoshis and added in bulk into the primary Blockchain. 
Understand how incredibly insignificant a decade is in this scheme of things.
