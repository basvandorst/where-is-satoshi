Fees are paid to miners, which are only a subset of the people who have to store the blockchain. As someone who doesn't mine, I strongly oppose helping people store arbitrary data into the blockchain.

Mmm, the fee estimator is usually quite robust to variance. I've been observing it for months and never saw anything like this.
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:47:14
Thanks, that's very informative. Should that have as large an impact on tx fees though?

No. Unless you have free electricity and a lot of capital.

Note that setting maxmempool to 2MB will limit it so much that your node probably won't be useful for anything anymore. I think clients count mempool overhead in that number, so it isn't directly comparable to "mempool size" are reported by most websites. For example, mempool usage on my node is currently 165MB+ and that's only because I limit maxmempool to 200MB.
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:45:47
Could you add a third chart with total fees in the mempool? I find that a better congestion metric than transaction count, as it accounts better for low fee transactions (counts them less)
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:08:04


I agree. I guess I'm just trying to say, don't give this number more importance than it really has. It's not real money, at least not entirely.
@_date: 2016-06-15 12:20:00
I use that site often, but it doesn't show this information.
@_date: 2016-06-15 09:46:50
Oh, this is really useful! Any chance you (or someone else) could put that up live on a website?
@_date: 2016-06-07 09:56:00
Of course they say that. They hold a large number of bitcoins, they're not gonna say they suck. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:19:51
This number isn't really meaningful, because if some started selling in real volume, the market would crash instantly. So suppose you held 20% of bitcoins in circulation, there's simply no way you'd be able to sell them for 2 billion dollars.
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:05:35
Thanks, TIL. My point about transaction fees still stands, though. The peak we're seeing is very real.
@_date: 2016-06-15 12:20:51
Really cool! Thanks!
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:59:36
I *think* what you're seeing is counting mempool data structure overhead, whereas websites are showing total transaction size, which is of course lower.
If you don't believe the current peak is real, check  for example. Yesterday, the total fees in the mempool were up to 11BTC, pretty close from an all time high as far as I can remember. You can dismiss this as spam if you want, but to me, 11BTC means an awful lot of people willing to pay to get their transaction on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-06-16 08:01:30
Could you add total tx fees in the mempool? That's a better metric than # of transactions, as it weighs low-fee transactions accordingly. That avoids the tired debate of spam vs. non-spam transactions.
Edit: another minor feature request: could you add one of these metric to the page title? That would allow monitoring the mempool without even opening the tab (example: [this site]( does it for the exchange rate).
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:31:14
Currently 14BTC worth of fees in the queue...

@_date: 2016-12-03 09:15:50


Do you have any evidence that these actually exist and represent a significant portion of bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2016-12-11 12:19:48

It's nice to see this influx of bitcoin articles in non-bitcoin media.
@_date: 2012-08-31 07:20:50
No, I'm saying that the bitcoin chain can only handle a finite number of transactions per block, and as the user base grows, people will compete to get their transactions in a block. Thus miners will start looking for transactions fees and small transactions will become prohibitively expensive (a large transaction takes no more effort to process than a small one, therefore they should have similar fees).
@_date: 2012-09-18 09:21:04
I just copy it to a few machines I own. I trust the wallet encryption system. Alttough if I had more bitcoins, I'd add an additional layer of gpg symmetrical encryption to hide the number of bitcoins and my public adresses.
@_date: 2012-10-01 18:25:52

I've tested it and it works pretty well (even if building it was kind of a pain on my linux system). I just made .06 btc out of it :)
@_date: 2010-12-19 09:52:36
Yes and no. I wouldn't use the bitcoin system to store large amounts of value, because of potential security holes that may or may not be related to quantum computing.
But I don't think it changes anything to the attractiveness of the system to handle small payments on the internet without relying on a single company such as paypal.

Just announce that the next 50 accounts or so will get 100mBTC free credit on bitcoin talk, and do some simple security checks like making sure every IP address is used only once. It doesn't matter if a few people cheat, because you already know in advance how much you're giving away.

There's no "rush to physical assets" in Germany. The vast majority of people are still very confident in the euro. I agree that too much inflation will cause what you describe, but there is a sweet sport that stimulates the economy.
In any case a fiat currency like the euro isn't supposed to be a store of value, but a mean of exchange.
@_date: 2012-01-17 12:46:20

@_date: 2012-09-02 07:55:24
I know this isn't going to be popular here, but inflation can be the right choice to mitigate a large crisis some times. For instance, in Greece, there is a necessity to lower the wages of pretty much everybody. Doing this directly is almost impossible without a revolution. Inflation while freezing wages is a much better way to accomplish the same thing.
@_date: 2012-09-11 15:13:48
How many active ones?
@_date: 2012-09-02 11:35:51
I think the main reason is that since the currency loses value, it gives a strong incentive to invest.
@_date: 2012-11-06 11:48:25
Any computer could serve for that purpose, as long as it's not connected to the network.
@_date: 2012-09-05 07:19:44
Promote it more, so it can become usable!
I have a question: what do you do when there are no good answers? In my opinion, the questions should expire after a week or so, and the money should still go to the answerers, but the asker should have the option to split the money between several answers.
Knowing that the money will go for sure to the answerers after a reasonable delay should motivate people to answer questions.
In any case your strategy for the time being should be to maximize traffic and the number of answers, at all costs.
@_date: 2012-09-09 09:07:47
How can you not be convinced bitcoin is a scam when the way it's presented to you is "Virtual money created by CPU cycles"?

Also I think questions should be time limited, maybe to one week, at least by default. This would create some sense of urgency, and garantee timely compensation to the answerers.
In any case I'll try to ask a question when I have one :)
@_date: 2012-09-06 13:25:48
You can ask questions for free on this site as well. The difference is that if you REALLY want an answer, you can put a real bounty on it.

I'm pretty sure it would show up as a lot of little circles, as the program shows one circle per trade. But I don't know how Mt Gox generates their data, so I can't know for sure.
As I said elsewhere, some way of grouping similar transactions would probably nice, but it would be difficult to do without losing too much info.

Of course it isn't, it's still in its very early phases of development. But the failure of one exchange doesn't mean the failure of bitcoin: we still haven't seen any holes in the protocol itself.
@_date: 2011-02-22 20:12:54
This is why we should not (yet) use bitcoins for storing all our money, but rather use them for business. If you don't hold too many bitcoins, you don't have much to lose from a crash. You don't need a lot of bitcoins to start doing business.

You can have as many levels of indirection as you want, it doesn't change the simple fact that if there is a single exploit in the bitcoin client, you can lose all your stash. I wouldn't trust 250,000$ on it.
You can downmod me all you want, some day a guy will post a "how I lost my 20,000BTC because of an off-by-one bug in the client" on the forum, and everybody will suddenly call him stupid for having trusted so much money on beta software.
As a side note, setting up securely a "matryoshka of three FreeBSD virtual machines and five TrueCrypt partitions running on a dedicated computer behind fifteen firewalls" does *not* take "an afternoon's tinkering away".

It's a graph of density of USD/Bitcoin transactions at certain exchange prices. It tries to be less misleading than other ways of plotting the exchange rates.
@_date: 2011-04-20 18:20:58
I don't think so.
The hypothesis is as follows: mining becomes highly concentrated. Suddenly, a majority of miners (but a minority of *users*) decides to change the rules.
Other people will simply start rejecting their blocks. Mining good blocks will simply become a lot simplet, and business will procede as usual.

You could get hacked in five minutes. Your IP is published on the bitcoin network, a well-prepared attacker with an unknown exploit only needs a few seconds. I'm not saying that this is going to happen, just that adding three layers of encryption and fifteen firewalls doesn't make your setup bulletproof.

I think they're called heatmaps, but I actually have no idea :) I came up with the idea myself, even though it's probably a very common one.

In the interest of market transparency, I think it's important for everyone to be able to understand as much as possible what's going on in the currency exchanges. 
In contrast with traditional charts, this one shows the volume of each trade (the area of each circle is proportional to the amount of money exchanged). The circles are transparent to allow viewers to appreciate the density of trades at a given time point.
Hopefully this chart should allow people to better understand what's going on the next time the exchange rate swings widely, and to differentiate small jitter from big movement. Assuming I didn't bork my cron command, it should get updated every hour.
@_date: 2011-04-20 14:53:07

Just be aware that internal transactions don't mean much, as anyone can write a script to transfer money back and forth between addresses he owns. I think the amount of btc exchanged at Mt Gox is a much more reliable indicator of the health of the bitcoin economy.

This is the most useful comment in this thread. At one point or another, the exchange will stall.

Basically it's a convolution between the trade data (weighted with the trade amount), and a gaussian-like function. Then I use matplotlib to generate the heatmap. The idea is to fuse nearby transactions, because to the outside observer, 10 trades of 10 BTC should look the same as one of 100 BTC.

The problem with witcoin is that the implementation and the reward method is backwards. It's not clear what the intent is.
In my mind it would be a lot simpler for a Q&amp;A site: to take the example of Stack Exchange, and upvote would give a small amount of money (maybe like flattr, so that there is no disincentive to click), and the best answer would get a bigger amount of money (again, maybe reserved when asking the question, to avoid a greedy asker keeping the money to himself).

I don't really know what's going on, but the fact is, Mt Gox hasn't seen volumes like that in more than a month. Any idea what causes this?
@_date: 2011-05-31 09:33:38
I think the most likely succesful attack would be an attack on the P2P network: maybe enough peers injecting bogus packets and affecting routing could disrupt operations for a while.
I don't think an attack on the cryptographic system is very likely, even though I'm not an expert in the matter.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:10:57
I for one am selling. This is a moment I've been waiting for a long time. 
@_date: 2011-10-13 12:12:55
What's a "world class" bitcoin exchange? Trust is something you earn, not something you declare upfront.
@_date: 2011-09-06 08:51:56
Maybe :)
@_date: 2011-06-28 10:41:50
Ebay maybe? Quite a few people are selling bitcoins on ebay.
@_date: 2011-03-27 08:13:37
Note that some transactions are involve only one person, for example miners who send the money back to their main wallet.
@_date: 2011-10-07 20:24:11
(first of all it's not my post)


All of this is in your head, and is absolutely not implied by the post. Packers are not stupid, they just don't care about this stuff. They look at the current state of bitcoin, and are not interested. That's just they way most of humans function.
People who care about "interesting" stuff are a minority. It's not about intelligence, it's about what you care about.

I wonder how long before Amazon blocks the service?
@_date: 2011-07-16 08:30:15
Excellent idea!
@_date: 2011-01-28 22:41:00
I don't get it. What service do they provide exactly?
@_date: 2011-09-20 13:12:26
I agree the distinction is important, but as there is no way of assessing the health of the bitcoin economy, I think the dollar exchange rate is a useful surrogate. Bigger bitcoin economy -&gt; more demand for bitcoin -&gt; higher exchange rate.
@_date: 2011-03-26 13:51:46
The best source of data on bitcoins is the blockchain itself. Your client has a copy of it, just learn the format and bam! you have all the exchanges in bitcoins since the beginning.
@_date: 2011-04-19 20:06:36
You should ask on or @_date: 2011-07-16 10:40:34
Great then :) What GUI toolkit do you use?
@_date: 2011-04-21 05:57:52


In that case, yes, we can change the system. But that's a feature!




I agree this is a valid point.
@_date: 2011-06-23 09:21:42
Is encryption done on the client?
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:38:32
Me neither :-D
@_date: 2011-06-15 09:47:51
This is a great idea, you should post on the forum. Or even better, do it yourself :)
@_date: 2011-05-31 14:07:53
I agree, that's why I said "disrupt operations for a while", not "destroy the network" :)
@_date: 2011-03-26 17:29:45


@_date: 2011-06-23 08:04:53
The exchanges at [tradehill]( should give you an idea of what is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:57:16


or not.
@_date: 2011-07-02 22:14:25
Very neat idea, and very useful for the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2011-06-27 05:25:05
It's pretty and sexy, but I don't find it particularly understandable or useful.
@_date: 2011-03-18 23:33:39
A little competition is always welcome!
@_date: 2011-04-30 17:14:33
It is possible to add decimals.
@_date: 2011-04-30 19:34:22
Depends on the bug. A bug that allows a remote client to read your keys would kill the network.
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:50:08
Doesn't it depend on your hardware?
@_date: 2011-02-11 16:28:09
For those who don't use KDE, a plasmoid is a small widget, similar to windows 7 gadgets. This plasmoid gives the exchange rate on Mt. Gox over the last hours, weighted by trade amount and a gaussian for time.
Enjoy! (I hope I'm not the only one to use KDE and Bitcoin :) )

Taking into account all the past transactions is not going to tell you if bitcoins get hacked, if mt. gox has new problems, or if bitcoins get favorable press coverage from the Wall Street Journal.
Using complex math can marginally help you, but trading always has and will always have a part of risk and gambling.
On the other hand, even a simple bot can be quite lucrative when market actors are irrational.
@_date: 2011-06-28 16:53:31


I'm not sure what your asking. The graph is updated hourly. Making it a dynamic display with zooms and live updates would probably be tricky because of the amount of computations involved.
@_date: 2011-09-09 13:02:22
That's pretty neat, but if someone holds a large number of bitcoin, he can fake activity by moving his money to a new adress from time to time. There's really no way to tell if activity is genuine from the block chain, since transactions are anonymous.
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:22:48
What happens if their bitcoins get stolen? 
@_date: 2011-05-18 11:33:03
Do your games work on linux? If so, I might be one of your first customers :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 07:57:18
I've noticed this often happens when the price is about to crash.
@_date: 2011-06-13 15:50:05
I'd be willing, for a small amount of bitcoins :)
@_date: 2015-03-28 08:25:04
So border agents can break your stuff and not pay you back? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:01:36
So as someone who has lost track of things, what client(s) will still work in a month?
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:00:41
You would be more convincing if you gave arguments to support your point. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:17:16
Or not.
@_date: 2013-06-03 11:22:59
The density is proportional to the amount of transactions in a given area.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:43:33
Full disclosure: I wrote the original code, but I don't host the current graphs.
Why it's nice: because it's the only way to simultaneously look at exchange rate, volume, and exchange rate variability.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:06:17
So what kind of moderation will you perform? I prefer my moderation light, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:09:32
It should remind everyone here that 90% of bitcoin's valuation is based on expectations of future growth, not current utility.
@_date: 2013-02-22 15:36:44
Looking at it in log values doesn't make any sense. There is nothing similar in the variation between 1 to 10$ a coin and 1,000 to 10,000.
@_date: 2013-02-16 12:31:51
Not exponential, linear.
It does take a lot of space though.
@_date: 2013-03-01 12:04:14
... and you've managed to completely miss the point!
@_date: 2013-06-03 15:00:19
They are updated on a regular basis.
@_date: 2013-03-01 08:41:23
Also called a Ponzi scheme :)
I just want to point out that this argument can backfire quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:28:05
Pretty much, volume density. The volume is the integral of the density over a specific time frame and price range.
@_date: 2013-08-31 11:53:55


No we don't. We do have a conspiracy theorist though.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:27:38
I agree my comment was a bit simplistic. But even counting those domains, I don't think the current use of bitcoin justifies a capitalization in the order of 10 billion dollars. Which is fine, but I think everyone should be aware of.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:24:26
There's nothing like rising prices to raise interest in the currency.

Don't worry, he's rich anyways :)
@_date: 2013-08-31 10:04:41


Because reading dissenting opinions is healthy. Plus this was nicely written and fun.
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:51:05
You're completely stupid if you think you know what I understand and what I don't. Have you read my entire posting record to say this?
@_date: 2013-02-22 08:33:17
The price graph looks eerily similar to the great bubble of June 2011...
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:13:32
Keep in mind that a correction is likely in the next few days.
@_date: 2013-03-21 09:06:28
A nice little correction in the next few weeks will cure you :)
@_date: 2013-02-10 12:54:33
The network's hash rate hasn't changed much in the past 6 months.
@_date: 2013-07-23 19:12:13
Not very funny or insightful.
@_date: 2013-02-25 09:33:18


No one is forcing miners to take these transactions.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:32:53
When it comes to currencies, subjective stuff is precisely what gives them value.
I don't think you can criticize Wikipedia here.
