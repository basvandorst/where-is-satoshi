I would be terrified if governments moved any faster.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:59:33
I just lost 1500 bucks, lololol
This is why I love the stock guys that come into BTC and fail, then hating BTC because they think it's a stock or a socially acceptable trend. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:38:43
lol no
@_date: 2014-10-11 02:27:18
Lol. Someone lost some money.

It's hard to originally, took me months to convince my investors that I wasn't crazy.

@_date: 2014-10-11 02:30:34
How much yen do you have? Euros? To make any investment, you must have convincing evidence to do so. Accepting a currency is no different. For instance, I had to convince my boss to accept PayPal. Is PayPal a Ponzi Scheme? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:49:04
No thanks on the Global Order, I'll pass.
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:36:25
He has nothing in it. I checked
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:10:33
Since currency is the fluid value of one's power and worth, you make complete sense. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:51:59
Don't get stabbed.

No one has any idea on how big this is. A foot in the door of one of the top grocery sales around the world. Go BTC.
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:26:16

So is starting a business without any contracts gambling?
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:40:41
Some bear should buy all and sell at a higher cost to prove BTC is superior lol
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:09:03
Because there's no grassroots startups to integrate BTC. Everyone wants to talk about it on the interwebs but no one will go out and educate. Gotta have a high density of restaurants that accept and use it in between each other, so on so forth. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:28:20
Looks beautiful! Will bookmark, congrats on the launch!
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:50:51
Short answer; yes. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:48:39

750k actually read or is that your reach? What was the actual numbers?
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:07:22
Agreed. I wish the BTC community was a little better with transparency.
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:56:37

More than 10% of all Americans have no idea when it comes to anything.
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:34:04
That's pretty huge.

Zealots of freedom!
@_date: 2015-03-23 08:12:31
Can I invest?
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:10:19
Okay, that's pretty cool and all. But that's pretty cultish.
@_date: 2015-02-14 00:32:31
Woah, didn't even think of this looking like a scam. Thankfully I don't need any more btc! But I do, however, enjoy teaching and telling people about personal liberty.

Did you wait to see? It could've been just a dead minute or so.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:00:16
I found out about btc 3 months ago, didn't invest (made excuses). now it's 3x the price. So I bought some today. It's never a bad time to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:50:20
I only make .014btc an hour, I need to get my finances rolling. Don't hate.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:26:59
So don't sell to mtgox?
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:26:25
