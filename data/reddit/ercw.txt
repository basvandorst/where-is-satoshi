So you're eating a pancake. Brother says "Hey why don't you eat this big pancake next time?" and you're like "Nah that's way too much brother" then your retarded cousin says "Look what if you just eat two pancakes really fast?"

I guess, but I guess if I was the goat person I'd be OK if the customer just brought back a USB stick with a bunch of block headers with the SPV proof of his transaction. I'd verify the work on my computer.

On that topic -- what exactly put the end to the Namecoin coinhopping? 
From  I understand that Namecoin was merge-mined from April 2011, but that didn't seem to stop people from coinhopping months later. Here's a hashrate graph from that time (not sure if legitimate): 
I also don't see many auxiliary PoW:s in the block history of Namecoin, so it's hard to believe that was the solution to the problem. My second guess would be that as Namecoin didn't have EDA it quickly became unusable due to the high difficulty and finally became illiquid enough as a result that miner's never wagered to coinhop to it anymore.
I can see how the oscillations stop being a problem for Bitcoin once the difficulty adjusts and if the BCH profitability cycles assume some regularity, e.g. if we miss 50% hashpower every other day, a -25% adjustment will see to it that even if the coinhopping problem persists, Bitcoin will average 2016 blocks in 2 weeks as intended. But I don't see that the oscillations in hashpower would eventually disappear as long as there is another SHA256-chain.

If I am a poor Venezuelian farmer or whatever, when do I need to prove the existence of documents? Land titles?

As most of you have noticed, the coinhopping problem (miner's switching chains to chase short-term profits) is causing major network congestion in Bitcoin right now. The mempool is getting heavy. This profitability period drained ~40% of our hashpower, but that's only because the Emergency Difficullty Adjustment of the other chain landed on a level where it was only marginally more profitable to mine on it.
It is entirely possible that during next oscillation it will land on a more profitable level, where we actually lose majority of the hashpower (temporarily). When that happens, the mempool can clog up really bad and fees will skyrocket. Even if we get lucky, we can still count on pretty high fees these coming weeks until the other chain does something to fix their difficulty adjustment algorithm (which they probably won't hurry with, because they like our fees to be as high as possible).
In 2 months, the 2MB hardfork of SegWit2x might coincide with a point in time where our fees are really high. It will be really difficult to control the narrative that different Core criticizers will want to spin at that point. For the average user, it will just look like the fees are super high and SegWit2x is offering a solution. They won't understand the concept of coinhopping and it is only going to sound like a made up story. Hopefully we'll have time for a few difficulty adjustments of our own by that time, but we should still do everything we can do stop this situation from escalating.
I suggest that everyone make as few transactions as possible during these coming months until SegWit2x! I understand that a lot of people are excited to try out SegWit and experiment, but please do this on testnet for the time being!
Also, please educate people on what the coinhopping problem is.

You can download blocks through the satellite, but you can't send transactions to it. What is the use case?

Dude, do you have any idea what an awesome idea that is? This is genius level shit -- you may have solved the years long scaling debate just by this. I can't believe no one ever thought of this before. Spelled out this way, its all so brilliantly clear.

Thanks, I didn't mean it would cease to function, so perhaps my analogy wasn't very apt, you are right. What I mean is that the mempool gets full of high fee transactions driving fees up.
That being said, it worries me slightly that you're not approaching this very strategically. While the mempool still functions as it was designed during this coinhopping problem, it isn't *viable* to use it when it is too expensive. This is a big problem *right now* because the Bitcoin brand is at stake here. SegWit2x is not very popular with the general community right now, but that could change rapidly once users deem the mempool *unviable* for their intentions. Having a third fork of Bitcoin gain momentum causing a threefold coinhopping problem (not to mention replay attack risk) isn't exactly an ideal outcome.
I therefore think it's prudent to abstain from putting the mempool under anymore load in order not to give the SegWit2x any more reasons to seem like a good idea. Do you disagree?

Sending transaction via SMS is pretty great, idd.

In situations where you don't have internet, can you help me come up with scenarios where that's useful? I guess if I run a shipping business I can wait with shipping my orders until I get a transaction.. ? But it feels far-fetched that I wouldn't have internet access .. how would I check incoming orders, shipping details .. ?

Thanks for the feedback (I am the author of this flowchart)
We did discuss including this possibility in the flowchart but neglected to do so due to the low probability of this outcome. But you are indeed correct.
P.S. Thank you for your fantastic work in Bitcoin.

This would argue that Craig is right (pun intended):
