I was in bitcoin when it was 4k a coin. I understand the cycle, but this is not a cycle! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:34
That's hysterical lol!!

Your right.. stay positive as bitcoin goes down to 8000 by tonight
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:14
I'm trying to be positive trust me. I am .  But this is hitting me so hard in the face.

I was reviewing the booking order and I saw a massive 210 coins to sell at 14400. On gdax. I was cautious if it was a fake out cuz I've seen a lot of these. But I was certain it wasn't, because I thinking needs to take profit some time

You actually captured my moment very accurately! :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:25:10
Well, my initial investment was very large I lost not only all of my profits which was over 4k but a little bit on my investment which was around $300.00 loss.

I bought at 15550 when it dipped.

Yep, get ready to jump into one when Bitcoin drops to ,5k next week..
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:39
I agree!! But the Futures are involved now, things may fall apart this coming Monday, I'm selling all my Bitcoins then, but now I'm just enjoying the ride
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:08:05
I was thinking the same thing!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:03:32
I missed that boat, I sold  I saw a huge buy wall Last night, I was like there is no way in hell they are going to eat through that nonsense. But it was another fake out. I didn't catch it in time. So yeah :/
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:37:24
Nope!!! My heart can't take it,my mind is shot, my soul lost all Faith and my body still trembles from amount of stress I had went through the last couple of days.. I'm out! Keep your hodl keep the bits that are coins.  Keep them and have them as digital ornaments and have them hanging from your Christmas tree next year.

Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.. in other news I lost 2k in 2 days, thanks Obama.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:55:26
Thank you, that makes sense. I was getting worried. I started to pull out to cash, and gdax froze . I lost close to 2k :( 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:39:52
