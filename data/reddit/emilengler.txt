According to whois.com bitcoin.com was registered on the 4th of January 2008. Why is it older than bitcoin.org which was registered on the 18th of August 2008. At this time there was no public mention about bitcoin.

Do you think satoshi is reading this ?

You can use Jaxx, there you can move all funds from a private key into your Jaxx wallet. It is a light wallet so you don't need to download the entire blockchain. If you want an open-source alternative without moving the funds you can use Electrum. At the first startup of Electrum you are being asked of importing a private key or create a new wallet

Only because you want a character on your leyboard doesn't mean you own any bitcoin

Thanks to the guy who signed with "Satosho Nakamoto". /s
Why do people sign petition with pseudonyms? This makes your own signature invalid...

The real first rule of bitcoin:
If you control the keys, you have the bitcoin
If you don't control the keys, you don't have the bitcoin

Contributions can make your code more readable ;)

Thank you for running a full- node :)

Another reason why BCash has no right to exists
@_date: 2018-11-06 06:26:55
Looks great, already thought about open-sourcing it sonother people can contribute ?
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:14:48
We can do it like in 2010. You send me Bitcoins and I'll order you Pizza paid with my credit card.
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:20:07
Yeah it is ok dude was just a bit confused that I know this pic from somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:07:46
He registered the domain at anonymousspeech with a gift card.
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:21:00
It is public domain so don't worry
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:57:26
Don't understand it anyway, I'm usually not very interested in any kind of sports
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:04:33
If you can prove that you use the name longer you can apply for the ownership of ghe domain at IANA. The only person who has the permission is satoshi. We need you
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:49:26
In many decades transactions from non segwit addresses like yours will be much expensive. It should be a crime to keep funds in non segwit addresses.

Yes, when I am thinking about it you are right. Never thought about it.

It was posted on the metzdowd cryptography mailing list. He also announced it in October of the previous year
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:13:04
Yeah it is really cool, I also had this idea a while ago.
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:25:23
It's time for adventures and lots of fun with Pony, Lion, Panda and Chickun
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:27:42
Then you wouldn’t write this.
@_date: 2019-01-09 12:43:26
I don't know if this exists outside Germany. He probably used something similar then PaySafeCard. PaySafeCards are prepaid cards where you can buy anonymously online.
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:06:06
Pruning is the answer
@_date: 2019-01-09 12:42:10
No, there were multiple hardforks like P2SH which would make it impossible. But you could start your own chain. Btw, the client would not find any clients because the IRC server which was used for seeding is down.
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:55:55
Bitcoin.com was registered before Bitcoin came into existence. Ver bought it later. Satoshi bought bitcoin.org at AnonymousSpeech. Probably with a PaySafeCard.

My pentium did it in one day.

Thanks for using my screenshot without permission.
Don't worry your service is cool, was just surprised that I know this screenshot with the exact lines from somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:00:08
Yeah, send me 10000 BTC and I will order you 2 Pizzas instantly.
I will even deliver them to your house in person.
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:54:54
Then I would chill on a yacht with my buddy satoshi.
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:31:29
@_date: 2018-11-17 13:49:38
I agree
@_date: 2019-05-22 18:08:22
I would give you gold for this if I would have money
@_date: 2018-12-20 05:58:01
There is one golden rule:
If you control the keys, you have the bitcoins.
If you don't control the leys, you don't have the bitcoins
