This is definitely false. It works like any other business, the vast majority do not win. That doesn't mean nobody wins, or that trying to win is a foolish th
Investing in index funds will give you the least volatility, but will make certain you are not one of the winners in the market. In the glory days of poker, about 6-18% of players online won money, now it's down to less than .1% This is because everyone learned how to play ABC break-even strategy, and now the rake eats them alive.
Unlike the zero sum game of poker, the market generally gives most people a win as long as they hold, but there is also inflation and taxes to deal with. This deludes people in to thinking they are winning, when institutional players are sucking profits they could have dry. If you blindly invest in indexes you might lose less than not investing at all, but you are still losing.

There's nothing technical at all preventing Trezor from supporting iOS. There are numerous ways they could implement it including midi.

I used to have to call every month O2 after being billed a few pounds for data roaming (I traveled a lot) when I always had all data switched off, now in iOS11 off on the control center doesn't actually turn the transmitters off.

You'd need to physically disable the transmitters inside, which is not that hard. It's not paranoia, iOS has a history of not respecting the software settings of packet activity.

Some iPhones don't have sim trays if they are American and CDMA. I think since iPhone 5 they all come with sim tray.  So that's another caveat of repurposing old iPhone. The transmitter also can always connect to towers as well either way sim or no sim. Not sure if there is any vector, but potentially a fake tower and carrier settings injection attack. Airplane mode would seem to solve that though.

It's a crappy company, they are slow with support. I never would keep coin on coinbase, I always instantly sent everything off.
I waited two months once for a reply to a ticket.

You are trying to sound like you understand even the basics of contract law. That's not how this works. Fraud statutes are very broad. This is fraud. How widespread? I don't know yet. Maybe it's only a handful of people.


Louis? v. I forget was 7th circuit. Not applicable. Consumer protections are generally strong in the 9th circus. You can sue, especially in California against a California company. Why anyone chooses to do financial business in California is beyond me. That's why coinbase is trying to escape the tentacles maybe.


I like how you know it all. I already consulted with a class action lawyer, hence the thread...and I've already been the head of the class of a class action before, I get it. A class action needs victims and a target you can collect from. That's the point of this thread. When I search back in December, there was nobody posting about this issue, but it was occurring. This is to alert others. 
I have an open and shut small claims case for ~$500 and change plus expenses. It's a pain in the ass. I have to serve them, then they won't bother showing up because it's too expensive to bother with for them, then I have to collect. They will drag that out for a few months, and then I will get a check and they will continue to get away with it. Will I do it? Maybe.

Oh boy, smart ass gets to be wrong, and you are that smart ass.
Here's what I wrote them last month:




Thank you though for showing me the new terms they updated that this dispute is not subject to. 
You are right they are perfectly free to close my account. I was quite civil with them though. They at most were annoyed with my persistence. They are not free to commit fraud however, and that's what this is about. 
Edit: 
Is an older one. I'm sure you can find one from the last year. Their new terms aren't very good either. I can still sue them since we are both in California, and their severability clause is poorly worded which can render the entire terms void, but that's beyond the scope of this discussion.

1% is a lot, especially when it triggers NSF fees for the account from a debit transaction.

I now don't pay for them on USAA if it's caused by a foreign fee. US Bank is different however, lesson learned.
Why are people in this sub so damn passive aggressive? Go dry clean your fedora or something. It's not helpful to anyone being a dick.

Coinbase is American with foreign shell companies they are trying to run to. I expect American companies to follow American law.

Not without pay 3% you don't. It used to be like an instant echeck on paypal, free when coming from bank account. Now it's a week wait to do a bank account transaction. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:04:35
I didn't agree to it, and it's a few hundred dollars in fees, so yes, especially if other victims. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:39:27
Sorry, but if you keep money in a checking account attached to a debit card you are dumb.
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:40:23
It's against the law and fraud. Make sure not to delete this post as I'm sure someone interested will search this thread.
If you are in California you can recover the fees with a small claim, otherwise you might be subject to arbitration.

Those have very high annual fees or are tied to something not free. When a card holder offers that to you, you're still paying the 1%, just in other ways. Visa mandates it now. 
Secondly, cash advanced fees are assessed (or should be) for credit card purchases on coinbase. 


I used a USAA debit card, so USAA does assess it, you may have a different product. Schwab you are correct, and they are good for sending wires, but trading with them is very expensive, especially for options. Not sure if my account still active with them.


Well USAA is the only bitcoin friendly bank I have left. I had two other bank accounts closed for bank purchases. You also have to understand I'm already willing to pay the 3% fee to make instant payments across the world. I don't sit on more than a grand in coins.

Why is everyone here so Coinbase committed fraud plain and simple.
You have to wait a week to get coins if you buy with a debit card. Trying telling a starving freelancer in Ukraine to wait a week to get paid $200. Coinbase took away the instant buy feature. That's how I used to purchase coin, with a bank account and a credit card so I didn't have to worry about preauths. 
Edit: The bank is not cooperating now because I tried to dispute the fees first and not the whole transaction at first. I lost my appeal in their minds by asking for the wrong thing. I contracted with coinbase to bill me, not a 3rd party company in the UK. So technically it's an unauthorized transaction and should be reversed in whole. Coinbase might have a right to pursue any perceived debt, but that's different than whether a credit card authorization is legitimate. 
Dealing with Visa directly, and then will sue coinbase if I have time.

They said it was temporary, and it was for a week.
