Google the signature - see it has been used before to sign something else

Didn't he copy and paste a signature that was used to sign another message?  This indicates attempted fraud rather than an innocent Satoshi who lost his keys.

Number 1 seems very likely - he had some correspondence with SN and the original SN signed this random message.

I think so as It is not as easy to create custom ltc miners :
Memory bandwidth refutation
Some attempt to refute this by arguing that scrypt is not designed to be inefficient, but is instead designed to be highly dependent on memory bandwidth. Since the high-speed cache RAM on modern processors already takes up most of the die space, no sizeable improvement could then be made by creating custom chips. If we accept this argument we then estimate the cost of attack utilizing GPUs that are avilable today.
To do so we start with an estimated cost of hardware at $400 per megahashes per second and the October 2013 Litecoin network hashrate of 30 gigahashes per second. The total amount of equipment necessary to match and takeover the Litecoin network via 51% attack is then an estimated $12M USD (or about 45,000 AMD HD 7950s).
