slightly newbie type question, but can't you just keep a set of bitcoin addresses in an encrypted text file that you just have on your mobile device? just copy the address when you need it and so on?
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:44:40
good point
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:56:26
Depending on your OS it is usually located here
Usually you can just copy it across from there to where ever you want it.

It might be short for Lightning Network effect. I'm being optimistic here. But the general term network effect is a model for the way new technologies commonly get adopted by people (personal networks) on an [S-curve]( Bitcoin appears to follow such a path but it probably several different S-curves. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:06:47
There are no LN enabled bitcoin wallets for iOS, also it's not part of bitcoin core wallet GUI. The LN node software for macOS is still mostly on testnet as far as I can tell.

My understanding is that you would be able route payments through your channel if you have enough in the channel. So you could set up a channel between say yourself and an exchange of say 0.5BTC and that means you could process up to that amount minus tiny transaction fees. You can open channel to another person with only 0.01BTC and then another person can transfer an amount to you or vice versa, so you might be 2-3 nodes away from the main blockchain.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:29:24
from the article:
 "It is speculated that the e-Krona would work by either having it work like cash currently does, with value stored on an app or card rather than a central database, or it could be in a registry-based system with the e-Krona stored in accounts held in a centralized database." 
You know what would be a better idea is for Sweden to at least make an effort to just create a tweaked fork of the current bitcoin, then offer everyone the opportunity to run a full node and offer people the opportunity for people to mine the e-krona from home using GPUs, so reduce the  difficulty factor and even increase the number of e-Krona coins to match it more with the fiat Krona.
Then people could use atomic swaps to convert between e-Krona and bitcoin etc. 
The point of a cryptocurrency is to allow the people to be a part of it.

approximate time scale is 6 months to 18 months. There are still no easy to use GUI implementations on macOS or iOS wallets at this stage.  There are lots of tests even on mainnet but most of it is on testnet
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:03:35
segwit is going to be massively adopted in the next month or so as the Bitcoin core wallet will be released which give GUI interface for creating segwit address. The LN is really more designed for providing micro transactions for even less fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:50:22
I wonder if when LN becomes widespread they would become a LN node instead?
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:58:35
Do you think people buy bitcoin because it is easier than buying shares?
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:42:02
It might only be direct accounts. As far as I can tell you can still do cash deposits via bitcoin.com.au at westpac and anz and Bpay still works on btcmarkets.com

It's quite a big (668 bytes) and complex transaction 4 inputs and 2 out puts that's why I think. mempool is quite full too. I'm confident it will get there in the next few days though

Looking forward to a nice stable LN node/wallet that's easy to install/use on macOS or windows. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:33:01
Less mining means the difficulty would reduce too and may give other countries a chance to mine and leads to a more decentralised mining.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:03:24
This is excellent!
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:53:25
When do you think we will see stable mainnet  lightning network enabled wallets on macOS, Windows iOS , Android etc? 
I really think this is the key, then having exchanges or even banks that can convert from bitcoin to fiat more or less instantly to a persons bank account/card ( say within 10 minutes) will really make this a viable payment system.  Though I guess if there are lots of people only using bitcoin amounts there is no need to convert to another currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:02:30
There should be no problems, but I would put in a fee of around 0.0009157BTC to be sure.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:31:42
yeah, exactly, most people say we are in some kind of early adoption phase, but the fact that Futures trading started this year really indicates some kind of mainstream financial interest, also Japan and south east asia in general seem to have promoted a lot of interest and might be a good starting point.

When major wallet developers make LN enabled wallets it is pretty much as easy as scanning QR codes to send and receive payments.
As long as they have a built-in currency converter all most people will see is the QR code. 
There are now lots of GUI UX designers working on this now I think. Give it a year or 2 and the average person will be interested in having a bit of bitcoin for daily transactions I think.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:16:19
you are right. They keep a back up of it on their servers  but they do note that:
 " Because we don’t know or store your password (we can’t even reset it), only you are able to unlock and decrypt your wallet."

I wonder if they force mining facilities to close it reduces the difficulty of the network? There are some pretty big bitcoin mining places in iceland  which use geothermal

Looking at the [wiki article]( it seems that PoS has less computing power required to double spend/ The articles notes that
 " Because there is little cost in working on several chains (unlike in proof-of-work systems), anyone can abuse this problem to attempt to double-spend (in case of blockchain reorganization) "for free" "
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:56:14
The first thing needed are simple to use macOS, Windows iOS LN wallets that are double click to install, ideally having Bitcoin core wallet would include a LN transaction list would be great too. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:29:15
How much of a bitcoin do you make while it runs?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:37:12
if you are running bitcoin core, which is what it sounds like, you can just put the bitcoin folder onto the external drive, then start bitcoin core up again and it should ask you for a directory then navigate your way to the external drive folder where you put it. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:46:08
I'm not so sure, since LN relies on Bitcoin to settle open/close channels specifically on the bitcoin mainnet . But you could be right too. I feel that LN is more like a kind of 'hot wallet' for the bitcoin network.  I like to be hopeful/optimistic
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:25:07
I feel that slot machines the probabilities are in favour of the house. In the case of bitcoin there has historically been an overall increase in the value. Bitcoin has an underlying functional utility as payment system or storage system. A slot machine , though it can store value, it is much harder to access the value at any time. Gambling I feel tends to rely on probability of either 50% , heads/tail etc. IN the case of casinos slot machines the probability is often programmed in to always favour the house/machine, by even more like 40-60. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:28:23
roughly 2140 
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:16:09
I think those things can be worked on in parallel. Lightning network really needs to be implemented as a desktop client first and also various mobile wallet providers need to implement lightning too. I would suspect Schnorr could be implement in Bitcoin Core in 8-12 months sometime.
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:39:59
Even running part time a few hours per day is good too. Just make sure you have more than 8 nodes connecting. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:43:48
My understanding is that it is more that Bitcoin cash engaged in misleading and deceptive practices and made a claim that it was a majority of the bitcoin network in someway or was the 'real' bitcoin or something like that. Most other hard forks tend not to make any particular claims other than they are from the original Bitcoin block but feel the code needs to have different feature sets (block size, or difficulty levels etc). Bitcoin cash could have been 'more legitimate' if it wasn't promoting itself as being more than just a hard fork. That's why many exchanges refer to it as Bcash to make it clear that it is different set of consensus rules to the main chain. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:36:07
the bitcoin transactions can't be replicated or duplicated due to the very powerful cryptographic hash functions, also the network is transparent unlike other financial systems. If you control your private key your bitcoins can't be seized by the government randomly. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:47:17
Those two maps look actually fairly similar. If you look at the LN test net it is certainly comparable to the 1977 map.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:41:01
I think the purpose of bitcoin is to act more as decentralised reserve currency for people to move larger amounts internationally. It seems to be more useful for countries that have poor banking systems but that have fairly high levels of wealth in other areas. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:23:43
It has the private key so there's that. But you would want to immediately transfer that private key to your own wallet asap with your own private key.  So if you bought this you would have to wait about 10-15 minutes to ensure that you have the amount in your own wallet before walking out the door with it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:56:37

I think you can 'sweep' them up by sending more bitcoin to that wallet with only 0.0001BTC then you can send the remaining to another wallet , or even in the future use it to open LN channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:15:43
Though I admire your enthusiasm I feel as though it misses the point of crypto payments by going though a third party.  Just having a bitcoin address is the point of peer to peer transactions.  This is why we need the Lightning network to allow for these kinds of micro transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:30:17
the bitcoin folder is located in users/.../library/application support
you can then drag the bitcoin folder to the external drive.
then when you start it up again it will ask for the directory , then choose the external drive
edit: make sure you quit bitcoin core first
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:29:36
Partly because it costs bits to move bits. When LN becomes the most common way of moving bitcoin around then Bits could be more common.  If we can send people 0.0001BTC and be charged at most 0.000001BTC then it can be more widely adopted.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:57:21
Yep, I think start running a Bitcoin core wallet node is a good idea to start. And yes try and put the blockchain onto an external SSD if you can. You can even play around with some lightning stuff too.

The transaction has a lot of inputs (6) and the fee is really low (Fee per byte 51.975 sat/B). The chance that this gets confirmed is pretty low. It might be left in limbo for several months is my guess. Hopefully it will get dropped from the mempool in 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:52:57
Wouldn't there still be a dispute mechanism though? Say that Ebay or Amazon/Big Retailer or even Paypal offer lightning bitcoin payment options then they could just send a lightning payment back to the customer that did not receive the goods/service?
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:29:40
My feeling is that the retailer would cover it, so eBay would send you the payment back to you, not necessarily the individual seller. For example banks ( at least in Australia) often cover you for fraudulent transactions. But I haven't had much experience in reversing transactions so I'm not sure. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:16:12
just guessing here, but it is coming towards the end of January and many people might only be paid once a month, so people might need their local currencies to pay for stuff. But it really seems to depend on the bitcoin markets in each country a bit more.

The main wallet that uses Segwit is GreenAddress 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:04:04
I personally think using a secondary processor is really missing the point of Bitcoin. Your restaurant really should have it's own wallet, public QR code(s) address that patrons just scan. The number of patrons likely to use bitcoin is fairly low (due to current fees)  but I think those patrons wanting to use it would be more impressed if you had your own bitcoin address/wallet. You can always set it up with an exchange so you can cash it out the next day if you actually need the money. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:10:42
I've been trying to do a text search for the words 'US Citizens' and it comes up empty, also I can't see the word 'banned' anywhere on that page  
Can you quote the section that says who is banned or restricted?
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:01:22
Once a fairly stable macOS and iOS bitcoin LN wallet becomes available is the key to this. Ideally if Bitcoin Core incorporates LN, those people are most likely happy to run the LN part on a continuous basis.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:57:44
This sounds more accurate
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:39:53
Where can I download a macOS or windows LN node app/wallet that I can just install, double click , load with some of my bitcoin and leave on? As soon as this app is available I'm sure everyone would be happy to participate.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:45:23
Not always true. Some wallets may rebroadcast the transaction to the mempool after the 14 days I think. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:22:35
There should be a withdrawal function in coinbase somewhere. It should have a field that says something like 'your bitcoin address'. But you need to get the receive address from the wallet you intend to send to first. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:46:48
 has some good sources, also 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:57:51
I think it is a bit of a motivator to make Bitcoin more useful as a monetary settlement layer than other currencies. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:19:14
I found this one the most helpful
if you scroll down it gives some instructions too. It's still a little tricky but it's worth trying
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:48:00
Could be because it's kind of stating what we are all fully aware of. Your last sentence doesn't really help either. It sounded excessively negative. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:08:14
I think it's because the value of bitcoin is so high mainly
 15 euro is about 0.0013BTC at current prices of about 12,000 euro/bitcoin
but back in the early days, like last year, when a bitcoin was only worth 1500 per bitcoin , then 0.0013BTC is only 1.95 euro.
There are solutions coming up called the lightning network(LN) that hope to help this problem. but it will take another year to get that safely working. So at the moment bitcoin is being literally like digital gold, as a store of value that you can 'send' but with similar fee.  It's still a bit cheaper to send large amounts of bitcoin anywhere than to send gold or even an international money deposit direct to another bank account. Yes Western union might be cheaper but it doesn't go direct to your bank account. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:20:20

@_date: 2018-01-29 01:14:35
yeah pretty much exactly this
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:38:35
not sure if serious or not, but that's not a bitcoin, unless it has a public and private key in it. They should make these as USB compatible somehow.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:31:26
Once we see a lightning wallet on iOS app store and a standalone macOS lightning wallet/node then we know it is deployed. The github wallets mentioned above are kind of user unfriendly to set up, maybe it has changed but there is no .dmg file to download, open a app and just run on macOS.  I'll check again. 
edit: yep those macOS versions use darwin and have technical installation requirements. They really need to be packaged up to run independently with a macOS interface like Bitcoin Core has a normal .dmg download and app you just double click to start up. Why don't the developers create a user-friendly version to test out? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:01:58
do you think it will ever get included in the Bitcoin Core wallet app? I kind of dream of [this mock-up]( I made up.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:58:28
Why doesn't the government just embrace bitcoin, set up government bitcoin wallet addresses and just tax bitcoin directly? They could even become nodes in the lightning network and make bitcoin hosting those nodes. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:44:03
I believe that once you get your BTC amount you are free to close your channel which then goes to the blockchain if you choose to. A large node(like a coffee shop) with many connections would only need to do this once a day or even once every few days. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:54:25
You still need to unprotect your private key so it shows properly then you can import the key. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:19:14
ASIC boost should probably not be activated at all. Andreas explains here 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:38:44
my understanding is that it is based on a consensus model, I think it requires something like over 85% or more in agreement across the bitcoin network, I'm not totally sure but it is quite high. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:08:48
cool! thanks, in the Pubkey in create channel window, what is that?
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:59:36
LN channels are like 'hot wallets' so in the case of your site I think what might work best when LN is stable you would need to close the channel address once a week to consolidate funds back to your main paper wallet address, if you get a bunch of donations for example. At least that's how I understand the process.  The idea is that you might get 50 micro payments to your LN channel and then you may want to close it to send to cold storage. As far as I know there is no real time limit to keeping a channel open. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:28:45
If you think it's on an exchange the best you could do is to log into exchanges that you can remember and use the 'forgot your password?' button that most sites have and it usually emails it to a email address you know. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:26:01
I'm not sure why they are concerned about the issue of 'no central authority'. That is literally the feature of it. Bitcoin is a payment/transfer system that does not rely on a trusted third party instead using very powerful cryptographic techniques (hashing) which make the payments irreversible and tamper proof. That's the reason it has value for the most part.  Other currencies are backed by access to energy, military or goods and services. Bitcoin provides a service in the form of distributed computing power to solve the [Byzantine General's Problem]( a form of fault tolerance.  In many ways the Bitcoin network could be thought of as almost like a super specialised country (Bitconia, if you will).
The value of bitcoin could indeed be over valued in terms of it's utility now ( even Andreas A says bitcoin will suffer bubbles for the next few years) but it has potential with L2 payments ontop of it to be a highly versatile settlement layer. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:46:50
I think the distinction is that bitcoin is the first and most decentralised recorded ledger of financial transactions in history. They probably should not use the word blockchain but rather [Merkle tree](  The value of bitcoin is that it is so decentralised no one entity controls it and it has cryptographic security so large it would take another entire planet's computing power to have even a slight chance of breaking it. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:32:19
yeah agreed, it sounds more like a digital currency, of course any transmission of data needs to be encrypted like everything is already today. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:22:20
what is the transaction ID? you can check it on 
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:34:22
Yeah, at this stage that fee is a little on the low side for a 2 to 2 transaction but I'm pretty confident the network will get to it in the next few days.  I used a different blockchain explorer at

@_date: 2018-01-08 04:38:47
Does anyone know of a stand-alone macOS lightning wallet? not the github one because that requires the darwin kernel and command line to install it seems. Just a nice simple double click the application style like Bitcoin Core. I mean ideally Bitcoin Core should have LN in it at some stage, is that likely?
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:05:41
might be related to the price of electricity and cost of the machines involved, but there would be indirect costs like the amount of money required to build devices that produce the electricity and the requirements for building ASIC miners. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:04:52
I've got the darwin one running but it says it is syncing to chain, what does that mean? how long does that take?

The only mathematical description of this kind of uptake is called an [sigmoid function]( It applies to any kind of network effect. For the case of bitcoin I think it tends to be a bit more punctuated though. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:48:01
looks like great development but I'm not quite technically skilled enough to wade through. I'm just looking for a lightning.app type file to download and double click to run. The installation at  looks quite complicated to me
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:13:51
I realise that it is a high hope. I tried the  alpha lightning.app and it requires too much user input to get it started, I shouldn't have to seek out nodes and paste them in manually, there should be a set of addresses built in to connect automatically like bitcoin core wallet does. I just think it would be convenient to have it all as one app.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:49:07
there really shouldn't be any difference in the amount of bitcoin but rather how many inputs or outputs the transaction has. you can send for example 1BTC, 500BTC or 0.01BTC for 0.001BTC

@_date: 2018-01-12 08:28:16
Why only accept bitcoin? ( unless you are in poorly banked place of course) Just offer bitcoin as an option payment.  Use your own wallet and address. Don't use a third party processor.  Remember though the customer usually would be paying the transaction fee, so they may be sensitive to that. If they are sensitive to fees perhaps it is better to consider litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:11:45
I would say a  bit less than that actually, it's more than likely over a million bitcoin or more have gone missing or destroyed.

@_date: 2018-01-23 23:33:29
The paper seems to suggest that there is no major difference in bitcoin and ethereum. But from my experience it is still easier to download the whole bitcoin blockchain onto a small computer than trying to download ethereum. I suspect that there are many more part-time bitcoin full nodes than on ethereum.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:51:38
probably a few more days may be 4-7 days
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:30:00
In that case I guess it makes sense for them to try to ban exchanges for crypto due to their more gambling nature. But would they really ban it for daily transaction purposes, for example could a person buy a coffee for bitcoin (assuming say in the next year using a Lightning Network enable wallet)
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:19:20
no you can't. The transaction number just tells you the details of what is being sent, inputs and outputs, fees paid etc.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:38:18
yep the fees depend on the weight of the transaction. 
Have a look at this [transaction]( for $362,061 USD  it only cost them $10 in fees. This is why people use bitcoin to transfer money around the world because very few banks could offer a service like this and also so fast too. 
If you had say a lot of people sending BTC to a single address, then when you want to transfer all that it would cost a bit more. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:41:16
any chance you can just copy and paste the relevant paragraph from the article?
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:54:58
it' sometimes really hard to tell though, it might suddenly get picked up if the mempool volume goes down.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:30:25
There is a button on GitHub I think called 'fork' so you can do it anytime you want. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:43:42
thanks for this, looks ok, 
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:05:24
I think it depends if your wallet has that functionality. I'm not too experienced with it tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:18:22
This makes sense. In Australia I believe people pay GST(goods and services tax) to buy crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:41:08
here is a [graph of the bitcoin price]( I made using a log scale with an exponential line of best fit 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:49:37
The miners, for verifying the transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:21:31
Sometimes your wallet you sent it from will re-broadcast the transaction to the mempool. If you can somehow stop it from doing that, may be delete the wallet ( but make sure you have all the passwords, private key etc) it won't rebroadcast it.  But to be honest I would just continue to wait it out. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:56:16
yes, good point!
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:19:58
It seems to have been removed /doublespending
it also has 32 inputs according to 
something seems pretty strange about it
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:20:42
nope. close to 12,000 euro 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:41:11
looks like it is! 2nd place
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:00:46
I think the point of LN is to aggregate large volumes of small transactions over say a week or so. So that people are able to send thousands of 0.00001BTC transactions for no real fees to an address.  You could have ten thousand transactions and that ends up as 0.1BTC that you can then close the channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:59:32
I'm giving the darwin.zip file a go.... Nope didn't work it just shows Lightning menu and under that it just has Quit. What else do I need to do?... edit: wait something just showed up!
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:24:12
wait, isn't it based on the idea of not requiring a trusted third party?
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:02:13
I see what you mean, but wouldn't it be in the interest of eBay to for example require an amount (like they currently have your credit card numbers) but in a lightning channel that can be taken out in the even of a dispute? I kind of imagine something like a lightning channel credit contract channel, something like a layer 3 solution perhaps. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:40:30
the transaction is really big ( has like 15 inputs to 1 output), so it could take about another 5-10 days I think. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:32:36
Having a robust foundation is also eventually helpful too.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:31:03
I just put in your figures for 100 Antminers ( making 1400 TH/s) power consumption at 12,9300 watts and it gives a profit of about $864.05K using this [online calculator](
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:56:54
This transaction has been confirmed 
also this has been confirmed also
The original one seems to have been dropped from the mempool I think.  can't find it on block cypher either.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:17:02
same thing is happening to me. I think you just have to leave it. There was a discussion about it here 
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:18:30
What I don't understand is why don't banks embrace bitcoin even more? Lets say half a country's currency is in bitcoin then the local currency can still be used as a form of daily transaction. Banks could even be lightning network nodes, offer services to hold your private keys with insurance etc, make a nice interface for your bitcoin funds etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:58:58
I think fundamentally it is because bitcoin is the most decentralised and distributed of all the cryptos out there, it is also the hardest to break cryptographically so it has the highest resilience. I think most people are optimistic about the teams of people working on second layer solutions to bitcoin like  Schnorr Sigs, SegWit , LN, atomic swaps etc, but also there are more people working on Bitcoin core projects too. Bitcoin is literally acting like the reserve currency of the internet at this stage.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:30:50
The only thing you can do at the moment is to plot the price of [bitcoin on a log scale and then find the line of best fit]( Then it can vary up and down a bit. The line is exponential but it follows a [sigmoid type function]( between falls it seems. But it is basically follows a kind of social adoption curve.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:56:02
 has a good reputation for the most part. Not sure if they use Segwit but I think they might use batching.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:49:27
It looks like blockchain.info is probably still rebroadcasting it I think or still has it in their mempool.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:48:50
You'll probably just have to wait for an update for the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:32:28
I like your analogy of a geyser  and splashing around.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:51:05
The fact of the matter at least in most western countries now most places have to perform KYC/ AML (know your customer/ anti-money laundering) checks on people. Once you have been verified the process is usually pretty easy though.  May be try other exchanges like Gemini, Kraken Bitifinex
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:50:33
give us a screen shot of the under help -&gt; debug window -&gt; Network traffic, it looks kind of cool
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:05:56
Have you downloaded the whole blockchain yet? but basically you are now able to receive bitcoins! You are helping to keep bitcoin decentralised too.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:36:23
The only thing is that a person could see is when the transaction took place and then they can make an estimate of what the going price of bitcoin was then ±500
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:31:22
it's on their website at  
but also consider these stats too 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:36:22
BoE should just buy lots of bitcoin, set up LN nodes and be in service as a bitcoin crypto exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:06:46
Lightning network (LN) will help enormously in the future, within about a year or 2 most transactions will be via a LN enabled wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:58:49
Your wallet should suggest a fee but assuming it is a single  address  to 1 it should be fine at about 0.0014BTC
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:13:11
The document was a draft and it's now been fixed.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:30:28
I think people view Bitcoin as more of a standardised protocol like TCP/IP is for the internet except for the transfer and store of value. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:53:50
Does south korea not have a freedom of speech concept? because I would think that is what they would need to show since cryptography is essentially a form of freedom of expression. If they have a freedom of expression law then banning cryptocurrency would be like saying people can't trade art works for money or other art works.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:27:40
I think the main utility of bitcoin is the decentralised nature of it and the fact that is gives people the opportunity to literally be their own bank.
 It is often described as being censorship resistant. It basically means that you can always have funds available to you( yes you may need to convert to another currency). A government or other entity can't freeze your account because you own the private key.
In more day to day activities it is an excellent method to transfer value around the world fairly cheaply, though it does cost about $20-30 these days.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:48:19
Still waiting for a stable lightning wallet that automatically connects to LN node, a bit like the bitcoincore wallet connects to nodes. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:52:49
Remember though that 'blockchain' was in fact first developed by satoshi and what we know as part of the bitcoin network. One of the best resources is the bitcoin wiki at 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:19:01
yeah I think it should be fine too. I found when I switched to SSD it seemed to be a bit faster. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:52:48
I think you can actually see it concretely in code here is the latest block  looks like this 00000000000000000080c9458f9e32a3a306cf76bd917fa647045bc3134c26dd
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:54:51
I just feel that there is often a lot of paper work involved etc, may be it is different these days. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:27:51
Pretty sure things will get better in the next few months, looking forward to bitcoin core wallet 0.16 or 0.17 even. Once we have LN nodes anyone can run easily it will be much better.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:56:51
I think that's why the fork happened. A minority wanted bigger blocks and most of the network didn't so they created BCH instead. But I think it had something also to do with mining pools. But I'm really not sure about the details tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:06:12
Use Greenwallet, seems to be pretty secure 
edit: also supports segwit too
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:55:49
The relevant paragraph in the article:
"Bitcoin is not part of a balance sheet. It does not inherently extinguish debt of any kind – neither a tax obligation nor a bank debt. Nor do other cryptocurrencies. Once the fad for them subsides, the realization that you can’t pay taxes or repay a debt with them will become evident and their true value of 0 will become evident." 
It's just not true, because bitcoin can be converted to fiat that can be used to pay back a debt. Bitcoin has value because we assign a value due to it's inherit properties. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:19:07
Yeah I would agree that sending a few hundred to local bitcoins would probably be viewed as a form of money laundering. But I'm not sure how they would know what addresses belong to who, unless they have a list of addresses they know might be 'tainted' . The problem I see is that they should be a bit more upfront about where you can can send your bitcoins to.  
But it does say in their terms and conditions that don't need to say anything.  
One thing I don't understand is why coinbase is headquartered in San Francisco and yet the terms and conditions are for a UK based company. ... anyway it says in their terms and agreement that 
" You acknowledge that Coinbase's decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your account, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to Coinbase's risk management and security protocols. You agree that Coinbase is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and security procedures to you." 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:08:49
well have a look at  and you can see it jumping up and dow quite a bit now, due to futures trading.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:20:35
My understanding is that those coins are actually already confirmed by the blockchain before you even get them via signed smart-contract. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:43:49
May be have a look at this list would give a good starting point 
I like the economic discussion at  
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:10:46
Just also to mention, occasionally people don't realise this but you don't need a bank account to exchange bitcoin. Once you have even a tiny amount of bitcoin on your wallet it can't be taken away, unless you forget your password I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:33:50
This is why the Lightning Network has had so much work put into it recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:24:43
The lightning network needs to be pushed more to help it as a exchange medium for small amounts. I think Bitcoin is good for moving large amounts of money quickly. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:35:03
Well we are heading to the weekend soon so trading should stabilise a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:52:35
I think the main reason is that bitcoin core is the most technically secure version of the blockchain with the most decentralised system making it more robust against censorship. Other cryptos have potentially more security or centralisation issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:27:34
well intially that might be the case, but if large numbers of people have their savings in bitcoin they will just cash out say 0.07 BTC ($US 974) to buy a new computer or holiday or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:42:16
ah, well it depends on what country you are in. In the US people are using coinbase or gdax.com as a starting point to move funds from their bank account to get bitcoins. There are other exchanges like  . I'm in Australia so there are few different options. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:25:02
Agreed, putting an emphasis on mBTC might help a bit
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:16:05
ah that clarifies it now, thanks makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:51:13
may be have a look at the review here too 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:30:59
My guess is not for another 6-9 months at least, the Eclair wallet is only experimental on Android. As soon as there is an iOS bitcoin wallet with LN implemented that's when things get interesting . Possibly not until 2019. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:50:13
also apparently it is not a default on Bitcoin Core either. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:08:52
In my mind I don't really understand the worry about a fluctuating price if the base value of bitcoin is really high, it hardly makes a major difference to smaller amounts useful for small scale transactions.
let say hypothetically bitcoin is $100,000. if you have 0.0009BTC that would mean you had the equivalent of $90
if the price of bitcoin went to even $101,000 ( an increase of $1000) and you had 0.0009BTC it would now be worth $90.90 then if if drops by $1000 again it's back to $90 so it's not really much of change. 
Are people really going to worry about such a small change? most organisation could absorb that cost too.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:36:26
is better for more in depth stuff I think
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:54:17
I think here  , but you can also just watch your exchange at 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:53:14
Lightning network should help avoid this in the future
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:50:00
thank you for explaining this!
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:43:29
that actually makes a lot of sense . Thanks for having another look at it. tbh I'm not completely sure about all the technicalities, I just hope that the wallet developers can implement this in a way that we can easily understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:22:41
Yeah bitcoin is like a protocol , like TCP still runs the internet
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:31:03
basically they just add more decimal places
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:33:08
Well the Lightning network for bitcoin is meant to help the scaling issue significantly 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:07:27
just watch the candle on  also switch to line and you can see moving up too
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:36:42
It's a bit like a global distributed off shore savings account at this stage. It is managed, audited by hundreds of thousands of blockchain nodes, it is also confirmed using cryptographic hashes that require such large amounts of computing power it would need another entire planet to even have a slight chance of duplicating a coin transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:22:21
Good questions. yes I believe both parties need to be online to do an active transaction. I'm not sure about the second question but there is an FAQ about LN at @_date: 2017-12-09 21:41:41
For the case of bitcoin I think it does use fractional reserve but just by moving the decimal place along. But at this stage it won't need to move the decimal place for a very long time.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:45:09
Using google translate app on a phone I think it says " Bitcoin banks Robin hood" " whoever does not believe will follow him" I'm not sure what the last part mean though. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:56:00
no, that bitcoin miner literally has over 100 or more cores that are dedicated to hashing SHA256
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:11:22
from the drop down menu just select what ever hash rate of your equipment is. So may be go to eBay and search for a S9 asic miner and it will show the hash rate then use that value to put it, that one is about 14 TH/s or so.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:21:02
well your bitcoin might be worth $200 next month. It just means you can participate in the bitcoin lightning network, you can receive bitcoin, send bitcoin and convert to almost any currency if you need it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:36:14
Yeah it's really hard to guess how many bitcoins are in accessible . It might be possible to estimate actual volume by looking at transactions?  There have been 16.734 million mined so far. I guess at least 1-3 million have been permanently lost.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:09:36
mBTC, may be mikes, mics? "Hey man, you owe me 10 mics!"
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:14:10
Speaking of Lightning Network Does anyone know of bitcoin wallet iOS developers that are starting to implement LN protocols?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:01
it's on bitcoin testnet some resources at @_date: 2017-12-09 23:05:57
I think there has been a backlog in unconfirmed transactions. If you have the address search for it here on this blockchain explorer 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:58:17
yeah that's the situation at the moment. This is why everyone wants the lightning network implemented into common wallet software, then the transaction fees will largely disappear.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:31:22
add your bitcoin receive address to the checkout process? I found this tool from github which might also help 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:41:45
Agreed. We need lightning network to be more encouraged. Hopefully the developers of wallets  and bitcoin core are working on this now. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:19:42
~~is not too bad
edit: should be @_date: 2017-12-28 06:05:10
Thanks for providing all this excellent background information about what has been happening.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:18:04
May be choose a wallet that you can control the fees. See the list at  . If you are in the UK I'm sure there are other exchanges to check out too, just a quick google search shows up  which looks reasonable to me
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:06:13
May be just donate it then? Make sure you set your wallet to manual fees otherwise you can't move it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:26:09
ahh, that's even better! I really wasn't sure about it from looking at the various demos.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:20:39
try this mining comparison tool, just switch around the values a bit
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:59:25
Have a look a blockchain explorer and just pick a random new transaction being confirmed 
or play around with the various settings 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:26:28
They get rewards from the fees, but that is so far in the future we will mostly all be dead by then
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:11:06
Don't cash them all out I hope, leave at least 1 BTC and a bit.  But yeah as others have said just find a good exchange in your country and they usually transfer direct to your bank account. May be cash out a bit at a time?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:27:23
Here is what it it looked like when it just started trading, this is gdax.com but I'm not sure if it is one of the exchanges, still looks interesting in the first 15 minutes 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:02:36
Do the nodes/channels need to have constant internet connection?
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:38:36
Why did you buy a whole one at once rather than buy it in parts over time?
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:12:55
nothing will happen, it's just another forked altcoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:52:39
Make sure you are running  to help the network.
Also find an iOS developer who is working on Lightning Network integration and donate to them!
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:16:01
When they update the app, sometime in late January I think
see also 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:56:24
It makes some valid points but speculating about if we were all paid in bitcoin or had bitcoin mortgages is a bit out there. If bitcoin stabilised in relationship to other currencies you could perhaps discuss that. At the moment bitcoin is still developing and growing in acceptance so it's too early to tell.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:29:24
I think it really depends on what country you are in and what socioeconomic group you are in.  Some people are seeking economic security in the far future and others are looking to go for quick money in the next year or so. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:23:15
It literally doesn't matter what price bitcoin is at. It just means you get less actual bitcoin number.  You could buy 0.005BTC which is currently about $96
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:52:14
I like to be optimistic and the first wallets and bitcoin core will have it within 6 months
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:19:20
hey that's cool, an Australian block explorer!
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:59:39
or you can try 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:14:30
yep, exactly that too! really hoping all major wallets will have segwit in the next 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:00:11
may be also compare with 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:01:54
is a satoshi the same as 1 µBTC? I forget the exact conversion. edit: it's ok I found a conversion.
1 BTC = 100 000 000 Satoshis
1 BTC = 1000 mBTC (millibitcoin)
1 mBTC = 100,000 Satoshis
1 μBTC (microbitcoin) = 100 Satoshis
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:14:34
May be try on the weekend sometime, if coinbase has dynamic fees it might vary , I don't know. Also check  and it gives an idea of how busy the network is, when it gets below 60,000 it is a bit more useable I find. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:48:52
DB executive only thinks bitcoin could be better designed not that it isn't going anywhere. Once the lightning network gets adopted then the banks will be really interested because they can be a hub, which is still fine, makes the bank more transparent
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:40:45
I guess in principle it could but the transaction might be buried so deep that it would be hard to identify. I'm not an expert in blockchain dynamics so I'm not entirely sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:10:34
ah ok, wasn't really sure, but that makes sense now that you mention it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:23:47
what's the transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:42:54
I like getting into mBTC as a measure 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:06:14
The last 10 days has been a bit bumpy but it looks like it is starting to smooth out a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:12:34
not necessarily ,if some major exchanges have technical glitches it might drop more , but often it stabilises for at ±5-10%
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:41:12
agreed, I'm pretty hopeful and optimistic about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:01:37
My understanding is that it literally just means buy low sell high and cash out at a set future date. Some one correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:14:56
I get that you need to create an on-chain transaction but this is not going to overwhelm the blockchain because only a few people will be doing this at first, once those first few have done that then they won't need to make another transaction for a long time thereby freeing up the blockchain for bigger transactions and others. So there might be 5 million nodes initially but those 5 million transactions won't need to be part of the blockchain anymore because they have already confirmed the transaction which they can then use for the next say 2 or 3 weeks before then need to contact the main blockchain again. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:40:07
One thing I think you are missing is that the value of a whole bitcoin can be really high because you can sub divide bitcoins down to 8 decimal places.  So if 1 BTC = $250,0000 then 0.001BTC = $250 , or if 1 BTC = $900,000 then 0.001BTC = $900 and so on. The value of bitcoin could go up almost any value and the fractions just get  higher value.  At those high values no one is going to be buying entire bitcoins unless they are a bank or business of some kind, or just lucky early adopter. 
When will the last bitcoin be mined? see 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:49:51
Bitcoin itself it unlikely to have really fast transactions itself but it will have the Lightning Network that talks to the bitcoin blockchain so you can do lots of mini transactions.  I think bitcoin already has global acceptance in many western countries because there are exchanges for bitcoin to local currencies. When will it become integrated into banking systems? hard to tell but you never know you might be able to store your bitcoin balance in your online banking next to your investment accounts or something. May be in 5 years time?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:19:09
not too late, just get a wallet and buy that $200 again. It currently looks like it is stabilising a bit with slight gains
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:26:07
I don't think these are stupid questions, they are reasonable I think. I think it will be many years before this is a problem economically. If bitcoin is valued in the hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions the governments around the world would be basing their economies on bitcoin. The main bitcoin network would be acting as a kind of reserve bank for the world. 
Lets say 1 BTC = $1,000,000
then 0.001BTC = $1000
or 1 mBTC =$1000
1,000 µBTC =$1000, 
or 
0.000001BTC = 1 µBTC = $1
So people would be exchanging multiples of 1µBTC for various goods/services via the Lightning network
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:32:00
I don't think that is feasible at this stage. Once the lightning network goes live main stream you might be able to do that.  As I mentioned in other posts the first step is to get a bitcoin wallet  
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:11:48
According to the bitcoin wiki it is a myth  
I've had a small transaction get abandoned for 2 weeks and then when I look though it again I see it confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:53:41
from what I read on another thread or somewhere else, it means that eventually only big organisations can keep a copy of the blockchain, it means it is much less centralised*, rather than the 100,000s of nodes around the world now it might end up with only 1000 or so, it means a bad actor could more easily influence the blockchain. 
edit: *decentralised rather
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:36:52
Nice minimalist design. I like it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:12:17
yeah I would agree that's not so small, but I feel that some exchanges can vary a lot more than others. I watch an Australian exchange and the day changes can be ±5-14% which in my mind is not too bad when the base price gets really high. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:38:26
The price differences between exchanges is not really all that large, they clearly must be communicating with each other via APIs to some extent, a change on one exchange is fairly consistent with another. Compare say Gemini.com with gdax , the base price might be a little different but the percentage change is often fairly similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:19:49
There is a chance the value of bitcoin could settle for a while at this level for a few months and not go exponential for a while until may be LN becomes more common.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:56:47
Just so people are aware, in Australia international transfer fees are quite big and varied see , 
so this is pretty consistent with charges using bitcoin, which has the advantage that you don't need a bank account at all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:33:45
Well your bitcoins can't be taken away so there's that. You are now part of the world's largest supercomputing network keeping your bitcoins safe from just about everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:25:27
click bait headline. They just find it hard to value for all the standard reasons. But doesn't recognise the technical features of bitcoin it particular the huge cryptographic hash power associated with bitcoin transactions. 
The scalability issue is being developed extensively and actively though. 
The economics of it are based on limited/constrained supply. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:05:38
in that case I would definitely try some disk recovery system, there is hope!
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:40:58
pretty sure if you go into settings somewhere you can change the fees manually
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:12:48
Think about what happens when Bitcoin core adds lightning network, it means more people will be willing to run a full node because now if you have enough bitcoin transactions running through your LN node you can even get a little bit of bitcoin for keeping your channel open. The more decentralised you can keep bitcoin the better I think.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:22:46
I kind of think if you can put in more like even $50-$100 per week, if you can that is good strategy, obviously it would have been easier a few years ago to do that. But at the moment bitcoin is looking like a reasonable long term savings account. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:09:07
Lightning Network so we can send micro transactions of bitcoin to our friends for like $5 with little to no fees
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:46:58
certainly there are people working on it right now. Probably within 6 months I would guess, but this might take more than year. 
I just listened to a podcast briefly and they described the bitcoin code as like aerospace engineering, everything has to be tested a lot, so I would assume the lightning network would be similar. 
 There are some resources and examples of clients  at @_date: 2017-12-30 22:13:20
The nodes are also transparent as far as I know, so you can still trace the amounts of bitcoin if you needed to. So if say McDonalds was a node you can easily see how much bitcoin is being transacted, in a sense it also makes money movement more transparent. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:24:50
Should we use the expression mBTC?, I do think that gdax should include a little option to change the units from BTC to mBTC and µBTC like core has that option.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:44:59
hmmm, not sure I just tried Arcbit via an iPad and it didn't ask to deposit anything to start it, do you mean before setting a password? You shouldn't need to enter any personal information as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:24:41
may be ask this in @_date: 2017-12-09 08:44:53
I like this idea, but can you clarify something about this? is the Lightning Network going to be something that gets incorporated into everyday mobile wallets like Breadwallet or Arcbit  or even Bitcoin Core wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:45:46
yes, as long as the wallets are connected to common nodes on the Lightning network. If say all bitcoin exchanges have LN nodes then any one who bought coins on say gdax or gemini or some random exchange in finland, australia etc then there are probably only about 16 hops or less to transfer that bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:10:46
may be try the exodus wallet, they seem to have access , via shapeshifter to get a wide range of cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:00:47
Apparently in about 6 months when Lightning Network enabled wallets become available
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:41:20
I think mainstream investors are interested in it a bit more these days, for example introduction of futures trading with bitcoin. Though in some places bitcoin has been around for a few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:25:44
I think it has something to do with governments just being able to arbitrarily taking or freezing your money without due process. Also bitcoin is not really all that anonymous, the blockchain is public data so forensically you can get lots of clues as to where bitcoin goes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:56:30
that may be the case sometimes but bitcoins are still being generated from miners. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:57:23
that makes sense, thanks for clarifying that
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:22:18
[Arcbit]( is also a good option too, as you can import private keys etc. But don't forget that you still have to pay a fee to transfer into it, about $10 or more perhaps. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:37:14
There is a lot of work going on in something called the Lightning network that is addressing exactly this point. Off chain  distributed confirmations going back to the main bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:48:10
There is a chance nothing much will happen and it will be just business as usual. Dropping a little bit , going stable for a while and rising a bit as more people adopt it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:32:44
might take another 4-7 days I think, that's just a guess
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:33:57
I think it's a good time to buy because the price has stabilised for a little bit. Remember you only need to by fractions of it like $150 is about 0.01375 . use [preev.com]( to convert back and forth 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:51:36
woah I just saw that sell wall  , what does that mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:10:36
They got cold feet I guess. Is CME still going ahead though?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:42:31
not OP, but my feeling is that stocks represent a specific set of goods/services that are needed or in demand. Bitcoin represents a much broader range of things that could be exchanged.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:12:46
Bitcoin core developers are more security conscious and have decentralization as a key priority 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:27:16
in the EU, I think the best option is find do a google search of your country and bitcoin exchange.  You could also try  too
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:18:22
 it seems to be working
also  is showing it fine too
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:22:12
you really should have these amounts on [bitcoin core]( or on a ledger hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:03:56
is there another futures market coming up?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:48:44
seems reasonable
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:21:10
looks that way, may be on the weekend?  but I think this is just the situation now I guess, higher fees to do a transaction that confirms in shorter time
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:03:56
it's not a bad idea. But I think for the moment people prefer the plain B with vertical strike through. I do like the evolution diagram at the bottom though. 
But for a second I thought this was a proposal to use the bitcoin blockchain as a proof of identity, which I guess can be used like that , though I  haven't seen a neat little app for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:25:56
no, it literally doesn't matter because it is decentralised. They own some whole coins, they don't own the network or anything like that. Even if you have only 0.002BTC that is literally yours and your alone. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:29:29
The main reason it is hard to spend it is because major companies are still hesitant to have their own wallet. It is trivially easy for any company to set up receive addresses. Then if they really need the money in local currency they can go on to their favourite exchange and get it back. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:56:11
May be choose a wallet that you can set the fees manually? Even if you use a low fee, it should still get to the destination but it might take 14 days to get confirmed (or it just get returned to your wallet). If both the wallets are in your control there is no chance it will be stolen.  The main reason for fees is for when sending to a party other than yourself. Well that's my understanding at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:52:49
thanks! I see it now
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:07:27
not really feasible in 5-10 years , probably not even until 2040.  see 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:54:24
I understand from an investment perspective that might be the case. But I don't understand from a personal perspective. Surely having your own place to live that can't really be taken away would be a powerful feature to have in one's personal life? is constantly renting a different place every few years better?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:03:20
Gemini is more regulated I think
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:08:25
Because to send an international bank wire transfer from one bank account in the world to another bank account still costs about $20-30 and it takes 2-3 days to be processed. With bitcoin it only costs about $15-20 to send and it takes only about 8 hours (if you are unlucky may be a bit more)
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:20:36
that fee doesn't sound too bad as you said. Everyone is waiting for the Lightning network which should reduce the fees even more dramatically. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:04:52
I think bitcoin still can be and is useful as a currency, may be not day to day small transactions but it is still competitive with international bank deposits, so I think it does have some useful utility. The fact you don't need a bank account to transfer is still hugely useful to some people. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:58:28
cool! looking forward to it!
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:29:53
I realise it is independent but I think making the Core wallet compatible and able to send lightning payments would be really helpful
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:46:08
fractions or decimal places of bitcoin can still increase in value
today 0.001BTC is worth $18
next 6 months 0.001BTC could be worth twice that at $36
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:46:02
The only businesses interested in bitcoin at this stage are futures markets. Once the Lightning Network(LN) becomes more widespread businesses will be able to act as LN nodes to help the transactions off chain (smart contracts) but are still confirmed on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:30:20
Or just ask people to pay you for chores in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:21:48
Still waiting for a nice macOS client for LN, and LN /segwit updated iOS wallets too.  I really hope that Bitcoin core gets a LN implementation built-in too like [this mock up]( I made a while ago. Commercial versions should really use the terms 'Bitcoin savings account' and 'Bitcoin cheque/checking LN account'
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:11:54
oh ok that's good to know then, does that perhaps mean LN might get implemented sooner then?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:15:58
I think most people understand the basic principles of the bitcoin network. But one thing that sometimes new comers don't appreciate in the fraction reserve component of bitcoin, i.e. the tiny fractions of bitcoin like 0.0001 or even 0.00001 of a bitcoin can be valuable
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:55:14
I think LN is important so that people can use the bitcoin reserve currency for smaller transaction. Bitcoin is really about replacing government reserve currency situations that make money out of thin air. Bitcoin at least is mathematically limited. Yes various people/orgnisations will have far more bitcoin than others but at least it is transparent and publicly auditable 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:17:31
My intuition is that it would be. Since the bitcoin network is worldwide
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:11:01
Lightning Network (LN) will allow for this
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:56:43
My understanding is that smart contracts within bitcoin relates to only the amount of the bitcoin within LN channel that you can send to another person without having to tell the main blockchain because the contract was already 'signed' by the blockchain when the channel is open and then closed. 
It doesn't have anything to do with fake products that are bought. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:39:44
I was told on another thread that they are basing their futures on the  it doesn't seem to show a chart though
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:37:19
that's my understanding at this stage from reading similar answers to this kind of question. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:16:23
Well the more people mining there is an increase in the difficulty to maintain that only 1 BTC per block per 10 minutes. I think that's why.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:42:44
it uses the [bitcoin core]( blockchain, it's literally the only way to be sure
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:46:45
I always wonder why governments don't just simply have their own bitcoin receive addresses then they can just apply some kind of bitcoin tax then they can keep their own bitcoins and make their own profits. So if a business offers a product they can price it both in mBTC or µBTC and in local currency. So for india it is currently is actually conveniently 1 µBTC = 1.05 Indian Rupee
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:45:38
this will have very little impact. The point of the original chain is that is has the highest security and decentralised network. It is unlikely to steal hash power because it is less profitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:24:01
Here is the original in case you want to sing along 
just listening to it now and it's so accurate 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:01
You might want to check out this site to get a better idea of financial viability
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:28:07
not always, but they often run them with their set ups I guess
but any can run a full node  that just keeps the blockchain in order
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:59:20
also check out the sub  @_date: 2017-12-09 19:45:43
What if you buy it in lots, like if you like split it into 4 lots of $1,750 , put some in now, then the three others a little later on as you watch it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:35:34
surely anyone can set up their own node with a small amount of BTC, for example amount to give to your friends or what ever. If there are less transactions happening on the main bitcoin blockchain then fees on the main network will also go down too.  Even now it is still cheaper to send a large amount of bitcoin internationally than paying bank fees to deposit money into an account
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:58:05
yeah I suddenly realised when I looked at it again that it didn't go back far enough sorry. I was just linking a sample of a log scale chart just as an example really. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:08:26
I think the first amount in the lightning network would be high but then all the little transaction would cost very little. I would imagine having a LN balance on your wallet of something like $100-500 depending on how often you are making small transactions. But you may not need that much either. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:19:53
but with the lightning network you can easily buy a stick of gum with your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:32:08
 is pretty good I think , also  has graphs too (bitcoin is listed as btx)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:15:09
interesting, didn't realise that
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:55:10
Well as long as they can exchange with other cryptocurrencies on an exchange and it is based on bitcoin blockchain with a de-centralised system, miners, everyone can download a node and run it. Then that's fine. edit: de-centralised
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:21:16
 No, you may be liable to pay capital gains when you cash it out
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:24:04
Do you mean you moved them to a different wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:02:21
All steam needs to do is adopt the Lightning Network wallet early next year sometime.  One thing I don't get is their comment about volatility. If bitcoin is 50k or 60k or whatever the smaller amounts when converted will vary much less even if there is shift of whole bitcoin price of ±500 it would make the price vary only by may be a dollar when converted. 
edit: I've done a little hypothetical calculation
say bitcoin is $50,000 sometime, a game could be price at say 0.0009BTC ($45.00)
then price of bitcoin rises to $50,500 0.0009BTC is now $45.45 
that's hardly any worrying increase at all. Besides computers can just dynamically adjust prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:11:16
I think mentioning that anyone can be part of the bitcoin network is the important thing. As you said,  you don't need a bank account to be part of it is important
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:57:52
ahhh, that's not how bitcoin works, at least at the moment, literally the only people making new bitcoin amounts from scratch are the miners. So I think it that sense bitcoin is acting much more like a commodity. So what ever amount of bitcoin you have in your wallet is just only that amount, it won't accumulate 'interest' in bitcoin so to speak.  If you find an exchange that deals in other cryptos you might be able to move some BTC to buy another crypto, see if that goes up and then buy more BTC could be another way to do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:49:35
Mostly so you don't have to have the whole blockchain ( currently at 167GB) on your primary machine, unless you have a seperate computer entirely, then you can keep it on 24/7, but you really need unlimited downloads for that. You can just run it a few hours day if you like.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:06:09
The only realistic regulation is on big exchanges I think in the future, even now they have AML/KYC rules. For example the gemini exchange has specific rules I think which is why they can do futures trading.  The only other thing I would imagine is may be in 2-5 years time if bitcoin is being used as a currency on a day to day basis on say the lightning network, lightning network nodes might have to register with the government to ensure AML rules.  
May be  further down the track when the value of bitcoin is so high you may need to declare your bitcoin income as well as your fiat on your tax return, but then you may be able to pay your taxes directly into a bitcoin address that government owns.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:52:07
Also remember that if there was a sudden drop in mining capacity the network would just make the difficulty go way down. Also the blockchains that ensure the consensus rules are around the world ( people who run Bitcoin Core full node wallets) not just in china
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:12:16
yeah, it could take another 7 days. low fees will now take several weeks to confirm it seems.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:57:13
That is looking like a great start! looking forward to the rest of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:07:19
yeah that could be true, but if hundreds of thousands of people only have say the equivalent of $200 in their hubs for coffees and groceries they only need to transact with the bitcoin blockchain may be once per week or once every 2 weeks with more funds. Also remember those nodes are likely to be localised in geographic/city/region so the funds are still moving around that area contributing to the economy. Yes there will be big hubs too that people will be in common with I think.  Even internationally you could have hubs that people engage with that might be small businesses say a coffee shop in Sydney and a shop in Los Angeles means I could send someone small amounts from Sydney to Los Angeles even if I had not been to either of those places. Based on the idea of 6 degrees of freedom, i.e. there are may be 6 jumps from anyone in the world to anyone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:58:42
I wonder why Steam doesn't have their own wallet QR code? Why do they need to go through bitpay?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:39:47
from the examples I've seen floating around it does seem to be a wallet system, because you need to 'open channels'. So you have confirmed transactions and are able to confirm transaction to the receiver/sender and then the batch gets sent to the main bitcoin chain for miners. But I'm not sure of all the tech  details. May be check for examples
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:14:21
May be use a wallet where you can set your own fees, it may take a little longer to confirm but the chance of a double spend is still extremely low
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:04:16
I think the economic principles of bitcoin is a savings model rather than debt model. The value of bitcoin increases and the reason people exchange it is for specific reasons.  This article gives a good overview of the principles, especially towards the end 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:10:14
or may be governments could just have their own bitcoin wallet and receive address?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:33:13
there is quite strong development in lightning network now and into 2018, which are basically the 'variety of possible transaction types' Satoshi is talking about. Even Segwit was being rolled out which helps bitcoin in terms of mute-party signatures.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:07:43
A 'stable' bitcoin price  is good I think. It makes it more reasonable as a store of value. That said, I do think that a steady increase of around 0.5-1% per day would make it more attractive to conservative buyers. This kind of increase is still way higher than most other investments if that's how you see it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:17:59
pretty sure the consensus rules of bitcoin says you can't have blocks bigger than about 1MB ( but you can have segwit), where as Bcash says you can have 4MB or what ever larger size it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:05:50
interesting, I wonder if it is general people or a bunch of random investors doing this as a form of hedging, probably amounts to a similar thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:45:31
might drop by 5-10%. the last one though seemed to be due to major exchanges suffering technical outages though.

I think as long as they open a channel they don't need BTC. Here is another FAQ related to this I found 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:04:36
has a few resources
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:40:24
If growth is only at it's current rate of +5%/day I think that's ok for a while.  If it was even slow at 5-8%/year would be good too. Lightning Network will help with day to day transaction ease too.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:12:48
good point, I don't follow the other cryptos as much so yeah there might be some pressure. Though bitcoin hopefully will get lightning network adoption in 2018. Bitcoin may be acting more like a decentralised reserve currency and the alts are converted to transact. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:48:54
If you you used bitcoin core try right clicking on the transaction you sent and it should have the option to cancel it or resend with a new fee
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:15:03
Are you on a slow connection? There are various optimisations listed at  . I've not noticed too much recently, I only run the node for a few hours day though only get a max of about 21 connections.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:51:46
Sometimes I have the feeling that these little crashes are done on purpose so that the new Bitcoin futures and traditional investors can get in on it. It would just be easier if it just increases smoothly at 1-3% per day. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:50:26
I do kind of wonder what happens if most people keep their savings in bitcoin and only ever cash out to the local currency to buy things if they don't accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:29:56
It looks like quite a big transaction(lots of inputs) at 50.16 sat/B, so it could take another month or so I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:11:30
I believe ledger and trezor uses open source to interface so it may not rely on the existence of the company
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:47:50
may be?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:35:59
One thing that's good about the bitcoin core wallet is that all the other nodes need to agree with each other, so if there was a 'bad acting' piece of software that would get rejected as being not part of the software. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:37:32
True, I really want to encourage all the developers of bitcoin wallets to implement LN into their code.  Hopefully Bitcoin Core will implement it too. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:48:36
try r/BitcoinDiscussion/ seems to be good for that
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:15:46
My feeling is that it might push the price up more, it may even stabilise it in some sense to due their conservative nature. But it certainly won't make it hard to purchase small amounts of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:59:02
That is a really interesting bitcoin price calculator. I think it would be even better if it had a graph function too so you can add a simulation of the future value.  
Agreed, when the price of bitcoin stabilises people will be a bit disappointed although it would still be a power and high effective storage of value. Even it had a growth of only 5% per year it would be functionally more useful internationally as a means of exchange. It certainly looks like [logarithmic growth](
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:00:37
May be for food or accomodations, but technically most places will provide these within social services. May be liquidate to provide for someone in dire need that you care about? In terms of employment look for jobs that you don't mind doing, that seem useful to society etc even if it doesn't pay too much, or upskill, become passionate about something also helps too.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:01:32
Depending on your interest and amounts I think setting up [Bitcoin Core]( is a good way to go too. You can keep it on an external drive. Though you really need a clean computer.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:53:33
Oh well, I'm sure it will get through in the next few days there aren't too many unconfirmed transactions according to this 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:38:47
The core team is literally adding the GUI interface for segwit now, it will most likely be in the next version of bitcoin core. I'm hoping though it will be mostly invisible to the face of the wallet but it might be something a bit different too. But bitcoin core is able to handle and even create segwit addresses via the console I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:31:27
I don't think in the first instance it would need to. Both currencies could be included in a tax return. on the tax form you could be asked how much bitcoin did you receive during the year and how much local currency have you received.  If you owe the government tax in normal currency and the government can organise an appropriate tax rate for bitcoin. You send whatever bitcoins you owe the government to the government bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:01:26
good point :)

anyone can run a full node, it just really depends on your internet connection, as long as you are on large download plan
  see  for details
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:26:50
People are pretty positive towards Lightning Network here. It just takes a bit of a time to check the quality of the protocol, but it should be coming in a few months
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:04:55
yep that's pretty much it
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:32:24
I was just guessing, why do you say 12-18 months?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:39:13
Use [bitcoin core]( if you can
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:21:39
Anyone can create a bitcoin node, but yeah once there is a stable  desktop LN client available for macOS/windows/linux reddit admin would probably have one set up anyway so people could pay for reddit ads or gold using bitcoin directly. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:39:08
yeah I can see it has 8 confirmations already
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:03:45
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:44:45
just read the twitter feeds of the core developers at
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:12:23
I really don't think it is. The main reason is that anyone can run a node ( essentially any one with a bitcoin wallet in the future), in the same way that Bitcoin core can be run by anyone.  If you do run a big node then yes may be you might get targeted by authorities for AML/KYC obligations. But even if banks become nodes that's not much different to current bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin acts more like a distributed reserve currency, so having banks involved isn't a bad thing because it makes the banks transparent, they can't just print money or lend it haphazardly  because it is all publicly viewable.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:13:13
I'm really not sure how rapidly the value of bitcoin will get. it might go steady, go for a burst, go steady go up/down and so on.  
If it suddenly becomes easier to do transactions people may prefer to buy bitcoin as a savings account and just do lots of LN(Lightning network) transactions that even the banks might be interested in becoming part of.  If I could send a person 0.0001BTC with no or a tiny fee I would be giving bitcoin amounts all over the place, it wouldn't matter what the value of a whole bitcoin is, it could be 2 million dollars a coin but I could send people 0.00001BTC which would be $20 for may be 5 or 10 cents and it would instantly appear in your wallet anywhere in the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:03:54
This is a fair enough concern. May be ask more experienced people at Most people set these up in their garages external to their house I think. Make sure you have a smoke detector set up. Make sure you have your electric circuits checked by a professional electrician would be another. Have seperate circuit breaker may be?

It's just Christmas break so some people might pull out a bit of bitcoin to convert to fiat for presents or winter heating bills ( though if you use electricity to heat why not bitcoin mine and get some free heating and a few  fraction of bitcoin too)
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:58:08
that's fair enough. I guess if it only changed 5-10% over the year it might make everyone more comfortable. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:53:53
ahh, sorry, misread. May be set up an ad here in reddit via  
you could post in  but it has reddit history requirement
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:00:03
Yeah in principle it could be double spent if someone randomly found it. But then it would fail to confirm and be rejected by the network.  Yeah I think you are understanding that correctly. Again I'm not 100% sure
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:53:33
May be check also 
Pretty sure, if I read it correctly, for people on low incomes it isn't actually very much from what I read

Yeah I think we are all waiting for the lightning network to get more widely distributed so we can do micro transactions . As soon as that gets implemented then using bitcoin as an everyday operation will be a breeze.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:14:43
I think it's a good idea, despite some medium article thinking it's not good. Here is the reddit discussion why that article is not really valid

in the western world there is little no chance of a ban for the next 10 years I would guess. The only thing that is coming up is more scrutiny of know your customer (KYC) and Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.

is that wallet being developed as desktop macOS and iOS?

I would just wait it out a bit longer another 5-7 days. Your fee is pretty good I think
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:23:57
that too
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:34:51
Probably best to find an actual accountant. But as far as I know you need to declare only when you cash your bitcoin out. I'm not sure if you are just using it for living like for paying rent or something but you may need to pay some kind of capital gains tax. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:14:31
the lightning network will help this for micro transactions

Just get a wallet to start with. Then just offer something like tutoring, dog walking or something and ask to be paid in bitcoin rather than cash.  You could literally set up a lemonade stand or something like that and only offer bitcoin as payment. just ask for say 0.0005BTC to be sent to your receive address, print out your QR code and you are good to go, people can just pay you straight away.
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:34:43
People really shouldn't be getting loans for bitcoins. The point of bitcoin is just to put in an amount that you can use for transactions. Just store a bit in every week, you don't need a loan for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:37:38
If you are running on mac os you can just check the activity monitor usually and select the network tab, then select bitcoin core and it will show you bytes in and out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:53:27
The mempool is pretty full at the moment,  around 230K transactions, your fee is low so it is not high on the miners list.  Though I'm pretty confident it will get through in the next few days though. 
I used this blockchain tool to view your transaction details, 
in the top right corner you can convert between various currencies too .
edit. I also spotted the unconfirmed amounts coming in at

Or may be instead of running heating, help mine bitcoin transactions and get some heat too.  Or may be with the Lightning network there won't be as many transactions on the main chain in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:44:11
yeah that is pretty weird. The thing with the bitcoin network is that it doesn't seem to drop transactions usually. I've had a transaction unconfirmed since 11th December with a low fee and it seems to get rebroadcast every 2 weeks it seems and just gets stuck in the mempool.  But why Breadwallet would choose a zero fee seems very odd indeed, almost like a bug in the software it seems.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:39:27
Once the main bitcoin price is large the variations won't affect the smaller amounts as much.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:00:05
I don't think this could be the case because cryptography is a form of free speech I believe.

What is your set up? what is the price of electricity? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:02:35
I think the wallets need to have a particular kind of send/receive address for it to work. Not all wallets do this . I think it is especially important to wait for Bitcoin Core version v0.15.1 to get to v0.15.2 for it to be implemented. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:51:25
Just get a bitcoin wallet and just give your customers the QRcode and/or bitcoin receiving address.  The customers can use a mobile wallet to send bitcoin to that address. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:36:13
actually you might be able to right click on the transaction in core and there might be a 'increase transaction fee' option in the drop down menu
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:28:18
Why don't you just download a mobile bitcoin wallet  that is literally all you need. 
Then you could just ask people to donate to your bitcoin receive address. Or you could offer some kind of goods/service, like homework help, dog walking and ask to be paid in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:11:46
I think get bitcoin core and wallets is the first step though. Website frameworks are a really good idea too.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:07:10
nah, just hold for a few months and see how it looks. You didn't really need the money you put into it did you?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:12:01
To convert you really will need to register with a UK based bitcoin exchange, the one I've seen before that looks pretty good is  but just try a google search and you may find others too.

what is the origin of ' honey badger'? I've seen it before in reference to bitcoin but not sure what it means exactly
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:40:07
become a miner, join a pool. But the current bitcoin miners are basically really loud fans running like in this video 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:10:58
Seems like the fee was unnecessarily high for a low size of 223bytes.  I use this blockchain explorer
 , you can switch the currencies too
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:05:42
I guess for people that have no other banking system and if they only occasionally do a transaction it might be OK. I think that's why they are pushing for segwit and LN to help in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:31:17
What I don't understand in these transactions is if I offer to buy a house with bitcoin, why should I need to even cash it out first? In the article it says :
" Carina Isentaeva, a Redfin agent in San Francisco, recently helped a client write an offer on a luxury home in Silicon Valley that was contingent on the sale of cryptocurrency. The offer was accepted, but the buyer ended up backing out when his cryptocurrency didn’t sell. Isentaeva said she’s confident he will buy when it does."
If people buy a property with bitcoin surely the seller sets up a bitcoin wallet and the buyer just sends the bitcoin to the sellers receive address, end of story. What is this about cashing out? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:00:16
I don't think you need to have much in a lightning channel from what I read. You can always bring your lightning amounts back onto the blockchain. This FAQ covers this pretty well 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:30:45


I don't think you would be. I would assume that they may make a specific amount request through the channel, so if they don't send enough the transaction won't work and might close the channel , until you make the correct amount available. May be?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:24:18
yeah that makes sense. Yeah it might be client-side error, but other than that I'm not entirely sure.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:05:04
My understanding is that the amount just returns to the original wallet  it came from. I'm curious to see what happens to my transaction. 
Yeah I think it is competitive bid system, the more you pay the quicker the transaction it is going to be. There is also some kind of probability too, so the higher the fee the higher the probability of getting included in a recent block.  see also  
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:15:45
Such a good point!
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:38:48
Sometime in 2018 according to a recent video explanation of it 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:08:06
This is just my opinion,  but I think businesses that accept bitcoin as payment should keep their bitcoins as bitcoins for the most part, sure cash them out as you need them but if you can you should set up your own receive address and have a seperate wallet that is on your system.  This allows you to shop around to other exchanges to convert your bitcoin back to cash if you need to. Though I'm not sure how Etsy implements bitcoin payments so I can't be entirely sure if this is you best option.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:05:26
yeah it looks like the fee is a bit low, so it might take a week or more
edit I used:  to check it
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:27:55
I think I read somewhere that yes there is a tendency to save more in a bitcoin economy rather than spend. I think the point is that it more up to the individuals to decide when to spend a bit more it's for something that is really more worthwhile. 
The situation I think we have now is that people go into debt for undefined reasons just because the interest rates are low should you or can you really afford a $600,000 mortgage? a bitcoin economy tends to be more about saving up for something first and then you get it.  Bitcoin is kind of like a global collective bank account in someways. But if you need to use it to buy food/shelter you can still exchange for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:47:03
What does this mean? I thought this was cancelled months ago?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:29
ah ok then, yeah I think that makes sense now 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:58:35
lightning nodes would be SPV nodes like mobile wallets but I would imagine if you want to keep an channel open for a long period of time you would want a desktop client .  
I just think having as part of Bitcoin Core would be convenient so you can settle on the main block and see both LN transactions and main block transactions and help the decentralisation too, this might be true for a big node say if you had 100s of bitcoins worth of transactions running through it. 
Just as a side point, if you ran such a node you may still only need to open the channel only once per month and you only need get it confirmed with one transaction on the main block. This is how LN could help to scale thousands of transactions per second but only do one 'big transaction' on the main blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:30:20
From my experience it will get there eventually, in the next 7 days I think.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:58:14
How do you manage your bitcoin receive addresses? do you just one main one or different ones depending on the product or service you offer?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:40:31
There is a setting in electrum wallet I read on a help forum . I'll copy and paste the relevant bit"
You can customise your fees by going to Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Fees tab -&gt; Edit fees manually.  To decide what fee you want to pay, you could try having a look at [this page]( which estimates how long your transaction would take to confirm with different transaction fees. -[source via bitcointalk.org](
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:39:17
Bitcoin is highly divisible. So a single bitcoin can be broken down into 0.1, 0.01, 0.01, 0.001 and so on. So if you have only 0.01BTC that can be exchanged for normal currency of about $107 . But that same 0.01BTC next month might be worth $115
Have a play with [preev.com]( and you can get the idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:43:09
yeah I realise, but we still don't have widespread segwit adoption which is needed before LN can be used. I kind of think the value of bitcoin for 2018 will hover between US$13k-15k while these things get tested and slowly implemented. Bitcoin is still regarded as the safest most decentralised currency which has that going for it and that is not going to change so that is where it's value lies for the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:05:40
Just wanted to add that there is a lot of work to make bitcoin more easily accessible for micro transactions using something called the Lightning Network. So Bitcoin core is like a distributed reserve currency store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:54:08
are you using the current price for 1 unit = 1 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:39:05
With the lightning network transaction can be very fast in a few seconds or so. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:22:28
if you have a big download limit like over 1TB/month you can run it on a laptop easily. It just sits in the background most of the time for a few hours a day. The initial download though could take a week as it is about 164GB. But once it's all downloaded you can just run it when ever you feel like it and then it goes to download the latest part of the blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:41:29
this seems pretty unlikely at this stage
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:19:49
I think if you have clean computer keeping a copy of bitcoin core with your wallet and blockchain on an external SSD is a good option too since it is not always connected directly to the internet. Also you help confirm your savings and help the network out too.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:22:54
I just looked at it with 
and the fee looks somewhat low 211 sat/B, but I do think it will get there eventually , may be 7 or so days
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:39:33
People shouldn't have to rely on exchanges to buy sell bitcoin. The point of it is to do transactions with it, and yes you can store it too. Give people the opportunity to pay for goods/services in bitcoin. If you are a teen and offer tutoring or baby sitting or dog walking you could ask people to pay you in bitcoin fractions. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:04:59
Is coinbase insured to cover the cost of stolen private keys?

thanks for the clarification I wasn't entirely sure
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:34
not really. As far as I know net neutrality really only applies to large bandwidth content sites, like VoD. Bitcoin doesn't really use much data over the internet per se, but it is more about computing power.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:50:58
can you paste the message here?
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:24:37
As far as I can tell it is only a payment system called poli that is affected so far due to the holidays. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:39
yep  I would think they can implement the lightning network (LN) protocol pretty well, in fact they could be a hub/node for bitcoin LN
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:27:42
I'm not 100% sure but it is not just the miners that keep the blockchain accurate but it is rather those running bitcoin core that actually make sure the blockchain is accurate. The miners are confirming transactions and also solving cryptographic problems to generate new coins. When the bitcoin is all mined it is only the transaction fees, but that is very far into the future. see also 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:05:04
There is a good paragraph about this at  ,
 although the number of whole coins remains the same or slightly less than 21 million due to loss/destruction/hidden because it is highly divisible, those divisions can still have a value and remain relatively stable. That's my take on it anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:15:22
The analogy of the 2001 Monolith is pretty good. It does remind me of that classic scene at 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:53:50
Why can't you just dynamically change the price of your product base it in dollars so for example product A = $1000 today is also available for 0.07370
if the price of $ BTC changes you then say it is still $1000 and just adjust the BTC price you offer.  Just put 1000 into the  and use the BTC value that pops ups as what you charge for that day. 
Once you have the confirmation of payment in your exchange you can cash it in dollars then and there. It really depends on your exchange but you should be able to see your bitcoin receive address somewhere in your exchange profile. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:31:37
I think more lightning wallets are being developed for mid 2018
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:05:35
Yeah about 6-8 months, one video I watched said sometime during 2018

I think it is also due to the much larger computing capacity of the bitcoin network too. The other cryptos don't have as big a network. But bitcoin is having a scaling solution layered ontop of it called the Lightning Network, so in a sense it is future proofing itself.  By analogy the internet still runs on TCP (transmission control protocol) for the past 30 or more years.

yep it certainly is according to [xe.com USD - BTC](
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:29:21
yeah I noticed this too. I really like the idea that we could run an ASIC miner water heater, even if we only make 0.0002BTC per month, as long as it is relatively quiet, why not?

If it was using bitcoin core wallet you just need to get a copy of the wallet.dat file
Then may be boot up bitcoin core and it should show up
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:23:16
yeah I think pretty much that's what happens, I have sent a transaction with 0.0001 fee on the 11th December 2017 and it still hasn't been confirmed but it does show in my bitcoin wallet as pending. A few months ago I did a similar transaction and it took ages but eventually got there. 
You could try   that might help

6 to 8 months is my guess. As soon as we see a LN iOS wallet and a desktop Windows/macOS with LN that can left open. I really hope that Bitcoin Core wallet will include LN too. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:06:58
My understanding is that you don't need a direct channel with Maccas. Someone else or many other people or other corporate organisations, So Westpac may have connection to Maccas via LN and you may have a connection to Westpac so would have opened a channel  to the LN Maccas node via Westpac.

not really sure this is a 'nice' thing to do. If you are 'hurting' it means you put in too much to begin with I think. The point of bitcoin is the social nature of it, if more people hold then it holds it value a bit more. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:50:06
What about the upcoming lightning network? surely that can really help, bitcoin core becomes like the main reserve decentralised bank store and lightning you can use to shift small amounts of money that you need for goods/services?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:41:43
This seems accurate
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:44:36
is good starting point
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:15:11
I guess you could send a big amount (like may be 0.01BTC) to the wallet with that tiny amount in it, then those amounts get added together, then choose the option to 'spend all' to another address
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:42:57
that's good to know
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:33:44
The very basic reason is that bitcoin has the most security in terms of development, more peer review, and it is the most decentralised version of any cryptocurrency for the scale of it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:59
yeah, it looks very wavy on btcmarkets atm
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:32:02
The difficulty of mining bitcoin is so high now that you need specialised equipment to have a hope of hashing anything. If you get [one of these running]( you might have a chance. but it makes a lot of noise.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:26:24
I suspect that this is going to take several weeks to confirm or after about 2 weeks it might expire and you should have your funds back in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:56:59
I think this is a good use case, if you need the money then use it. May be buy a bit more bitcoin into your bitcoin wallet now to replenish it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:27:36
yeah that's the one, there is a function in it that you can prune the blockchain down to about 5GB I think , more info at

 seems to have no transactions
Can you copy the addresses and paste them here, it's hard to see them properly and we might mistype them
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:42:38
This is actually pretty impressive
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:34:12
Yeah, it due to the price of bitcoin being pretty high. It's pretty hard to move bitcoins now for a reasonable price.  you basically can't send $10 worth of bitcoin at the moment.  It might take a week or more to get it confirmed. you should be able to set a fee manually 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:51
it might go ±10% anytime
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:33:50
My understanding with an LN node that you could actually earn something by charging a small fee, so if I handle a 1BTC node and 1000people use 0.001 each I might charge 0.00001 per transaction which gives me 0.01BTC or something like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:57:17
ask to be paid for work in bitcoin and give them your receive address
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:56:09
yeah I agree that's technically true. The block space does represent transactions though doesn't it? People coming into bitcoin are often told to get their coins of the exchange and into their own wallets. So there might be more demand for bitcoin transactions to move coins to other wallets. Also I think there might be a lot of transaction volume going from various exchanges around the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:46:11
There is a subreddit at which has links to resources and discussions. I really hope there in the future that bitcoin core wallet shows lightning in it 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:45:45
there are a bunch of website that can calculate your return based on various factors. But a single ASIC miner S9 would cost about $3000 or so, check eBay . Also you can do a calculation here at [cryptocompare.com](

Could it also stabilise bitcoin price more? or is it like that prison fight meme on the front?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:37:10
Let say you bought 0.005BTC at $15,000 = 0.005 X 15,000 = $75
If you still have that 0.005BTC when the price gets to $50,000 then that is 50,000 X 0.005 = $250
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:29
yeah, pretty much. It is hard to see a dip especially on different exchanges it behaves differently too.

I kind of wonder hypothetically in 10 years time say if bitcoin becomes a widespread method of transaction would you pay tax in bitcoin? say if you paid your landlord in bitcoin and not in fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:30:58
I think it really depends on where you are buying your bitcoins from to get a notifier for that exchange. Some exchanges offer some kind of standing order system where if you have fiat funds you can set it buy a certain amount at certain price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:45:40
1. bitcoin is a distributed network, so any bad behaving node will get rejected/banned
2. Western governments are very unlikely to ban it as bitcoin is viewed as functional asset with utility. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:03:59
Do they really mean they want to use the bitcoin blockchain or do they mean their own blockchain? As long as they can exchange between both it should be ok.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:12:31
Why not start by downloading a mobile wallet listed at  and then at least you are able receive bitcoin. You could offer goods or services, dog walking or something in exchange for 0.001 bitcoin.

Help them set up a wallet on their phone, choose one where you can set the fee manually ( ArcBit is good at this, I think also Breadwallet too) . Then ask them for some cash , like a $20 note and then send them that amount.

Wouldn't it be good if banks invest into bitcoin though? it might make bitcoin more stable and less likely to fail. 
If the bottom falls out  I don't think it would have any significant effect on the wider economy especially at this stage.

@_date: 2017-12-02 04:33:36
Yeah I have no idea really other than that graph. There seems to be a lot of optimism for $100,000 by 2020 or so though. But realistically it is very hard to predict this kind of thing. I do think it will go up most of the time and might find a stable point for a while.

So does this mean if a person turns off their phone the transaction gets cancelled? I guess if the transaction get stopped half way it will cancel. But once it is finalised and exchanged the channel can be closed. but I'm not sure exactly tbh
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:51:28
But isn't the use of exchanges a good thing, since most people will keep their coins there and if they need to cash them out they can do that with pretty low fees most of the time?  May be try to contact Bitcoin core at [their Twitter account](
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:47:18
Also I think it is valuable from a technical perspective too. IN the sense that it has certain properties that are valuable specifically that you can't double spend or replicate bitcoins due to their very powerful cryptographic properties.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:37:33
not really, I think people are using is as a distributed store of value and transfer. The dotcom bubble was thinking more that lots of people would pay for web services , but ended up not working. Bitcoin is more of cryptographic protocol with a monetary value attached. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:16:38
or governments could just start with setting up their own government bitcoin wallets at their own reserve banks or treasuries with their own receive addresses. It literally requires nothing more than a single laptop with bitcoin core, a back up, or even a cold storage set up.

I think the nodes are only used for routing the transactions, they don't really store anything per se. If a large node closes then the transactions just get re-routed to other smaller nodes. There might be a slowing of opening/closing new nodes. That's how I understand it. But I might be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:18:07
yeah true that
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:20:09
The Bitcoin Lightning Network will allow you to use bitcoin as a currency for daily micro transactions using the bitcoin core as a kind of central but decentralised reserve bank.

@_date: 2017-12-09 22:26:55
I think a lot of transactions in countries already use electronic transfers of moneys I don't think it would be that big of difference. But remember that bitcoin does require the internet to function, so in 3rd world countries people would need lots of free wifi and access to smart phones.

ah, well if you run bitcoin core, you would get a pretty immediate notification that a payment has come in. When ever I send bitcoins to my bitcoin core wallet I get a notification almost as soon as I press  send from the other wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:52:36
yeah I know, for the stock market that would be a bad day. I guess 20% may be? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:13:50
yeah I can certainly appreciate that. So I guess for the moment it is best to use bitcoin for larger transactions. paying around 0.0005 seems to be ok for the moment I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:36:34
In the long run they all might use some kind of lightning network (LN) in some way but bitcoin will have the highest value reserve currency value in a sense because it has the highest level of security due to the larger hashing power needed to double spend transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:32:27
totally understandable. I don't think you should need to transfer to a new wallet though, it should be fixed and updated by the developers.  I'm optimistic that these fixes will help. LN enabled wallets/nodes I really believe will be exactly what we are looking for, though I suspect it won't be for another year. I made a visual [mock up of Bitcoin core with LN]( that I really hope would get included down the track.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:36:58
yeah I was wondering about this , why is litecoin going up so high?
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:06:34
well Bitcoin core does offer mBTC and µBTC, so at the moment 2mBTC  is about 20 dollars  or  20µBTC is about 20 US cents
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:34:43
Why not just buy 0.02BTC? that's about $300
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:26:20
My feeling is that common wallet software will have effectively 2 sets of transactions in them. The main bitcoin amounts and the lightning amounts.  I made a [GUI mock up]( of what I think it might look like for bitcoin core with LN. But I'm not really sure exactly.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:26:54
ah that makes sense then
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:11:50
there are no LN wallets available at this stage. It is still in testing phase
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:48:51
it's a bit of shame they focus on the whole bitcoin price. I kind of hope the price doesn't go below 9k now. I mean if you bought even 0.04BTC at $9000 and it goes to $15000 you still doing really well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:35:11
Agreed. In Australia it costs $30 to send bank account to overseas bank account, and it might take a day or 2 to complete. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:36:10
You need to import your private key into a new wallet of your choice
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:06:43
well it should show up in a wallet, it just will say unconfirmed that's all. I think the reason why the fees are so high is because the difficulty in solving that mathematical cryptographic puzzle that confirms transactions is extremely difficult needing a huge amount of computing power, also the software only allows a set amount to be created every ten minutes.  
The solution to these smaller transactions is the Lightning Network but that is still in testing phase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:27:29
I think it can take up to 14 days with low fees I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:25:28
I don't think so. I mean I guess individuals could advertise it themselves but it is literally like advertising 'The Internet' . 
That said, I do think that 2nd layer operators could benefit from advertising in the future like "be your own bank, send bitcoin lightning fast with zap wallets for less than 1 cent to anyone connected". But I don't think we are there quite yet

It's more than just proof of work I think, it's also the fact you can't double spend or create fake bitcoins due to the extreme cryptographic hashing requirements. Also you don't need a bank account to be part of it, you can be stateless and yet be part of an economy. It also can't be taken from you arbitrarily, i.e. your funds can't be seized or frozen.

@_date: 2017-12-23 08:40:58
This article seems to hinge on the definition of 'useful' which is also another word for value.  The cryptographic hashing in bitcoin is in fact useful work because it secures the value of the coins produced, in other words it makes the coins very difficult to replicate even with large amounts of hash power.  The work is useful because we value uniqueness in the transactions. Building of a house is also 'useful proof of work' because it provides value of shelter, but you can replicate millions of the same house, so the value of the house might not be very high because the houses are not necessarily unique. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:19:38
I'm pretty sure it is also very dependent on the exchanges. For example gemini exchange quotes a price of $17494. gdax is $17,559.9, bitstamp is $17270.18
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:55:26
I think Bitcoin is more like the decentralised reserve currency of the internet at this stage. We should not be using it do small coffee transactions but for moving larger amounts of funds to areas that need money. The transfer fees in bitcoin are still comparable to international bank wire transfers that often cost around $20 from bank account to bank account, bitcoin is still faster taking only about 8 hours or less in some cases to confirm many times. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:44:26
It might settle down at some value and cruise for a while
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:43:01
not sure but I did find this question in the Segwit FAQ :
Is the segregated witness soft fork equivalent to a 4 MB block size increase, a 2 MB increase, a 1.75 MB increase, or what? I keep hearing different numbers.
The current proposal for soft fork segregated witness (segwit) replaces the block size limit with a new block cost limit, counting each byte of witness data as 1 unit of cost and UTXO transaction data as 4 units; as a result, the maximum size of a block becomes just under 4 MB.
However, blocks are not expected to consist entirely of witness data, so blocks near 4 MB in size would be unlikely.
According to some calculations performed by Anthony Towns, a block filled with standard single-signature P2PKH transactions would be about 1.6 MB and a block filled with 2-of-2 multisignature transactions would be about 2.0 MB. It is further likely that future scaling improvements, such as Lightning, may slightly improve the ratio such that filled blocks become larger than 2 MB.

I checked on another blockchain explorer 
and it looks like it's just the fee is a bit low due to mempool congestion . I'm pretty confident it will get through eventually, may be in about 7-10 days. The mempool is getting a little smaller each day which improves the chance this transaction will get picked up.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:52:13
I think it is literally just their number of customers. Bigger exchanges have more exchanges happening so can do more 'bulk' activities. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:26:31
I think bitcoin seems to have a sort of baseline growth that gets disrupted on occasion by the classic pump and dump. If you just look at this [graph over the past 10 days]( it looks quite strange.
I would say that yes there can be occasional bubbles with in the growth, may be bitcoin could be more 'froth' or cumulative  'bubbly' . It looks like if the price increases too rapidly it gets corrected back to a baseline. As many others have said this is an early adoption phase but it needs to be more steadily adopted I think.  Ideally if bitcoin found a nice steady growth for a few years and then flatlined at some base level it would be fine. 
Just one other thing I realised. People wonder about mining, the mining is capped at 1 block every ten minutes or so. So if there are less miners the complexity of the cryptography is reduced to match. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:59:07
most people are buying fractions of bitcoins which have a value and associated public private key transaction. for example. 1BTC = $22,000 0.1BTC = $2,200, 0.01BTC = $220, 0.001BTC = $22 and so on. Each of these is regarded as different transaction if sent separately. Each block has a certain amount of a whole bitcoin in it. So for example Bitcoin's first block halving happened on November 28, 2012. The block reward dropped from 50 bitcoins per block to 25 per block.

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:09:17
I think as soon as there is a GUI interface for Segwit in the next version of Bitcoin Core 15.2 perhaps? it will will really help all wallet developers implement Segwit more widely. I believe Breadwallet is going to add segwit in their next version early next year too.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:14:42
I'm not sure about the technicalities but I was told in another thread about lightning network that it will eventually become part of any/all bitcoin wallets so that would imply the lightning network is as distributed as the number of wallets there are so the wallets would be controlling the channels. But again, I'm not entirely sure
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:08:15
yeah, you realise that is the equivalent of $US4,785,000 , if it is one transaction then the fee would be about 0.002416BTC to get it confirmed faster
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:26:19
This seems like a good price for new futures markets to get in. It's also a good time for anyone to buy in for the concept of a decentralised currency.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:28:43
To  be honest, the best thing you can do is just [download the bitcoin core app]( it does take a while but that literally then makes you are able to control your bitcoins and create receive addresses you can print out as QRcodes for your customers. It really isn't that hard and it gives your customers the option. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:48:11
Thanks for asking this question, I'm curious about this too. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:16:21
Yeah I was wondering about this too. I tend to use  , it has a nice interface and can switch currencies too also has a QR reader too
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:11:34
Yeah I just checked another blockchain explorer too  and couldn't see it. It may well be that because the fee is zero it has been dropped? 
oh I found it on this blockchain explorer
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:07:40
here have 2 milliBTC that's about $US32 at the moment. Just waiting for lightning network and will be able to send people $2 for fun with essentially no transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:25:30
bitcoin for the most part operates in fractions of bitcoins. so each smaller fraction increases in value. 0.01 was worth $100, 0.001 then might worth $100  0.0001 is $100 and so on. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:55:57
The stealing of bitcoin is still a criminal act so yes, in fact you would go to the police to report a theft, in fact with a gun involved that is regarded as an aggravated assault I think. Wouldn't it be the same as someone forcing you to use your PIN to access your card, same process. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:25:37
do you know if there are any test wallets that work on iOS or macOS?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:43:55
I think the time intervals between the two events might be too short. It might be that banks take a few days to transfer the cash too. Not all money is instantly available in the real world unlike bitcoin which can essentially move instantly.  Sometimes real world money appears to move instantly but often really it is held in blocks, gets authorised, audited etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:32:35
May be a slight dip before the CME futures comes into play on Sunday, if it is low investors of futures can be more confident of profit when the futures contract is set to sell. I think that's how it might work. But check  for more information
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:45:36
Yeah that's true, if BTC gets to $100,000 having a 1% change might be such a big deal then
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:09:05
I wonder if you can sweep up remainders in a wallet ( though it would be expensive) by transferring some really large amount like 0.0063 into the wallet with a small amount and then choose the 'send all function' back to your ledger address. the fee would pretty large around 0.002 I would guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:01:55
So I guess people are not really buying property with bitcoins but used bitcoin as an investment vehicle. People are just comparing the going price of a bitcoin to the equivalent of cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:22:45
Actually bitcoin is fairly competitive with international bank account wire transfers. In Australia for example it cost $30 to send money directly to an overseas account and it takes 1-3 days to process 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:43:28
exactly! but it might take a while to get to a whole bitcoin at this stage . So you would need to buy about $373 every week for 52 weeks. You might be able to buy in the dips though. But don't forget that the value of even small parts of bitcoin go up at this stage all the time.  So 0.01921BTC = $373 today but next year 0.0192 might be worth twice or 3 times that which would be $1,119 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:15:42
Good point. I guess may be you can use a lower fee for the initial amount. Though banks often take about a day to transfer funds too. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:50:54
Here is an older video that talks about off chain for smaller transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:53:47
I would agree, once 2nd layer systems like LN are more widespread, bitcoin becomes a potential savings account and LN like a day to day checking account.

If people use electric heating in their houses in the winter they could be mining bitcoin at the same time. If only bitcoin ASIC miners were quiet, more people would get them. You could also just use solar power too.

May be try  , but I have no idea, pretty sure all are https,

It would need a consensus but it would also create a hard fork.  There is some discussion here 
also a discussion of why only 21 million bitcoins

What about running Core a few hours a day? is that good too?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:07:21
I like those analogies
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:33:09
To be honest I'm not sure why governments wouldn't want to embrace bitcoin. The treasury could have a number of bitcoin receive addresses to give people the option to pay taxes or whatever in bitcoin. It would keep the government 'honest' because the value of bitcoin is no longer defined by the government but everyone in the system. You could quote prices in local currency or bitcoin. But at that point tiny amounts of bitcoin would be worth a huge amount. people might have a salary in the range of mBTC or µBTC. So currently a person might earn 6,000 mBTC ($67,850) per year. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:57:43
I'm not sure but there isn't really any reason why a good reviewed seller wouldn't want to help out. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:53:39
I would be surprised if it crashed so much. If I recall correctly it was due to silk road events.  I feel there are more serious investors in the system now. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:56:29
 is the main one, it consists of mostly individual sellers I believe. like eBay for bitcoin I guess.
edit: I read further in the thread and yeah I see issues with that

Thanks for researching this ,well I nuked it, well as much as you can on reddit.

Does it matter you don't have UK ID? as long as you have some ID. I would keep trying with a local exchange.  Most rules are more about AML and KYC
Try  which has an address in the UK, or  looks even more specific to the UK.

It probably has several peaks, it might be more like a mountain range. This year will be interesting to see how it progresses, it could get to around $40,000. Bitcoin is following more of an [S-curve](
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:28:55
I've also had a transaction although small, for over 2 weeks now also. In the past . 
I've been looking around and found this blockchain explorer and it seems to give an estimate on when it might get confirmed  I tried it with my old transaction and it looks like it got rebroadcast on the 25th
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:23:21
My rough understanding why they moved from gold, I think back in 1971, was because it was holding back the amount of money available to the federal reserve and reduced economic growth, if the federal reserve can declare money into existence out of thin air , with a future promise it might get paid back, more projects and business could be developed. Some one feel free to add to this. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:43:44
What wallet did you use?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:57:37
I think what they mean is hold until it becomes really cheap to do transactions on LN for example. As a holder in the future I guess you could run a node and make money from lots of tiny transaction fees may be?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:53:56
Lightning is trustless because it relies on the blockchain , also it contains hashed signatures which can't be forged or broken because it was generated by the blockchain originally.

Not sure if it will have that much of an effect depending on what they are wanting to buy in fiat currency. Once bitcoin gets to large values it may not be necessary to cash out very much to get what you want. In theory you can pay rent in bitcoin in someplace, but even if you can't you can just convert to local currencies pretty easily. In Australia you can pay your rent or bills using 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:08:07
yeah they are at also check out 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:07:16
If the transaction still appears in a blockchain explorer like  it most likely means it is still in the mempool .  Transactions don't really expire from what I've read , so it might just get randomly picked up at some point.  Since you used Bitcoin core I think it still will say it is in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:34:15
do you mean you don't have a spare $50 per week or that you are not sure about how to buy bitcoins on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:14:33
seems unlikely, because there are futures trading in bitcoin there is more incentive to hold and keep the price fairly stable I think
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:45:18
may be try

I just like the idea that even a kid with a lemonade stand could have a bitcoin receive address and not have to pay any significant fee
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:00:25
My feeling is that it stabilises because I get the impression that the BTC network is at capacity mostly, and utility is harder.  Also when I do a [S-curve plot]( it seems to fit it nicely with the current price showing a classic tapering. Of course it will do what it wants in the end. But because there are futures in it there are a lot more hodlers that keep it within an interval value . But really still just guessing
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:34:39
thanks for that, I've added an edit to the top of the post
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:12:29
The lightning network will act as the main day to day micro transactions , so in theory each government department could have it's own wallet that people could send bitcoin taxes to ( even small amounts of mBTC, µBTC). The main bitcoin blockchain becomes the reserve bank of the world currency. Each country would end up with different fractions of bitcoin. If needed you can move the decimal place accuracy of bitcoin without increasing the number of whole coins. if say one bitcoin gets valued at say 2-5 million dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:18:56
When lightning network is up and running a bit more and implemented into common wallets it will be much easier to do day to day transactions. But most businesses still will want to convert to the local currency.  May be if bitcoin gets to a much higher valuation so that there is less volatility in the price you might see businesses offer a price in dollars and price in mBTC or µBTC
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:41:36
one of the features built into the original bitcoin core recognised this I feel because they have settings to change from BTC to mBTC (milliBTC) and even µBTC (microBTC). So in the future you can be talking about buying a coffee for (200µBTC about $3.50), So right now 1 mBTC = $US17.24, a yearly salary of is about 3,471mBTC ($60,000)
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:22:13
Lightning network incorporated into wallets in the near future (thinking within 6 months or so) will reduce fees significantly, especially for small transactions. Doing a large BTC transaction on the main network would depend a bit more on the whole bitcoin price, but the bitcoin transaction fee may well go down too. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:20:31
no, I'm in Australia
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:49:18
I think the problem with this is that it really depends on the exchange you are looking at too. they can vary by as much as ±$500 at a moments notice.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:52:00
yeah that makes more sense. So I wonder then if this can be implemented/added into existing wallets, like Bread, Artbit etc and may be even bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:56:06
I'm excited. But will the lightning network work like the Bitcoin Core App so that anyone can download something like a 'Lightning Network Core App' and have it run in the background on their computer to help the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:46:35
thanks, sorry about this I didn't realise this at all, I'll delete my original post.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:33:21
If bitcoin acts like gold then major investors might buy more bitcoin as a 'safe haven'. My feeling is that financial crisis tend to be more about people with low cash flow causing a knock on effect, i.e. bad loans that people can't repay. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:17:58
just use  , they even have a Bpay option.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:42:18
I really don't think this will be an issue. Firstly we need to have wallet developers create wallets that can actually use the LN protocol. At the moment I think there is only one or may be two.  
If people actually use mobile bitcoin wallets that use LN protocol it will actually reduce the number of smaller 'test' transactions enormously. For example you would be able to get your friends into bitcoin heaps easier. 
You have LN enabled wallet, you have a friends with a LN enabled wallet and you would be able to send them like $2 worth of bitcoin with virtually no fees at all.  Yes it gets sent to the main bitcoin blockchain eventually but as far as what it says on your wallet it will say it is confirmed. Well that's how I see it anyway.   If you haven't seen this video it explains it here 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:04:38
Once we get the lightning network established, literally you can replace cash with smartphone apps and do transactions with anyone for very little.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:15:41
If you are really interested in helping bitcoin you can install [Bitcoin core]( on your computer if you have good bandwidth and are confident your system is clean. You should read a bit more about wallets etc on the official site  
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:45:02
do you think that's because it's easier to do smaller transactions with litecoin? less fees etc?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:52:16
it's pretty much a waiting game. I tried to send a transaction with a fee of 0.0001 from Arcbit wallet on the 11 of December and it has not confirmed. It is theoretically due to expire on the 25th of December. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:03:31
First question: I think the point of LN is you don't need a middle man, it uses an encrypted star contract that uses the concept of 'proof of stake' of your bitcoin amount in your channel. 
second question: essentially same as first question you have encrypted the agreement of funds
third: I don't think there is any specific limit funds, I think there is a max but you may only need to have as much funds as you want. Essentially a lightning channel would be like a checking account from my understanding. 
See also this informative video about it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:51
yeah that fee is really low, so I think that transaction will be not looked at and be dropped in 14 days , the money will just return to the original wallet. So check again on Sunday, 31 December 2017
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:21:38
For people not sure about what this is my preliminary google search results in a good article here 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:43:27
I'm just excited by having micro transactions for bitcoin. So people can pay $0.10 to view a page or something like that. Some kid selling lemonade you could pay them something too. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:53:27
There is not very much reliable information that this is going to be a thing at this stage as far as I can tell. I've checked bitcoincore.org and can't find any mention of this event so it won't be part of the main bitcoin, so it would need to be called another coin I suspect. But I'm not really an expert so I can't be sure.
edit: [digging around]( I think it will be called Bitcoin United
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:35:57
Arcbit is pretty good , you can manually set fees if you need to. also listed on the official bitcoin.org website too.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:19:05
what if steam offers bitcoin payments via the lightning network next year?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:36:20
Yeah I noticed that on one of my transactions too. I found this link that suggests you need to delete a file 
I've copied the relevant bit here:
Bitcoin Core
Bitcoin Core makes making Full RBF transactions very easy. Simply go to the transactions list, right click the transaction that is stuck, and choose the "Abandon Transaction" option.
If that option is greyed out, then you must go to the Bitcoin Core datadir and delete the mempool.dat file. Then restart Bitcoin Core with the -walletbroadcast=0 option and then you should be able to use "Abandon Transaction".
If the above two options fail for some reason, then you can start Bitcoin Core with the -zapwallettxes option to clear all unconfirmed transactions from your wallet.
Once the transaction is either Abandoned or cleared from the wallet, you can simply go to the Send tab and send the Bitcoin again but make sure that you include a sufficient transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:23:56
I think it means people would want to save their money in bitcoin because the value of bitcoin increases. It seems to be slightly counter intuitive though. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

This is really encouraging, thanks for running that simulation!
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:28:47
It's a system in final testing phase for sending micro transactions of bitcoin. There should be lightning enabled wallets available perhaps in 6 months.

it might be explained at about this point here in this video explanation 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:03:29
I think lightning network is still on testnet at this stage
but check also they might have something
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:25:00
Using the compound interest formula though 10% per day with 365  interest periods compounding daily is too high I think.  Here is the [formula I used on wolfram alpha]( but only using 1%.  If someone wants to play around with the assumptions a bit more it's closer to $60,000 near the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:30:18
yeah pretty much
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:47:52
I agree with your sentiment. When normal people have spare or more money they are more likely to be able help others when they have no debt i.e. spend for other goods and services.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:41
I think that is more that the ledgers on the bitcoin blockchain is decentralised. Any one with a laptop or normal computer can run Bitcoin Core and hence help with decentralisation.  I think the miners power is more to do with hashing power and the security of the coins themselves, but it is still really hard to do anything with older transactions.  There is a discussion about this point here 
edit: If you really want to keep decentralised , if you have the spare computer and bandwidth, even for a few hours you should run 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:11:03
my understanding is that the amounts with some nodes can remain open for indefinite periods of time and as long as they have enough funds in the channel they can continue a transaction.  But I'm not entirely sure. There is a good discussion about this at 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:51:32
As the other replies have suggested it depends on your wallet if it has a cancel function but usually wallets don't. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:06:11
From what I read in other comments, a major issue is that BCH is very centralised to only a few mining groups
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:27:35
May be mid to late January 2018? Purely guessing here. Unless you want to pay a 0.003254BTC fee
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:56:18
Sorry you needed that wallet.dat file, I mean unless you can I.D the original drive you might be able to recover the wallet.dat file because when they wipe the disk it usually just wipes the file directory, unless they zeroed the disk.

Nothing is really happening other than hard forks. The nature of bitcoin is that it is open source so anyone can make a fork

I think  is regulated, it says on their about page:
 " We are a fully regulated, fully compliant, New York-based digital asset exchange for both individuals and institutions. We are regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) and held to the highest level of capital reserve requirements and banking compliance standards."
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:59:14
I think it helps a lot it is open source so people can set up their own LN wallets
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:00:48
I like to think that the most this will do is to make the value of bitcoin to go flat for a bit. I think this will only affect some exchanges that are part of the futures exchange, I'm not sure which ones though. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:40:17
I think they do. The fees are listed at the bottom of the page at  it looks like it is 0.38%
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:19:54
I think it will get confirmed in another 4-8 days but it does look like a slightly more complex transaction 191.94 sat/B
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:49:00
Just go to  and the top right is a download button. Install the software. I would make sure it puts the block chain onto a seperate hard drive though. Sit and wait a few days for it to download completely. You can quit it when you need to and restart it when you need to and it will pick up from where it left off
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:47:40
yeah, I think there are ways but they are complicated, like -zapwallettxes but I'm not sure how to do that. I have a stuck transaction sent from a different wallet and it's the same thing for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:54:35
basically because the contract exists off the exchange. I think the lightning network is based on the idea of 'proof of stake' . I think when the channel is closed it gets sent safely to the bitcoin blockchain ( actually I think it is already on the blockchain)
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:47:52
pretty much this. I think there is even a button on github called 'fork this' or something.

According to a [log graph that goes around]( it wouldn't be until around may be 2040 or 2050 I think
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:35:27
isn't it the other way around though?  "without the blockchain there is no bitcoin"  I can have some random string of characters like tghs886782355ggfhii12ff is essentially worthless and possibly meaningless unless it originated from the block chain or has been verified in it somewhere.  The block chain is actually the somewhat cumbersome part as it is a huge file (a ledger essentially) that in principle everyone should carry with them.  Doesn't the value of bitcoin come from the computational power to generate verifications/encryptions? that's roughly my understanding.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:49:31
I think also more wallets ( I believe Breadwallet next year) and bitcoin core in the next version will be implementing active Segwit addresses to help with the mempool size. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:32:46
I just watched a video with Andreas and he was explaining that the CME futures probably won't be as bad as people think. Really interesting video here 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:25:49
What's the transaction ID? it could be that the wallet is rebroadcasting it to the mempool
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:12:25
ah ok that makes sense. But if a hacker found a way to get into thousands of coinbase accounts coinbase would not cover that? Can account holders see their private keys in their account settings somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:55:23
when did you do your previous transaction? if it was like 3-4 weeks ago it was a bit quicker for sure. The mempool is really full and the miners tend to favour transactions with fees in the order of 0.003BTC I think
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:35:14
just check  once it gets below about 90,000 then try moving them, use a proper fee of something like 0.001 and it should get there after 4 hours I think.
the mempool is purged after 14 days if I recall correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:49:38
pretty sure the best is to use  it should geolocate you and there should be options to choose from. But the first step I think is to get a bitcoin wallet. You could use a bitcoin ATM too.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:32:23
sure why not? the bitcoin core network is like your savings account essentially, so if you can make an instant 0.0002BTC payment for a coffee with no fee or a tiny fee like 0.00002 seems like a good deal to me
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:17:05
Have you tried  ? they look more professional . You do need to bear in mind now most bitcoin businesses still require AML (anti money laundering) and KYC (know you customer) laws.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:34:13
probably not for another 6-8 months at least , so realistically not for another year, may be early to mid 2019 and then a bit more wallet adoption in 2020
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:07:48
I guess you can sort of hide it, but if the auditors come they might be able to trace the transaction from the exchange, like they could get a warrant to view your exchange account it would have a record of the address you sent it to. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:44:59
Well it's been 3 minutes on gdax and it still looks ok
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:11:49
The last coins are very far into the future as far as I know. But I think say there is a reduction in miners ( i.e. hash power) the bitcoin algorithm will get easier so that transactions don't need as much power to have them confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:52:11
yeah that's true. I guess I'm being optimistic about things in a sense that the government may even offer to pay their staff in bitcoin too if they opt to. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:00:26
no worries, sha256 is really hard to solve so it is used as proof of work in the bitcoin network.
To calculate your profitability here is a hand calculator, just play around with the settings 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:33:26
well if the price of bitcoin increases even by 5% per day it's still pretty good
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:30:01
sorry I'm not a miner, though I've always wondered if this would be a good reason to become a miner. I'm not sure on the technicalities but I'm not sure if miners can mine/confirm a transaction directly

I suggest you check this online calculator 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:37:50
Pretty much have to wait for LN.  Bitcoin is not really for small transactions these days, it's acting as storage like an offshore bank account for people who can't trust their own governments to keep their money safe or useful. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:57:13
I'm pretty sure this only applies to direct 'pay anyone' type payments from your personal accounts. BPay still seems to work with BTCmarkets. Bitcoin.com.au still allows sells but you need to do a manual cash deposit at ANZ or westpac 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:41:21
bitcoin-qt is too intense for most people. Tbh I think it is better to just get them to download a mobile wallet and then just transfer some small amount to them from you and then explain all the features. 
I just checked the process of importing a private key into Arcbit wallet ( presumably others are similar) but you may need to enable advanced settings then you import by scanning the QR code. It's also kind of unfair to keep their private keys I think and misses the point. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:35:02
ah thanks for letting me know, I'll check their site now
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:25:54
Do you think Bitcoin Core wallet will have Lightning Network included in it in the future? I really think it would help personally. I even made a very rough visual mock up of it  , obviously it would need to include send bitcoin to/via Lightning option. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:17:27
I think you need to first look at your current real world financial status. All you mention is borderline shitty job, borderline, it sounds like it might not be that bad. 
But 70 BTC is about $US800,000 which is certainly enough to buy a house. From that perspective I would consider buying a nice property, but bear in mind the costs of up keep etc.  But if you are single I would start with something fairly small.  You don't need to cash out that much. The price has been relatively stable/rising for the past few months.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:48:55
you're most welcome!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:17:44
I would assume that coinbase should be able to cash you out at the current price but it may take a day or so for the funds to end up in your account. disclaimer: I'm in Australia so I can get funds to my nominated account within about a day. Coinbase fees are here, scroll down to the end of the page 
looks like if you have something called ACH transfer it is free though
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:20:58
I didn't think the hub fees were high at all, in fact they may be close of zero if needed, but it would need lots of lightning wallets to be running that can talk to a wide range of hubs like mentioned in the video 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:42:21
Bitcoin has a much higher hash power, uses SHA256 vs Scrypt on litecoin, which means that bitcoin needs far more computing power to double spend or duplicate a coin
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:42:04
I think it's just at the last half of the year 2017 that there has been more serious testing of LN. For some curious reason people suddenly thought bitcoin was ready for a huge influx of value and didn't realise it would impact the cost of transactions. Although many people leave their bitcoins on exchanges, then come to and are told to get their bitcoin off the exchange and on to hardware wallets. My feeling is that the value of bitcoin for the rest of the year will just sit at around 14-17k , it's an open source project who have no financial incentive to progress too fast and are more interested in the technical robustness of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:29:55
I think the main thing that bothers some people is the volatility and perhaps the energy associated with confirming transactions. 
 I think it is technically sound though. May be securing your own coins is too much trouble, forgetting passwords etc. Though tbh there are ways of having bitcoin literally like cash , just have your private key visible but keep it physically hidden, so you don't need to worry about forgetting a password. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:17:02
As others have said Korea might have an influence but in a more general sense it is because bitcoin is more a social currency and follows social networking type models rather than commodity models.  So bitcoin is sensitive to social behaviours and actions. In a sense bitcoin might be best measured using principles of how safe people feel having their money in the network combined with the utility of the network and whether they need their money in fiat form in various local areas. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:04:50
A lightning network wallet on the android and iOS store. 
Also travel cash cards that need to be able to store/convert bitcoins to the local fiat currencies. 
If you can convert amounts of bitcoin to a local currency would help adoption for things like tap and go would be really helpful. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:27:52
Just speculating here but I think that if bitcoin become more like a reserve world currency the LN would have nodes that have much larger volumes of transactions in them. Some nodes could even be banks, corps like eBay, Apple, Walmart etc but the underlying bitcoin network might only need to transact 10 million because everyone would be using LN wallets/cards. 
But really the next step is to get all wallets to be using Segwit because it does save a large amount of data. The most I could find is from the Core developers here at 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:20:12
There are active testing and work being show cased at . 
I personally would like to see bitcoin core include LN transactions too, so we can run Core and it would also allow for people to open LN channels too, something like this [mock up](
@_date: 2016-01-07 05:04:11
It is not backed by anything but it has value because it has features of currency and money a kind of representation of a resource that others value for the further exchange of goods or services. That resource is the mathematical encryption it generates and the effort required to maintain and generate it.  
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:34:49
Really hoping they start to integrate LN(lightning network) into something like the GUI of Bitcoin Core so that we can all start to run LN on the side of the Core functions. We really need pay/donate via Bitcoin LN buttons available on web pages and hopefully some mainstream businesses consider being channels like we all hope. I realise people don't like banks but being able to integrate bitcoin into banks and other financial systems would be really helpful for further mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:05:34
Yeah unfortunately at this stage the transaction fees are fairly high.
But you can always set up a bitcoin wallet like Breadwallet on your phone for free ( that will give you your very own bitcoin receive addresses) and if the opportunity arises you could ask someone for some bitcoin and literally just hand over some cash for some bitcoin if someone wants to give them to you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:45
wikipedia has a good over view at 
but bitcoin could in a sense be just decreed into existence by 'proof of work' but with a limit of 21 million coins allowed.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:57:34
I think it's still pretty good for international transfers of money only costing about $10-15 to send just about any amount of BTC, no bank account needed
@_date: 2016-12-26 09:26:19
Why no bitcoin core wallet?
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:41:59
wouldn't this be consistent with their policies of reduced government interventions and perception of bitcoin being more like commodity than a currency?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:20:09
The key to recovering bitcoins is to find the private key that is often password protected.  If you find an old hard drive with say an old wallet.dat file on it from the original bitcoin core app, they didn't password protect it by default, so there is a chance you could recover  just run the wallet.dat file with the current blockchain.  But if the file is corrupted the bitcoins are lost forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:58:16
You would be getting about 0.08113 BTC, if you have that amount just lying around doing nothing then yeah just put it  in.

Write a will and include the password to your wallet. Or if you know you are going to die set up seperate wallets for the people you want to get your funds.

@_date: 2017-11-22 06:51:18
yeah I think it was a typo for  'swing' .  I think it really depends on the exchanges you look at. 
When you look a current price of bitcoin it is an average of several exchanges I think.
So one exchange might swing more dramatically than another one does because they are exchanging more bitcoin transactions selling/buying etc.  There might be a lot of 'day trading' with other currencies too. 
Though I think it is also the magnitude of the number. Looking at say a whole bitcoin might go up or down by $100 but if you look at a what a fraction of bitcoin is it has less of an effect.  for example: using [preev.com]( 0.008 x $8,160 = $65  if it changes up by $100 $8,260/btc 0.008 is only $66 .08
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:05:55
Wouldn't that still be the same if some one forces you to use your PIN to give them money from an automatic teller machine? Certainly keeping bitcoins on exchanges has been bad i.e. private wallets can be stolen by hackers etc. But the bitcoins themselves behave like real money/cash, they can be lost stolen transferred etc just like real money can be. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:28:33
thanks for the explanation, that was quite helpful.
Just a question though, why would transferring a bitcoin have a different byte size each time? aren't all bitcoin addresses the same length of characters?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:30:36
My rough thoughts on why I don't think this is a bubble is that the underlying technology is very sound. Also from an economic perspective I think because the product/service is a new kind of money exchange that links into the real tangible world, also it is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It is literally a system for the exchange of goods/services which means that it can apply to a broad range of things. 
Bubbles are more often characterised by demand for a very specific kind of thing, like real estate, a new specific gadget/thing that makes you feel good for a while. Bitcoin doesn't seem to fit this kind of profile, bitcoin isn't specific to a particular thing because you can go and exchange it for any other set things.  Just my rambling thoughts... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:32:57
You can prune the blockchain see  down to about 5GB it says. The reason full nodes often have all of the transactions is just for transparency, and it some cases for forensic searches, so you can potentially trace transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:38:03
They should make electric bitcoin lawnmowers,Those Antminers seem to make the same level of noise , so we could just mow the lawn while hashing for bitcoin transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:59:26
In terms of the security of bitcoin , it uses hashing called SHA256 which is essentially impossible to crack.  To brute-force a single SHA256 hash, we would need ASIC miners that are a trillion trillion trillion times faster than the hash rate of the entire bitcoin network.  This is equivalent to many billions of years . To quote 
"If you work through the exercise I proposed above, even if you had miners a trillion trillion trillion times faster than the current network, brute-forcing SHA256 would still take you 71430540814238958387154 years. The Sun is expected to go out in about 5000000000 years" source: 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:01:13
May be start by explaining some of the features of bitcoin, I often explain it by emphasising how it is secured. Like what the basic features of money are like the fact the bitcoins can't be replicated or double spent due to the massive cryptographic processes involved, the fact curiously that bitcoins can be stolen and lost actually paradoxically makes them valuable too.  The fact bitcoin is distributed to a world wide network of nodes (software running on computers called Bitcoin Core) that all have to agree with each other about transactions ( the block chain ledger).  The main site  is pretty good too. The FAQ at  , the side bar here on reddit has some excellent information too
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:30:57
Get a bitcoin wallet first. You can either use Bitcoin Core ( that is very heavy data wise though, but you are helping the bitcoin network) or just get multi wallet like exodus. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:48:09
each node keeps a copy of every transaction ever made in the bitcoin network, the nodes talk to each other and double check everyone is in agreement with what the other says in their 'ledger'
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:37:35
true, I'm not sure. My understanding is that you only pay taxes on amounts that you actually cash out and use to be part of your yearly income for example. But there does seem to be more discussions about capital gains taxes in the US. disclaimer: I'm from Australia. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:54:07
I think I saw a post the other day that said that would be tricky due to block confirmation times or something. Here it is 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:52:07
I think all you need to do is copy across your old wallet.dat file to the new bitcoin core folder. But you can only add one wallet.dat file at a time as far as I can tell.  You can then open bitcoin core using a different folder which has that wallet.dat file in it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:44:40
What does the software implementation look like? Will it become part of Bitcoin Core for example? So people running a full node can help run the Lightning Network? Would people who offer bandwidth to help these transactions be compensated in someway? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:32:29
People really shouldn't be keeping their bitcoins on an exchange. There should be a function that you can move it to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:28:51
there is a video on the front page of  and it provides some quite good information
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:00:41
Just buy some now, even if it dips below 10k it will sometimes hover between 9900 and 10,100 and if you only buy a fraction like 0.01 it won't make too much difference. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:46:46
it keeps the blockchain accurate and robust and distributed. One of the key features of the resilience of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:16:21
Just invest initially what you are comfortable with, it could be $200 or $1000, it is currently increasing at about 2-5% per day. Despite what people say about volatility it's not that bad at the moment, it's kind of steady slightly up at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:00:33
thanks for the clarification and it's good the know the mining farms have less power.  So is it really the Bitcoin Core software that we run at home that has more influence?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:04:08
you can still store value and you can still sell it back to your local currency if you need to.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:06:07
My guess is that there are less unconfirmed transaction and there is more hash/mining capacity may be due to the drop in the value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:05:40
Question: why can't miners make money from just fees now? Wouldn't it be helpful to allow anyone to offer hash power to get fees for transactions? 
edit: I just noticed that is the case in a comment below
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:30:38
The gist of the article is pretty negative towards bitcoin. The usual commentary about a bubble and that it is used for criminal activity. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:44:42
according to [preev.com]( it would be about 0.05460
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:44:07
what should be added to improve that explanation?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:15:50
pretty sure that mbtc just means milli bitcoin. If you like find the preference settings for what denomination mBTC, BTC or µBTC to show. You have about 0.0300 BTC or 30 mBTC
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:40:03
In a sense bitcoin is more like a social network. Lots of people contributing to it so it just stays or increases slightly everyday. The fact you can exchange it whenever you like makes it a bit more flexible and useful in a way.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:27:22
they may use mBTC instead so, it becomes...
1000mBTC = 1 BTC
100mBTC =.100 BTC
10mBTC =0.01 BTC ($103)
1mBTC = 0.001 BTC ($10)
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:19:36
Actually one good thing you can do is download the BitCoin Core wallet. But it does take a very long time to download the current blockchain, it currently takes up around 169GB. I suggest you keep in on a seperate hard drive though. You can download it a bit a time, it might take a week though
see  specifically 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:18:53
The other option would be just first get a bitcoin wallet, like ArcBit which works on a phone, then at least you have a starting point, may be offer tutoring in a subject you are good at and ask to be paid in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:46:02
$11,000ish seems about right for the middle of next year. Though it might stabilise around $9,000 for quite a while.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:28:38
What kind of gear are you going use? the only one I've read about that can handle bitcoin are ASIC Antminer S9 and they are quite expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:39:39
to be honest I think the better way to gift bitcoins to a friend is first to get them to download a mobile wallet, like ArcBit and then send them some bitcoin. Then they can see the approximate value instantly in any currency they want. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:22:04
Bitcoin core also helps maintain the bitcoin network too.  Exodus is pretty good too as it supports other cryptos too and shows your value in a number of different currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:10:07
I don't think sat would need to at all. He could just cash in what he needs, or even using his own website   to pay what ever bill he needed to. In Australia at least. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:43:22
that would be great, currently it only will take up about 166GB for the whole thing. But it might take almost a week to get it all on your system depending on your bandwidth
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:56:19
I don't use coinbase myself but there should be a function that you can withdraw your bitcoins to another bitcoin receive address that you set up on your own mobile app. Make sure you set up another wallet first though which will give you a receive address , that's where you send your coinbase bitcoins to. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:06:12
Quantum computers as I understand it are not suited to breaking SHA256 type problems, certainly not by 2027 either is my feeling, at least with their current set ups. There is more detailed technical discussions about this at 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:59:44
I originally predicted about $12,500 or so but at this rate it is really hard to tell.  But at the latest rise now it looks closer to $14,000 or so. I'm just doing a rough visual plot that goes up.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:41:32
yeah I was going to suggest this too 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:27:15
You should be able to withdraw to another bitcoin wallet from coinbase. Then you can sell your bitcoin on an australian service like btcmarkets.net or bitcoin.com.au
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:00:41
I don't know for sure but I think while there are still bitcoins to mine the ASIC miners are the only ones to even get transaction fees. 
Until we can get a cheaper and quieter Antminer S9 it's not really possible to use a general purpose computer to do hashing for bitcoin.  Mining is really only something that can be done in appropriate places. e.g. If you have your own solar farm, wind farm, pumped hydro , a watermill perhaps, I guess tidal power too. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:14:48
Is this related to the lightning network? I think this is a level above bitcoin ( thinking of bitcoin as the core of the network) .  There might be better information here at  . It looks like the point of it is to use the bitcoin blockchain as the final authentication level. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:27:52
This is a good question. Here is a graph and it shows a few sudden drops in the mempool. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:20:00
Just sit tight, there is a chance that it might get confirmed in the next 4 days. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:11:39
yep you could be right. Here is a good bitcoin chart site to check out too 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:03:14
I guess I'm just hoping that the Lightning Network application is like Bitcoin Core, something that any person with a laptop can just run easily and just sits running in the background. In other words the lightning network is highly distributed that everyone can participate in. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:55:21
so does that mean it would better if we used unique addresses each time we do a transaction rather than say 100 people send bitcoins to a single receive address?
 Say in the case of that subway guy that it would be better that Subway to have a seperate receive address for each customer that pays with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:47:37
not American, but I still think having bitcoin is the same as having an overseas asset of some kind. It's only when you convert it to your country currency that you would need to report it as income. But I'm not entirely sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:36:32
it would just so much easier if the major banks would just integrate bitcoin into their online systems so you just go to your online banking service and trade there
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:56:57
It's not quite creating a bank for what you are describing. Most people use coinbase I assume just for convenience, it essentially only holds their private key for bitcoins. The only danger would be if coinbase was hacked and a lot of private keys were stolen. People shouldn't really keep large amounts of bitcoin on exchanges like that, they should put in them into Bitcoin Core wallets, or other hardware wallets say on their phones etc.  
Bitcoin is very unlikely to cause paper(fiat) currency to fail in large stable economies. There is a chance that smaller economies might go for bitcoin though, but smaller countries are suspicious of bitcoin at this stage partly because they can't control the value of bitcoin. Though I would imagine they might opt for their own version of bitcoin fork. But the value of their own bitcoin might need to be associated with either computing power or it be related to some kind of 'smart contract' related to the industry of their country.

Yeah I was wondering about this article too. I'm hoping the lightning network would work like a seperate app like Bitcoin Core . 
I still think that thousands of people around the world could run a 'Lightning' node, get a bit of compensation while they are able to provide 1000s of transactions per second (or whatever your computing power can handle)

Unless I misunderstand OP, he is just running The Bitcoin Core app. It doesn't do any mining it just holds a copy of the block chain and a wallet. Literally anyone can run bitcoin core, get it from  . You can run it casually too from a laptop, though it's best to keep it on an external drive.

Isn't the general rule that the more people buy bitcoin the higher it's value goes? completely guessing here but a billion  dollars is 1000000000, and putting that into preev.com you get 128,200 BTC. Since there are not that many actual bitcoin available that 1000000000 would need to spread out to all the current bitcoins around. 
There are currently 16687425 bitcoins now. So spreading that evenly around would increase the value by 59.92 dollars I think. (1000000000/16687425). I don't know if my math is correct though. Someone else can chime in.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:25:12
This is a good question. My understanding very roughly is the main reason some Chinese companies have power is because they get cheap hydro power. Although I did read that this might be being reduced in someway. 
I do think though there might be a lot more bitcoin miners distributed around other places too.  
It would be cool if there was a bit more access to ASIC miners to home hobbyists, less noisey ones too. Being able to run them more occasionally just to make a few 0.0001 per month or so to ensure a more distributed network.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:41:33
I guess in an economic sense if you have your own bitcoins they can't be taken away from you. In some unstable economies there can be a so-called run on the banks. Governments can theoretically freeze or no longer secure amounts of money.

Wouldn't it be mostly important for large transfers? If I wanted to transfer say 0.001 BTC($7) it wouldn't cost more than say 0.0001BTC ($0.70) to get it into the chain in less than an hour or so surely? I don't really know for sure as I haven't much experience in transferring BTC much.

Good question, I don't know exactly. But my understanding is that mining/transactions validations are related to the difficulty of the hashing problems to solve.

@_date: 2017-11-29 08:50:31
I think one thing to realise is that when the value of a whole bitcoin is so large the value of smaller fractions of bitcoin isn't quite as volatile.  if 1BTC = $10,620  but if you have a product for sale at 0.001BTC, that's $10.62, if it goes up by $200 it now 1BTC is $10,820 so your product for sale at 0.001BTC is now only $10.82, which is not hugely different.

I don't think bitcoin is overvalued. I think it's important not to think of it like a stock or a product but more of a network, so you are part of the bitcoin network and can gain value from it.  I would buy back in if you can, just buy $1000 at a time or something until you get comfortable with it as you go along. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:05:22
This is definitely relevant and I think we should have small apps that use the blockchain as signatures of proof. Bitcoin's value is that the network is extremely secure encryption, that is worth something at a minimum.

It might be more a infrastructure problem though. If you could put bitcoin onto prepaid credit cards and bitcoin fiat conversions can take place like any other foreign currency exchange on cards it would work a bit better for daily transactions. I wonder if Lightning network connected to Mastercard or Visa network would work? MC and Visa might welcome it as they can get a percentage of the transaction from a new currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:11:11
Correct, bitcoin.org only lists bitcoin wallets. But most wallets are able to convert the current value of bitcoin into other currencies. for example  you can choose various currencies that is equivalent.  The only place you can store other currencies is with a bank account and their app/website in that country. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:53:44
Once we have lightning enabled mobile wallets is when people are likely to be doing more spend and replace. 
Another issue is that it is still fairly tricky to convert between fiat and BTC. I do think that it is actually easier to accept bitcoin as a business than businesses seem to make out. If I walked into a fancy restaurant ordered my meal and it cost $100 and told them "sorry I have no credit cards or cash to pay you but I do have bitcoin" surely that restaurant could easily accept the payment in BTC?
On a vaguely unrelated note, I really think that bitcoin might be a good system for donating to the homeless (the original unbanked ,of course there is  a spectrum). I think it would be easier if people needing money just print out a QR code and if you go past them in the street we can donate them some bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:46:36
to be honest I always thought that the bitcoin blockchain is really mostly a merkle tree but the clever thing about bitcoin is that it is distributed to full nodes (many thousands around the world) and they all double check with each other. To  add to the merkle tree you need to hash a transaction via a miner.  
From wikipedia: " In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes."

I think it's best to go back to the basics of what bitcoin actually is and that it tends to be fairly resilient. The peak $20,000 was a bit of an outlier in terms of the growth of the value. The actual utility of bitcoin remains the same, in fact transaction fees are quite low now.  The future of bitcoin is still pretty optimistic with new tech added to it such as LN in the next year or so. 
It still remains an asset that is virtually untouchable from a cryptographic perspective, if you hold the key then no government can freeze your account for example. The economics of bitcoin is, if I recall correctly, the Austrian school of economics. 
But presumably you did not invest more than your could lose and that you knew there was a chance it could devalue. Remember that bitcoin was acting as a speculative store of value, since people invested into it probably just need to access their money out in the real world to pay for bills that's why it does this from time to time.  For example Chinese new years is coming up and that sometimes does things to the value of bitcoin.  The value of bitcoin is also a network effect but it is two way so people tend to use it just for transferring value from address to address and converting back to fiat currencies.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:52:20
yes  I think that is the point of it. LN provides transactions for zero or no fees in many cases. This is assuming they have at least an internet connected phone they can access at some point.

I still think my model works in the sense that towns can be interconnected. Town A might be good at making a particular product. Town B is good at extracting resources ( may be even using solar to mine bitcoin). Town C is good at growing/making food. Those 3 towns are now able to exchange goods and services for what they are good at using something say bitcoin to represent the amounts of goods and service available. I would agree though that the growth rate of those towns would be limited to things like resources. Each town is able to save a certain amount of bitcoin and can use that to then exchange to build a new office or whatever. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:55:03
One cool feature of LN is once it is mainstream in lots of bitcoin wallets on mobile or desktop devices is that people can even earn a little bit of bitcoin for helping to port bitcoin transactions around.  Imagine a  slum in India somewhere, a few dozen people will have cell phones and they can all be part of the LN network, they only need to know one person not even directly connected to the main bitcoin network but they will be able to accept even tiny transactions like the equivalent of 1-2 cents, or rupees, at the end of the week they may have collected 100s or 1000s of transaction and they can close the channel and they now have 0.01BTC of their own. 
The other cool feature is doing micropayment for website viewing, instead of asking people to pay via PayPal, you could just ask for like 5 cents to view a page.

I think that's the economic model of bitcoin, I vaguely remember that it uses Austrian School of economics and that everything is based on the idea of the individual saving money(units of value). In the bitcoin model people would be more incentivised to save and never get a loan. 
From a generational perspective I guess it means people just start of small. So as a kid you save up your bitcoins as you go (since the value of bitcoin increases), eventually you get enough bitcoin to afford a small apartment of your own to own outright, then work a higher paid job get more bitcoin to afford to buy a 2 bedroom place, you then sell your 1 bedroom place and buy the 2 bedroom place and so on.
I think the point of bitcoin economics is that it doesn't rely on the concept of long term loans because the unit of value is high that people want to focus on what is important and what can actually be achieved. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:43:19
Here is an explanation with diagrams. 
But basically Segwit means segregated witness. The witness part of the block chain is separated from the main block of transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:49:27
I guess that's true when you think about it today. But I speculate that within a full bitcoin economy there might be a lot more personal savings. Also there might be more motivation to build more resilient structures in disaster prone areas. 
For example people often ask the question: why don't people build hurricane/tornado proof houses? they often say it is due to costs and it's easier to rebuild etc. In a savings economic model people/governments are more incentivised to survive more intact. There would be far less people needing to rebuild etc, sure some might be affected but overall the ability to survive a natural disaster would be higher. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:35:18
I think the main reason is that bitcoin in many jurisdictions ( thinking mostly western English speaking places) is still not mainstream. Just guessing here but most governments don't give the option to pay people in bitcoin. Most banks don't process bitcoin directly either. I feel bitcoin is much more like a more a commodity that can be more easily converted than say buying gold bars and shaving bits of it and convert to cash to use it on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:14:24
I think a major issue with mining is that the machines make too much noise. If you could run a bitcoin ASIC quietly, even if a bit less efficiently it would be more popular. For example electric hot water systems could be mining bitcoin even if you only end up with 0.01BTC per month or something would make it more popular.

pretty sure that bitcoin core full nodes ensure that all the blocks are valid according to the consensus rules. If a block created is invalid it gets rejected by the network. full nodes also do a blockchain validation to see if there have been any changes and  reject any changes it sees and it may go and compare with all the other full nodes to make sure the blockchain is consistent with all other nodes.

Having something like the LN in India would be amazing, people who live in slums would be able to use their cell phones to do lots of micro transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:46:44
I think you need to add the concept of a Merkle tree and you need to also include more detail about the SHA256 hash, for example why is it so hard and how can it be easy at first and then how can it get harder to produce blocks only every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners are on the entire bitcoin network.

My understanding is that the only regulation that most governments can impose on bitcoin are legal requirements on major exchanges for anti-money laundering(AML) and know your customer(KYC) requirements. It is also likely that your tax obligations might be required to be sent to the government too. But other than that bitcoin is like keeping cash under the bed but usually with much much better security.

The problem I see is how do these other suggestions remove the 'trusted third party'. The power of the bitcoin blockchain is that you can have a system you can trust because the cryptography and hash system is so strong.  How does this apply to the real world like a work of art or realestate? how do your have 'proof of work' for artwork or for realestate? ( the word of an expert is encoded into the blockchain?)  The only place I guess it could have value is in the case of monetary systems like company shares. If you can buy shares in a company the way we buy bitcoin that might have value I guess. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:46:30
Here is the peer to peer transaction part:
a bitcoin (or part of a bitcoin) is really a combination of public address enycryption key and private key with an attached amount of bitcoin associated with it.  
The private key is held in your wallet (you might not even see it, but it is there). In your wallet you are able to send what ever amount is in your wallet, but you can also create receive addresses to your wallet so people can send you an amount of bitcoin.  
Once you send an amount or receive an amount that goes into something called the mempool (short for memory pool) then, depending on the fee that transaction gets picked up by a miner to further encrypt the transaction. 
What this does basically is make it so that transaction of bitcoin can never be repeated (double spent). The more confirmations the harder it is to break the transaction( double spend), something like 6 confirmations means you would need several hundred thousand computers to even have a chance of breaking it. 
Then all these transactions get stored in thousands of nodes around the world that all compare with each other to make sure they all agree with each other.  So bitcoin is a combination of public and private keys an entire network of computers and a bunch of miners that 'work' to make the transactions irreversible through something called hashing (it's kind of like a long puzzle complex)

It really depends on what country you are in. If you are in the western world there should not be any trouble converting bitcoin to fiat , most governments just want to minimise money laundering.
But also remember that you can use pure bitcoin for some purchases of goods and services too.  With fees right down at the moment you can easily use bitcoin from your mobile wallet to exchange with another bitcoin mobile wallet user. Bitcoin is certainly more quickly useable than having shares/stocks or a block of gold.

The main thing being developed in the lightning network (LN) for bitcoin, which should be easier for retailers to consider because it allows them to batch thousands of transactions into one on blockchain confirmation but still maintaining cryptographic security etc.  But it might take another year or perhaps 3-5 years for this to become widespread.

I think primarily that any LN compatible wallet can be a hub and move transactions around and doesn't require a trusted third party, it get finalised on the bitcoin blockchain at the end of the day or when it suits you. LN hubs would be far more widely distributed than banks and I think hub owners can even make a bit of bitcoin.

Let's say some government agency is following some suspect of interest, they get a court order for a search warrant against the suspects' computer system. 
Then the agency can just insert whatever code they want re-route the suspects software updates with compromised piece of software that looks legit and the government can have full access to a suspects computer system/phone or whatever.  
Just use traditional spy techniques targeting a suspects computer system with a warrant.

still think that if the lightning network can get mainstream payment processors involved like mastercard and visa it would be cool to be able to choose to add bitcoin as a currency to the card like you can add other currencies.

Yes I agree with this, except that the BTC denominated accounts would be just an interface with the bitcoin distributed network. The point about currency I think though is that its value can vary quite a bit depending on the economic activity and how people value things. For example a physical house may be always be of high value.

Bitcoin-Qt is quite a large download, about 15GB for the whole blockchain. But it is then only on your computer, assuming you have secured it it then it is less susceptible to a hack.

But isn't the point of bitcoin is that it is a distributed Bank itself? Unless the Swiss bank just offers a added bitcoin service? I think what needs to be recognised is that a network of computers running bitcoin software should be viewed as a sovereign state first. I think that what is needed is to be able to easily convert between BTC and CHFs for example.

You can't emigrate because your are not software. But just as the concept of a corporation is like a person. A network running software could be afforded the same kinds of protection a nation does. 
Bitcoin could viewed like a nation that exists only as a software network that produces strong encryption sequences, (or our personal 'like' of a distributed system etc), that is its GDP output that we humans value. 
For example a person is a network of neurones and a person is afforded some rights within a country, some humans have a personal GDP output that is valued higher than others.

Well presumably you just convert BTC to CHF, or have an automated system that does it for you, like with current cards you get a cash advance with a fee for whatever local currency you are in. I think it all just depends on what the countries local laws are. I mean if they passed a law to say a company operating in some country must sell products in the local currency then that becomes a problem (didn't china do something like this?).
