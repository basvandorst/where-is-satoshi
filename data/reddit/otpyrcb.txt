I have withdrawn to USAA and navy federal. I have purchased with both too. no problems

what do you mean they don't "do crypto"? you sell the crypto, and withdraw the cash to the bank..they "do cash" don't they?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:36:06
you can only buy 100$ a week? look under account settings for more verification/raise limits
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:00:03
also you can buy fractions of a bitcoin...like you can buy 0.0001 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:38:15
I like it, so I can see what the price was at certain times easily

Put it in the coinbase vault 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:59:37
you buy one bitcoin at $5,000....you sell  one bitcoin at $10,000 boom, you made a $5000 profit. (minus exchange fees and taxes) it does not pay you. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:09:39
not necessarily "someone" could also be many people
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:06:38
when we talk about buying the dip we aren't talking about selling your current holding and using that money to buy the dip, we are talking about any other available fiat you have lying around. 
What you are talking about is more like day trading...like if you sold this morning at 16000, then yes, right now buy the dip at 14000 making a small profit, if you did that with a whole bitcoin you would make roughly 2k profit depending on fees/exchange rate

talk to her about it now, don't wait until it reaches 20k to say never mind lol, talk to her about other possibilities you could use the money for and try to get her onboard. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:49:19
they can buy now &gt;.&lt; better than buying earlier at the peak anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:55:32
once you sell you still have to actually withdraw the money to your bank account, did you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:26:56
you have to look at in in percentage, not price.
If you put in $200 and btc goes up 100% you now have $400, is it worth it to you? It may take months to go up 100%, and you may crash and lose half your money

Hodl, I made that mistake when I first started...took a pretty big loss would be up so much more if I just HODL
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:23:56
would you be mad if you sold and it doubled again? if yes -  don't sell, were up %1,900 this year . If you can watch BTC climb to 50k+ in 2018 and not be sad that you missed out on the gains then yeah. sell it. No one can tell you what your own goals are, or which way the price is going from here
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:25:43
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:09:51
Why don’t you watch the price on gdax instead of refreshing?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:46:23
it wont? if I look out a 10k loan for bitcoin in January it wouldn't have made me rich? XD
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:15:19

It is possible to un-stop the stoppable possibilities of this non possible stopability
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:05:47
so basically you are asking if anyone knows that the market is going to crash, without ever recovering past 8200 again?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:07:30
oh okay, Ive only been at this for about 3 months, thanks for the feedback. I actually didn't have too much trouble, I only experienced a few minutes of downtime after we broke about 50-60k in volume. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:54:40
this makes everyone who sold feel better about their potential gains..thanks! XD
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:56
buy rn!
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:04:15
Hodl, I bought more at same price, do. Not. Sell. I learned that the hard way 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:00:40
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:48:43
patience grasshopper
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:50:51
Did you not plan on holding your $100 investment more than 8 days anyway? Did you intend to panic sell if it drops 10-15%? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:21:42
Never sell. Why be part of the group of weak hands that drive the market down even more, its our duty to hold the line. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:24:58
90.8% chance the momendandum of the uptrend will receive majority of the real target price/market value left over from the forking wave of illapsicating hype, the price will certainly be below the AVP Diagram on the Hypo-naner and we should see a slight Sideburn followed by a raging waterfall/parachute 50% upwards 50% downwards by this weekend
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:17:50
No, what I do I hate myself for going HOLY SHIT BTC IS AT 5800 over the weekend, and not buying until it got back up to 6800 -  4 years ago is too far back for me to worry about whenever I cant even make correct buys in the present.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:11:09
the FOMO is strong as we move towards the end of the year, nobody wants to miss out on the 10k predictions, Goodluck

What you see is what you get 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:14

whats your idea of a good return? enough to buy a tesla or a big mac?

working fine here
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:48:31
yeah, it makes sense, it does nothing for you sitting in a savings account, might as well earn a little something. and get use to how to use it
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:37:39
buy with bank account, it takes a while for the transaction to happen, but you get the bitcoin at the price you bought it at.
If you deposit the money to coinbase (it takes a while to get there) and then you buy it after the money is deposited, you get it at the price it is when you actually make the purchase, not the deposit.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:59:54
Oh my O.O
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:59:45
Roulette? Its more like blackjack, we are the dealer.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:05:00
my personal opinion - gonna be a while before a dip close to that size happens again
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:59:08
Now we wait for the price to go back up to buy more at a higher price 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:32:19
10600 Isnt a high enough bounce?...up almost 2k from todays low...
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:59:46
sell them to me
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:53:34
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:07:41
You mean a discount, don't bother waiting, u may just end up getting in at a higher price. buy 50% of what you want to buy now and average the rest over the next 2 weeks?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:13:52
bitrex? what country?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:15:10
if you have money sitting in Coinbase you are doing it wrong anyway &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:30:50
anyone that says don't buy bitcoin on credit...might as well be saying don't buy bitcoin if you have any debt what so ever. If you have debt (most of the time) it's because you cant AFFORD to pay it off...so why are you buying bitcoin if you cant afford to pay off your debt?
I'm all for someone buying with credit...as long as your willing to bite the bullet when there's blood in the streets
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:28

good for us if we want to pick up any additional btc before we break 8k
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:25:14
you do know that you do not have to buy a whole coin right? you can buy or sell a fraction of a coin, 0.0001
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:11:45
bye bye butterfly
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:38:23
yeah I kind of thought of that after I posted lol. But I don't think Eth is the best example because I believe the currency is Ether
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:08:03
did you do any trading along the way or just hodling?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:19:35
Don't worry about how much of a better deal you "could of had" , even if you bought better around $9000 instead...depending on the amount of BTC you bought - it probably doesn't make that much of a difference. I bought a little bit at 10880 this morning, I was thinking it was headed right back up above 11,000 to stay.. little did I know the dip came about an hour after. You never know, its pretty much the luck of the draw. Good news is you have a pretty good chance it will be back there soon.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:12:03
so much media attention breaking 10k that it wont go down, wont see a dip till at least 10,500 or 1100, and it wont be a big dip.

bought at 10850 literally less than a few hours ago
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:39:42
that is a good thing - the more people that buy at this price are more likely to help us hodl over 8k
