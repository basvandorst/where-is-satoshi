The exchange is up. Withdrawals are not. (Last i checkee was about 2 hrs ago)
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:29:29
They should provide another update on this.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:10:24
Maybe if they add Euro pairs.

Actually it is my fault.
I sold yesterday. (Not that I wanted to but I had too)

I did a bank payment to Kraken on Friday. Which has just come through now.

My first post here (been a lurker for some time)
Anyone else wanting the BTC price to stay down until we get some money into the exchanges tomorrow? 
I am desperate to take advantage of sub $6k price.

Yes, go down the Gdax route as explained above and you can buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:47:49
What option are you seeing? 
You are any how better off moving your funds to Gdax (Same company as Coinbase) to get better rates. 
You can use the same log in info as coinbase over on Gdax and instantly transfer the funds from your Coinbase Wallet over to Gdax.

I did not buy. I am waiting for a dip in price.

I have used it a few times when i first started buying Bitcoin. It is a reliable service. Similar to local bitcoins to some extent.
It is much more expensive than using an exchange.

Just knew it, before i my tranafer to Kraken comes through BTC would be back up again.
Gutted.

Nah, don't listen to this guy^

Kraken was down for days. People had the same concerns at that time but they were up and running again.

Then start with 0.05, sell 0.95 when you reach 1 BTC (or put it in your wallet.)
Then start again with the 0.05?

I trade on Kraken daily. I have rarely had any issues.
Use their cryptowatch trading platform. (trade.kraken.com)

The earnings will be the same regardless.
You simply calculate it by calculating the % increase or decrease in current price from the price you paid.

Year to date?
