FWIW: anonymous in-kind contributions to candidates are illegal.

We're 100% non-partisan, so no can do, sorry.

By saying it's an "as applied" interpretation of 11 CFR 110.4(c).
They are also allowed to make new rules, but for this they don't even have to do that, just interpret existing regulations. And Congress gave them the power to regulate campaign finance (within various limits).

Resident ≠ permanent resident (green card). There are plenty of foreign national, US resident, non permanent residents in the US.
And yes, the question of what is adequate 'best efforts' is at the crux of this, and why CAF's request failed. Ours, IMHO, does the best that's currently possible.
(Some BIPs might allow for real refunds [to the control of the sender] within Bitcoin, and some orgs might create hybrid Bitcoin/KYC accounts that give it full auditability. We left those questions open in our request for revisiting in the future.)
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:34:54
Wouldn't matter. If you convert to USD immediately then that wouldn't affect you.

You can always sue them if you feel they've exceeded or abused discretion.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:31:58
It's part of the "facts and circumstances" of our request. In other words, if you want to rely on AO 2014-02 and be protected from prosecution under the FECA for what you do w/ Bitcoin, if you follow our proposal, you're safe.
If you do something else… well, it just hasn't been decided yet.
And FWIW, MYL PAC is a hybrid Super PAC, so we *can* accept unlimited contributions. We just argued that we think that the $100 cap on cash (i.e. on hard-to-trace stuff) should apply to Bitcoin.
The FEC deadlocked on whether or not to impose that. Draft B would've had it; the [commissioners' statements]( clearly show that there's a divide on the issue.
I assume that it'll eventually get litigated, though not by us.
Our position is to favor a $100 cap, at least for now. (Maybe in the future there'll be KYC-account-linked Bitcoin addresses, which would be just as auditable as checks [or even more so], but for now that's not really available.)
As for whether they get away with it: I'd guess that the FEC would deadlock 3-3 on whether to prosecute/investigate a &gt;$100 Bitcoin contribution. 
Whoever complains would then have standing to sue the FEC to compel investigation etc; cf the ongoing case [Public Citizen v FEC]( which did exactly that when the FEC deadlocked over whether to investigate Crossroads GPS.
So … sooner or later, it'll get decided by the courts. I don't honestly know which way they'd go on it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:37:10
No, you have to give your name/address/occupation/employer before you are told what address to give to.
It's $100 for even identified contributors. None at all for anonymous.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:25:47
Which 2?
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:43:24
No worries. Feel free to email me later. ;-)
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:43:35
Yes, you can make in-kind contributions of property already. The difference is just in how traceable the contribution is. Also, you can't make such contributions anonymously.
@_date: 2014-04-26 07:01:12
Even if AO 2014-02 says to treat them as in-kind?
(Not to mention: what legal basis do you have for treating it as currency? No regulator has ruled that way.)
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:47:46
You'd be required to give your name/address/occupation/employer before the donation address is disclosed to you.
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:17:11
Those are distinct questions.
Practically, is there a difference to contributing to a Senator Bob's official candidate committee vs contributing to "Citizens for Senator Bob SuperPAC"? A few, yes — mostly having to do with who controls the message — but obviously Bob will have "gratitude" either way.
Is there any advantage to donations via bitcoin? Not under our proposal. It'd be just another payment method — one that is limited to $100 per contributor/recipient/election.
That's got advantages for the Bitcoin economy (more real use vs speculation = more stability), and people who want to donate using Bitcoin rather than currency might participate more, but I don't see it having any particular advantage per se.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:22:25
Still working on it. :-/ Will be up soon.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:01:34
Maybe so, but you still have to follow all reporting / disclosure / etc requirements.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:38:25
No. It's a cumulative total per election/recipient/contributor, valued at the time of each individual contribution.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:45:25
Contributions to MYL PAC to support our work are welcome. ;-)

@_date: 2014-05-20 00:34:00
Take a look at the [implementation we proposed]( page 7-9. It's fairly straightforward.
Note that it doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be at least as good as the standards already out for accounting for / deterring unlawful activity / etc w/ other kinds of contribution. I think it meets that minimum threshold.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:24:01
Correct except 'prove' and 'US resident'. 
1. The standard is 'best efforts'. PACs aren't required to see your government ID, just to ask you.
2. US citizens or permanent residents are allowed to contribute. US citizens residing abroad are allowed to contribute too.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:51:52
Our proposal requires getting contributor's info before giving them the address to contribute to, so it's not anonymous.
Re. valuation: draft A says if you immediately convert to currency, you use the value you actually got in that transaction from your processor (eg Coinbase). If you hold it, you use the value on a large open exchange — presumably the same one each time.
And draft B says what to do with the excess amount (donate it to non-election purposes, i.e. c4/c3/US Treasury).
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:48:29
Take a look at Crossroads GPS for a much better example.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:25:34
I can't comment on partisan stuff. However I can say that we will launch ASAP, and you'll be able to contribute to [insert candidate/party/PAC/etc of your choice here] on our website using Bitcoin.
So if you include earmarks? Very soon.
How big a deal? I don't know, honestly. Mainly of interest to Bitcoin people (i.e. all y'all); it might be a niche for contributions that hasn't really been exploited yet.
Separate from that is of course what politician would come out *politically* supporting Bitcoin and thereby getting more contributions; that's something I can't comment on because it's partisan, but I would assume that such politicians (if viable candidates etc) would expect to see more contributions.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:50:02
The difference: whether SCOTUS thinks it "gives the appearance of corruption". Also, the amount of money you can spend, and whether you can anonymize it through a 501(c)4 (superpac yes, traditional pac no).
Obviously, many people disagree with SCOTUS on this.
(Disclaimer: I run MYL PAC, which submitted the [request]( discussed in the OP link. And it's a hybrid Super PAC, which means we can have one of each type of account.)
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:56:08
 updated — lists all Bitcoin accepting political orgs &amp; whether they require donor info.
@_date: 2014-04-26 07:15:49
Yes: a binding advisory opinion by a regulatory agency as to how their regulations apply to specific facts.
If they disagree with your opinion, then you're retroactively liable in a MUR.
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:18:19
Please do let us know if there're any missing, or if the information gets stale. AFAIK it's got everyone listed.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:26:36
Also, if you make an account you'll get notified as soon as the beta is live.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:34:29
That part's Federal law, for political committees at least.
Not necessarily for 501(c)4 / social welfare / "yes/no on proposition X" / lobbying type organizations.
@_date: 2014-04-26 07:45:36
Of course you can contest a MUR in court. The judge would have to agree, of course, and you'd risk costs.
_Shavers_ treated Bitcoin as money under the Securities Act. That's very, very different from the FECA. See my extended argument [here]( pp 1-5.
Of course, if you want to take that risk, you can do so.
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:56:16
 updated — lists all Bitcoin accepting political orgs &amp; whether they require donor info.
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:56:15
That's a separate limit. MYL PAC is a hybrid Super PAC, so the per-candidate contribution wouldn't apply to contributions made via our non-contribution / independent expenditure / SuperPAC account, only via our traditional / contribution account.
So the only limit that can apply for the SuperPAC side is the $100 one, and then only by analogy to the limits on use of cash.
Commissioner (and ex-Chair) Weintraub is reportedly working on an actual rulemaking, which would be able to change the regulations (in an AOR like this, they can only interpret existing regulations as applied to a specific situation). 
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:38:47
How so? Our request was meant to be very legally conservative, to give as much auditability as possible to political contributions considering the public policy issues at play.
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:18:01
The Administrative Procedure Act has a sovereignty waiver clause. [5 USC 702](
Also, the courts are not the same as the administrative agency. It's not a total monolith.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:00:06
 You have a static Bitcoin address publicly listed. That means anyone can send you Bitcoin anonymously, without sending in donor info.
It is of course your choice what measures you feel would comply with the FECA, but if you're looking to be protected by AO 2014-02, you're doing it wrong.
Feel free to contact me if reading our original request —  — doesn't clarify things.

PS IANAL, IANYL, TINLA.

Agreed; that's why we said that it should be revisited in 2016. Bitcoin tools will improve.

Yes.

Already did! Unfortunately, he said he's too busy now to participate.
@_date: 2012-08-07 17:02:04
I'd like to see TC's statutory citation for the 60 day response requirement. The FinCEN representative I spoke to said that there is none, and I saw none in the law (31 CFR 103.81).
I'd appreciate if they could share their request with us privately, in case the two overlap. The title alone isn't enough for me to be able to make any comment on its content.
@_date: 2012-08-08 06:43:35
Yes, that's a reasonable description of what we'd want to do. We want to be sure that we *don't* have to register as a MSB or the like if we do so.
Yes, my interpretation of the law is that we in fact don't have to. But let's be honest, it's not 100% clear currently. Hopefully, it'll be a bunch of work to get the answer "we have no jurisdiction over you, kthxbye". Getting it from just our interpretation to authoritative ruling is what's at issue here. Bitcoins aren't cars after all — cars have VINs and very well traced transaction history which is tied at every step to legal identities. Bitcoins don't have that.
On top of the FinCEN part, there's of course also FEC issues 'cause of the PAC (and for that matter foreign national involvement in eg c4 activity, which we wouldn't be able to prevent if we accept bitcoin), but that's a separate matter.
Also FWIW, the bank doesn't have any way to check for bitcoin laundering. (Not that this affects us, but for the record.)
@_date: 2012-08-08 03:27:15
We'd probably argue that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, though it has some value besides as a medium of exchange (eg for the Len Sassaman tribute, secure timestamps, pride of ownership [like a baseball card], etc). Plus that Bitcoin isn't backed by anything at all, let alone gold. So yes, it's not like gold for 31 CFR 1027.
31 CFR 1027.100 is pretty explicit about what it covers, and digital goods are clearly not in it.
@_date: 2012-08-07 21:25:06
FWIW just personally: I figure that they're *going* to rule on it one way or another, and they're already under pressure from people who think that the only thing Bitcoin is used for is money laundering, pot, or tax evasion. 
Why not instead get them to do so in the context of a legit, federally regulated corporation asking to have it be treated in the lightest possible way? Running from an inevitable ruling is not going to help the community, just make the ruling worse when it comes down.
@_date: 2012-08-07 23:27:15
Yeah, that's something we'd definitely like to avoid. We already have enough regulatory burden w/ the FEC and every state SoS; having to also comply with a whole bunch of AML regulations meant for businesses like Western Union would be a bit excessive. 
I think that it *is* totally reasonable for WU to have to do, and possibly even companies like MtGox or the like, but I think as applied to us not so much - we would only conduit contributions to other c3/c4/pac/etc type entities. But we'll see; we can't just pretend, we have to ask.
If it's too much of a pain (eg if it would require FinCEN registration or regulation), we probably just won't accept Bitcoin at all. But I don't mind going to a little work to try to be accommodating to a reasonable request. 
@_date: 2012-08-07 21:22:50
I actually think that's nice too — but it only works for individuals. 
We already have federal regulatory obligations. If we are to accept Bitcoin, we have to jump through the necessary hoops; doing so is definitely not our primary purpose, so this is a case of us going well out of our way to help provide a service that people have asked us for.
@_date: 2012-08-07 21:20:21
We don't expect to be purchasing them much (maybe for refunds in some situations?), so I have no idea on that. However, we're Delaware corporations, and DE has basically no taxes that affect us, plus we're tax exempt federally (except for things like interest on savings accounts, or revenue from totally exempt-purpose-unrelated activity — that's subject to federal corporate income tax).
We would declare received Bitcoins as in-kind contributions, valued and liquidated at whatever their current market value is.
@_date: 2012-08-07 17:29:20
or 3. They say "you don't have to report to us", which is in fact what they said when I asked them about something else that affected us.
Money from semi-anonymous poor people and elections does mix just fine in certain contexts (otherwise we wouldn't be asking in the first place). Cf. 501(c)4s (can accept unlimited anonymous anything, more or less), and PACs under 11 CFR 110.4(c)(3) (can accept &lt;$50 anonymous cash, no mention of anonymous commodities).
FinCEN will rule on this one way or another. If we don't make a positive case for why they shouldn't come down hard on it, then the only case they will hear or consider is that of people who want to ban Bitcoin entirely.
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:58:46
See last link on page for the link to the Google docs draft. I'd prefer comments in-doc since it'd be easier for drafting, but am happy to discuss here.
See our previous comments (also linked on that page) for context.
Also, please note misreporting of the 2013-15 Conservative Action Fund PAC AOR — the FEC did *not* say "no". In fact during their discussion (audio links are on the page) they were pretty much unanimous in saying that yes PACs can take bitcoin. They just couldn't agree on appropriate requirements. That's why we're submitting a new AOR.
Once we submit it, you'll be able to send email comments to the FEC directly if you want.
