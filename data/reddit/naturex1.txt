"Anyway, sure, I'd vote for 2MB blocks, if only to be able to prove the point that we need a different scaling solution than bigger blocks"   
 If you are referring to LN, then we need bigger blocks. for LN to scale, it would need 130 mb blocks at most. So by not scaling bigger than 1 mb we are just delaying the inevitable.

You can't prove he isn't Satoshi. That's the point. Everyone can call themselves Satoshi. Saying they are not Satoshi, would make you a liar aswell then. Since you can't disprove them.  
  
And if you think the users of a coin reflects the coin itself. Then you are just as bad as the media.. "People are buying weed with Bitcoin. Bitcoin must be bad!"

Bcash has already grown from 1-5k tx a day in aug to 30-50k tx a day dec/jan. (Peaked at 150k tx a day couple weeks ago) If that growth keeps up it's just a matter of time when they will benefit from the block increase.  
If we are smart, we increase aswell. Then they have nothing that we can't offer + We have network effect, the branding and the community = Win.  
  
You are correct, Bcash can't implement LN. But that's not the point here.  
The point is that we need a block increase for LN to work properly and the sooner we increase our blocks we make Bcash obsolete. There is no good argument against it, if a 4MB block makes Bitcoin centralized, then LN won't fix it. LN need bigger blocks!

Off topic: I do believe Bcash can implement LN and they have bigger blocks to scale it.  
I really think we should stress this, as to not lose marketcap to altcoins.

But &gt;1mb is needed for LN + it would clear the mempool and fees for the time being. Why is this so hard to accept? I'm not saying 1GB blocks, but a 2mb or 4mb. Why is this so hard, when it would solve so many problems and give us more time and prepare us for LN?

It's not HIS project. You're judging a whole community because of one man's actions, lol. It's like judging Islam with 1billion people because of the actions of one terrorist.

Why would you judge the whole bitcoin cash community based on actions of one man? Seems very foolish.

Why would you judge crypto (bch) for what Roger is doing? Doesn't make sense. Roger didn't make bch, he's just a supporter so i suggest you separate the two for sound arguments.

You should feel happy, then sad, then happy agian. And eventually you will die.

On a real note, I think you can actually send in more btc to the adress to pay for the fees. I'm not sure exactly how, just check out youtube.

They will be incentivized by the transaction fees that they get. And the miners that can offer lowest fees will get the most transactions.

It's your fault you listened to a conspiracy. 99% over at /btc think "operation dragonslayer" isn't based on reality.  
Can it happen? Probably not. Do we have anyway of knowing for sure? NOPE.  
You messed up by investing on nothing but a fairytale..
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:33:35
Why do you think BCH and Roger is the same? He didn't make bch, he's just a supporter. He also still holds BTC, so you might dump that aswell then?

Now ask yourself, was there anyway you could of known that 2 weeks ago?
