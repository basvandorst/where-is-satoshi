Too bad for them I don't answer calls from numbers that aren't in my contacts. 
To voicemail with you, vulgar unwanted Robocall! Damn you all to hell!

Did they cite a rule or regulation that your activities violated?
I know the details of every agreement make sure it is rigged in their favor, but they should at least be able to cite a policy or rule.

In fairness, we can say for certain that the government is violating the standard merchant agreement. 
However, it's possible the government entity negotiated a specific exemption or was granted a waiver to that portion of the standard agreement.
Different rules for different entities. Ain't that a kick?

Nevermind all that. We came here to bash, not to think.

So what's happening here is someone on Reddit is *not* calling me an idiot?
I'm not sure I can adapt to this! LOL!

Wait, are you saying I can't access PayPal via a VPN? I thought this was about paying for a VPN service. In other words, the VPN provided can't use PayPal to get paid.
Did I miss something?

Right. We're so lucky to live in the era when journalists can't work without using hipster slang. 
Good job, grownups! You seem so young and fresh now.

You've rented a post office box for years.

Possible. Very, very possible. And why shouldn't it hate me? I never complimented it when it got that new hairdo. I forgot our anniversary. We almost never go out to dinner, and god knows the last time we danced. 
I see now, it's all my fault. 
The signs were all there, but I was so caught up in me, my needs, my desires...I never gave Coinbase the love and affection it richly deserves.
If only there were some manner of atonement, some second-chance redemption for the hopeless sinner!
Men, you gotta treat your crypto currency exchange like a queen and your brick and mortar bank like a whore, lest you suffer as I do suffer now.

I've had no delays with other exchanges.

They determined he was brigading.
