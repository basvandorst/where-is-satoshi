What I don't understand is why the socialized losses are only for BTC holders. Yes BTC has been stolen, but because we trusted you with our bitcoins we get punished? Socialized losses should be for altcoins and usd too. That way everyone loses a bit, but considerably less.

Sure and pigs can fly. According to TA it would've bounced off of 600 usd, that's not even the point, the massive amount of contracts that was opened in a flat market never happened before. You might want to do some more research before you come to a conclusion like that

Not necessarily, okcoin remains the biggest one with the biggest liquidity, all major traders are on there. The hacker would know that everyone will be watching the stolen bitcoins, but not the trading activity before the heist. The biggest amount of contracts taken out was in a flat market before the heist.

Not really, it was more the hype of it that caused the price to rise. Because of capital controls they could only withdraw a very limited amount of money, and as far as I know there are currently still some capital controls in place. If you only have a small amount of money available you use it for food and other necessities, not bitcoin. Some other people in Europe did get scared and bought btc though.

It is like that because the GBP and Euro markets are seperated from the USD market. So when the price is volatile and people mostly trade on the USD market, the GBP and EUR market lag behind, until someone puts up buys/sells closer to the real USD value. I've had the same today at the Euro market which was lagging 10 EUR behind the real price.
So it's not really a Coinbase issue, it's just that GBP and EURO don't have enough traders on Coinbase :)

@_date: 2017-02-25 11:57:21
They wouldn't because it's a SOFT fork, which means that they'll just mine what they want, blocks remain valid for the miners that didn't upgrade because it's a SOFT fork and backwards compatible for older software. In order to happen what you're suggesting is that the 70% hard forks away. Segwit transactions are valid for older nodes...

He also made a tweet about the cost to fill blocks currently giving 2k transactions per block at 6-7 cent per transaction, it's still very cheap for some millionaires here.  In particular if you think about that DDOS which costed 10k+, these people are playing with a lot of money. So even when you double the capacity to 2MB, if there are bad intentions you could still easily fill all blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:53:02
I agree, shame on those not actively trying to support Segwit which objectively speaking is the fastest and most supported scaling solution.
@_date: 2016-03-02 17:01:14
The actual [block]( but if you check the last 20-30 blocks you see more with relatively low amount of transactions but still very full.
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:12:16
 for 2MB that would just be double that which is still not that much considering some people are willing to pay 10k$+ for DDOS attacks

Jihan Wu, CEO of Bitmain, is providing 73% of all miners (asics) globally. He wants to control Bitcoin and doesn't like the Bitcoin Core (developers). Immediately after the HK agreement concerning scaling, he broke it. He wants Bitcoin to scale how he wants it, latest we heard about that was 2MB HF + Segwit HF. To try to force Bitcoin Core developers to execute his plan, he is setting up fake pools like Viabtc and pointing his hardware to pools like GBMiners, btctop and now the new canoe pool. These pools run Bitcoin Unlimited which is an alternative implementation with a lot of issues (it almost caused a fork by accident a few weeks ago). GBMiners changed to BU and suddenly got a huge boost in hashrate the day after Jihan Wu visited them in India. Other Chinese pools/miners are scared to support Segwit because then Jihan will not provide them with mining equipment anymore. The reason he's using fake pools is to spread out his hashrate so it isn't obvious how large percentage of miners he actually controls, while trying to "pretend" that his real pool (antpool) is neutral. He also attacked BTCC in public for running Segwit and supporting Bitcoin Core.

@_date: 2017-02-25 09:49:07
False, you can have flagday activation, majority of nodes already support segwit so even if "only" 30% of the miners support segwit it would be perfectly safe and there will not be "anyone can spend" issues.
@_date: 2016-03-20 08:03:24
well then that's your answer right there, it won't get approved if its above your withdrawal limit. So you can wait 24 hours until your withdrawal limit is back or you should verify yourself more or you can make a ticket to cancel the withdrawal and withdraw an amount that you're allowed to withdraw. Their limits are pretty clear: Level 1: 2000 USD per 24hr; Level 2: 7000 usd per 24hr; Level 3: 25k USD per 24 hr

I think calling it censorship is spot on to be honest. It's just an alternative version of it, to make it seem less obvious. I do read both subreddits although the amount of informative and unbiased posts on posted daily you can count on 1 hand. I agree that there has to be some communication between them but if you look at how the vocal leaders of Classic are acting, then they don't want that. Just look at what Brian Armstrong and Olivier Janssens are saying on twitter, most of their posts are just lies which, sadly, most people on don't realize. For that reason I think it won't happen, they will have to compromise (which Core already did since they said they would implement the 2MB HF) but Classic doesn't, so that's basically the end of the story.

750kb means that they are using default settings and shows at this point of full blocks that they're incompetent. Jihan from Antpool has said before that as long as they're not forced to mine all full blocks, they won't. If they let the backlog increase, they get higher fees.
@_date: 2016-03-05 07:42:32

This is only true if the miners try to actively steal coins and fork the network, since UASF by itself will never fork the network. The miners had this option before with p2sh which uses "anyone can spend". It was rolled out with 55% miner support and 13% transfers now use it.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:01:07
That's true, however they are still the pool that mines the most empty or half empty blocks.

Important to note that BU, and in particular Roger Ver, was pushing the narrative that BU devs found it. They didn't. They wouldn't even be able to find an elephant in a petting zoo.

You are so clueless. They offered the code, that's all that was agreed on in the HK meeting. Miners aren't even angry about HK agreement, it's a red herring. They want to collect high fees as long as possible.

Well yes, they are basically just funded by Coinbase since Brian has been promoting that website. Classic has very little support, just check blocks mined, they are just very vocal and have some reddit voting bots. This post only has 17% upvoted.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:17:34
They are also the only ones who get paid and were supposed to act as employees of the nodes. So that is completely irrelevant and good luck running a coin with only hashpower and no nodes or support of the industry

It was a way of asking miners if they preferred p2sh or op_eval,

It's not "is there a chance", it's 100% sure. Has been confirmed in the private channels but no one wants to confirm it in public since Jihan supplies ~70% of all miners worldwide and ~90% of miners in China. If they piss off Jihan, they will not get any hardware anymore.

Bruce, you're either naive or you have bad intentions. Roger Ver is spreading lies, bribing people, hiring people in China to bribe miners, hiring people to attack Core devs. People need to see the real Ver, the egocentric manic depressive sociopath that he clearly is.

CEO's don't check reddit/twitter/github constantly, so they get their information from people they trust. However if you trust the wrong people, you are being fed false information. I'm pretty sure that has happened with Brian. Glad he finally started to think logically.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:29:36

He wasn't smart enough to pull it off, just like he wasn't smart enough to contribute something useful to Bitcoin Core. He is now busy talking bad about blockstream, how they stole his idea while he just failed.

Doing both makes no sense. as said on twitter: SegWit: Moving items from an overcrowded house to a shed in your backyard. Hardfork: Buy a new bigger house and move everything into it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:05:39
Super-majority of the community and the industry wants it and requested it. It's a tiny minority that's blocking the progress. 2MB hard fork is dangerous if not properly planned. Just go over to  and check how many nodes haven't updated in a very long time. A softfork with segwit will not cause an issue for them.

@_date: 2017-01-17 06:20:21
Dont you also need a license from Intel for the software? This is just vaporware. The professor is a bit like prohashing. Wrong about everything. Claimed bitcoin would crash at $200, supporting ETH, claiming the hard fork was good, claiming ETC would die fast... He is what traders call a contra-indicator.
@_date: 2017-01-31 08:39:32
No, this is actually a big surprise. Maybe they misconfigured a miner that they mined a segwit block by accident, proving that they are actually running Core while signaling BU. We can only know if more blocks are found.
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:54:05
He doesn't, he wants to control it, which is quite obvious if you look at his actions.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:15:32
If you support BU, you support Roger Ver and Roger Ver supports altcoins, so that theory doesn't work. What he is saying is that GBMiners don't have any ethics and that's why they think it's fine to be bribed by Jihan.
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:23:43
Going through your history, you are spam post in many threads.
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:49:34
There is, but the people providing the proof, don't want to make it public ;). Think for yourself for once: 3 new pools appear out of nowhere and start signaling BU, hashrate of the big pools doesn't drop at all (no miners leaving) but those 3 new pools suddenly have an insane amount of hashpower, where does that come from? There is only 1 answer to that.
@_date: 2016-12-22 06:30:53
maybe more important: who's paying for them since they're all written by 2-3 people.
@_date: 2017-01-21 12:55:45
Because the guy who controls 70% of the asic supply told his customers they wouldn't get any more miners if they support Segwit since Core didn't want to be manipulated by him.
@_date: 2016-12-20 05:02:08
There is no link on reddit to personal info and you know it. Which is literally what it says in the rules. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:41:57
UASF is a success not segwit2x. Most of those miners switched to BCash for quick gains, they don't care about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:47:05

@_date: 2017-08-24 14:49:06
12 hours after Segwit is active and with Segwit2x companies being part of the creation of BCash, which causes huge hashpower swings, this is completely dishonest.
@_date: 2016-11-22 10:42:49
Not even mentioning the technical issues that bigger blocks cause, you're going to keep increasing and hard forking every x-months? That doesn't seem like a solution at all.

No, those 20 can wait until a bus comes by with some available seats if they don't want to pay more. But if I come to a bus stop, there are 20 people waiting and a new bus comes, I can always get on first if I pay the appropriate fee.

If only it was that easy. Flibbr happens to have 0 technical knowledge and his biggest attribution to Bitcoin has been trying to keep as many people trading on Bitfinex as possible since he still has a huge amount of bfxtokens. If he was serious he would write a serious proposal/BIP instead of grabbing 3 random images from the internet and an addition lying that Bitcoin will be 1 MB forever (which obviously isn't the case).
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:28:00
Nothing new, it's Jihan/Bitmain that you need to force to switch, he is the biggest threat to Bitcoin, lots of Chinese miners and pools listen to him since they depend on his hardware. And he's pissed with Core since they don't do what he wants them to do.

@_date: 2016-11-16 10:02:07
That's a very good point, however a hard fork (afaik) could reset the difficulty to a certain level if they assume only a certain percentage would follow the fork. But it does prove that if that doesn't happen a BTC fork is even worse ;)
@_date: 2016-11-22 10:44:11
Segwit will increase the capacity beyond a normal 2MB hard fork, with potentially even coming in the range of 3-4MB if the amount of P2SH transactions keep increasing.

If you don't agree with Roger and see how damaging he is for the whole ecosystem then why do you still work there? someone with 3 years of experience in this niche can easily find another job.

This whole article is full of lies and inconsistencies. Someone already pointed them out on his medium article see:  Only reason why it's on fee.org is because once donated 1 million to them, so they would put anything on there.

If Bitgo, which probably secures more BTC than Coinbase, can do it in 3 weeks then any company should be able to do it within 2.5 months.  Their CEO has been promoting Ethereum over Bitcoin for a while though, so he couldn't care less about fees on Bitcoin.

They don't, they want to add segwit in the extension block.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:27:02
Miners are our (users) employees since we pay them, we are the boss. They are supposed to do what we (the users) tell them to do. If they don't, we fire them. When 90%+ of the nodes are segwit ready and they refuse to activate it, they are the bad actors.

Who's saying that "Giant companies" are looking for alts to use? I've seen some Classic drones mention that but with 0 proof and I really have a very hard time believing that.

That's the a useless metric. People want to have quick returns and then opt for altcoins. Altcoins are used to accumulate more Bitcoin.

But it's all traceable so that really isn't good for Silk Road. Ebay and Amazon don't require you to install a program, for a lot of people this is already a huge issue (not even taking into account how bitcoin works). Don't forget the billions in advertising they've done to become this big.
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:16:56
Shaming is not the right word, I think it's more like calling out that he doesn't have the right set of skills to be vocal about these issues, because he's not technical enough and doesn't understand the consequences of his proposition. If he feels he does have the required skills, he should just attend and try to work on a solution together. But then again Classic devs were also invited to the previous roundtable and they didn't "have time".
@_date: 2017-04-24 09:35:15
Isn't this just payment channels of which there are already other solutions on the market?
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:19:02
In most European countries this is already the case. So no surprise there. You'd be stupid running around with that amount of cash on you anyway.
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:56:49
Exactly, but most importantly, they will only accept bitcoins which is not an easy concept. Ebay and Amazon are easy, you just go the website. Here you have to get your hands on bitcoins, install a program, send bitcoins, etc. Really not userfriendly for people with no technical knowledge.

No, they use it as an excuse at first until they drop their act and give the real reason.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:21:59
People paid for their miners so, I don't think so unless the price drops really hard which is not to be expected
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:40:10
No. Most people don't know what's best for them. That's why we have people like Trump who are very popular. You can just take a populist standpoint. Most people involved in Bitcoin would not care either, they just want the price to go up or are not technical enough to understand what's going on.
What's going on now with Core and Classic is perfect example. I'd rather have a **"board of directors"** build out a roadmap, people with enough technical skills combined with people with vision and you always need 2/3 of the board to agree.
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:25:09
No. That little altcoin has nothing to do with BTC
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:02:52
Depends on size, looking at the latest blocks somewhere around 2500-3000 transactions per block (so every ~10mins)
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:49:51
well one of the empty blocks was 2 mins after the previous block, most of the time the spv stuff kicks in if it's within a few seconds up to a minute after the previous block
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:46:56
Careful with using real names on Reddit, they might ban you for doxing. :) that's why I didn't say it literally.
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:42:32
Blocks aren't full yet, Segwit comes in April which is 1.5 month. If we get 10 times as many transactions or 20 or 50 or 100... You can't just keep increasing the blocksize, there needs to be another better way to scale... or to compress it.
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:25:23
So you are not supporting something that 95% of the users want? Is that because of your agreement with Bitmain?

There is so much hype around OpenBazaar and I don't get it. It's distributed, not decentralized. I don't see this replacing silkroad or I'm missing something. I don't personally see this as the killerapp, I hope I'm wrong but I just see it as just another startup trying to reinvent the wheel.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:04:26
It's good that they get segwit, it's bad that a bunch of miners are deciding what's best for the coin.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:51:49
they upgraded to 0.12 and forgot to change parameters, Antpool sometimes mines fuller blocks and sometimes more empty

There was a roundtable last week, there is a new one this weekend
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:29:31
He makes a valid point that reddit doesn't represent majority. But that doesn't really matter. There will be people against it, even from the core team, that's why it's a compromise. You can't make everyone happy since there are a lot of different visions on how btc should/could be used. Most people seem happy with the consensus so now it's just suck it up and create it and try to accomplish the roadmap. If you've worked as a programmer in a company you know that not everything goes, or has to be developed as you want it. But that doesn't matter, you can bring up valid points but if they get shot down, then that's it, just do your job. (this might sound harsh but I've got plenty of experience in the field)
@_date: 2016-02-18 06:19:48
It's really not as crazy as some of you think, in Europe there are already a lot of restrictions on cash use. They are not allowed to accept anything over 3000 euro in cash and I've seen stores reject people with 500 euro bills even before they were planning on banning them.
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:18:29
Well an important fact is that you can never make everyone happy in life, and I think the same can be said about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:31:03
Honestly, I don't know what the specifics are for the next roundtable, I would assume it's a further discussion on the last roundtable which was about scaling and a roadmap but with other parties that couldn't attend the previous meeting. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:58:07

He doesn't even understand what's going on. It's a soft fork and it's already on the chips, as Bitmain yesterday stated.
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:56:08
No, and that isn't the point, if segwit would activate on Litecoin, they would have no "valid reason" anymore to block it on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-21 08:18:40
How about the fact that in the past there were already a couple of hardforks? Then why are you still in Bitcoin if you're so opposed to it?
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:55:29

You claim shapeshift is 3% of all Bitcoin transactions, you also say that segwit is a priority. Isn't it that kind of dishonest to not deploy Segwit as soon as it's available? Why are you trying to make users pay higher fees? Maybe you just like to keep fees high for now to force Segwit2X? An extra split would mean more business for you, more lost faith in Bitcoin and more people using ETH to get them into your new venture: Salt Lending?

The most technical Bitcoin conference of the year and there was no support for SegWit2X, that should be a very clear sign for everyone. Also the fact that there were almost no attendees of companies that signed SegWit2X show how much they care about the actual technology, rather than making some quick money with their business.

Hi, welcome on reddit and congrats on making your first post.
Obviously since there are only a few services/websites currently supporting LN, they're going to have the most (incoming) channels. The color given to these channels also gives a false sense of centralization as you can see if you spend more than 2 seconds looking at the picture.
The 100 of nodes in between the "hubs" are connected to multiple "hubs" through different kind of channels, thus serving the decentralization.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:10:44
This is actually wrong, BT1 will be BTC.
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:46:55
By voting for Bitcoin Unlimited you are basically stopping all progress and scaling since they can never reach the required % to push their 2mb blocks through. And since Bitcoin unlimited is not implementing segwit, segwit wont be activated since core can not reach 95% required. So viabtc together with Roger Ver are holding bitcoin hostage and dont allow it to grow.
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:31:51

I agree that threshold is too high and that it will only happen after the normal way (community pressure) will end up not working. But I don't think there will be a compromise
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:34:05
"Bitcoin devs are readily replaceable" that's not exactly true. There is only a small group that actually knows what they are doing, that's also the reason why Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited just copy the Bitcoin core codebase. They don't have the skillset to actually improve Bitcoin, they have the skills to copy/paste. If the Core devs would give up, Bitcoin would still run, but without any real improvements. If you don't improve, you end up like Litecoin.

2 Won't happen, if one party is malicious and tries to block Segwit even though 85-90% of the people want it, other miners will just work together to block the blocks of the malicious pool.

Awesome job, what scares me is that it's coming from blockchain.info. Don't really have a good experience with their wallet and I'm not the only one.

all your bitcoin are belong to me

You have to wonder about their ethics. How do you think purse can give you such discounts? Stolen credit cards. 1) Hackers steal cc info, put it up for sale at very low prices darknet markets. 2) People buy that info and buy amazon gift cards with it. 3) With those gift cards people buy the items for the purse marketplace. 4) They now have bitcoin/cash.

This explains so much, how he has been trying to fud bitcoin lately, he needs a believable excuse to switch sides. And that's the first step
@_date: 2016-05-21 07:21:48
It's not just that, his behavior lately has been toxic to say the least. I already thought he was desperate when running a casino on bitcoin.com, this move is even more desperate. Seems like he's very low on cash.
@_date: 2016-05-12 06:56:59
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:21:03
So it's fine that he tries to push a 5% wallet and doesn't even mention a wallet with 95% support? Oh and the 3rd article "Theymos: “Bitcoins Belonging to Satoshi Should Be Destroyed”", He never said it, one big lie. But sure keep protecting Roger, just damages your reputation more really.
@_date: 2016-05-17 11:06:00
So what you're saying is that when we dumped to 160, you also turned off your miner?
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:47:18
@_date: 2016-05-21 08:58:48
Like sending a transaction out with an unconfirmed input with no fee and then making a public issue/drama about it. Then realizing he made a mistake and still blame other people rather than himself? That's just fudding in my book.
@_date: 2016-05-30 09:31:46
They're probably short on cash if they're begging for bitcoin tips. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 06:10:31
Make them scan an QR code to receive some coins, of course nothing much, but just some small amounts. Make sure you send the transactions with a big enough fee though since you don't want them to get frustrated it doesn't confirm.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:45:45
Well he didn't have any proof that Craig was Satoshi, so I really don't think he should ever get it back. Lost all credibility.
@_date: 2016-05-12 18:35:23
The problem is that "bitcoin.com" sounds like the official bitcoin website while it's spreading lies (Classic propaganda see the news section), only offers bitcoin classic as desktop client and now encourages people to gamble. Horrible experience for new users.
@_date: 2016-05-12 20:22:15
"Roger is a good man", if by "good" you mean in the top 3 of worst people you want to have involved in Bitcoin. Liar, scammer and he's just an horrible person or you think they just took away his US citizenship for nothing? His only achievement in life was buying Bitcoin cheap.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:21:57
I don't believe Craig is Satoshi, but I know plenty of people with messed up hours, and most of them are programmers.
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:30:17
Can't upvote this enough. He's one of the biggest fudders around. Claims to be anti-censorship and then in return blocks everyone on Twitter that says something pro Core or debunks his false narrative with facts.
@_date: 2016-05-07 15:41:16
Yes, Roger and Olivier can't be trusted. They also tried to bribe the miners already.
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:41:16
pure desperation to make some money. It's so sad to put it on the "official" bitcoin.com domain
@_date: 2016-05-31 09:05:22
Pick up a shovel and a pickaxe and go to China, they can be found everywhere there.
@_date: 2016-05-11 06:25:00
Bitcoin is for everyone! But then they charge 1000 usd for tickets and 200 usd to view the recorded footage afterwards. I have some issues with that.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:31:23
What's more important here, check who liked the tweet. Jeff Garzik, Roger Ver, Craig Wright puppet.
@_date: 2015-11-28 12:05:38
I don't see this happening. If you have content/webshop/... you want to be visible, you want to be found so this would only work for people who don't want any visitors on their website.
@_date: 2016-07-22 08:48:03
It wasn't done democratically. Vitalik lost money and pushed it. It would be the same as Satoshi proposing a hardfork since he lost some coins in an obvious risky investment. The support was limited, check the data. Vitalik just has too much power in the community and people make some sort of Ether-God out of him. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 09:17:38
Sure that's the official stance, but the evidence is everywhere. Every single Ethereum article bashes Bitcoin and just spreads more lies. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:15:43
Test everything properly before pushing it out. Better take your time and test properly or you'll end up hard forking to bail out something/someone every couple of months.
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:36:10
1) They raised fees by 50%
2) They tried to censor Theymos because censorship
3) Their CEO and CFO have been trashtalking Bitcoin and praising Ethereum (lol)
4) They changed their AML/KYC policy, lots of customers left
5) Their support sucks
6) They close accounts if they suspect you gamble or do anything else that they don't like
7) They lost a lot of ETC from ETH users

GDAX did which is coinbase's trading platform.

He is in the list of the people that signed but google translate, translated it a bit in a weird way

So many people are not getting hoaxchain... hoaxchain is the future.
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:06:06
TLDR: "we are eager to activate the New York Consensus SegWit2x program by July 31st." translation: "we're very scared of BIP148". Still good news because segwit will get activated.

seaman is right up there with when it comes to hopeless idiots that are always wrong and are now trying to push alts.
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:24:18
Today I took all coins &amp; money off of the exchange. I did a full verification, then it required me to do an additional one, I did that but it kept asking for more. Obviously bugged. Buy buttons also didn't work for me, that's it, no more trading for me there.
@_date: 2016-07-17 06:42:45
Last 3 days there were 3 exploits. Yesterday it was down for over 12 hours "upgrading" (read: fixing another exploit). It's in a huge bubble and will come crashing down once people can withdraw their coins, which they can't now since the Dev blocked withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-07-21 20:42:26
Yeah it was a pretty dumb contract to begin with, sorry bro.
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:33:07
This is fundamentally false. Cheapest energy are actually renewables, might want to update your world view and do some research.
The one thing where critics do have a point is that for example solar only works during the day so it's not 24/7. But you didn't even mention that.
@_date: 2016-07-24 11:44:51
20%. get your facts right
@_date: 2016-07-22 09:53:52
Actually Ethereum's USP: Build unstoppable applications.
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
And there went all the ethics/principles out of the window.
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:48:53
yep, removed everything from Coinbase yesterday
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:30:11
Thank you for posting this, completely agree with you.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:08:53
This happens after the spammers stop spamming :) Nothing to do with actual use, if you actually checked the blocks and transactions it was very obvious someone was purposely spamming the network.
