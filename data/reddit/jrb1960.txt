Very good catch !, thanks.
You see the confusion is bigger as I live in a spanish speaking country and for us  1,123 means what 1.123 means to you. 
So, my example (0,077:335.00) should read as (0.077:335.00) to you.  
I also like your other suggestions, any of them could work, we just need to call attention to this simple way to make it more legible, any format is better than no format at all.
Best Regards,
P.S: question : so, if I payed (0.077:335.00) it is around 77 thousand Satoshi right ?

Perhaps I am wrong, but I tend to think that you have your unit of account (dollar, pesos, etc...) and the natural thing is to use them as most of the other currencies: if no cents then is just the natural numbers, if cents then 2 places after the decimal point.  In our case, we also need to deal with the Bitcoin vs Satoshi nomenclature.
 
All of the above just makes it unnatural to the person you are trying to explain that you gave them some Satoshi for them to play and get familiar with the concept (to me it is still very very hard to explain to simple people what is Bitcoin).
 
I guess what I am saying is that this nomenclature ( 0.023:123.45 ) would be awkward at first, but as soon as you show it  to someone trying to understand Bitcoin all these unnecessary confusion about Bitcoin vs Satoshi goes away like magic !
 
When you try to explain Bitcoin for the first time to a friend check it out, perhaps you will be surprised.

Hi, thanks for the comment.
I guess my point is about usability and branding.  
As the currency is Bitcoin (as the unit of account) I am suggesting a way to create its mask so anybody that sees the format  ii.iii:iii.ii would immediately know it is BTC and will also know immediately know how many satoshi.  So I guess I am talking from the perspective of simple, non-sophisticated users (like people who uses dollars and cents).
My comment is not about some feature that a specific software (wallet, exchange, etc...) could have, it is about making Bitcoin  easier to use with a very simple convention.
Best Regards,
