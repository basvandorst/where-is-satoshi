What do you mean cost themselves money when they can make money?
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:49:58
I get your point.
But let's say the government of the dollar makes it illegal.

Yes but there are only a handful that can easily get others to follow them. Like the US can get Europe to come along on any war they start.

@_date: 2019-06-07 15:55:52
I'm not saying they will pull it off globally. Let's just say they make it illegal in the US and get Europe to go along. What does that do to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:43:14
Not sure why people are making it so complicated.
All the govt needs to do is announce anyone holding bitcoin or transacting in it will go straight to jail for life.
Help me understand how that doesn't destroy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:17:23
Millions? Are you serious? How many millions in your opinion? 20? 50? 100?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:20:38
Oh you mean millions of dollars. I thought you meant millions of bitcoins.

You should reconsider if you really are obsessed with bitcoin if you don't know what the bit stands for.
Edit: Sorry I may have understood the question wrong. Are you asking if you should put this info in the essay or not?
@_date: 2019-04-21 00:06:59
Thanks. On first look, it looks really simple and easier than I expected. Anything I should know before jumping into this? As I mentioned I am clueless when it comes to putting money in this sector and if relevant I don't intend to put more than a few hundred euros.
@_date: 2019-04-21 00:26:20

This works for small amounts. I work online and pay less taxes because I've put my country as not the one I live in. But when money starts pouring into my bank account the algorithms will notice.

I only put in the money that I've made on some side gigs. If it's gone it's gone. I'm fine if it goes to zero. But not selling. Been there and made that mistake before on stocks.
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:59:12
I'm still confused about why I need someone to 'create' a cold wallet for me when it only consists of two keys?
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:09:22
Which model?
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:04:19
I agree. Till today no one has as much tried to take out the fees in bitcoin and practical use of scientific standards confirmed by a reliable authority. Doesn't mean it will stay like that though. Things can change pretty quickly especially with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:13:36
Yes but I'm going to FOMO in if it shoots up lol. And 5 years down the road it'll be either boom or bust so it's pretty much irrelevant whether I buy all in now or next week. But still playing it like a pro :)
@_date: 2019-05-20 10:52:41
I have an account on Bitpanda. Spent a few bucks but still a major chunk of my money is not invested in any coin. Where do I start now?
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:52:49
Thanks. Which one do you use?
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:48:19
If you can, just keep investing 50 bucks every month as bitcoin expenses and forget about it. Don't bother with selling.

In Germany, if you hold crypto for a year you don't pay any taxes on the winnings. Considering that I plan to be a millionnaire soon I'd be pissed if I had to pay a quarter of a million in taxes.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:07:12
OK I'll look into it thanks
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:57:36
OK. I'll decide the wallet later. When should I start trading? Are you going to give me tips on that?
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:48:40
OK. But I'll need you to clarify which part was bull. I'm not rushing into it anyways so I'll wait for your response.
What I don't understand is that is a paper wallet consists of my keys written on a piece of paper, what then does the cold wallet contain? Surely it contains the same keys, just written inside a USB stick that is not connected to the internet? Why would I spend 100 bucks to buy a fancy USB tk store my keys when I can just write the keys on a piece of paper? What am I missing?
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:39:13
Sounds legit. You make 300. What could go wrong! It's free money bro.

@_date: 2019-05-14 17:40:42
They know bro. You can't buy without providing ID. At least at the usual exchanges like kraken and Bitstamp.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:32:24
Do basically you are promoting your own exchange? I already told you I've got my money set up in Bitpanda.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:22:31
Yes but I don't have the knowledge to research which coins have the potential. Then sign up at an exchange that offers that coin. Then worry about how to store it. Bitcoin was hard enough.
As I said, when I habe more clarity on how this works, I may consider more. But not right now.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:33:59
I don't get the fuss about spending bitcoins. There is a limited quantity available and can easily be hoarded or lost. How is is practical that we use it for day to day transactions? Jut like gold, we don't spend it do we? If we did, someone with a lot of gold could fk everybody else. Just like there are some countries that have nothing but oil and use it to influence world politics.
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:36:45
Just make you really dig a deep hole. Scanning techs can still detect a few meters deep into the ground. After about 15m you are safe.

The CEO of Walmart is Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:18:01
What's the reasoning behind that?
To me it looks Like bitcoin is here to stay. The small caps have potential, but they look More risky to me.
Plus the two exchanges I am at don't offer many options. And I don't have the time to find exchanges that offer my fav coins. When I do, I'll probably do it. But for now it's just bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:29:30
It does clear things up. Thanks so much. I'll bother you further since you seem to answer exactly what I want to know. If you don't know the answers or feel I should be finding these answers from some source myself, just point me to that. 
1. So I deposit fiat to kraken, buy BTC. They hold it for me but I don't necessarily own it. I am assuming this lack of ownership isn't an issue when transferring this bitcoin to my wallet? 
2. If I put in a hundred bucks every month into BTC at kraken, and send it every month to my wallet, I am assuming I don't incur any frequent transaction fees? Is there something you feel wrong with this approach? 
3. Since the wallet isn't connected to my ID, I could own more than one wallets, right? 
4. If I was to buy a hardware wallet what would you recommend? Maybe name a couple that I can explore? Note that in the next couple of years my investment here may only run up to a max of 2k, not more, if that is relevant. I only buy bitcoins with a side gig that I do which brings in a hundred bucks a month. 
5. If I was to buy another currency, would the same wallet work? Or I have to do all the things again for that other currency? 
Thanks in advance

Obviously that is the right way. But one who gets in because he got FOMO simply cannot have the discipline for that. If he had, he wouldn't FOMO in the first place.

Best move? Give me one good reason.
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:53:50
Nothing. But why buy from a third party when the company itself sells it to you?
There is the possibility that the third party may install malware before selling it to you. Not saying Amazon does this, but why risk it?
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:10:01
So I've been reading quite a bit since this post. Found out how blockchain works. Bitcoin is the reward for people validating the transactions. There are other block chain systems around as well that offer their own coin as reward. Many mainstream companies like Samsung look to be getting involved with their own coins soon. My next step is trying to find out which system has potential for widespread use in the future.
As you can see I've only been scratching the surface. When you say educate myself, do you think I should be getting into the technical details?
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:04:34

Agree on the dollar being safe for now but as strong as the American warmongering machinery is, it won't always be able to invade countries that stop using the dollar, like Saddam and qaddafi. At some point the world is going to say the lies are enough.
Also, China is emerging as a massive power. When China says no to the dollar, your patriotism and bullet behind the dollar goes down the drain. No offense.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:58:21
I have only heard of a few exchanges and use kraken and Bitstamp myself. I haven't done any research on direct bitcoin buying which is probably why I never heard of this. Sorry can't be of much help.

I intend to put in 500-1000 dollars. Agree spending 100 on a hardware wallet won't make sense. Unless of course bitcoin reaches my price target of 10 million USD. Just kidding...

@_date: 2019-05-18 22:16:06
This is one of those questions that you should never ask. If you don't know the answer, you are going to one day end up losing your stuff, whether through a used wallet or something else.
In fact, it isn't even recommended that you buy it from a third party seller like Amazon. And you are asking about buying a used one!
Don't do it.
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:41:06
They can also say anyone who spends bitcoin gets 10 years in jail. That will kill bitcoins mainstream adoption and render its decentralization almost useless, as no ordinary person will be willing to touch it.
I don't disagree with your points, but I think people underestimate the power of world governments.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:09:48
Not sure. But I'm not using their wallet anyways. I will use my own. It's not safe to depend on a third party for wallet.

Buffet missed out on bitcoin because he invests in a different style and bitcoin doesn't look like a good investment when you see what he does. He should however stop embarrassing himself by making fun of bitcoin. Especially when he just defended his company's decision to buy Amazon stock.

I signed up last week at two exchanges. Fomo'd my way to 5 different coins, bitcoin being 70% of my holdings.
If you want to FOMO then you're pretty much on the right track. Sign up. Deposit money. Buy bitcoin.
A better idea would be to buy a certain amount weekly but who's got the patience for that? Especially while one is suffering from FOMO?
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:02:05
Hi, hope you are back from your travels?
I have read the three links you sent above. The concept is pretty much clear now, but it all seems so overwhelming. I still don't understand who is generating the keys for me, and who am I giving those keys to in order to complete the transfer of my bitcoins from the exchange to my wallet. Is a wallet the same as a storage? I am usually good with technical stuff but this one has me stumped.
I already own some bitcoin on two separate exchanges. What is my next step to get those bitcoins to a secure place as I only intend to hold them for years or even decades(and I mean it when I say that).
I have been advised to go for Ledger of Trezor wallets. I can order one and the 60 Euro price tag isn't an issue. But what do I do once I have it in my hand?
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:17:26
