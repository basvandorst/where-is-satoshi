I use Gemini, when you do a bank transfer you get the USD as credit which can be immediately used to buy btc 
The actual charge to the account hits 3 days later 
Also fees are hella low

Coinbase will more then likely terminate your account and with it your bitcoin, you can send any you got it to me in the meantime for safe keeping

A lot less informative

I have no problem buying at an ATH because I believe it’s going to keeping going up once it hits 100K I’ll start thinking about not buying at an ATH but I also think there will be a dip within the next 24 hours

Gemini is easy as a high school cheerleader

very informative, truly an amazing hobbit

I moved a few thousand USD into my wallet in prep for the dip...still just waiting but the fact that it’s going so high makes me think it’s going to drop hard 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:35
Put the limit at 11,000 but the rapid change stresses me out + I want to watch the dip happen

Literally the first thing I do when I wake up

Don’t day trade or “peak/ATH” trade, only hodl and put in whatever you can. Ignore the news and make sure you read this sub at least a few times a day to keep on top of what’s coming next. And remember HODL!

I remember buying bitcoin at $150

I use Gemini really good site, only complaints are
 it takes 2-4 days for money to get drawn from my bank but you are credited the cash on Gemini immediately 
Daily limit is $500.00, this works for me now but once I get a better job I’ll be wanted to do more then 500 a day, I know this can be raised but I haven’t looked into it yet

I don’t know what futures are? Simply due to lack on research.... hook a brother up with a link about it *finger guns*

Possible 2nd in progress

I use gemini for BTC they have really low transaction fees, a pretty good UI 
Con: 
No App 
Bank transfer takes 4 days to be withdrawn from my account BUT you can use the money immediately it works like credit

Mark Watney, he’s a botanist by trade but doing really well on mars

Same but with Gemini

I personally think the first long term Plateau is going to be at 100K and probably last about 3 years or so. This isn’t backed up by facts or stats but those are the vibes I’m getting. If BTC does hit 1Mill I’d bet it’d happen after 2040.

Takes me back to the good old days

The best time to buy was 10 years ago, the next best time to buy is now.
