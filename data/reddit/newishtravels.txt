During presale (I wish I knew anything about crypto back then)...1 BTC = 2000ETH, which right now would net you...$1.7M. 
A little later it'd be half that...still ~$850k. 
Now if you're comparing exactly 1 year ago...BTC has gone up 14x, ETH has gone up 100x. Compared to 2 years ago...BTC has gone up 34x and ETH, over 850x. 
It just depends on your timescale ;)

Should introduce you to options. But then again...maybe not xD

Could you list the bugs for me btw? It all often gets convoluted in everything else that happens in the cryptosphere.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:49:24
this...this is really good :D

They both serve different purposes. It's odd that everyone would like to think it HAS to be one or the other. I often like to think of BTC as gold, and ETH as oil. 
Or as others have stated...BTC as electronic gold, and ETH as web3.0

Yep...at nearly 800k transactions in 24hrs, it's finally being clogged. But the scaling issues were already known beforehand. What wasn't known was that a dapp would show up that would bring this many new transactions to the table.
And just last week it was ~600k, and things were fine, cheap, and fast as usual.

True...but instead if we assume he bought...416BTC ($10k worth)...then he would be at $1.3M instead of $5M. Meh still a millionaire. 
End of the day, it's always wouldda couldda shoudda. 
I remember when I bought shares of apple at $380 and sold at $405 (20 shares worth BEFORE the 7:1 split) being happy with a $500 gain. What would it have been if I held on to this day? $16k gain.

Agreed. Fun to note that in the past 24 hours, the number of transactions is &gt;70% more than BTC's. Closing in on 700k transactions in a day (&gt;than 50% of all crypto transactions combined).

:D Good good. I thought I was missing some other obvious ones. Everyone has their "DAO" moment ;) and thankfully the Parity bug wasn't with ETH itself, but only the wallet application.

It's amazing right? Person A buys house from person B means person B sold a house. Person B bought the house in the 50s. Person A bought person B's house in 2017. In=/=out. 
If you look at it all by itself - yes it makes sense. But OTHER things are being traded relative to crypto. And that's why it's not a zero sum game.
(I am agreeing with you)

Might have misunderstood. Proof of stake results in no advantage for people with cheaper electricity. Therefor there will be no advantage to centralizing it in places that have cheap electricity. There would be no economies of scale. Aka... a person with 10000BTC would generate the same as someone with 10BTC.......PERCENTAGE-WISE. 
The example would be bitcoin mining farms in china. POS would break that centralization.
Also by algos I meant that there are several ways to implement POS. There isn't just ONE method of POS. The goal is the same, but the path differs.

Are you sure? I think it's to the extent at which it levels the field. Depending on which algo is used. For some proof of stake levels the field by taking the advantage of lower electricity costs away. You still need to buy the hardware, and you're never going to make more than the guy with 10,000 ASICminers vs your single miner...BUT percentagewise, you both will make the same. 
Centralization now is based on where electricity is the cheapest. Take the cost of electricity out (or minimize it substantially) and now it doesn't matter WHERE you mine - hence decentralizing what was once becoming more and more centralized.
