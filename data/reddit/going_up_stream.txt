I don't see why you're being downvoted. I'm not exactly sure the reason but your assertion is valid. Though I would point out that miners probably aren't the only people selling, venders and investors could be too.

I feel that anonymity is important to preserving rights (and if we're being honest, destroying them too). So I don't think being anonymous is inherently bad.  
I don't think Bitcoin will last 3 more years(still wishful thinking), and then be replaced by better crypto-currencies. Furthermore you are too right that the "one world currency" people are clueless.  
I think we'd get along nicely in person ^ ^ . It's been extremely nice talking with you and you've made very good points that I can't help but consider. Sorry for calling you a troll

Buttercoin maybe?
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:30:47
The worth of a bitcoin is dependent on it's utility as a currency. otherwise why would you want a bitcoin if it's not useful? 
@_date: 2013-06-15 10:01:59
I don't think the hash rate of all the miners should determine value. The value should be derived from utility which is why Bitcoin is more valueable than traditional fiat currencies.
@_date: 2013-06-03 01:07:56
There are plenty of info sources that tell you this.  
You can buy them on exchanges like MtGOX, BTCe, etc...  
Also you should not mine with GPUs only FPGAs or ASICs. Mining Lightcoin with GPUs is a better idea.

It's in the block chain as I understand it
@_date: 2013-05-26 22:23:35
how is it scary?
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:51:16
Your rights can't come from yourself because they are too easily taken away by communities of other people. You join a community that gives you rights and return you give them rights and protect each other's rights.  
The government is the centralization of that community into a power to organize a larger community of people, giving more power to all these people to protect their rights and lives.
@_date: 2013-06-22 23:50:48

@_date: 2013-05-22 06:20:03
And really it's not totally vital to the economy just for the majority of exchanging Bitcoin for fiat. You find still convert fiat to Bitcoin by mining. You pay money for the hardware and electricity and you get Bitcoin, though this does not really support a heathy economy as it would be very difficult to get into Bitcoin without the exchanges.

Ah I see however I still think 4% while still a security hole is just as safe if not safer than the risk of charge back fraud which is quite higher if I'm correct.

Ya it's more like a 98% certainty.

He doesn't want money for what he's done so you can't
@_date: 2013-07-02 17:48:17
I think it's because they use gox to buy Bitcoin on credit when you order and that's why you get it right after the payment goes through 
@_date: 2013-06-17 10:47:20
You're getting your miner. Why complain?  It's late but earlier than than most people.
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:45:13
well I guess I could see how bitcoin can be considered a commodity but I don't think it should advertised as such because that gives the wrong idea, and so does calling it gold. A commodity is not money to the average person.

@_date: 2013-06-07 02:38:08
you really only need 6 at the most that's an hour. But you can be safe at even just one or two. It's really the same risk as a charge back fraud if not less of a risk

@_date: 2013-06-11 12:39:01
Well i think you are going to have a hard time finding sources for the social and economic impacts of Bitcoin because it is still so very new. You might have to do you're own research into that because at this point it's all speculation as to how Bitcoin is affecting the world

It would become harder to mine Bitcoins. The problem comes when they have enough mining power to control the network 50%+ which will be very hard to do 
@_date: 2013-07-08 01:44:12

Bitcoin gets it's exchange rate from basic supply and demand. It's value is subjective. Bitcoin's value is more derived from it's utility and because it's superior to traditional currencies. Any more specific questions that you want answered?

that was really fun to watch
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:47:33
i think you missed the point. BTC's price will not change. We will symply be saying 1mBTC is equal to 0.13USD as aposed to the current 1BTC is equal to 130USD.
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:20:59
ah i see yes the network size would defiantly add to the reliability. i still don't think bitcoin is a commodity though mostly because bitcoins don't exist as i understand it, when you make a transaction you just sign a contract that declares that an amount is moved from you're wallet to another.
@_date: 2013-08-10 21:59:36

or what i was thinking i would do is go to a local shop and have them use a high presser water saw to just cut it all into the metal.

That would still make the coins huge. I think they are just large replica/home made coins

Average rates over the major exchanges seems the best idea. Though knowing Google they'd use the "Google+ Money Exchange" so you can easily send money to friends and tell them what you buy.

It's not that we WANTED regulation the issue was that businesses would not accept something like Bitcoin because it wasn't a real thing. If the government recognizes it as a real thing then so too will businesses and exchanges will know how to avoid being arrested. The California law is just written poorly

I'm aware of the Russian cultural views of homosexuals. That is what is called a bias and opinion. I understand the amount of bias that RT has and try to dispel the shroud they cloak stories in. When they are the only "news" station capable of reporting on actual issues and they don't have any false hoods I see no reason to dismiss them as not valid news.

I don't fully understand what's going on!
@_date: 2013-07-28 00:58:47
Ok I'll concede that the National Rifle Association is not as presumptuous as The Bitcoin Foundation. But you must concede that a name should not be so swaying in your opinion of an entity. If I call my self Lord of all things hot dog and go about securing the hot dog economy by funding court cases, providing information, and paying hot dog developers to maintain the main model for other hot dogs; would it not be beneficial to all hot dog consumers and be worthy of recognition? You write off the Bitcoin Foundation because of a name and discount any discussion of them because you don't like A NAME?  
Then you go on to distract from the good that is paying Gaven by comparing it to all of the spending the US does (this is an inaccurate sweeping comparison that is a good example of "apple to oranges"). The US Gov funds medical research and many other very GOOD THINGS, so they do some good in funding such endeavors. Paying Gaven (which you find so egregious that you compare it to funding the killing of masses of people, e.g. the US military) allows him to work full time on a very important project, the Bitcoin protocol and the Satoshi client.  
Finally I would like you to refute or confirm that the following is true  
"The foundation DOES act in it's own interest as it is primarily composed of business owners who's businesses are dependent on the success of Bitcoin (I thought we all wanted that too). The foundation lacks the mining(voting) power in the network to make changes as you seem to think they do. Bitcoin will progress on with or without the foundation."

I assume you're comment is trolling because it adds nothing to the conversation. It seemed to be hostile for no reason, when you could have just said that you think the foundation is over stepping what the community wants/needs (A gross presumption for you to make in the first place). If this is not try then I'm sorry for calling you a troll.  
As for the Bitcoin Foundation, which PAYS Gavin, with money. You know that thing that's needed for Gavin to help support his family. The foundation DOES act in it's own interest as it is primarily composed of business owners who's businesses are dependent on the success of Bitcoin (I thought we all wanted that too). The foundation lacks the mining(voting) power in the network to make changes as you seem to think they do. Bitcoin will progress on with or without the foundation.  
The foundation's "good work" is facilitating progress in the Bitcoin economy by influencing laws that pertain to Bitcoin.  
You complaining about the foundation is like a random gun owner complaining about the NRA giving the Feds a central target and having influence over how guns are made. If you don't like the Bitcoin Foundation then you can fork it and start your own, like open source software, other wise you hold little ground by whining to my comment.

So tell me why they are better.
@_date: 2013-07-28 05:47:37
Well that name is very off putting but if it were that way i could try and get around it. (Doubtful though it has quite the negative connotation)  
You are right that perhaps calling themselvs the Bitcoin Buisness Asociation might have been better. I'm unsure of the origens of their name, and it's too late for me to be looking. I wish i could insure that the Bitcoin Foundation wouldn't become corrupt but i can't. Also, don't think i trust them with bitcoin fully. They pay Gaven and the other members of the main dev team so they can focus on the protocol and provide a legal entity for Bitcoin like the EFF does for Internet rights like free speech or privacy.  
Oh and we don't explicitly need Gaven, his team, or the foundation. It's only convienint to have them to keep a steady and reliable development. we as a community could dump them if they try anything bad and move on.  The cripto-currency inthusists understand this and it would be easy. though for others it makes no sence, most people need a master to tell them what to do because they don't, can't, or won't understand the subject of issue. The foundation isn't for me or you to follow it's for the future general populis.  
The only comment i've thought was trolling was the first one (i still think it was inappropriate).  
I don't plan on letting them rule me.  
on a side note; why did you say "down with aynonomis tor services"?
Sorry for misspellings. I'm on a phone and that was a lot of writing.

A world with a weaker world gov that simply over saw relations (trade and basic human rights enforcement)  of smaller regional gov that over see more specific law enforcement, conviction of criminals, and their rehabilitation would be a much more stable world. Give people rights, HELP the ill, and support a responsible economy is all the government really needs to do.
People will always want power. That is a main issue but it is not totally a government problem it is a cultural problem too.

didn't know they did that. i just figured that they link it to the genesis block and done because then the chain can sync up from there

They use the test net

A world where governments can't control DNS doesn't help anyone? Think about wikileaks.bit or thepiratebay.bit that would be amazing. The whole point of Bitcoin, namecoin(it could have a better name), bittorent, and bittorrent sync are all very useful for keeping the power with the people.
