So i'm not the only one... Perfect time for a flood.

I think they can totally to this as miners. I'm gonna search some mode about this, but the way i remember it is like this: miner finds nounce that works, takes transactions from mem pool, adds them and closes the block. So maybe you could, as a miner that is, add your coins and pay yourself back. Pretty awesome stiff. You could alao remove taint from coins. Hmm... Interesting concept that is.

This is from 6 December 2015. I fail to see your point
@_date: 2016-03-17 23:06:16
So this post with 30 points is at the bottom of the page while -6 takes the cake? o.O
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:00:42
Or somebody could write some code that if there are available transactions in mem pool, the miner is forced to include them.
@_date: 2016-03-20 11:13:07
We could change the limit to whatever mb now. If we wanted that is. There's written code available already. 
But hey, let's write more code and wait for it to be released and tested first, then all the wallets have to upgrade and be backwards compatible... 
I wonder what will happen if this code is not good enough. Will they just make us use it? Or can we just ignore it until it's been a couple of years and they find a better solution? By that time they will give us LN ( if nothing goes wrong there either ) and you'll have to pay more fees to the Borgs.
Not reasonable timeline for people who want to see this thing grow now. I've been telling everybody to stay out of Bitcoin for this reason: The technology is there, but the politicians what to get their cut.
@_date: 2016-03-19 20:45:52
Awesome. Could he tell us his opinion on Blockstream and what they are doing to cripple bitcoins growth? Is there any conflict of interest going on? Or are we just going mad here for nothing. Thanks
@_date: 2016-06-11 21:42:21
Revoked... Just like the HF :)))
@_date: 2016-06-11 21:45:55
Code that will make a predictable increase in blocksize will do it for me to be honest. I want this to be in the past already. It's not fun anymore.
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:13:48
Exactly. We should get as many transactions as possible. Considering the fact that this is a limited network, there are only a maximum number of transactions that the network can handle at this moment. We can't grow because we're already seeing full blocks after full blocks. We need to open the gates and allow more people ( transactions ) in before they decide to do transactions on another blockchain... And this artificial fee market is wrong. Miners have enough incentives ( coinbase transaction ) for the next 20 years.
@_date: 2016-06-27 11:09:45
Click bait
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:27:00
Because it has reached it's maximum. Come back in 3 years when we will be able to scale. We're still talking ( after 3 years that is ) and doing nothing now.
@_date: 2016-06-10 21:59:44
The problem will be solved 
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:46:36
Thanks OP. If you don't own the private keys, you don't own Bitcoin. It's that simple. You give someone your Bitcoin.... You gave them your Bitcoin. Not your anymore. Look for MtGox ( emptyGox that is )

They're being cut off because of the high fees. Let more people in.
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:40:08
Let them come. Let's hope we won't see a massive backlog.

Because of the artificial fee market that is being created now ( even though miners get paid their 25 (soon to be 12.5 ) bitcoin Coinbase transaction ) the fees will only rise. Maybe in 3 years when we get a HF to a larger blocksize ( sry to talk about this, but they are linked) the fees will go down a bit.
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:32:55
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:37:34
They will go down a bit. Not by much. But at least they will not increase. Say you have 1mb block. You can fill this with let's say 3000 transactions ( 4000 if you have small transactions ). You can't get over this limit because there isn't enough space for other transactions. SegWit basically takes the signatures and puts them in another field. That makes a little more space for transaction data, but you still only have 1mb to fill. So once you get there, you've hit the limit ( again i might add ). BTW this is presumably that all transactions in a block are SegWit transactions. From my understanding ( please let me know if i'm mistaken ), even after SefWit is released, ppl will have to build SegWit transactions to get the increase in capacity.
 So what happens next? Ppl pay more fees to incentivize the miner to confirm their transaction first. This will build a backlog and create a Fee Market.
Now say you have an 8mb block. You could fill 8 times the transactions you could in a 1mb block. Now take the 8mb block and fill it with SegWit transactions... You could add even more transactions.
See where i'm going with this?
Now the problem is that if Bitcoin really catches on and we are not ready for these new transaction on the network, we as a community have failed. The Overlords have won and they will make Bitcoin a settlement layer only for rich guy who can pay 10 usd for a transaction... Might as well call the banks if we get there.
I signed up for " A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash ". Not a settlement layer. You can make it whatever you want as long as we get the p2p cash with low fees. 
Hope this makes sense. Got a little carried away. Have a good day man. Welcome to over 600 ;)
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:56:59
Bitcoin isn't ready to go mainstream. Give them another 3-5 years and hopefully it will work. If it goes mainstream tomorrow the backlog will kill most nodes seeing how most nodes are ran as side projects on Raspberry Pi"s. If this goes mainstream tomorrow everybody will hate it because nobodys transactions will get confirmed or will have to wait days/weeks to get 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:15:07
Lawl. That's funny because "Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"

Raise the block size already.

Nobody's perfect man. But he's been with Bitcoin for longer time than you or me. It would be a shame to lose Gavin due to drama and politics

Same here. Coinbase is an awesome company that has created growth for Bitcoin. loves drama so now these posts are allowed.

Ok so you use reddit and that's it? Do you have online banking by any chance? Or you're cash only?
@_date: 2016-07-30 11:31:12
Then stop using google, facebook and mostly all sites on the interwebs... Even reddit collaborates with FBI.
@_date: 2016-07-20 23:00:34
Install Mycelium ( or another wallet ) and SEND him some bitcoin.

Did you even listen to the interview? They joked about it for 30 sec and then moved on. So much drama And FUD. I do agree with you: DO NOT keep your coins on ANY Exchange.
