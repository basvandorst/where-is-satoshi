Builds character.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:31
But that wont happen to me
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:59:33
Thats some Mr Robot Next Level intelligence going on right there to protect his crypto
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:01:33
Who are they exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:22:35
That still doesnt help it make anymore sense
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:29:58
Hey bay be dont say may be
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:19:16
Crypto is addicting
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:57:07
JP Morgan knows how to throw a party.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:36:47
Shorts met a Pumpasorous Rext
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:30:44
Join the party.

If waking up every morning and feeling like you got kicked in the nuts makes you happy then yes.
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:24:35
Sounds about right
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:35:47
Username checks out
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:17:31
Exactly why she was chosen to be spokesperson.
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:15:58
You have been watching too much Game of Thrones.
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:12:32
It's beyond his capacity of understanding.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:24:11
His Dad gave him millions. If that isnt money out of the air what is?
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:58:45
Outsmart your future, self shooting self, and only load blanks.
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:30:18
Imoca 60 is on my list.
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:33:42
Well that sucks
@_date: 2019-11-06 12:45:18
So trust them not to find out what's on there? Okay sounds solid.
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:23:19
Fun ☺
@_date: 2019-11-27 09:44:48
Sounds smart, what could go wrong? How could you prove you didnt transfer the btc and now have remorse?
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:58:19
User name disappoints.  
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:00:07
Do you really have to ask?
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:53:36
Not if they cant get their money out of the bank and into bitcoin. I hope they dont lose everything they worked for. Those people have struggled too much and too long for peace and prosperity. The United States's current administration has its head up its ass and the world is falling apart taking advantage of the lack of leadership from the USA.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:53:07
Just a public service announcement, I just went in so its a great time to short. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 17:14:25
Only when I'm  not checking prices ��
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:40:17
Seems about the easiest way tbh
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:03:32
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:01:43
Safety deposit boxes aren't as safe as one would like to think unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:38:32
I thought that only applied to having sex
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:17:31
I watched a buy wall of 1000 Btc  get filled last night right before falling asleep. Stuff dreams are made of.
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:29:23
But my new Bitcoin embroidered  trainers just arrived ��
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:19:06
Think opposite of inflation.
@_date: 2019-08-09 20:57:33
Yes that's right.
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:14:00
Lets see the beauty
@_date: 2019-10-09 00:50:51
Sketchy af
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:51:57
Or buy a sailboat and anchor off the coast.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:28:45
Hmmm Eden like island, that sounds great.
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:31:48
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:45:32
Maybe put her on r/sailing and someone might fall in love.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:23:07
It makes you rich while also homeless.
@_date: 2018-06-20 08:28:38
Nah man not that wallet, give up the bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 00:48:24
Binance.us is available for USA customers.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:12:39
Thank you for your sacrifice.
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:54:25
The wind blowing and leaves rustling.
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:18:59
I didnt know you slept over
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:57:41
I believe that someone smart enough to conceive Bitcoin will be smart enough to understand  that their anonymity is priceless.
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:43:38
Powerful Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:11:19
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:30:51
She looks great!
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:21:38
Stop going sideways now
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:47:16
He left the building
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:20:20
I just got back from the future. None of you drive anymore but your maids have Lambos.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:43:58
Unless they are doing the phising
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:19:30
When shoes
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:03:42
The bedroom
@_date: 2019-02-13 06:29:30
Screen name checks out.
@_date: 2019-10-06 20:31:33
Coinbase just raised there fees. Best to shop around
@_date: 2019-02-13 05:35:44
You sound easily amused.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:35:44
Sounds a little bossy to me but have fun
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:12:31
Soon to be on Fox
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:49:31
Have a blast at the event, it looks like a lot of fun!
@_date: 2019-12-10 04:11:51
Anyone you dont know dms you about crypto on any social media block them.
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:23:51
Excellent, where do a sign up and which way are the toilets?
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:22:49
Wouldnt just  a large BTC symbol be better?
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:24:45
Brace for impact when you see the markup
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:30:02
Not last year.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:29:59
He bought it at 19k as well...
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:24:23
Every one that says hodl I'm convinced is shorting. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:17:28
Im pretty sure that he said he bought at the top as well but im not rewatching that again. I feel too bad for his family.
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:10:38
Just happier
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:51:25
HODL is just code for short. It took me a while to figure it out.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:58:37
Last time I checked the one near me had a 2K mark up. I would sit back and watch the shitshow settle before getting in. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:39:45
Guess you didn't read the hat. /s
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:13:19
That's very cool.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:07:56
I can see that it may be wiped out. Hope that helps
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:39:39
Like Litecoin?
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:44:18
Waterboarding seems to be very effective. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:36:38
We both looked into the abyss, but when it looked back at us, you blinked. Don't blink. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:33:56
Its on its way down. Why not wait and buy it when its on its way up? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:51:58
Sounds like most of my relationships.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:07:05
Me too
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:11:32
The awesome series Mr.Robot comes close with Ecoin
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:51:16
The first kick in the nuts is the worst then it gets slightly less worse.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:51:25
To underestimate the reach of his target demographic would be a mistake. The MMA community is vast and far reaching. The more high profile individuals that mention Bitcoin, the better for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:19:03
@_date: 2019-09-29 20:34:25
You sent some random on Insta your bitcoin and he ripped you off? Who would have thought that?
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:41:02
Because Trump
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:52:36
Except every time it does.
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:54:28
Just think of all the bitcoins inside! /s
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:20:44
Sounds legit wcgw?
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:02:27
Try telling that to someone's Grandparents. Should be easy to back trace and earn some well needed prison time.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:56:49
Yep move coins to Binance if trading, hardwallet if hodling.
