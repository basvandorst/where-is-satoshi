I can guarantee that it will hit 12k within the next 12 hours, though where it will go from there is a mystery.

r/bitcoin and r/wallstreetbets for non-stop fun

robinhood I believe, looks nice but I don't recommend it for trading as you cant transfer BTC out of it (at least not yet)

damn, your IQ is so deep in the negatives it could just overflow. I wish the best of luck ya.

Due to the fact you cant transfer your bitcoin out of the app. Its almost as if you don't even own it.

This shit gives me heartburn

normally losing 1k in value would cause me to panic, but this just made me laugh.

Just some guys having a bit of fun, it aint nothing to worry about (at least in the long run)

I dived in on a couple calls and the returns are looking nice, though i don't really trust the company and will probably just sell them off once this surge is over but thats just my experience.

I'm in the same situation, you just gotta wait till the 9th. When you are able to transfer funds just login into coinbase pro using your coinbase info and hit deposit, find bitcoin and there will be the option to pull from your coinbase account (for free).
