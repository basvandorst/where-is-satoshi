I will have to look into this in the future, i strictly only buy and never send so im not to familiar with how things like this work. Was sending to a friend trying to get him involved in bitcoin (good first impression lol) ive seen a lot of people saying rhings along these lines and their btc "gets lost" is that what im experiencing? Or am i judt going to have to wait a while for the confirmations to start happening.
