How would they know what we are using the electricity for? It could be an HVAC system.
As for the actual miner, I think I could arrange that underhand after declaring it as a 'computer'.

He would get freshly minted bitcoins in exchange for the money burnt on miners/electricity. The freshly minted btc would be 'clean'?

That sort of makes sense. I guess in my mind, its a lot more traceable to buy toasters than to buy electricity. 
And the advantage I see in bitcoin is that he can easily move his money to an offshore location. Traditional currency would be hit by restrictions on moving money off-shore, scrutiny and sizeable taxes.
I get that its not really possible for you to know whether a post like this is genuine or not, but for what its worth this relative (it is rumored, he doesn't admit to much) made a lot of money from investing repeatedly in a Ponzi scheme of sorts where the scammer offered extreme profits in short amounts of time (you can probably guess how that scheme eventually ends).

Does [this]( not seem legit?

Yeah good idea :/. I did get a few weird messages.

What I meant was, I can get *a few* ant miners without too much scrutiny or suspicion. Once I have those, my assumption was my main costs for the next 15 months will be electricity.
The end goal here is to move the money abroad gradually without arousing suspicion. Since bitcoin is 'nation less', I felt it might make things easier.
Of course, if you have any other ideas too I'd be thankful.
