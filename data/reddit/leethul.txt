I used this a while ago. Worked well.

Looks like Mellow Mushroom to me. I used to work at the Savannah store. Interesting.

So basically is even more circlejerky than and that's what you like it about it? They just had a more recent rally so their spirits are higher that's all. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:59:57
Ok, I'll give it a go, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:59:18
Thanks for playing! bucketofpurple , You're the winning bid. PM me for details. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:59:38
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:19:41
Ok, thanks! I'll give it until this evening and I'll let you know. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:05:00
bucketofpurple has the winning bid. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:44:28
Radio silence so far. Just sent you a PM. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:48:36
I ended up waiting on the blockchain to download fully, so yes! Done with armory though for sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:57:36
Just bought a 20$ code, I'll let you know how it goes. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:49:37
Awesome. Gyft is awesome. Everytime they add something like this it just makes even more sense to streamline my paycheck into bitcoins as soon as I get it. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:19:52
I've posted in the bitcointalk thread as well, but haven't heard anything other seeing my name on the 4/8 list. It sounds like bitinstant has moved on from that list now, however.  All the info is here: 
This was sunday night. I'm hoping to get my coins at that price. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:43:59
Gyft rules IMO. The triple points for btc's(basically 3% off) has been pretty great for puchases I would have made anyway. If btc over the laung haul proves to truly be deflationary, it may the way to go even if a place like amazon were accept btc's directly. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:00:43
And Greenspan has always been right!
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:59:17
I would assume that if you buy anything with btc, you are essentially selling them for the cash value of what you are buying. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:22:41
Bask in the ignorance!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:05:52
You are on the right track. Once you go through all the steps you will feel empowered and amazing as you basically just built your own bank. Now, what to do with that paper backup? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:50:15
Ah nice, thanks for taking the time. Anything stand out or are you just out for a troll? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:59:13
I think this same type of effect is happening to adults. It's an awakening. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:03:39
As an experiment, I have been doing this since the April rally. Clearly it's been great so far. I envision a world where this becomes standard practice. BTW the dollar itself was deflationary at the turn of the century and "Savings" used to have this effect anyway. Bitcoin is the rebirth of a savings based economy and society. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:29:19
I'm feeling your forecast, just can't bring myself to sell beforehand. Buy if it happens? Sure. Recouping your principle is probably a smart move. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:30:46
Andreas is quickly becoming my favorite voice in the bitcoin space. Anytime I'm feeling doubtful about the future of crypto currency, listening to him makes me feel better about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:42:48
I will for sure use you for my next track. Just finished one recently and I already have someone lined up to master. I actually offered to pay my engineer in bitcoin, but pretty much got crickets. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:33:01
I have noticed this when using coinbase to buy the humble bundle. Does not ask for 2-way, which I have set up. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:08:09
As innovative as steam has been, I would be shocked if they don't adopt it soon. In the meantime you could buy steam codes with btc from this site which was just posted on reddit and I just tried out myself. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:47:55
Great link. Brings back memories. It really does feel like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:40:19
Yeah, load up on the noots while buying coins! The future!
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:41:32
In this case I am pretty screwed with my paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:22:51
So I have been an avid listener to JRE for at least 3 years, maybe longer. I've seen him live upwards of 20 times. I have pondered this myself, and chuckled when Redban said "bitcoin god shut down" when SR got taken down. I just think that Joe hasn't spent any time researching it, and hasn't felt the need to. I don't think David Seaman has been on the podcast since he's been as into bitcoin as he is now, so it will probably take a guest like him. Obviously a Roger Ver or an Erik Voorhees as a podcast guest would be the best case scenerio. Not sure if it's on their radar yet or not. A lot of guests happen because enough tweets and stuff like that made it happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:20:58
same here
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:33:16
Worked! Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:00:10
I think if Gyft becomes a giant company due to being awesome and accepting btc along with triple points back, it's a great thing for bitcoin. Others will just be given more incentive to follow suit.

Just got this wallet a week or so ago and it's really slick, clean, and simple. Looking forward to this update. 
My one critique on all android wallets i've used so far though is, there doesn't seem to be any security at all. I have a lock on my phone, but once you are in you have access to everything in my mycelium and coinbase wallets, which I'm kind of uncomfortable about. 
edit: Ok, read the description in google play and it sounds like I need to learn how to use some security features. In the meantime, only putting walk around money into it seems like a decent move. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:01:42
I switched to an S4 from iphone while under that plan with AT&amp;T, still have it. You're good to go.
