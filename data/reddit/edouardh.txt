What "manipulation" are we talking about here ?

Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, can't be really defined as retrograde **in the context of his own country** : he's the one wishing to build Neom, the most technologically advanced city in the world, and he's also the one who gave the right to drive to women. I know it sounds like a joke to westerners, but I guess many high ranked people wish him dead in his own country just for this change.
All that to say that indeed Al-Waleed bin Talal may well be corrupted as the other arrested ones.

Please don't make me say what I didn't. I didn't say that he did that in good faith, or that he is not corrupted himself (even if I wouldn't see the point regarding his actual wealth), and even less that he was progressive in a general context. I said that he :

From [this article]( a freestanding ATM machine costs between $3,500 and $7,000. Knowing that this ATM had to be conceived and built internally, plus the fact they weren't able to save money by scaling since they only produced a few, I wouldn't be surprised if it costed them between 15 and 20K.
And I didn't even add that :
* they surely have monthly fees to pay to the place owner or the public space it is standing upon,
* they won't have many clients so they can't play one the mass market effect to lower their fees.

Regarding BTC, it seems like most traders have picked up their positions by now and are quietly waiting for the fork.
The remaining up could be caused by the regular cohort of newcomers entering the cryptospace when BTC is consistently going up for multiple days in a row.

Haha indeed a 2 days old account posting something like that and then replying he's been around since 2013. That makes sense ;)

I wouldn't be surprised if you are right !
Let's say the situation is quite complicated there, we don't have much information leaks about Muhammad bin Nayef (his predecessor) reign... Let's say it's really a 50-50, ["analysts" don't know]( if Salman is the missing visionary who will clean and modernize Saudi Arabia, which could redistribute Middle East cards, or just a dangerous megalomaniac.

Most people still think about their holdings in fiat-based value. I don't :

That's a good point, I agree that it would be nice to add that to FAQ :)
