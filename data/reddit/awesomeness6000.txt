If 11.7 and 10.5 breaks - we dropping to 8k
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:04:34
I went to Kraken. Thats how much I dislike Coinbase right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:18:20
Compared to how it was. I guess yes. If I had the option tho, I'd trade on bitfinex or bitmex but im in the US and don't want to risk going the vpn route.

Hey - Im about to wire but was hoping it'd be same day like yours - did you wire before the 1pm (PST) cut off?
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:34:03

@_date: 2018-01-19 09:08:41

@_date: 2018-01-29 20:51:24
I just bought some with no problem
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:33:22
if it doesnt bounce, its guaranteed to break 10.5. 
8k here we come!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:21:36
11/11 or 11/12 when Bcash pumped and dumped and BTC went down. Not sure if he missed type and meant to say 5k cuz that was pretty much the lowest a month ago.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:27:10
ok then. im fomo-ing in. ive been sitting at the sidelines since 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:51:39
aw rekt lol - damn my [target]( didnt hit so i turned bullish. Easy ascending wedge :(, ah well got stopped out of that dumped and havent traded cause im a bit salty LOL. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:28:23

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:39:22

@_date: 2018-09-04 23:50:30
Well my reply to you was like a month ago while this enitre thread was bullish at around 8k - I was still bearish as fuck lol. Got out of my SHORT at 5.9 then just waited for a good entry somewhere. 
My current position- LONG at 6.5
There was some idiot that opened a 2k btc short at 6k (fucking moron) which made me look at the margin ratios and realized it look fcked and was setting up for a short squeeze. ALOT of shorts opening in that range too before the ETF thing came out trying to front running since everyone expected it to be denied. 
BUTTTTT what gave it away was how the bullish traders I trade with are had starting to feel bearish in mid-August AAANNDDDD how the [smart dudes]( were flipping to longs.
My current outlook is neutral- I am being EXTRA cautious right now. I'm looking to exit out of my position soon since are coming up on a major fib level, I expect to see a battle at 7.5. I expect this to go to 7.9 then back down to 7.5 for a higher low - then I will probably start converting to bullish (first time this year). Im loving this step ladder, grind up - instead of the verticality that we have been seeing.
The weekly is the only thing thats keeping me from going back to full bear. The 6k support is REALLL lol.
As far as 10k, seems reasonable but kinda unlikely. Even if does break I don't see any move up getting past 11.7
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:04:35
ahhh you again! hello fellow trader! Spring 2019 is when well probably see 12k again. We going dowwnnnnn, got my bounce at 6k but this is the descent down. See you down there!  
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:44:05
5/11/2018 - 12:45 am - it broke 8 7. temp bounce. then more dumpage - ill see you back at 6 5 - 6 6 k
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:56:41
The price wouldn't tank if you sold as it went up. Like if you decided to start selling at around 15k. Your $178 million worth of bitcoin would have made the price go up- there was alot of demand, and you are the supply. The problem would be getting it out. If you had sold those bitcoins on several exchanges thats connected to a bank account, but doing it on one exchange, good luck.

hidden bear div on the daily. this thing is asking to re-test 6 6
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:17:06
ok so this was 8 days ago. the only reason why i said that during those moves was because of how we are not breaking resistance with conviction - any time it tries to go above like 4 hour / 1 hour resistance it will just retrace down. Same thing on that move from 7.9/8k to 8.4/8.5 it struggled to break above that to try and retest the 8.8 area. as of 5/22 11:11 pm pacific current price is at 7 9. well probably see a move up to 8.2 then come down. If we close below the weekly MA its pretty much the indication that its deffinately going to break 6.5 and make new lows - probably 4k
3.5k - 4k would be the capitulation price for the deep pocket guys who bought at 19k (not whales - just rich dudes who decided to get in bitcoin). Im pretty sure I'll get wicked at 2.5k lol
@_date: 2018-05-31 11:50:52
5/31 4:47 am pacific \- damn. closed my short at 71. seemed like it was being defended well. went long at 7085. its paying off so far. if theres a solid break out to 9 then damn, i dont think ill see 2.5. I dont think this upside move will go past 82 tho. well see
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:06:56
I like you
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:59:44
ah yes. here we are. you ready for 2.5k?
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:29:41
5/13/2018 - 9:25 pacific time - new weekly candle - rallied to 8 7 with that beautiful diamond bottom formation yesterday- that was the move to get you that 9k- but this is so so rekt. 82 has been personally a good support - rejected that formation of the head and shoulders which helped boost the move to 9.9 (about a month ago when it broke out of 6.8) - held on Fri - Sat. I think this will keep retesting till it breaks, my next support would be the break out at 6.8. Probaby come June well be at 6 5 - 6 6.   
Edit** - just to expand - 6 5 - 6 6 was heavily defended when we were there - if that breaks then I dont really see anything underneath that would be considered support until 3.5k - I think 3.5k would be the capitulation price of the people who bought that top - 15k+ - which then would probably push the price to 2.5k. but ill see you at 6 5 - 66 tho lol 
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:17:23
oh dont worry, my target is 2.5k - its still gonna get there. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:44:39
i guess you bought the top?
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:09:24
2.5k Confirmed
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:28:23
beautiful short man. i closed mine a tad early and longed the 71 - 76 upside movement. i was hoping 72 wouldve held when it went down again because it was riding along the bottom side of the triangle on the daily - loss a bit when it broke 7k but all good.
what im counting on (short term) is some sort of bounce / short squeeze around 6k. Quick up and quick down. The Long Short ratio on bitfinex is starting to come to an equilibrium. What Im actually most scared of now is getting TOOOOO bearish that I'll miss out on a beautiful long.
Other than that man, ill see you at 2.5k (well atleast 4k lol. 2.5k is my exaggerated target). Happy Trading Dude!!
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:47:37
welp here we are lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:22:52
hello friend. even though this post is deleted it was the last response you made to me. The other thread was locked. We made new lows. 2.5k here we come, 6k is now heavy super resistance, need to get above it soon or atleast test it or this bear market will continue to 2020
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:55:55
lolololololololoolololoolololol. we going to 2.5 man. i was saying it all year
