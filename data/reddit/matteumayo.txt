I wouldn't expect the extra back. I would expect the amount in BTC I spent back. Well really I would expect a gift card in 1-2 days like they initially told me was their policy.
I think of two things:
It's the difference between treating the BTC like a currency or not. If they treated it like a currency, I should get the BTC amount back. If not, I should get the USD value of BTC back.
Second thing: The differing values in BTC sent and BTC refunded occurred entirely due to their long delay and due to their error. Why should I have to suffer the consequences?
I know, technically they can just send me the USD value back if that is their policy. But from what I understood this wasn't even the policy. I was strung along both in that I was initially told it would be 1-2 days and that I would be given gift card value back, and also in that they took 20 days and the price fluctuated enormously. As a customer, it feels bad.

I love this thread! I'm on page 3 talking about how crazy it was... in 2011

Thanks. I've shifted my perspective towards yours recently, and I'm also saving the BTC I have left.
I may have exaggerated my regret in my previous post; I think (especially recently) I've come to terms with my past BTC "mistakes".

Did this work out at all? I'm from the US but I was looking for a similar setup.

For a 50% cut I can send you a link to a youtube video on how to get that hard drive out.

Got into BTC in January 2011, made some bad sales (sold at $1 then weeks later the 2011 bubble happened), but I'm still happy with what I have.
I've been very impressed with the BTC community, this really is an incredible thing we have here.
Cheers to $100!

I got here early 2011.  Mined solo and got a couple blocks (100 BTC).
Sold them for $1 each since it had been at &lt;=10 cents, and $100 seemed huge at the time.
I resisted temptation during the 1st bubble (~$30) and didn't sell however, so I still have some.
But man do I wish I didn't sell those first 100 BTC.  I imagine that I'll be thinking that more and more as time passes.

Very cool. [I saw one earlier that was over 8k BTC.](

Aw, sorry to hear.
Well hopefully things will open up in the future. Cheers.

44.5% final offer

That plus the fact that the mining difficulty is rapidly increasing right now, meaning even though they break even quickly now, by the time they are shipped it could be completely different. Time will tell I suppose.

I'm stuck here too, puzzling.
