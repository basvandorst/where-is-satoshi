And I'll add to this that everyone in this forum is a redditor for &lt;3 months, most 4 weeks and under.  That's quite telling.

It wouldn't be slow because it has 8x the block size -- it could EASILY handle the current Bitcoin network. You're the one that doesn't get it.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:19:52
Because nobody is using it anymore -- and that is why the mempool is clearing.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:43:42
I am saying that the longer term and even medium term cryptocurrency enthusiasts have left Bitcoin, or at the very least this forum.
Think what you want but the Bitcoin mempool is HIGHLY correlated with major altcoin rallies. The market has spoken.

Highly underrated comment.

Metcalfe's law on the value of a network pegs Bitcoin at $17,000 with it's current number of users, and it can't handle any more, so I think you're right.  Until Bitcoin can handle more users it won't appreciate beyond 15-20k and alts will thrive.

Nobody uses segwit let alone LN. Bitcoin has a major adoption issue. Not to mention the LN hub model has huge centralization issues. Bcash is functional now, Bitcoin is maybe functional in the future. I have zero investment in either but putting all your eggs into one basket that MIGHT work seems silly.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:10:34
At least that copy is still functional as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:40:08
You're nuts -- Bitcoins price is following Metcalfs law and is almost exactly the square of it's daily users. If Bitcoin could handle even 2x the users you're talking Bitcoin $34,000-$68,000.
Instead core chose to cap its daily users here and give life to altcoins. 
Linear increases in users has consistently led to x^2 gains in price -- to say you need to exponentially increase your user base to increase price is just flat out not based on facts.

Lol this is how to get Bitcoin for free -- it's still going to cost you a butt ton to transfer it out of Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:32:51
You do all of the above -- you increase the number of lanes and you come up with other unique solutions.
You certainly do not stifle growth during your period of largest growth while waiting on a long term solution that you're not even 100% sure it works.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:35:54
Except for the fact that nobody will adopt segwit and LN needs full adoption to even function.
I'm not even a BCH supporter, I hate BCH.  I was a huge Bitcoin guy that left for Decred out of frustration.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:32
Mempool wouldn't be clogged and there would be no BCH if we had 8mb blocks ...
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:48:37
Shorting in the face of massive hedge fund buy interest ... seems like a good plan.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:04:07
Decred solves this issue, just sayin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:25:02
Bingo, there was ZERO excuse for not putting in a block increase to alleviate short term pain while still working on LN.  That blunder by core is responsible for pandora's box of alt coins opening.
What happens if LN turns out not to be the golden parachute everyone thinks it is? Then Bitcoin is actually dead.

Pension funds don't pump and dump -- they have far too much capital for that. They buy and hold.
A hedge fund might pump and dump -- those guys are already in the crypto space.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:24:52
Well the good news is Roger and company are about to become small potatoes once institutional money comes to buy Bitcoin in Q1 2018.  This pump and dump is their last hurrah.

Can't market make to your clients without accumulating a strong core position first lolol

People that think this is just noobs buying for free fork coins need to listen to Mike Novogratz lectures on the herd of institutional money that is coming. I pity anyone who isn't 90%+ into BTC for Q1 2018.

Asset managers are terrible at managing assets. I am a professional market maker and rip them off regularly. I have 90% of my assets in Bitcoin.

Agree. I do think we will see Bitcoin become extremely regulated as it goes mainstream.  That's definitely a negative for me.  I think institutions could care less about hard forks/features and just see it as a unique store of value that us peasants are using.
I personally am slowly dripping out of half my bitcoin for decred because of the way they allow everyone to have a vote/voice in all decisions.  Maybe it goes nowhere but I feel like that was the original spirit/intention of Bitcoin.

DRW has been arbing this to the point that their Bitcoin trader is retired at like age 32

Shadowstats has CPI at 10% inflation according to the measure everyone used back in the early 80s.  The Fed just changed the way CPI is measured more than once over the years to hide the fact that they are inflating away all our wealth and equity returns are 80% inflation.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:00:46
Ahead of schedule and under budget.

Any thoughts as to whether just BTC will survive or there will be a multi-cryptocurrency ecosystem?
Until recently I thought many would survive but it appears to me as though banks are currently getting into BTC (we almost NEVER go down during NYSE hours). This tells me they are going to have their slower customers (the guys that re-balance once per year) getting into BTC in Q1 2018. (Banks have been front running their own clients for 100 years) At the moment BTC is really the only crypto that has the liquidity for any type of large-ish fund ... so it feels like just by the timing of it BTC may leave everyone else in the dust.

That's because if the ETF departs from the underlying basket there is an army of bots waiting to jump on the arb.  You can create/redeem shares of the underlying, Google it.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:53:48
Agree. Hedge funds are getting in and there is a futures contract coming out. As soon as we break $5,000 everyone that sold thinking $5,000 was a local high is going to have to buy back $5500 and $6000.
Hedge fund money entering is a lot bigger deal than teenagers dumping shitcoins for BTC.

lolwut who pays tax on their bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:59:29
I agree with the premise, but disagree on the 2% inflation
a. look into how the fed calculates inflation -- it's completely useless. shadowstats currently has US inflation running around 10%, which I think is much more believable.
b. secondly, inflation will fluctuate and the fed is so hamstrung by the enormous US debt that they literally cannot raise rates above about 3-4% or the US will go bankrupt -- you could get an out of control inflation event that takes us to the moon.
c. I'd add that Bitcoin will be some weighted average of global inflation, not just US.
Really like the post though, as a former currency trader I 100% agree with your premise.

You don't need smart contracts to be a great store of value. Sometimes simple is better -- see the Andreas talk on Bitcoin vs Ethereum.

I wasn't around for previous bubbles but hedge fund money is getting in so this time may actually be different. Having said that there's an awful lot of get rich quick type investors right now so I wouldn't be shocked to see a mini crash at some point.

No, it would be the CFTC.
