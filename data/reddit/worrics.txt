Nope. I put my transaction to some bitcoin boosting site or whatever it was called and it got confirmed the same afternoon. I guess we can only learn from that. I hope yours comes through...

Thanks! For double spending, do I have to have the exact same output as the original transaction? Because my total balance was 0.059 and with the low fee I could send those 0.059 as output, but now i can only send 0.056 as I increased the fee.
I guess it has to be the exact same transaction just with another fee? Is this correct? Would it work then when I send some few Satoshis so I had enaugh to send 0.059 (original amount) + new higher fee?
edit: i also tried to broadcast the transaction on some pushtx sites, all had this error.

Do I have to use the same sending output for both transactions? I sent 0.059 at the original transaction (that was also almost my total balance (0.0595), so 0.059 to the recepient and 0.0005 BTC to the Miner). When I want to double spend, i want to use higher fees ofc. So therefore i can only send 0.056 as output and 0.0035 are for the miner. 
So, is it a problem for double spending when those values are different? (0.059 originally and now only 0.056).
I cant send more as thats my total balance..

ty so much for the explaination. is it safe to post the hex of a signated transaction in the internet? isnt there my priv. key included?

No I didnt. I used electrum. I might have done something wrong. I had 0.059 BTC as total balance and sent it with only 50 sat/byte fee instead of 350. So i sent approx. 0.058 BTC when u subtract the fee. I deleted the unconfirmed transx in electrum to generate a new signed one with a higher fee. Obviously, now I dont have the same output as this was my whole balance and now i can only send approx. 0.056 BTC as output (if you get what i mean). Do the recepient BTC values have to be the same for double spending or can i have different values?

Unfortunately no, only 2 outputs, Miner fee and actual transaction value for the recipient.

Uhm, I mean, in the screenshot the guy probably received money from somebody over a payment platform (like neteller, paypal, ...), but I do not know this app/payment method so I asked what payment this is that it has that high fees. Or why should he pay 20 $ for a BTC transaction? OP didn't post any infos so I'm a bit confused. :D

What payment method is this?
