I'm confused by what you're getting at. Banks are able to benefit from financial services because they have a large amount of money.
I personally do not own enough Bitcoin to be able to give out a loan, and if whoever I lend to defaults on their loan I'm shit out of luck.
When you talk about these entrepreneur opportunities available, you're basically talking about the need for a Bitcoin bank with  enough capital to give out loans and assume risk. It's not decentralizing, it's just a shift of power to someone else.

Venmo is the one true crypto!

Fair enough. I just don't see the push for decentralization when at best power is going to shift from a few organizations to the founders of coins and some miners in China.

And the other half profited heavily

I'm guessing a lot of people are switching out of their alts in order to ride the most recent Bitcoin rally. This is what I did with some of my smaller holdings.

Crypto is not regulated by the SEC or insider trading laws

Holy shit. This type of talk is the definition of a bubble.

Why is BTC at it's most vulnerable?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:57:50
This has been run of the mill action for months now with all cryptos. I don't see why coinbase would specifically want BTC to fail

As a small investor, you don't really have to option of betting on it going up. Being able to loan and sell contracts requires a lot of capital.
When someone takes out a short position, there's someone on the other side of the contract in the long position.

This may be bad for Bitcoin in the long run as it adds more competition to the market, many people who don't know much about crypto only use coinbase as their trading platform.

Do you think that's a good thing? It seems like that sort of thing makes Bitcoin a much more dangerous investment.

Interesting, so the original comment is wrong then. A decrease in difficulty is in a way a bailout for miners, decreasing their costs to mine.

Not true at all and there's a huge difference between knowing about it and investing in it
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:24:46


You realize that if miners stop getting the rewards they're hoping for, they'll stop mining, running Bitcoin, right?
