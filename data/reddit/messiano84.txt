In his defense,  he actually tried a bit to understand it and got some things right,  others very wrong. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:23:15
sounds like market manipulation for their "election" agenda... sad.
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:12:54
My guess: AlisterMaclin ? That guy has really smart BTC "attacks". 
@_date: 2016-03-26 02:10:51
Seems pretty accurate.

Thank you very much.  This is the most informative reply I have seen concerning hf and segwit, please include something like this in the capacity increase FaQs!

Did you test what BashCo said to you regardings this being a Reddit-wide auto-filter?
@_date: 2016-06-07 18:58:27
Oh no,  Peter Todd must be using Steam now!  ;D
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:38:40
And why this belongs in this sub?
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:32:05
Mistyped title. Can mods remove this?

Perhaps if I start sending my dick pics to the blockchain it will be worth 19 billion?

said the BTC manipulator who shuts his exchange to short the market

found my dirty crypto secret :D

A 5 year old understand division, maybe an ELI2 is needed here?
@_date: 2016-11-19 18:00:59
Do it !
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:51:46
I thought South America...  
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:59:01
He didn't.  He justs supports Classic as well. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:42:26
People selling BTC for USD. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 23:45:53
Read the author twitter,  its even worse... 
@_date: 2016-09-27 14:12:58
Funny how the "not-censored" sub downvoted this to oblivion yet claim this one has issues with censorship.

I believe he endorses the idea of multiplie clients and development teams. The best ideas  (it's not a choice  between client A or B) will become part of the consensus protocol 
@_date: 2016-09-25 01:39:58
FINEXing lol...
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:55:20
read hal finney posts in 2010 on bitcointalk :)
@_date: 2016-09-27 12:12:22
I meant he meant competing as in the ETH / ETC case, by splitting the chains and value.
@_date: 2016-09-22 20:05:04
90% ready!!
@_date: 2016-09-23 21:32:53
That cleared things up for me, and I have read a lot of posts about segwit, please PSA this point (with more details) for more visibility!
@_date: 2015-09-14 03:06:44
They are stress testing with mBtc transactions :) 
@_date: 2015-09-10 15:58:49
Besides being controversial, those test might actually be benefitial to the network, by showing exploitable flaws. Since Bitcoinxt nodes have beem DDos so easily, also makes me wonder how resilient are other nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-19 18:45:47
Great iniciative,  given FIDE's bizarre past  and heterodox choices I can't see why addopting Bitcoin would be a bad move. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 17:42:27
Foxbit.com.br has the lowest fees (0.25%) and great support.  Been buying from them since they started earlier this year without any  problem. You may also want to check the Bitcoin Brasil Facebook group.

"chief-carlatan" was uncalled for. Appreciated your comment, not this part... we know Maxwell has been called worse, but the technical critique is what matters here.
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:54:08
Brazilian here,  not afilliated with any of those services but have used some of them.  Definitely not a scam,  this is a real tragedy and everyone in Brazil is helping any way they can.  Some of those services already did similar causes,  they are trying hard to promote Bitcoin in Brazil. By the way,  quality of service has improved a lot this year,  with new (and more ethical) players than before. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:34:56
Thanks,  I was puzzled that at first Germany seemed pro-bitcoin regulation wise but there were no ATMs.
@_date: 2016-05-21 12:05:32
My bank in Brazil charges $1 for an online transaction,  much more (plus taxes) for an international transaction
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:51:20
Just checked,  he needs a Sperrkonto with about 8k to get his one year Visa. Checking Fidor it doesn't seem it supports this kind of account. So I gurds thr option would be to transfer euros from Kraken to Fidor then from Fidor to a more established,  traditional bank,  right? 
@_date: 2015-10-18 19:34:56
Security wise,  any issue?  Sometimes I get "Electrum servers can't be reached",  but to me its only a minor nuisance. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 01:27:36
Drivechain is a really exciting topic.  Paul is one of the best minds in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-06 03:28:57
You rule! Great comment. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:51:31
What, about the atomic cross chain post that was moderated out?  Seems like an interesting idea
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:19:15
Unfortunately, he needs euros in a bank account for the visa.  Otherwise,  it would be much simpler. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:33:39
Nice!  I took a look at Fidor,  seems they don't have much ATMs,  so I'll guess he will also need another account to withdraw cash if needed.

Tried installing both XT and Core on a Windows machine,  both stuck halfway downloading the blockchain...

Don't try to bring family and friends to bitcoin unless they are used to high-risk investing and tech-savvy, which they probably aren't. In case BTC tanks 50% overnight, or just goes ultravolatile, how will they react? It's better to just mention it's a promising technology they should be aware of. In 2014 some friends warned me about BTC and LTC, I passed it away because it was clearly overvalued and bubble-like. By the time they forgot about it (mid-2015), I began buying it ;). When I hear Bitcoin again from friends or relatives, I know it's time to sell lol.
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:34:54
LOL they have a Bitcoin guide: 
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:53:02
Thanks!!  Bitwa.la seems very interesting.

Any reason why GreenAddress isn't in this list?  So far it is the only wallet I have used and someone reliable has suggested me to use it,  but now I am wondering if I need to change it,  because  it doesn't seem very popular around here.  What am I missing? 
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:03:56
Would be important to have someone  maybe rusty,  talking about sidechains,  liquid, lightning,  etc.  Also,  any chance getting wink brothers as well? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 10:42:06
I have the same  issue with a relatively large withdrawal of BTC from an exchange.  It show as double spend despite 1000+ confirmations and isn't on my balance.  At first I thought ir would solve itself,  but so far it has been a week and it still show as double spend,  not sure if I can spend it because I am refraining from use GreenAdress because I am scared of losing important money to me.  Please update us as soon as possible.  I will also email the support with tx ids.

Welcome to Latin America.  High inflation and interest rates, taxes and capital controls,  currencies that lose 30% of their value in a year...  Unfortunately most people have zero financial education here and have no clue about how to even protect their wealth.
