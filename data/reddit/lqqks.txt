The comments under the video are interesting.  They claim that America does not have the required amount as stated.  I live in Australia and our country sold off some of  it's gold reserve back in the day thanks to our treasurer who had
Made an error with our superannuation monies by buying and selling currencies.  He had to make it back so he sold our gold.  Gold fell during the announcement then went straight back up higher than it was before the announcement. 
Just like oil has its own group so does gold.  They discuss it's future and risk assessments done when to sell, if to sell...it's in the groups interest to control the price.
With regards to the video it's sketchy at the least.  Good luck if it works wish them all the best as i to was a backyard chemist in the day.
Will this effect BTC, nope it will help.

We're all paying for and have paid for this thing called "insurance" it's never been free...
..as far as profits are concerned perhaps they need to change to a more profitable mechanism blockchain/Bitcoin.  Obviously if they don't change soon it leaves the door open for ideas like the OP has; which have lower running costs...and most probably no insurance involved.
 


So you think they offer insurance to its customers from profits made? Cause if you do you've got it wrong.  When you follow the insurance trail it 'ALWAYS' leads to the Elite most likely straight to the banking sector.
Regardless we've all fallen into this trap, insurance.  It's so imbedded into our society it's almost horrifying to think about it.  Look at what efficiency the blockchain and BTC has created and what other new ventures it will create...we have a tool now to rid us of this.
P2P is here to stay, let's embrace it and work towards improving it and using the tools given to us to change this embedded mentality.
As far as I'm concerned this is a new era and the likes of EBay and Amazon are of
"Old School" bring forth "New School"
Not sure if I answered any of your questions but this is what my mentality is at this point in time.

Yep it seems the geeky world is to fixated on perfecting it and have not thought about the consumer end...once the big boys finished playing with it it will evolve...over time we'll have no choice but to deal with btc as it is much more efficient and cheaper than "REAL" currency.  We are headed in this direction like It or not.

They will stop at nothing to see this collapse ..
You talk of money...means nothing if 'money' collapses, which it will sooner rather than later.
Since I have been involved in Bitcoin I have seen countless efforts by the media to bring it down or discourage people from using it; and still going.  We all know the power of media and the tools which they have.
At this stage many governments are shitting themselves as this revolution digs right in.  
Officially 'No Rules' play from now on.  
The only thing that I have a worry about is the Centralised Exchanges we are using.  We have seen MtGox scenario and this is not in any way helping our cause nor will of it happens again; it needs to be addressed fast so this shit doesn't hinder Bitcoin and it's fellow clones.
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:24:36
