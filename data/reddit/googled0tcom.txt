But your Reddit account is 4 years old, and that’s not good.  Don’t want you to become the target of those hackers.

Oh, it’s on the app. If you do it on the website. You need to go to transactions&gt; select CAD from left &gt; CSV Export &gt; save. Now select BTC&gt; CSV Export &gt; Save. Open up CAD transaction.csv and BTC transaction.csv. Check the value on each CSV, use cad value/BTC value

Educate yourself before writing an article.

A lot of people are getting hyped up on the Litecoin right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:49:31
Most of people buying bitcoin because they want to get rich quickly.

A stupid asshat with zero knowledge about bitcoin write a 12 grade level article about bitcoin and tell people stop buying bitcoin. Sounds about right.

And we have “fix grammar” section on our English exams. Although I am not good at it at all, but some “smart students” have almost perfect grammar. 
Edit: especially programmers, because they have to write comment lines in English.

How to find out the price after you bought? Go to quick trade &gt; history. The amount of money you paid on the left, the amount of BTC you bought on the right. They take 0.2% trading fee. Say you paid $1000. Now 1000*.02%=998.  998/the amount of BTC you bought=the price 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:48:36
The dip happened hour ago, won’t be that low again. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:25:00
Sell it and take the profit then go out treat yourself with a McDonald’s meal. Come back use your $50 to buy again, repeat. Unlimited meals.

Easy, do your own math. Before you execute your quote, they show you something like this underneath the button “1 CAD = 0.0000103048 BTC” pull your calculator out, 1/0.0000103048” that’s your price you are paying. Or, example, you are buying $1000 worth of BTC, they show you how many BTC you will receive, say 0.03, 1000/0.03=your buying price. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:30:23
Bro, enter 1.00 and 1.19. Lmao

You need to disable 2FA on coinbase and everywhere else you have 2FA enabled with Google Auth. After you have your new phone, download and install google Authenticator again, go back to coinbase enable 2FA with your new phone. This is the only way. 
And next time you probably can consider the app "Authy", unlike google Authenticator, it has backup feature, that allows you to backup all your 2FA to new devices, but you must remember the master password you have set in-app.

I have about $100k to invest now, and I am making $100k+/year from my programming job, do you think I should put all my $100k in? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:49:15
Well. Probably can't. But I have no debt, and even I lose $100k and my job, I still can live my current lifestyle for about 2 years. However I am planning to have kid within 2 years. I don't think I can be stupid enough to lose $100k on bitcoin. I don't know. Need advice. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:29:44
I got to know BTC many years back when it worth really like nothing, I have tried to buy some later when it was at slightly 1k+, but I was a student and broke af at the time, so had no chance to step in the "game". I am finding new ways to invest because I have saved some extra money after I landed my current job. I am in IT, so I do believe in a lot of things. I am trying to buy BTC now not because of seeing some people making millions from it. And I never believed "get rich over night" kind of thing, at least not me. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:35:04
What wallet are your using and where did you buy your BTC. From Canada too. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:36:45
Thanks. I am new to this, any help means a lot to me, really appreciated.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:35:24
Ha! Thanks. I also heard bad things about coinbase. I am considering bitcoincanada, they have office in Ottawa or something, and there's no fee. For wallet, I am looking for offline ones.
