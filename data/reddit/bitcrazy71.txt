When was Trump right on anything ? ��
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:23:38
Obama was garbage and Hillary much worse. Trump bombed the crap out of Syria for over a year before laying low. Bombing Syrian airfields twice based on fake poison gas attacks! 
Trump created the Iran crises to suck up to Israel and he has NO plan to defuse the tension. If he's not going to war with Iran, then why is he sending so much military assets there? I hope the war industry won't get us into another never ending war in the Middle East   ����
And who was going to war with N. Korea? Trump is the first president since the Korean War who threatened N. Korea and then backed off! If you think his 2 meetings with Fat Boy was a diplomatic success you are right, It was for Kim Jong  Un.

They absolutely suck, I went through hell with these morons. Utterly incompetent, unprofessional and completely clueless. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:40:57
I didn't know, I think they could still comeback at some point in time.

Firstly, I would never blame the victim in any situations like this. Crypto exchanges are out of control, I've had my share of grief with cex.io but monetarily, no where near as large as yours. Right now I have coins lucked up at Bittrx and waiting for them to let me withdraw. Exchanges must face accountability which is absent at this time. I hate regulations, but without them customers are unprotected and are at the mercy of so many sharks in the industry.

No, it didn't, always said recovery failed. Only one time, when I switched certain words, it gave me a new wallet without any transactions. I'm assuming it was a new wallet. I've checked my coins on blockchain, they're still there. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:16:13
Thank you very much. I'll do it on a Linux live. Is Tails the best choice to use for this?
@_date: 2017-02-13 10:30:07
It's recovered with lots of help from grnqrtr or gurnec. I had only one wrong word, but it didn't matter. Happy ending for sure. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:20:43
I had written one word wrong. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:39:27
I don't know gurnec.
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:06:22
No, only used Trezor's website. I'm not very computer savvy. What software can I use? I'd appreciate any suggestions and a brief, simple language how to use instruction. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:47:13
Oh yes, I follow the random order that Trezor tells me to put in the words. Like 15th. word 2nd. word and so on.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:25:39
Oh wow, thank you so much. Is it safe to do this online? or should I use a live version of Linux from a flash drive?
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:09:45
I just wrote down three instead of there!
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:18:47
3 months of anxiety? Yes it was pretty scary!
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:23:46
All of them!!
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:07:52
By checksum, do you mean passphrase? I only have 24 words, nothing else. Obviously there's a lot I don't know, I'd appreciate if you can give me some directions as to how is best to approach a solution. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:14:06
Ok, then does that mean I have the right words, but in wrong sequence?
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:12:15
My 6th word was written incorrectly, should've been there, I had three in that spot. All other words were correct and in right sequence. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:07:46
I guess it couldn't be for both of them, because the wrong word (three) didn't open the wallet. But, the correct word (there) did. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:37:51
Ok, thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-02-15 16:11:04
"THERE" was not a problem, it was the right word for my seed. I had "THREE" instead. They're both mnemonic words. Application warned me with the orange bubble, "invalid". 
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:50:24
This is how it went down, I wrote down THREE the correct word was THERE. One small and somewhat dyslectic mistake!��
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:55:58
I'm not technical at all!! I contacted Dave, but after a couple of emails, he stopped replying. He might be very busy. Thank you so much for your help. I've downloaded Ubuntu in a flash drive. will try it off line, see how it woks out.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:48:56
Okay, thank you so much. So no need to download it into a flash drive?
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:28:45
I put them in in the order hat I have them written down. I have changed the sequence several times, always get the same answer: Recovery failed.
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:01:38
It was a very close word and a BIP39 list word. All the same letters, only moved around slightly. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:59:58
Yes thanks, that is my concern as well. I'm going to learn how to do it off line.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:36:59
Thank you so much for your help. When I use the recovery process on Trezor site, it always ends up telling me recovery failed. Only once it created a new wallet with no transactions. Is it safe to use electrum.org online? Or should it be used off line? Thanks again for your help.
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:23:06
I couldn't afford a beer, instead I send him a thank you note, you can ask him!
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:04:43
I only wrote down 1 wrong word and my sequence of words were correct. It was the same "checksum". 
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:43:49
I've tried a few combinations of my seed in off line mode with bip39 script. It seems very promising, but I'm not 100% sure what is the correct way to use this tool. I disconnected my hard drive to prevent or reduce the chance of male ware. It shows many addresses, none are mine, so who's are they? Where do I type in my words? Thank you in advance. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:38:38
Thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:11:14
Thanks. ����
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:37:36
Thank you very much, I have already made another Trazor wallet and have some coins in it. I will transfer all my coins into my new wallet as soon as I recover it. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:19:55
Oh thanks a bunch. Really appreciate your help.
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:00:29
Thanks again. Will keep you posted.
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:58:21
Thanks for your reply. I'm sorry, what's a distro?
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:25:40
If anyone has not tried the recovery process on his/her Trezor, I suggest to move your coins somewhere else and try recovery. If works out well and opens your wallet, then you are ok. If it doesn't work out, generate another wallet and tested, before moving your coins back. Trezor is a great device, but human error must be taken into serious consideration. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:44:39
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:17:28
Me too and thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:03:30
I've heard if SEC doesn't rule by the end of today, (10th of March) it will be approved by default. Is that correct?
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:53:51
Thank a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:24:16
I got the email too, by then it could be worthless!!

All these futures on Bitcoin, Re they a good thing or a bad thing? Can CME or COBE manipulate Bitcoin price like that have with gold &amp; silver?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:27:43

Where did I say Bitcoin? He is a filthy Citigroup major investor, I hate banksters. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:04:55
I don't blame the victim, exchanges must be held accountable. Perhaps we need some enforceable regulations to keep the industry in check. I've had serious problems with CEX.IO and currently have some cryptos locked up at Bitrex too.  Shame on exchanges that are using excuses to try to steal our coins. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:24:04
What a difference a year makes! Wait another year, I'm sure those who HODL will be rewarded.

Correction, today is September 3rd. My apologies. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:55:43
Brilliant, I'll buy one more Bitcoin this week, probably tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:57:12
I agree 100%. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:11:28
I was told my post was flagged due to flooded price posts. 
 
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:17:30
Jim Rickard has researched this in much details. IMF website says the annual meeting is on 13 to 15 of October 2017, in Wash. D.C.  Take a listen, Jim is a gold bug, I don't agree with everything he says, but his facts are accurate.

Thanks, I have used them before and will in the future. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:59:31
I've always been against regulations for Bitcoin, but after this nightmare, I believe we need a mechanism to protect average Joe against incompetent operators. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:56:19
Perhaps lack of accountability and regulations are causing too much incompetence. cex.io doesn't care about it's reputation, because they don't have any! I tweeted the CEO, got a response from cex, but not him. The man has about 50 followers, perhaps half of them only speak Russian. How can they operate in England, is beyond my comprehension. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:58:18
I'm confused about segwit after watching this. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:48:49
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:12:18
Is this true? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:39:26
Because price differences are often significant. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:54:50
Ok it's on google. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:53:38
Can't find it on iPhone. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:38:39
To buy or sell. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:53:17
Been there, done that! 
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:48:30
But there must be a place or places where you can buy from one exchange and sell it at another.
