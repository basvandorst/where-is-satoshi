HODL, my friend. It's not just a meme, it's a lifestyle! I buy however my paychecks align. If I have a surplus of money in my bank account that I'm comfortable just letting go for a little while, i invest it! I've doubled my money in the last 3 months and I started out with $300. It's addicting. 
There's a principle in investing that you might take a liking to. It's called 'dollar cost averaging'. I suggest you google it! But it's basically where you tell yourself that you are going to invest X amount every so often. 
So let's say I plan on investing $100 each month. It's a small enough amount that it wouldn't hurt my wallet, but it's going to a place that might benefit me in the long run! That $1200 a year might turn into $50k in 10 years. Who knows! That's half the fun. 
Nobody ever said investing was easy on your emotions lol!

Listen. Do $100 / month. I was just telling my GF that there is more gain in investing than the loss of not investing. Take my word for it. I wish I would've invested sooner and I hope you never have that regret homie.

Whoa, I haven't heard of any of those. I've just looked at litecoin and erhereum because they're on coinbase as it is! I guess I'll go back to studying them soon! I feel like there will be 2 or 3 cryptocurrencies that will become dominant throughout the world. It's only a matter of time before they reveal themselves!

Glad to hear you're apart of the movement! 
I haven't invested in alt coins yet. I'm still learning about them. I want to just select one alt that I'm confident in. Do you have any insight?

What wallet are you using 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:52:07
I see, I see. Well only time will tell. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:38:27
Very well articulated. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:05:52
??? Can you elaborate on that final thought 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:50:05
Isn't that what economics essentially is? 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:27:02
A decade till all this is possible?

This guy bitcoins

I was speaking in terms of the attempt to "enforce Marxism".  Likewise, the attempt to enforce unregulated currency still has many surprises for mankind. I know there's those who are optimistic, but don't forget that there's two sides to every coin.. 
I, myself, am skeptical about Bitcoin. Not necessarily because I don't believe in the ideals that everyone here is preaching, but because I think there's more surprises to come. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:12:32
I think you're forgetting about those who are protected by the government or serve the government. If people really wanted to overthrow the government, they could. But utopian ideas have never worked as imagined. Just look at Marxism. The ideals and intentions are there, yes. But there is things fundamentally wrong with Marxism which causes it to fail. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:10:04
What makes you think that Bitcoin is the solution and not the other cryptos 
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:09:50
I invested in it because of the libertarian aspect of it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. You kinda reminded of that. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:49:33
I agree with you. I just wanted to see somebody respond and give an alternative standpoint, but I doubt that'll happen. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:18:44
I can see what you're saying, but I don't know how much I agree with you. Home prices are much more complicated than that. Mortgages also let people who can't afford a home in full to make monthly payments. 
Where are you from? What you're describing sounds like the US.

That's called GoFundMe 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:07:32
Damn, did it come with wrinkles or did you have to pay extra for those? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:59:11
what about dogecoin ¿
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:57:11
Should I do this from my laptop or would it be easy enough to do it from my iPhone ?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:46:23
I have about $850 in coinbase. How much would it cost me in fees to sell out? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:14:07
What the fuck is MtGox 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:55:08
Yes, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:10:29
Do you live in the USA? What do you use?
