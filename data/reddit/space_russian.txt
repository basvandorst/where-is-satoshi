Downfall of the human race? You're thinking of WorldStarHipHop Coin, or WSHH for short, not Liveleak Coin. Slogan:  No where but vertical.

You're right, anyone that holds companies to any standard or wants them to improve their or prioritize anything is just another unreasonable irate customer who should be ignored. How dare they not suck that coinbase dick instead of moving their business elsewhere to platforms without these problems and suggest others do the same. I throw my hands up there's really no dealing with these low lives who go out of their way to correct misinformation so people can make their own informed choices.

I came here for memes, not disappointed.

Less than a week ago they admitted they haven't been doing enough and have decided to spend the money on support staff instead and increase account security options, so I don't think anything. I know they aren't. Do you have contrary information?

Based on your current disposition, no. Invest in what you are familiar with comfortably. It seems neither apply.
I may well believe that if you put $200 into a bitcoin it would appreciate well over time, but that is immaterial, ultimately. There would be no reason for you to invest $200 now, then for the value to depreciate to the point of making you more nervous than you are now, pulling out will less money, and then kicking yourself once values appreciated again. It seems like it would cause a lot of stress for you and your girlfriend over a decision she wanted you to make that you weren't ready for, and most relationships break over finances.
That does not benefit you in the slightest but seems like an extremely likely scenario to me. You sound like someone with a cautious attitude entering an investing world of volatility and risks you aren't aware of. So no. Don't. There are plenty of other ways to invest $200. Do what's right by you. 
How's about this alternative:  Marry this girl and trust her on finances for something she's into already anyways, and get some nice BTC returns anyways. She's got a good head on her shoulders.

That's fine. But you're talking shit by assuming without cause they're spending on servers and everything will be hunky dory if we just trust. them.

What does that have to do with you being wrong about server investment? Explaining to me why you trust your gut instead of doing simple research so you misinform people?
