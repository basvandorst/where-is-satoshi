Not quite what I meant as I assume anyone with lower wealth will continue to spend and be given wealth. But that as a system, individual wealthy actors will be incentivized to sit on wealth until a market gets close to stagnation before investing again. It seems like it would be worthwhile to design a system that would oscillate at a tighter amplitude between stagnation and high rates of investment.

Increase in relative buying power is guaranteed (sorry not growth) if there is a predictable rate of bitcoin shrinkage. It seems to me that in any sort of adoption process, the held amount of active wealth will stagnate the exchange of wealth before total adoption can happen. If total adoption is reached there will be an oscillation between total market stagnation and investment entirely dictated by the largest share holders. Investment becomes more feasible as rate of shrinkage decreases in relation to how much of not lost coins are being circulated. And that might be too far. Perhaps there should be mechanism to encourage circulation earlier than that point.

Does that mean that central banks in the future would have to hold access to the majority of active coins to keep the economies where they want them?

The hypothesis isn't reliant on it being finite resource. Moving the decimal point over for the majority as circulation diminishes means anyone who can hold on gains over time. ~~Growth is guaranteed for sitting on your wealth.~~ Increase in relative buying power is guaranteed for sitting on your wealth.

It was an intellectual question – I was just curious. Not something I was necessarily advocating for. Your first part is enough an answer though so thank you.
