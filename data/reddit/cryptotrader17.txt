I'm not saying the correction will be inflammatory. I'm just saying in the long run if Bitcoin survives there will never be an inflation of the Bitcoin currency. And what we are seeing now is the first stage of it.

Excellent point I never thought about that. But at some point all fiat will fail and the limited amount of bitcoin will be the value of Bitcoin. if that makes any sence

They are issuing new coins every block but you're forgetting that there's a limited amount of BTc and the difficulty keeps increasing as block are discovered.

Great post!!
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:51:58
Yes! But stop telling people the secret of when to buy!

Maybe have a tread dedicated to tipping people bitcoin that live in Venezuela to spread adoption and help them buy food since the minimum wage is 5 dollars a month and because the  whole world has their eye on their situation this might  ecmake a huge impact on other  countries with bad economies.
