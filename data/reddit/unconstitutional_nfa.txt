This is a bombshell interview.  Thanks for sharing OP.

In a clip from Bix Weir's latest interview he says that he suspects that Alan Greenspan is Satoshi Nakamoto. 
The theory: 
I know what you all think about this too:

Saved.  Here is something else to take a look at if you like Fed related cartoons:

Germany literally set the standard for how warfare was conducted because of the blitzkrieg.  The technology they created was also cutting edge.  You can't blame Germany for losing a war against half of the world dog piling on them at once.  We would all be living in a Rothschild banking free world if they had won WW2 and I will never forget their sacrifice.

Here is some more food for thought.  Bix Weir suspects that Alan Greenspan is Satoshi Nakamoto.

It was Alan Greenspan
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:17:10
Why would they be upset?
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:52:48
Its was before they slammed it back down.

I would imagine that even if the customer never handled bitcoin themselves they would still benefit a lot and the company would have a ton of new marketing angles.  Maybe we'll see some sort of pilot program in the relatively near future.

Because 1 Bitcoin has been the unit which everyone has been using to explain it, advertise it, and measure it against other things with.

The most interesting part about it predicts the Chinese government will make Bitcoin a mainstream investment for the public and even use it as a portion of their national reserves.  Also, the world's largest wealth transfer in history is supposed to happen from the current system to Bitcoin, gold, and silver holders. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:54:28
Yes.  I've heard Trezor mentioned before.  Is it more popular?
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:11:41
I'm excited to see how much of these predictions come true since most of them are supposed to happen this year.  If they do I imagine even some of the most hardcore Bitcoiners are going to be pleasantly shocked at how far things have progressed.
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:58:13
Right on schedule

Thanks.  I like this one.

I've heard some good arguments recently about how anyone who made their fortune off of this corrupt central banking system should be stripped of those ill gotten gains because of two major reasons besides morality.  The first reason being that it is unconstitutional money to begin with and the second being that central banking is literally a pillar of the communist manifesto.  The argument went on to say that the inflated stock market is an indirect bribe to keep middle class people in line.  It sounded like a communist purge to me at first but its really just enforcing the real law of the land.

The precious metals markets are rigged like crazy.  Its a great buying opportunity tbh.  Deutsche Bank just settled a lawsuit recently where part of it was they had to turn over evidence of market manipulation which included emails of the banksters laughing while they shorted the markets.

Its not outside of the realm of reality considering how far outside we already are because of the artificial world the bankers have created.

I've been listening to this for the last year and I'm really happy for the first time in a long time to notice that the vibe from the public is that things really can change.

They did it a year ago when some guy fat fingered a bitcoin purchase for $2200 each or something like that.

Its funny reading that after listening to this guy a lot recently:

Here is one where he talks about how his theory relates to current events:

Sounds like Patrick Byrne will get his wish if this is on a real blockchain but I wouldn't be too confident in an organization that lost tens of trillions during Hurricane Sandy and helps facilitate everything that's wrong with the system.

I've been seeing the CME group in crypto related headlines lately. Could their interest in this space be a potential factor here?
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:43:12
Alan Greenspan is actually Satoshi

I'd like to join in on the jeering but I remind myself that I bought Quark back in 2013.

If they take off segwit will bitcoin die?
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:20:46
I want to hear him talk more about how Alan Greenspan is Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:22:44
It seems like its finally happening.  I wish Bix would make a video specifically about his Alan Greenspan bitcoin theory and all of the plans major countries have including the one million in Satoshi's wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:09:50


Is it really though?  Do we have to keep doubling down on monopolistic control on centralized infrastructure as technology makes it easier to do the opposite?
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:06:34
I was never the same after I heard that the taxes under King George that they rebelled against were far far less than what people pay now.  I'm sure the founding fathers wouldn't have bothered if they knew too.
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:54:34
I can see those guys coming around for sure but the final boss of the bitcoin haters is Chris Dwayne:
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:17:24
The founding fathers never intended a nation where citizens would be anything but white.  I love how conservatives and libertarians cherry pick when it comes to the founding fathers.  I liked Ron and Rand when they were talking about how the Civil Rights Act was unconstitutional.
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:13:32
Since we're on the subject of anti Bitcoin butthurt, Chris Dwayne told crypto users to unsubscribe to his channel, lol
