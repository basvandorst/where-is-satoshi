@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:13
Coinbase is down!!! Nooooooo
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:41
Why is it offline? What else can I use besides Coinbase to buy bitcoin with? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:46:43

Fuck the Gov. anything that destroys the government I’m happy with. Bunch of crooks
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:12:41
Damn fat fingers 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:35:34
Jp Spears explains bitcoin quite well. Check him on Facebook. It’s a parody but at the same time brings up the faults in bitcoin. Including comparing buyers of bitcoins to vegans and it’s fucking hilarious.

I wish I got in 2 years ago. I want to invest but I can't even google anything about bitcoin without feeling overwhelmed. Even the damn wallets are iffy on which one you choose. I'm a rookie that's bitter for not getting in sooner. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:21:53
What are you at now? I'm ready to jump off a bridge. I had over $100,000 and didn't buy in at around $400 ish. I just didn't understand it fully. I still don't but would do anything to get on board
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:37:36
Complicated wallets make bitcoin scary to me
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:13:34
It just doesn’t seem as good of a deal
As it once was. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:35:36
I have no idea what the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash is but I know it’s bad...
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:33:01
I hate banks and the government. All corrupt. Lobbyists and politicians should all be done away with. Launch the banks and bring on crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:59:19
By low sell high! Crash to a 1,000 or less please.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:37:02
@ 10,000 per coin it doesn’t even seem like a good investment anymore. Below a 1,000 and I’m game. Hello litecoin or ethrum 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:11:37
Any advice would be greatly appreciated 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:28:09
I've heard a few and honestly I don't know the difference. I just want a decent UI and good security
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:47:27
Not my style but thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:45:18
Well Patrick Swayze I'm fucking buying soon and buying a lot I shall!
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:15:30
My house is selling. I don't get paid until 31st of this month. Trust me everyday I'm not onboard is like pulling teeth.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:44:34
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:14:42
I'm going to invest my life savings of 100,000 on the 31st of this month. I'm excited to not work anymore
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:22:48
Keep dropping bitcoin. Then I will buy all the coins!!! Hahaha well a few
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:45:28
It's going way back up now
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:46:50
English god damnit
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:52:47
I can't handle living middle class anymore. I'm shooting for retired millionaire at 32 years old. If I end up homeless I can say at least I tried. Then start all over. I'm ready
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:19:53
I'm bitter for not getting in 2 years ago!
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:40:43
Thanks, thats nice to hear.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:27:27
I'm dropping some serious money when it gets that low
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:40:04
I'm so lost!
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:11:01
Banks will fail eventually
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:06:25
I completely disagree. Gotta live a little or you'll end up stuck forever! Fuck up, start over and learn from mistakes!
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:11:16
I've got a friend who knows about bitcoin more than I do. I tried reading up on wallets and it's confusing as hell to me. He told me to get in when it was under a $1,000 and everyday I sit at work I get more and more pissed I didn't get on back then. Now it's all or nothing
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:36:08
I’m waiting for a dip... I wish I got in when it went below 4500 last wk! Now I wait for another dip big or small. I’m ready to tell US Bank to pound sand and never use a traditional bank again. Fucking crooks
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:36:27
How much is the fee? I plan on spending around a $100,000. Was going to use Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:04:57
Gotta love Warren but he's old school
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:20:46
Who is he? Sorry I just subscribed and don’t know much around these parts
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:26:08
It's tanking and when it finishes I'll be there to buy it all up!
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:46:12
Lmao I can't wait for that shit to go low and then set on fire!
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:26:19
I get $71,000 cash today from selling my home. I’m a little late and I’m kinda pissed. I was going to invest it all
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:41:47
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:14:57
Not religious but thanks!
