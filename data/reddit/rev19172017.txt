Yeah but he worked hard to be born into that family! Pull yourself up by the bootstraps! Bitstraps?

Yeah I dropped $100 in it. It's already worth a few cents more after about 5 minutes! It's a small enough amount that if this bubble pops then oh well but if it goes up I'll not be mad at a few extra bucks. First time buying BTC to trad

It's gone up 3200 in the last year. 1500 in the last month.

Dudes made a million on crypto. I think he knows how to invest his money.

Explosive growth and collapse is not a sign that things are working. It's a sign that the currency is unstable. It being new doesn't change that fact.

All those technologies were created by the government.

You mean the Bitcoin that has had wild growth and collapse? The Bitcoin that dropped over $1000 in the last month. The Bitcoin that still isn't accepted most places? Yeah what a resounding support of Austrian Economics
So what is your answer to Hayek supporting dictators and tyranny? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:01:49
The very guy you base your ideas off of didn't even believe in them. He believed in tyranny. And you have become delusional enough to think that Anarcho-Capitalism, which is not even a form of Anarchism, is anything other than a tool to subjugate you and everyone to new neo feudal lords. Your delusions are outstanding. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:10:23
No Anarchism is no Hierarchies, just more examples of you guys stealing our terms and pretending to be like us. And Capitalism is a hierarchy. 
Also, don't try and act like Hayek is a nobody. He is the most influential person in the Austrian School. And a Minarchist? Hardly. Again he supported dictators and believed in tyranny.

Technical progress is almost always the result of government investment. Free market didn't make the internet. Didn't make the microchip. Didn't make the computer, the gps, touch screens, none of it. So please tell me more about how technical progress is wholly the result of free market activity. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:04:37
Sure if we accept your made up bullshit definition that works. Except the internet was a government funded project (arpanet). The microchip was a government funded project. The GPS is a military project. The touchscreen was a government funded project. As was the cell phone. 
Listen I get it. I remember when I was 16 and first discovered right wing libertarian ideals. Eventually you will look around and realize that the free market is a lie. Free market capitalism will never happen, because the capitalism we have today is the natural progression of capitalism. It isn't free. It's a replacement of feudalism with its own new hierarchy where the rich completely own the poor. Austrian economics is a lie. It does not work. The founders of your ideology worked for brutal oppressive tyrants in South America. 


Yup Hayek was a supporter of a brutal dictator and reasoned it was necessary to maintain dictorial powers. That's the roots of right wing libertarians right there. They don't seek freedom, they seek power through the markets over other people. One day you will grow up and realize that the imposters you think of as libertarians are nothing of the sort. The real libertarians, the people you guys stole the word from, are leftists. We reject both the state and the Free market and instead know that the best force for freedom involves no hierarchy, but in cooperation of people working together.
