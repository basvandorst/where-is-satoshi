I understand where that view is coming from, but have always found it more than clearly absurd.  Visa and Mastercard stand as two separate entities offering the same service, not idea, more akin to say MtGox and CoinBase than Bitcoin and altcoins.  Bitcoin and -- let's just pick one here -- litecoin are two unique implementations of the same notion.  The way forward is not to sit and play with different implementations, but to come to a common one, and that can't be a yet-to-be-found evolution.  Any time a new "coin" hits the market, it taints the unfamiliar or unconvinced public's perspective.
If there are faults in bitcoin that can be quantified, these should be hammered out within the protocol serving that block-chain, not have upstarts with a "we're better" mentality trying to claim "market-share" as it only dilutes the very purpose of bitcoin.  Development efforts should be taken to confront these issues within a uniform standard.
Security-wise:  Bitcoins key system is changeable while maintaining block history. Casualties possible, but only those who left there coin to rot.
New miner productivity-wise: The only flaw here is pools limiting thresholds, and an improper assessment of how fees should work at this stage in the chain lifecycle. Introduce more equitable pools or fix the perceived transaction fee, and incentive to diversify or mine on and altcoin and trade is removed.
Eco-effectivity-wise: See new miner, and if you're expending less energy while still maintaining decent hashrates, you're clearly a step up to begin with as you aren't investing as much to mine.
Swing-saves:  biggest advantage to altcoins as I see it is they remain immune non-fiat means of mitigating the effects of swing based on public perception of the markets.  I abhor this practice, and adding more of these is again like to improve this problem, especially as you're preying on those trying to get into the same market in which you're trying to better your position, and likely steering them from entering at all as a result or racing those doing the same as you.
In short, fuck altcoins.  Again, I'm more than interested in seeing a valid take here denouncing my stand here, but yours is the only argument I've ever really seen and it's never backed and lacks per above.

I really only turn mine on when it gets cold and use mining to serve as a space heater.  Not sure whether I value a few mBTC or warm toes more right now.

About what I pooled over 6 months from late last year on an old gfx card I still pushed to pool occasionally.

I was never a real fan of the mBTC phase for just this reason.

This is said jokingly, but there is a 200+% fee tagged with fountain dust from ~2 years ago if not coupled with real transactions.

WA HOO HOOO HOOOOEY!

But alt-coins only appeal to a) those doing this. b)  those running pools or multi-mining workflows c) those betting on bitcoin failing and the particular alt-coin being the defacto replacement. (If anyone feels differently, please enlighten me.)
As such, the more members of group a, the valuation plummets even with a steady common share value of BTC.

This brings some interesting memories.  2 years ago I had seen the potential of bitcoin and had intent to build a similar service.  Built an FPGA platform around some cheap parts from reject boards I mustered from a couple companies I had ins with.  Initial intent to proto up an ATM type machine that sat and mined, providing customer interaction as a secondary, then effectively making well over 100/day.  Then I got hired with immediate debt repayment potential rather than pursuing the future and walked away from this endeavor as I saw others ppick up similar tact and pursue through ASIC design.

I love false recollections on that timeline...these were offered before the initial reduction, sure, but it was made quite clear they lacked sufficient production to get anything in hand soon.  Coupled with that the fact that this was following the biggest surge (in terms of presence, not percentage) at the time, one could have no hopes.  Sure a company might have invested in readier manufacturing streams, but given the risks at the times and lack of true investment from would-be endusers, it wasn't viable.

Again, that's common today, but should not be the norm as adoption grows.

Having bought bitcoin everywhere from $2 to $800, and been using it for years, I would say its far from 'silly' but it comes down to your personal intent and risk-assessment.  My satoshi of wisdom would follow the standard don't gamble with what you can't afford, and don't buy that which you don't envision using.

Most exchanges at present act as escrow services.  They take whatever funds you send them, whether fiat or bitcoin and create an account for you with that level of funding (less fees if applicable, read ToS).  From there, you engage in market trades, either with other users of the service or with the entities current valuation of bitcoin.  At which point, generally, these are applied to your internal BTC account with the service provider (just a number in the database, these aren't truly accessible to you).  To actually take the coins out, you can initiate a transfer from the service to a bitcoin address you generate and hold the key for to actually bring them into an account you exclusively had access to.
This is simplified and reflects many though certainly not all of the larger service providers right now.  It's worth determining how you would be most comfortable exchanging and search around for a means of meeting that than asking how.  Everything is going to be listed as having a caveat, as there is never a truly riskless transaction in any medium, e.g.  you attempt to trade a potato for a turnip and get clubbed and lose your potato and your shoes.
