I'm in europe, what exchange can I use to buy BTC where I wire the exchange €x and I can buy and sell on it? 
Like what MTgox have (I think), a system where they hold your money and your btc until you withdraw them.

It'll be near impossible to ban BTC though. It's just a new way of storing wealth, if they ban BTC then *should* by logic ban gold or the stock markets. They could take it over by 51% but any sign they're doing this then the huge spike in interest would help to nullify their attempts.

Bitcoin was in the news again, 6 months after the April bubble/crash, so people saw it was still around.
The notion bitcoin is only good for drugs was destroyed.
And while being linked with drugs is bad, any publicity is good publicity!

I kept meaning to buy a prepaid credit card a few months after the $30 high and subsequent crash to buy a few bitcoins but I never got around to it. The price would have been about $10. But I do have 1.05 BTC from mining so it could be way worse (from around the time of the $30 high to October 2011) :)

Saw this when it was on. Nice to see BTC is getting some positive media coverage

Have we been bestof'd?

Nice timing! Here's hoping you'll get way more than $1000 a bitcoin in the future!
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:29:19
I intend on keeping it. It cost me nothing so if BTC somehow crashes then hey, I've lost a little bit of my time. If it succeeds, then I get a nice lump sum! :)
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:25:11
Aw cheers buddy, I'll make sure to pay it forward!
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:21:07
[Yeah we have!](
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:20:40
It's pretty cool that you're at least tipping people, however measly the value of it is! 
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:53:36
Congrats, I have 1.11BTC that I didn't spend a cent on (other than electricity) through mining, not worth enough to cash out now but worth enough to hold onto in the future, but if I was to cash it out right now and spend It on one thng It'd be a college education, fortunately where I'm from they're relatively cheap.
Best of luck in your chosen degree and career path :)

I made about 1.05 BTC from mining back in 2011, and I still think that's a fairly sizeable amount. If I had 50BTC I'd be absolutely ecstatic right now
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:53:38
What cost 10000 BTC 3.5 years ago now costs a fraction of a BTC. I'm not an economist, but I'm fairly sure that is a fairly solid explanation of deflation, goods and services falling in price.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:23:25
The noise when a block is mined is actually glorious!

It's still deflation. 1 BTC buys more now than it did last week, that's deflation. If 1 BTC could buy less now than last week, that's inflation.
The prices of goods and services haven't decreased compared to fiat, but they most certainly have compared to BTC. So bitcoin is deflating
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:20:33
Hey I'll do it for half of half of that!
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:13:41
I was considering buying some when they were $4 in oct 2011. WHY
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:09:59
Keep working on it! Get the transaction sizes matches to the pitch of notes and it'll be perfect!
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:54:02
Because one dollar will only drop in value due to inflation but your 1 bitcent will rise in value. You're helping them get wealth and spreading interest in a cryptocurrency that you think is a viable day-to-day currency.

It's like an upvote only more significant and tangible! Upvotes can't be converted to cash but BTC can!
