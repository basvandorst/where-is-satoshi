If Bitcoin is money, it can't make you money while you sleep.
This entire post is nonsense unless you see bitcoin as an speculative investment rather than as "money". Ideally in the future bitcoin's price will stabilize and lose most of its volatility, that's when it can become a real currency.

I've personally generated over a million dollars of volume in a single day. Let me tell you a secret: I'm not a millionaire.
If you had $10k of coins and day traded trying to make a $10 profit at time (0.1%) and traded 100x in a day you generated a million dollars in volume, and probably have around the same amount of money you started with.
Volume isn't important, what's important is inflows vs outflows.

In your emphasis you quoted: 


Neither the article you quoted, nor the page linked in this post defines "funding model", could you show me where the SEC or CFTC has defined the term "Funding Model" as it pertains to crypto currencies? I'm taking as meaning "ICO" where tokens are being issued with an implied funding of a specific project or company, not bitcoin itself which is not sold through any sort of funding model.

Yes to the first case, no to the second. A middleman node only needs enough btc to handle the largest of transactions that go through it. But it doesn't lost any btc in the process. So with 1 btc you can handle 100 1btc transactions. You can't however manage a single 100btc transaction

You're not thinking about real world use. Why would I ever want more than maybe 2-3 channels. If I have to pay a fee to open a channel I would want to send as much BTC as I feel comfortable as once in order to reduce me fees.
It doesn't make sense for me to add in BTC to my channel partners as I use up money, I would want to deposit say all the BTC I plan on using for the week/month/whatever. However "who" do I open this channel to? Obviously not to Sally, Bob, or the sandwich shop, I need an entity willing to keep my money safe and is otherwise meant to be a "clearinghouse" for me. 
This Sandwich shop likewise doesn't want to open many channels and pay lots of fees, it would prefer to have its own clearinghouse single destination channel for all its income, so it can just close out once per month.
Now these clearinghouse channels would have to connect to each other, but since it's not "free" they would themselves want the biggest pipes they could, so the bigger the clearing house the more direct routes are possible that go through less entities. 
You will more than likely end up with a hub and spoke model eventually over time.

This is the ideal and would love for it to work that way. But my point has to do with there being 7 billion people on the planet and the Bitcoin network taking 15.5 million transaction/month (given 6 transactions per second) maximum given current block sizes. Which means if only about 2% of the world tried to open a lightning channel once per week the entire system would be overloaded with channels taking hours or days to open and be expensive. Also these numbers leave no room for transactions outside simply opening lightning channels. The whitepaper on the lightning network acknowledges this problem.
With the current blocksize you can't have even 1% of the world use bitcoin+lightning network on a daily basis. The only way the system wouldn't collapse would be for a 3rd party to aggregate transactions for people so it's only one big "bank hub" on the lightning network promising to keep your funds safe and accepting/transferring on your behalf with you never having any private keys to the bitcoin wallet in order to relieve pressure on the main chain.
Just incase you're interested here's the math behind some of the numbers above.








Edit: didn't see your edit about the devs that frequent this sub, I'd love to get more info on how some of these issues are planned on being resolved if you can point me to resources as I'm not really as steeped in the community as you are.

Fees are set by users (and also by wallet defaults to set number of btc, not dollar price), when most users have accounts worth under $10k they're not going to bother with higher fees and might be patient for a transfer. When all of a sudden you have tons of people with hundreds of thousands of dollars they didn't work hard for, fees seem inconsequential so they'll pay more to get transactions done faster. Fees are a bidding war that gets out of control fast.

I am a software engineer and have read the whitepapers but am not knee deep in the development (aka reading github repos). Our goals seem aligned, I want a decentralized network that can handle peer to peer payments on a global scale and is easy to use for non technical people. I don't want to lock out any possibility as to how this is achieved, and I don't care which cryptocurrency achieves this goal, though Bitcoin has the best shot right now due to its recognizability by the public and value.
I haven't done the math myself but it does seem having every transaction on chain could easily lead to problem at mass scale. But it also seems clear to me that the current block size is nowhere near big enough to support the lightning network, if there are yet other layers and solutions I'd love to be pointed out to them.
From what I understand bigger blocks are needed or else you will have centralization within the lightning network. If you really want me to fully explain why I *think* with examples this will happen I'll be glad to (I tend to ramble on, don't want this post to get too long).


I'm not saying this is wrong, but this does not describe the lightning network or any other layer I've heard about. Is there a specific layer/protocol you mean? Because I would be interested in reading more. (Lightning Network does not use "blocks").


Is this true? Have they stated bigger blocks won't be implemented? Because if so I can show that the lightning network without bigger blocks will quickly devolve to a centralized system at mass global scale where the vast majority users will never touch their own bitcoin (kinda like having it on coinbase and never withdrawing to your own wallet).

My point was to get people to think about what wealth even is. Wealth is work, money is a debt of work.
If I have a $1 bill, the world owes me $1 worth of work. This work comes from "somewhere" someone actually doing an action to produce something I want to buy for $1.
Since Bitcoin produces no work, Bitcoin is simply a transfer of wealth. The question is from where? If bitcoin doesn't become a directly usable currency in a real sense (aka: not some random bar/restaurant/website) for millions and millions of people, then the wealth "generated" by bitcoin is simply a transfer of wealth from late adopters/exiters to early adopters/exiters. If Bitcoin does become a real currency, it becomes a transfer of wealth from fiat currency holders to Bitcoin holders.
To use an extreme example in order to paint a black/white picture, lets say bitcoin shot up today to $1 billion/coin. What this would mean is most of us would be multi-billionaires (or at least millionaires). Could we all suddenly get lambos? The answer would be no because there are not enough lambos for everyone to buy one, all of us fighting for fancy cars, houses, boats would drive the "price" of those houses up in dollars to match our new bitcoin wealth. It would massively devalue the dollar as at the end of the day there are no new factories, no new workers, no new materials to support our fantastic "wealth" as marked in dollars.

I fully agree, it's a short term solution, but it's a quick one that can solve today's problems today giving us time to solve tomorrow's problems.


I've only heard this from the guy I was replying and I agree it wasn't the idea. But currently with segwit and current block size, assuming a person opens/closes a lightning channel 12 times a year, you can have a maximum of 12 million people using the system (and this is assuming they stagger their actions and don't concentrate on say the 1st, 15th, or 30th of the month).
If you had 144million people you could only settle a transaction once per year. If you had 1.4 billion people once per decade, and 7 billion and you're talking once every 50 years. Obviously increasing the block size would decrease these numbers, but even with 1gb blocks you're talking about reducing the capacity by 1000 times, so doing some math for 7 billion people that's still one channel being opened and closed once every 18 days per person. 
Considering current world poverty rates, children, and etc.. that's likely "good enough" for today, but there are still risks as populations increase as well as people lift themselves out of poverty (assuming a global payment system virtually everyone uses).
All of the above math breaks down if people now also have segwit wallets as "savings account" because now they'll need more transactions than the open/closing of a channel.

You also forgot the 1800btc/day generated by miners, requiring $10 billion in new investment per year to logically sustain a price of 15k.
After 2020 it drops to $5billion/year but that's still a ton of "new money" that has to come in. If bitcoin reaches $100k/coin now we're talking $65billion/year ($32b after 2020). This only works if a majority of newly minted bitcoins are held and never used.

Also even in regular markets it's not uncommon to want to be "anonymous" and buy from different sources so the fact 1 person owns a lot is not revealed. 
Like in manhattan a skyscraper developer will slyly buy all the land they need using shell companies so no one realizes someone is about to plunk a billion dollars building a huge building (and therefore know they're willing to pay a ton to buy them out).

I already use digital currency for 99% of my transactions. I very very rarely touch real money. It's called a credit card. If you mean a VISA linked to a bitcoin wallet then no, it's not currently possible to live on bitcoin, you're relying on VISA more than you are on bitcoin.
That said, I fully believe in digital currencies and want to see it be much more used in the future, the problem is you're conflating the value of a bitcoin with the value of the network. The more people use bitcoin the more valuable the *bitcoin network* is. If starting today everyone used bitcoin freely (instead of holding) we'd have a much much higher value out of the bitcoin network, but the price of a single bitcoin would likely go way down.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:35:25


Yes it's more secure in one sense. But to the average consumer it's much, less secure than a "fiat card" for one reason: Transactions are final, you bear responsibility for your money.
If I lose my credit card my bank sends me a new one, if I fuck up and get scammed I can chargeback. Both aren't possible with direct bitcoin payments. (Good luck getting the average joe to have a backup).

I haven't listened to much of Andreas's talks but I doubt he's out there even mentioning Roger's name because unlike people on this sub he seems to be an adult. (And if his speeches all include a blurb about hating another person then he's just as childish).
It's really annoying that there have been tons and tons of posts on this subreddit about some guy. If he's really as dumb as everyone says why's everyone paying attention, it just gives him credibility as a threat. It's like Donald Trump, everyone laughed and laughed at him and he became president and people still laugh at him. Meanwhile other crazy dudes get ignored and never build traction because the media doesn't focus on them.
The posts on this subreddit are literally making people learn more about bch, I didn't give a shit about bch until I kept seeing references to it here like it's some big threat, and guess what all I learned is that bch can today handle 8x the transactions bitcoin can.

@_date: 2017-12-16 01:17:41
Yes, but the fact remains given the current block size you can only open or close 15.5million channels/month which is not enough to support a global currency without massive centralization where most users never actually touch their own bitcoin. (And opening a channel will remain expensive)
Increasing the block size still needs to be done.

It's funny you mention small distinctions mattering to people who write these releases and then you call bitcoin a commodity, meanwhile the release you're referring to is talking about about securities, not commodities.
In addition to this I searched the release for the word commodity to make sure I wasn't missing anything and saw this under a footnote that I hadn't read until now:


The CFTC is a separate organization from the SEC meaning that the SEC has no purview over bitcoin itself, so the SEC release even more clearly is stated as having no bearing on bitcoin itself, and is referring to securities derived from cryptocurrencies, not cryptocurrencies themselves.

I think currency is a bit of a misnomer from me, what I want is simply a peer to peer decentralized almost-universally accepted payment system.

I agree it's common sense that it's misleading to sell it as "bitcoin" and it should always be referred to as bitcoin cash, bch, bcash, whatever. I'm not trying to argue that. It's clearly a fork and clearing not the main line, anything else is misleading or an outright lie.
That said: *legally* speaking the problem with selling you a "golden brick" is that it's scamming someone by making them buy something much less valuable than they thought. If I sold you bcash for $17,000 each then yes that's fraud and illegal. If I sold you it for $1,700 then it is not fraud in the legal sense, even if I called it Bitcoin.

I recommend everyone reads the whole thing even if you don't understand the tech parts. We don't all have to agree on what each line says/implicates/means, but we should at least read it before being able to debate the merits of the LN.

This is only true if every node in between has enough money. That's one thing I don't see mentioned enough. If I wanted to buy something that's $5k chances are the LN wouldn't work unless there were centralized super nodes connected to everything that could facilitate transactions. In which case the network would be a hub and spoke model rather than a decentralized network.

So bch supporters are either people who think they're on a grand crusade or shills.
What about people who just think we bigger blocks are a solution that can be implemented faster than the LN and would want Bitcoin itself to increase the blocksize? At mass scale even with the LN you'll still need bigger blocks sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:56:04
Can you explain to me how increasing the block size won't do anything to help with adoption? Lightning Network isn't ready yet, and it will take time to reach mass adoption, in the meantime there is an over 100k transaction queue and fees are extremely high.
It's causing people to actually abandon bitcoin as we speak as a payment platform. There's a real danger that if bitcoin remains unusable as a currency for too long before lightning network is large enough to be viable that the project could collapse. If you increase block size as an interim solution you clear the transaction backlog and allow bitcoin to be used as a currency while the rest of the infrastructure is put into place.
Not sure how this is "toxic bullshit"? a 6 transaction/second limit for on chain transactions simply isn't scalable on a worldwide currency level unless we abandon the concepts of being your own bank and let large LN nodes control our money.

You're correct but at this point it takes a lot more than $10k to move the needle significantly. But right now if you tried to cash out 100,000btc (aka 1% of bitcoin outstanding if you assume 6million of them are lost forever) as a market order across every exchange, you'd completely crash the price by at least 80% (likely even more).

I mean the lightning network's white paper itself suggests that bigger blocks will be needed. Segwit/Schnorr won't increase efficiency by enough to make the current blocksize anywhere near viable for a global currency. I haven't heard of MimbleWimble yet but I'll look it up.


The guy you were replying to clearly underestimated, but saying that it's going to take a lot of effort is a reason not to do it is self defeating. Truth is sooner or later it will be needed, we've known about this for years, it's something that could have been started long ago. It's kind of like the saying "best time to plant a tree".
I think the only reason anyone mentions that bigger blocks would kill bcash is because often when proposing bigger blocks you get downvoted or called a bcash shill or something. It's an attempt to show "If I were a shill why would I recommend something that would kill the project". I agree that killing off another coin should never be the goal (this goes to bch supporters too).

How do you imagine the lightning network working? Do I open my own channel to a central bank node? Do I just register with a bank node and never actually touch the network myself? Do I manage my own channels? How long do I keep my channel open? Am I opening/closing channels to individual stores, users, and etc?
Essentially my question is how frequently am I, one person expected to open/close a channel?
Because right now with a 1mb block if 7 billion people wanted to open a LN channel, never close it, and never do a single on chain transaction after opening a channel it'd take over 38 years to clear the queue. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:43:42
To reduce fees I would want to open as little channels as possible. Wouldn't it make sense for me to deposit say a month's worth of expenses to lower the number of on chain transactions?
Now let's say I don't have a server, and I don't want to keep so much money on say my phone, and don't want to bother with running a node at all. What options do I have? It seems to me it'd be most convenient to actually send my bitcoin to these supernodes and have them pay others on my behalf. If this is the case then they would actually control my funds.
Let's say my job pays me in bitcoin, do I have to make sure my server/phone is on for me to get my paycheck? This seems rather limited and annoying, I'd much rather have the super node I trust to always be on be able to be a deposit address for me.

If you even dare talk about the 6 transaction/second limit you get ridiculed with something about how very soon most of the world will be using the Lightning Network.
If you try showcasing how the lightning network is very likely to eventually become a hub and spoke model with the hubs being analogous to and likely owned by banks you get ignored/downvoted.
If you ever question the fact that total inflows to crypto currencies have been estimated to be $6-10 billion which means there are  over $400billion in unrealized gains that need additional capital to pay out you get ignored.
If you mention the $3billion annual cost in electricity alone (ignoring equipment, land, personnel) and the environmental damage it does to keep up the network few people care.

Not everyone, I'm sure I'll get a few reasonable responses, but in mass I'm just seeing blind faith that the price will go up forever hitting $100k, $1million, with no explanations other than "0.01% of the world use bitcoin" or "Not every millionaire can own a single bitcoin" rather than reasoned analysis, which is exactly what the clueless talking heads on TV are doing when they say it's a bubble.

Neither of those two complaints on the sub are a risk for someone that doesn't intend to day trade and just wants to be able to cash out.

Lightning nodes, not bitcoin nodes. Your tiny lightning node is going to have to connect to a hub on the lightning network if you want to actually make sure your intermediary nodes have enough funds to push your transactions. 
And lightning nodes need to be on to work meaning you need something that's either always on or very easy to turn on, only options is some sort of server or your phone.
There's no lightning wallet, you run a lightning node and you have to fund it with an on chain transaction. Also on phone so forgive my grammar.

Not that I think this was handled okay but what happened is trading was halted. You could buy and sell at the time that guy made his sell. But by the time he tried to sell all trading had stopped, just some leftover orders getting filled at most. Again this is still terrible to allow such a low volume coin out the gates with unrestrained market orders. They should've never let it happen in the first place, obut nce the cat's out of the bag there's no non shitty solution for coinbase.

Sorry I'm having a hard time parsing this and what you meant, so forgive me if the next sentence is off base from what you're saying. What I mean is in the LN to open a channel you need an on chain transaction which is not free, the TOR network doesn't have a cost associated with opening a channel to a peer or for connecting yourself to the network.


Quick googling says Schnorr will reduce transaction costs by 25%. So Instead of $10 fees, $7.50 fees. Instead of 6/transactions per second 7.5/second 
Not sure what you mean by L3, could you send me something on this?


I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean here, could you paint an example for me? Like why would a business want a "canal" to every one of its customers versus an aggregator if opening a canal has a fee? You may be right if fees are a "joke" as you say but reducing fees by even 90% isn't enough if this is to scale to worldwide usage. The article I linked above said schnorr would reduce by 25% and I'm not finding anything for L3 other than miners.
I did read your post, but let me reply again:


All you said here is "Fiat can't do it either" I know it can't, Bitcoin is supposed to be better. The second part all you said is "you have a choice" but with a 6 transaction/second limit even with a 300% improvement a population of 50million couldn't even open/close one channel per month. How can this happen with very real limits on transaction throughput? I don't want wishful thinking I want numbers that show this can scale to worldwide use, at least 1% of the world using it on even a weekly basis (70+million people).


Yes they do. How does this reply help? Again Bitcoin is supposed to be better, not the status quo.


Again not really sure what you're saying or how this has anything to do with my points about the LN and bitcoin's underlying transaction limit issues.
I want to see numbers and use cases that show that bitcoin can handle 70million people using bitcoin to make relatively small purchases on a weekly basis. That's a very low baseline to a "world currency" but even that doesn't seem possible to me without heavy centralization or larger block sizes (which itself could lead to centralizations anyways), which is what we want to avoid. Not "It Will" or "you have a choice", can you tell me how my numbers are wrong? Please do I'd love to be wrong because I *want* a decentralized payment system to exist.

So you're saying me in the united states and the sandwich shop by a beach in Spain have to have a channel open to our local nodes, and our local nodes need to talk to each other directly? This sounds a lot like centralization unless you're saying these local nodes have to have millions of channels open in a gigantic mesh network.
More likely I'd have a channel open to a major US based entity (much like a bank) who then has a channel open to a major Spanish based entity (much like a bank) who has a channel open with the sandwich shop.

This is true but it's putting the cart before the horse, I co founded a small company and we're at break even right now but some of our competitors (that I know we're better than) are billion dollar companies and we've not even penetrating a fraction of a fraction of 1% of the market. It's like declaring we've already won when in reality we can still be wiped out despite having a superior product.


Lets say a person settles once a month and do some math: 6 settlements per second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 15,552,000 settlements/month. So at most 15.5million people can settle per month before transaction limits are hit. Also if people only settled once per month that would mean the last/first day of the month would be where all these would be dumped out at once causing huge issues with transaction limits on that day. Also bitcoin has not at all shown it can be a store of value as proven by the fact most people still say "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose". 


Legally speaking (I am not a lawyer) there are two options: you run your own bank node for your money, or you have to follow KYC laws. If you're your own node that's great but you have to manage you channels and making sure their pipes are fat enough for your transactions (aka your channel to your friend with $15 isn't going to be useful to go out for dinner). You also have to make sure you node server is up 24/7 and secure and properly backed up. You also have to pay for every channel you create. Personally I think it's much easier to just depend on a banking node to manage it all for me and so will most people out there outside of a select few people.


I wouldn't be the first person to point out the absurdity of digging up gold from the ground only to bury it underground somewhere else. That said bitcoin isn't replacing gold/silver mining. It's adding to it, we could stand to do less of both.


I'm not convinced hedge funds are smart - at least not in the way you mean. They know how to make money, they know how to bet, but it doesn't mean they know/care about the future viability of bitcoin.

I actually agree, I'm trying to figure out some idea of where bitcoin will go in the future but since this sub has so many "true believers" it helps to use that language to fish out arguments for bitcoin adoption hitting high levels.
I actually think bitcoin replacing fiat would be incredibly, incredibly bad. Inflation is a tool, if a government can't print money out of thin air we can get ourselves in very very hairy situations. Just look at what happened in Greece when they couldn't' control their money (The Euro). Or just compare Europe and the US and Quantitive Easing Vs. Austerity after 2008. Or Japan today with their negative interest rates.
Being able to print money out of thin air is a powerful tool for stabilizing economies. Obviously it can go too far the other way (I own a 100 trillion dollar bill from zimbabwe).
If bitcoin's price ever fully stabilizes it's be a great way to transfer money between peers though. Forget Venmo and all this other nonsense, a cryptocurrency would be great for this use case and can't wait until it's practical to use a currency like this for small transactions.

It seems you're mixing up two concepts, value and wealth. Apple had wealth, that was what I was describing if no one wanted stock anymore and it was liquidated this moment, what's left over is its "wealth". Its value is greater than its wealth but only about 3x as much.
Bitcoin however has no wealth, only value. Fiat has no wealth only value. Wealth is material goods, and the means of production. What a $1 bill is is a debt. When I have $1 the world owes me $1 worth of work. When I spend my time working and get paid $1 by my employer, that $1 is an I.O.U. The world now owes me back $1 worth of work.
When I buy food with that $1 I'm cashing in my I.O.U. Someone else takes that $1 as an I.O.U. to the next guy that they need something from.
Bitcoin is much the same, bitcoin is a token value of wealth, I can right now give you a bitcoin and you'll give me $11,000 worth of work.
Total inflows into bitcoin has been under $10billion, assuming that there are only 10 million bitcoin that aren't lost that means we currently have $100 billion in "wealth" that has been created out of thin air. Who did that much work? There are now $100billion in outstanding I.O.Us. It means if the price of bitcoin was "real" then out of nowhere a ton of work is owed to holders of Bitcoin.
Where did this debt of work come from?


If this was true, then why can't we all just create a "human" coin, evenly spread it out so everyone Human gets an equal share of human coins, then all collectively decide we each now have $1 trillion in wealth in the form of Human coins?
If we all believe it has that much value, would we not have just solved poverty, inequality, world hunger? If we all believe in the human coin and spread it out to everyone we'd all be rich.


I don't work in finance but I do read a ton about many subjects. I first put money into bitcoin in 2013 because I believed in its value as a transactional currency and its merits. I made a lot of money off bitcoin from a very small investment and I understand the technology very well. I think Bitcoin's main value is as a currency, however all this hype around it has made many get into a "get rich quick" mindset by most people "investing" into it. Bitcoin's worth is in its usability as a currency, and right now I doubt even $1billion in transaction occur in a year with bitcoin directly for goods. Yet it's taking over $1billion a year just to run the network. It's current price isn't a reflection of Bitcoin's utility, but a reflection of dollar signs in people's eyes. If Bitcoin's current value was closer to $2-4k I could believe the price reflects people's hopes and dreams of a future currency, but currently it's people's hopes and dreams that they can multiply their money. I would be surprised if even 10% of the inflows to bitcoin were from people who want to see it as a currency and not just trying to make some "free money".
I'm not trying to be negative I'm trying to be real. Bitcoin could still go up another 10x, 100x, who knows. But it's important to understand that currently the price of bitcoin is going up, because people want it to go up so they make more money. Meaning people in mass can never exit their positions because there's no underlying asset. Unless Bitcoin becomes a usable currency for everyday transactions, everyone cannot use up their Bitcoins at once without crashing the price, this gives bitcoin a pretty awful velocity of money which isn't good for a currency.

ANYONE could have bought/sold bch during those few minutes the exchange was live (I dumped all mine during the run up). All the "insider trading" claims have to do with the runup of bcash before the start of sale, it was like $2k in the morning and $3k when bch went live. The $3k-&gt;9k jump in a few minutes before trading was halted was just pure incompetence. The $2k-&gt;$3k runup before that was a bit suspect.

I fully agree bitcoin is funding the crypto revolution, few coins can be directly bought with currency. That said, if bitcoin's underlying value is funding coins with no underlying value... well...


That it is, however it doesn't produce capital. If bitcoin was worth $1 or $10,000 or $1million there wouldn't be any more or any less food produced, any more or less physical goods produced.
For bitcoin to grow other currencies must become devalued, if not then it's essentially a ponzi scheme where if everyone tried to cash out there'd be nothing left. But at no point is new "work" being produced. If bitcoin was truly worth say $1million/coin and it wasn't some ponzi that means other currencies must've dropped dramatically in value to compensate for the fact our factories are still producing the same amount of stuff as before.

General rule of thumb: you should have about 1 year's salary saved in retirement funds by now. 
You can put some into bitcoin if you want but there's a very real chance you'd lose money make sure you're okay with that. You'd be 40% into bitcoin with $10k and only $15k in other investments.  You could win big of course, or you could lose it all. I personally would hesitate to put even 10% of holdings into bitcoin, but in the grand scheme of things $10k isn't a huge amount of money so it's up to you if you want to bet it. But please don't think of it as anything more than a bet.

You should read as to what caused the great depression and the crash of 2008.
If everyone over leverages themselves with btc even a small drop could kill it. So far leverage is kinda hard to do for btc compared to equities/bonds like in the above examples so I don't think it's a huge issue yet, but once it starts becoming common a huge crash is inevitable.

How is this chart "FULL SAVAGE"? All it's saying is bitcoin has zero underlying assets (because it is an asset itself, if anything bitcoin should be colored red).

Why not reduce the pressure by increasing block sizes? It's almost too late to consider it but this wasn't a problem that just popped up a month ago. No one knows for sure when LN will be ready for production much less adopted enough to come into everyday usage. Increasing the block size is at least something with a known timeline that could be implemented.

Oh but wait there's a lightning network!? Great, tell me how I implement the lightning network on every pizza shop in the country? Will they need hardware? Education/training? How do they deal with taxes on accepting Bitcoin and then cashing it out at a different price than it was worth when they accepted it? Who are they opening the lightning channels to? Every customer? One central bank entity?
All of that is going to end up costing like a few percent per transaction anyways.

Can you provide yours? Because without yours your assertion that it's not a bubble is equally meaningless. 
At current btc prices miners need $9-10billion/year in new money to sell their production of bitcoin. If they're holding any coins and not selling they're artificially decreasing the supply, causing the price to rise above what it should be in a free market (much like diamonds). I would bet thus far in total miners have made less than $10billion in realized revenue so far, especially since most of the price increase would've been injected over the past two months.
I highly doubt miners are selling it all, so there's a huge stockpile of btc that hasn't entered the market causing artificial scarcity, which could be causing a bubble. In fact everyone that's holding and not using is adding to the scarcity and driving up the price. For bitcoin to not be a bubble, we need to get rid of holders completely, everyone needs to freely spend bitcoin to buy things. Once everyone is circulating bitcoin we can have true price discovery, until then it's price is being propped up by scarcity since no one is willing to let their bitcoin go.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:39:06
You're comparing $10billion a year in new speculative investment capital to credit card fraud and what's needed to keep entire nations afloat?
I agree $10billion isn't exactly a lot, but there are people thinking it will hit $100k, which means $65 billion or $1million which means $650 billion. That's per year (with some halvings coming of course).
I'm not saying the price is about to collapse, but I don't think it's going to keep rising at this current rate. Keep in mind absent people paying directly in bitcoin and it being used as an actual monetary system and not a speculative "investment", bitcoin is zero sum, and the current sum is about 5-10% of the value. I would bet the vast majority of people with bitcoin see it as an investment not a new technology to enable worldwide payments. What happens to those investors the year Bitcoin barely beats the s&amp;p 500?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:16:40
Bitcoin does not produce wealth, it transfers it (as currencies do). If the s&amp;p 500 fails people lose jobs, people go hungry. 
Bitcoin's "market cap" is almost $300billion, but what did it produce? where's the food that was made? Where are the thousands of jobs? Where are the products? Companies like coinbase aren't produced by bitcoin, they get paid in bitcoin and in dollars. For miners they produce bitcoin, the output is bitcoin but they don't make bread, they don't make products. They just transfer wealth from buyers of bitcoin to themselves.
If the regular economy fails, bitcoin will not "save us all". At best it'd save an exceedingly small number of people, but more likely people would offload bitcoin to buy bread.

So you want bitcoin to make you free and elevate your status and in the process cause tons and tons of people to die of starvation? If hyperbitcoinization happens in 2-6 years as you say, the vast majority of people will be too "slow" to react and lose everything. Tons of businesses would go out of business and have to lay people off if they didn't adapt quick enough (and I can assure you most won't). It will collapse economies and cause a huge transfer of wealth mostly to a bunch of people who hate governments and "the 1%". Such turmoil would almost certainly lead to food shortages and war as it would mean the complete collapse of the financial system.
I mean if that's your goal that's fair enough. The rich never seem to mind when regular people suffer.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:06:59
I've already acknowledged it takes time in my previous post. But when should it be considered if not now? Like can you tell me when the discussion should start if not now? Are we going to wait until people realize the Lightning Network is still limited at scale due to block size and the fact large transactions will still happen on chain? How many months/years after the process is kicked off is it going to take?
I don't understand how "it's going to take a long time" is ever an excuse for not starting something now. If we start tomorrow it's still going to take a long time, if we start in 5 years, it's still going to take a long time. If we had started years ago it still would've taken a long time, but could've been done by now.

You misread the definition: "to make it appear as though" it was grassroots.
Astroturf is explicitly not grassroots. Just correcting definition so you don't use the word incorrectly in the future. Astroturf is basically a big company pretending to be "ordinary people" who like their product.
Your post isn't astroturfing, but could seem like it mainly due to ambiguous language. But if you added a "We are" to the start of the title it'd be 100% NOT astroturfing, you added a "This coffee shop I went to is" Then it IS astroturfing.

6 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 518,400. So Segwit according to you is 50% better which in the grand scheme of things doesn't make much of a difference when we're off by orders of magnitude.


You're describing a bank where I'm expected to not withdraw my actual money for potentially years (using current segwit numbers if 1.4 billion people used bitcoin, each person on average could be expected to open a channel once per decade). I'm not saying it wouldn't work but it goes against many ideas bitcoin was supposed to be about such as "be your own bank" and "Decentralized". Also if everyone used the LN for everything why ever use on chain transactions at all? Wouldn't this drop fees for miners by a lot? After enough halvings the reward may not be worth it for miners and there'd be less miners, which in turn could make a 51% attack feasible.


This is great, I don't know why they can't do it right now? a 4mb block would be able to handle current volume of transactions without a problem. But yes bigger blocks can really help resolve most of these problems.


Can you elaborate on this, I haven't heard much about additional layers besides the LN itself.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:47:23

That's exactly what I was talking about you're not living on bitcoin, your living on traditional banking systems. Most "Bitcoin Debit" cards are going to have a big fat VISA logo on it.


Correlation is not causation. If facebook's monthly active users tripled right now its stock price would not triple since most new users would have to come from lower income nations where advertising dollars buy less per user. That said, this isn't even a good analogy, Facebook stock isn't to the facebook network what bitcoin is to the bitcoin network. That would be the actual users, not the stock. Bitcoin's network value is in allowing money to change hands without a 3rd part (aside from miners) having to approve, not in the price of a bitcoin.

That's fair enough, I get downvoted often if I dare suggest larger block sizes or other solutions will be needed down the line.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:54:51
The bitcoin network can still only process 6 transactions/second. If a channel being opened/closed is 2 transactions you still have scaling issues.
6 transactions/second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = ~15 million. Meaning that if channels have an average lifespan of one month, you can only have 7.5 million total channels. Meaning most people could never operate their own node and would have to have big hubs control all their finances.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:41:43
I'm a software engineer and think it scales slightly better. It'd be pretty easy for bitcoin to scale slightly better too... all it has to do is increase its blocksize just a little bit and suddenly fees would drop, transactions would get faster. It would also basically kill bcash's entire "sell" instantly.

"No one drives in NYC, too much traffic". I live in NYC and actually own a car. I use the car less than once a week, usually to drive upstate or visit my parents. There's simply too much traffic here to make driving worth it, and parking is even worse.
Right now bitcoin can handle 15million transactions a month without causing a backlog (and there's currently a backlog). There will be an equilibrium of usage and price, but it's going to be much lower than where it is now. Lightning Network depends on lots of infrastructure to be useful so it's going to take some time before everyone's using it. The time before these solutions are ready and the time bitcoin's prices level off for too long is the danger zone of faith in bitcoin being loss by the masses.
If the bcash 8mb blocks were always full, bitcoin would've been long dead with probably millions of unconfirmed transactions and weeks and thousands of dollars per transaction. again this isn't an exclusive solution it's a "for now" solution. I'm not saying ride larger blocks to the bitter end, I'm saying increase size today, for today's traffic to give time to solve tomorrow's problems.

To be honest I think the real "attack" is just the fact that it's hard to move fiat into exchanges when banks are closed.

Transaction fees won't go down because defaults are changed. They're a bidding war due to congestion.

Lets use a little bit of logic here, if for 7 billion people and no other on chain transactions can only open 2 lightning channels per year. We're looking at 133mb blocks.
What if I wanted to close out my channel once a month? Now we can only support 1.1billion people with 133mb blocks. What about 13.3 mb blocks? 110million people. What about 1.33mb blocks? Now you're looking at 11 million people can open a lightning channel once per month, assuming no other on chain transactions.
What if I wanted to deposit from my weekly paycheck? Now we're talking 2.75million people with weekly paychecks wanting to use bitcoin and no one else (with 1.33mb blocks).
How is that FUD? Are we supposed to wait until it's a problem before fixing anything? I mean clearly we're already doing that seeing as how it currently is very expensive to use bitcoin.

You could say the same from posts like these, it's meant to make sure the idea of cashing out never goes into people's head. Not wanting people to talk about "spending" bitcoin and yelling HODL to others is basically showing your own insecurity about the price.
If you believe in bitcoin then you should be happy for people cashing out, them being able to realize value makes it more legit. If anyone and everyone could cash out freely all the time then anyone yelling "It's like a Ponzi" is wrong.
If "old hands selling" is a threat to Bitcoin then it just means Bitcoin's foundation is weak and it's value is illusionary. If you think its value is real then people cashing out shouldn't affect Bitcoin's long term success.

Bitcoin's value is either illusionary or a transfer of wealth. If bitcoin was worth 1million each and we assumed only 10million btc in in play (rest are "lost" in landfills or something). That means the market cap would be $10 trillion.
Think about what that really means. $10trillion is enough to build 5 thousands copies of the world's largest building. That's enough to comfortably feed the entire world for three years. That's enough to build  50,000 stadiums at half a billion a pop. That's enough money to to give an iphone X to every human on the planet.
But... who's actually building those iphones, buildings, stadiums, food, etc? How is bitcoin rising to $1million causing that much work to be done? The answer is it's not
If bitcoin was worth that much, that means currencies would have to be devalued by an equal amount. It's betting on a significant recession if not depression. It's betting on tons of human misery to have that kind of transfer of wealth in only 2 years if you think this could happen by 2020. Everyone with Bitcoin would suddenly feel pretty well off, at the expense of everyone else.

If you live in certain high tax places (liked NYC) selling before end of year would be beneficial, you can only deduct $10k in state and local taxes starting next year due to the tax law.

You're saying this ephemeral value of a Brand is worth billions, and it's underpinning valuation of Bitcoin in general. I'm saying this is simply not true.


And is that value $10, $100, $1million, $1billion, $1 trillion? You're saying people who say bitcoin has no underlying value are wrong because it has a brand, so implicitly you're saying the bitcoin brand is the single most valuable brand in the entire world, more than Apple, more than Coca Cola, more than Disney. 
And the crazy thing is despite whatever value you want to place, the Bitcoin Brand is unsellable, so you can't make money from selling it so saying the brand is the underlying value is just nonsense as a retort to people saying "bitcoin has no underlying value". 
Unless you can gather up all the "bitcoins" and vote to sell the brand and the total valuation of bitcoin drops by exactly the amount it sold its brand for (assuming the payment is payed out to holders of bitcoin as a dividend of some sort), then saying it's the underlying value of bitcoin is absurd.

Right now the average fee seems to be in the $30-$40 range to transfer bitcoin, from ANY wallet, not just coinbase. In fact Gdax is one of the few places you can reasonable transfer a small amount of bitcoin.
The fees have nothing to do with coinbase, and aren't the reason everyone is mad at coinbase. They're just mad because they released BCH trading unannounced and supposedly some employees knew about it ahead of time and bought bch before it went live. None of the issues people have with coinbase has anything to do with how they're holding or securing your btc. That said many think holding btc in ANY exchange is bad.

I'm going to go on a limb and guess Shark Tank is the limit of your experience with financing for businesses. I encourage you to watch many seasons of Shark Tank and pay attention to the sharks and take notes, then read books on startup funding and how investments in the space work, particularly with exits and how most investments yield $0 for investors for a total loss of capital (particularly in companies funded pre-revenue).
I actually started a startup and know how funding for companies work.
Notice how they never pull these numbers out of thin air, there's always revenue attach, and the sharks seem to like sticking to a 3x revenue multiple. When you invest in a company you're investing in a revenue stream, a dividend. A typical company is worth 3x revenue (varying upon industry). So when they give $1m for a company for a $5m valuation, they are either giving it to a company with $1.6.million in revenue, or a company with a high potential for revenue growth.
We're seeking VC funding for a series A investment right now at a 5x revenue multiple based on projected future growth. The types of investors we're seeking are also less greedy than the sharks as they very rarely give a 5x multiple valuation on a company (I watch shark tank enough). Meaning if we made $1 last year, we're seeking a $5 valuation, likely giving up 30% equity. So we'll get about $1.5 in funding (so about a year and a half of revenue).
Bitcoin however produced no work, no dividends, no revenue. Bitcoin isn't a company, there's no business model. There's no way to value bitcoin other than "feelings". If you tried valuing bitcoin by a multiple of revenue it'd be worth $0.

I said "in terms of creating "fake" wealth" not in how it operates. People hate the concept because what happens is a bank gets $100 deposited by you, they loan out $90 of it and some of that $90 goes right back into the bank account of another user, so out of your $100 the bank might possibly have over $100 in deposits. People hate the concept because it's creating fake wealth that doesn't exist, if everyone withdrew their money from a bank at once they bank can't simply recall all their loans and 90% of that money in deposits would have to come from thin air if it's FDIC insured.
Bitcoin is much the same. If somehow every single bitcoin was magically transferred to your wallet (and everyone who currently had bitcoin didn't mind for whatever reason) would you now be the richest person in the world? Could you buy amazon with all this bitcoin? If everyone tried to use their bitcoin all at once, is there really enough "wealth" to buy ~$150billion worth of stuff? Bitcoin is fake wealth because if everyone actually used their bitcoin the price would crash. It's expensive because most bitcoins aren't circulated since people are holding.


That's exactly the point, where did this wealth come from? I don't know the ratio but let's say it's 50% (probably lower than this but who knows). If only $75billion was dumped into bitcoin, why is it worth $150billion? Where did that "$75" billion come from? Is there a bitcoin bank that has in its reserves $75billion so that if everyone withdrew their bitcoin they'd at least get something back? If everyone all at once in the same second decided they wanted their "cut" the price would instantly drop to $0 and no one would get anything. The money put into bitcoin just went into other people's pockets. "Bitcoin" is literally worth nothing more than what people are willing to pay for it. Did bitcoin really create enough wealth to feed 50 million people for year? 


This is **wrong**. When a company goes public it does not suddenly release 100% of itself to the public, it'll release say 30%. If a company thinks it's worth $100million when it goes public it'll release a million shares at $30 each. That money then goes **to the company**. So now the company has $30million in cash it can use to buy equipment, inventory, hire people, etc... Furthermore using the above example:
Let's say everyone all at once would want their cut of Apple and no one wanted to buy a single share, you would not be left with $0, Apple would have to liquidate its holdings and assets and while you may lose money since its stock is worth more than its assets you would not be holding an empty bag. When you buy a stock you're not buying a piece of paper you're buying a piece of an income producing company. If it has a positive PE ratio little by little you're getting value back from it even if no one ever buys a share from you. With bitcoin the value only comes if someone is willing to buy your bitcoin from you.


Apple has 375.3 billion in assets, and generates nearly $50billion in profits per year of which it keeps $45billion (aka: increasing assets) and gives shareholders $5billion in direct payment. Apple's currently priced at a PE ratio of 18.62 meaning that if nothing changes it'd take apple 18.62 years to "pay for itself".
"The Market" isn't *assigning* apple it's value, the market is trying to *find* what its value is. When speculating (Gold, Bitcoin) the market assigns a value, and that's much different than a stock.

that, if the computer where the private keys are stored is compromised, coins
will be stolen by the attacker. While there may be methods to mitigate
the threat for the sender and the receiver, the intermediary nodes must be
online and will likely be processing the transaction automatically. For this
reason, the intermediary nodes will be at risk and should not be holding
a substantial amount of money in this “hot wallet.” 
Source:  Section 9.3
I'm not an expert on the LN myself but I've read the whitepaper and this seems to be the way it works. Note the risk is the compromised node only (I "think" though the quote above uses the word 'may' for risk to sender/receiver). The sender/receiver aren't at risk but this hack would force the channel links to be closed (aka on-chain transactions) after the lockout expires.
Edit: Disclaimer again: I'm not an expert on this so I could be wrong and the sender/receiver may actually be at risk.

Yeah that's the true tragedy of success. Crypto "currencies" won't be currencies for a very long time. It has to become boring first, then it can become money. If it's exciting everyone is trying to profit instead of spend, the price needs to level off and become stable before it's useful as a currency, and this has to happen without something killing the project along the way.

This is obviously debatable. 
When I first bought stocks I realized buying less than $2k of any company was stupid at $10/trade. $20 total to buy and sell meant I'd be losing 1% on fees on $2k which was the absolute most I wanted to lose to fees per year per holding.
Bitcoin is expensive as an investment to get into because of fees if you're putting in less than a few thousand (cheap if you're putting in tons more). 
As a currency it's useless since settlement can take hours or possibly days, and it still has these fees. Back in 2013 people were running around this subreddit tipping each other $1 for good posts, every day was a new story about how a new website now accepts bitcoin payments, and how it was cheaper than credit cards (to the store). Today we have the opposite due to high fees and slow confirmations.
I personally think we need a solution now, as the price goes up fees go up, as the price goes up more people try buying and trading, which means more transactions, which means more backlog of unconfirmed transactions, which means more fees.

Yes and no. 
If you want to liquidate $100k yeah it's pretty easy. $1million gets rougher as you're moving the price needle a bit, $10million would be hard without eating a decent loss, $100million no, not easy without losing a huge amount to market shifts unless you arrange a brokered private sale.

It's not about being for sale, it's about being sellable.
Wall-Mart could sell its brand if it wanted to. It'd be incredibly stupid for them to do that but they could sell it. Bitcoin can't be sold since it's public domain, so it can't be priced. It also can't be "protected" since it's public domain.
Quick edit: Public domain doesn't mean it has no "value" it means it has no dollar value, and isn't a retort to "For those who say Bitcoin has no underlying value". I think you and I would agree the air we breathe is very very valuable, but it belongs to the public, you can't sell breathing air, there's no tax for breathing in air, or anything. Bitcoin the brand is like air, it's available for anyone to use for free. I'm not saying it's useless I'm saying as a dollar amount it has no value, it has "value" just not monetary value, just like air.

Does the tor network have a high fee to open and close a route? Does the tor network require each node you send through to have a balance of data given to it by other trenasactions greater than the amount of data you want to push through?
Those are the two factors that will lead to bug hubs forming. Also given the 15million transaction a month limit btc has it won't be practical for everyone to run their own node, also to receive payments at unknown intervals your node has to always be on. Thrse factors mean for the majority of people it'd be better to have a super hub manage their money rather than they themselves. So these hubs would in effect be banks

The advice is on how to do it 100% "by the book" if you want to claim over 1 year for long term capital gains you have to declare "how" you got your assets.

That's the key point, Satoshi's coins are as good as destroyed - until he moves them. Once they're active all of a sudden the supply of bitcoin just went up a ton.

It's really really hard to tell how much money has been put into cryptocurrencies. My guess is less than 5% of its market cap however. Meaning I think under $15billion total has gone into the system, meaning most of the $500billion in "market cap" for all crypto combined is mostly "unrealized gains".
On GDAX, one of the largest exchange if you fired off a market order seling  10,000btc you'd crash the price to under $4k and get about $100million total.
If you had 100,000 bitcoin and coordinated it really well you could probably crash every single exchange to extract nearly a billion dollars and reduce bitcoin's "market cap" from ~250billion to about 60billion. It would be unknown if the price would recover or keep dropping more and more.
Assumptions: 
Someone is doing this maliciously because a market order of this size spread amongst so many exchanges means you're losing a ton of potential money, and it's not an easy task.
None of these exchanges crash.
GDAX is approximately 10% of the market

My main concern is I truly think over time it'll end up being a hub and spoke model with centralized "banks". To run your own node you have to be connected to the network, to add bitcoin to your channel there's a fee. To me it makes sense to put as much bitcoin to my starting node as possible, enough for the week/month/whatever in spending. If I end up needing my money back I need to be able to retreive if from the node. This means I either need to own the node, or have it be an entity whose purpose is to be like a "bank". If I own the node I have to make sure it's up to use it. I wouldn't want to keep so much on my phone and might not want my pc to be on all the time. So a 3rd party I trust would make most sense.
Then you consider connecting to the rest of the world with large channels, like of I buy a $2k plane ticket what routes will have that much money open to them? I wouldn't want to create new routes for a single transaction since that costs money. If the airline had its own large node my bank node could just have a  open channel to them. Or in different nation large hubs meant for international connections to its own smaller banking hubs to its own  end users.
How does the lightning network plan on  preventing "banks" from forming in a world where you can  buy anything with bitcoin like we can buy anything with a credit card today?

How did you come up with 50%? Are you willing to put an estimated date by when you think 50% of accounts will be held off-shore and bet real money on it? 
Your entire hypothesis rests on the fact that people would want to store massive amounts of money they want kept secret in a distributed ledger anyone can read. If I were trying to hide my wealth (and my wealth was in the billions) I would not use bitcoin, governments can analyze the blockchain. Also how would I convert said wealth into a usable form without affecting the price? Do I have to worry about government bans? Will my wealth be safe from a massive solar flare?
This scenario seems like what would happen if bitcoin was worth much more first, and provenly stable first, before anyone would seriously consider doing this. It'd be insane to put that much money into bitcoin for "safe keeping" since the price is so volatile, and the bitcoin itself is too "new". Maybe if bitcoin was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and had a relatively low volatility over the span of decades, maybe then people would consider putting in billions of dollars to "keep safe", but this is a chicken and egg problem.

Okay, my local pizza store's owner can barely understand his credit card machine. He always puts on his glasses and literally pulls his head back probably to focus to type in the amount of my food, presses a button and hands me the machine to swipe.
How does this guy use the lightning network? The only way I can see it happening is another company (much like the one he already uses for the credit card machine) comes in and manages it for him (and charges fees). At this point there's zero advantage to the store over a credit card.
It's not about how easy it is for you and me to use, it's how it is to actual endpoints at stores. 


Yes it will, it will at the least need tablets. You don't want your minimum wage employees using their personal phones to make payments. So now need to buy hardware (I'm assuming existing POS systems can't or won't support bitcoin/lightning network anytime soon). If you now have tablets you have to worry about it being lost, typical POS systems are large and bulky. Also cash will still be used so it has to integrated with their register to make accounting easier.


Okay. I'm a pizza store selling $3 slices. Over a month I sell 1000 slices using cryptocurrencies for a total of $3000. I close my lightning channel and immediately convert to fiat and get paid out $3005 after fees (coin prices went my way this month). How do I report this to the IRS? Do I have to tally up every single transaction, along with its spot price to form a basis, then tally it up for what I sold at the end of the month to compute short term capital gains?


I apologize if it comes across as mean spirited but I regularly hear pitches for companies and get asked for advice. I always pick out every single negative I can. It's the most important thing to see viability, it's to fully understand what you're dealing with and not have an idealistic view of it. I would love for cryptocurrencies to succeed, but I at this point don't see it becoming just another badge next to VISA, Mastercard, Amex, and integrated to a swiped card managed by a bank-like entity. I'm not saying it will fail or not be used, just succeed in a way most people on this subreddit aren't imagining. What I'm seeing is large Lightning Network "bank nodes" managing everything.

At the end of the day the bitcoin network is going to need much larger blocks. At the current 6 transaction/second limit you can only have 15 million transactions per month.

You said credit cards for coffee "impractical" I'm not quite sure what that word means. 
Also in very high throughput places cards are clearly faster than cash. I live in NYC and it's obvious that swiping a card and handing it back is much much faster than counting cash. There are places here that don't even accept cash anymore to keep up it's high throughput of sales during lunch. So "Quicker" and "more convenient" isn't universally true for cash. I personally use credit cards for every single purchase I make (I pay balances in full). It's so much more convenient and gives me tons of useful data about my spending habits I can analyze later. I think cash is outdated in a modern connected society and its use should be relatively limited compared to tech.
 &gt; I can't afford the expense and stress of identity theft.
Identity theft directly from a credit card use is minor, there's zero non public information on your card except for the credit card number itself. You can reverse those transactions too. It's not that a big deal (I've had my credit card info stolen before, took a few mins to call the bank). Having your SSN stolen is a bigger issue but that doesn't come with having your credit card stolen.

Last estimate I read is the network right now costs roughly $3b/year to operate in electricity - however I'm not sure how this was calculated, there's a chance chinese miners aren't paying a "fair price" for electricity. I doubt it's  that much.
But if that's true most likely you're talking about $5billion in energy spent at most total ( The actual cash inflow estimate from JP Morrgan was $6billion about a month ago but I was being generous and doubling it. USDT is at 1billion and just under 10% of the volume, so using that as a ballpark 15billion inflows seems right.
That said, the cost of electricity isn't an inflow to the system, it's an expense and investment for sure, but not part of the buying pressure supporting its price. If anything it's a negative on the value since it's an expense just to "keep it running". 
Edit: Assumption: USDT isn't a scam.

I'm not a market expert, in fact no one is lol. So don't trust me on this.
But in any case here are my 2 cents: Interest rates are really low, meaning it's really cheap to borrow money. This means tons of investment capital is flowing through our system, this means tons of excess cash for investments. This flow of money means people have a ton to throw around, for example the s&amp;p 500 is trading at pretty high PE ratios, a 10% "correction" would actually be a correction towards historical PE ratio averages, yet it's still going up. This easy money has also pushed up housing prices nation wide, and it wouldn't surprise me if it's one of the reasons money is so readily available to throw into cryptocurrencies.
The problem is if we have another recession, lower interest is one of the major weapons the government has, and they're already low. So we're low on ammo to fight off another great depression (2007 was almost as bad as the great depression). Raising interest rates could also trigger a collapse if the market is indeed built on a house of cards.

You did say:


My math wasn't about number of transactions/purchases, it was about number of settlements. If you don't change the block size and 12 million people used bitcoin regularly they could settle once per month at most. Meaning that you could at most once per month deposit or withdraw bitcoin from the lightning network.
The only way this works is if you never settle your transactions to the blockchain, but then you bring up other issues as mentioned a few posts up.

I'm not a lawyer so do not trust me on this but:


No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment
What this is saying is if you own land, if you own a truck, if you own a factory and use it productively, and then trade for a better version you don't owe taxes even if you sold it for more than you bought it for. Cryptocurrencies are not considered productive as they merely exist and do no work so it would be hard to argue they fall under this ruling. For anyone that argues that bitcoin allows transactions and therefore is "productive": Bitcoins DO NOT allow you to transfer money. The miners do.
I'm not sure what "for investment" means in this context but that could potentially help but you'd have to ask a lawyer and there's no legal evidence bitcoin and say litecoin are similar enough.

Also if you buy a coin for almost 4x what it cost this morning then it's a little bit your fault.

Yes it will require new hardware. Stores sometimes don't even own the actual machines (monthly fees for the POS system). And if they do it's a purpose built machine that's not simply upgradeable without the payment processing company doing the work. On top of it any change to a POS system will require employee training which is its own hurdle. And the store would still want an all-in-one payment settlement system most likely not direct bitcoin payment unless bitcoin was -the- main currency.
I've worked a tiny bit with pos systems (as a software engineer). Glacial is putting it mildly. There are lots of ipad based solutions popping up now however. Those will be much easier to upgrade, but their penetration is low outside big cities.
Quick edit: also many are not connected to the internet and have phone based hardlines to the master station. QR codes won't work there for confirmation.

Define timely? Because right here right now we have a problem where transactions are taking hours and commonly cost over $10. It's going to start getting more mainstream press and could sour the public's perception of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole.
When will the lightning network be production ready? What's the deploy plan? How long will it take the network to grow wide enough to be used more commonly than on-chain? How do they plan on dealing with the fact that only 15.5million channels can be opened or closed per month with current block sizes?

This assumes you run your own node, and connect it to a hub. Rather than have a hub hold your money and send it on your behalf.
The problem is to run your own node you need a server or to trust your phone with your funds.
With the current blocksize the network can only support 15million transactions a month. Hosting your own  node is impractical at scale due to the underlying network limitations.
Between these two issues its more likely you directly deposit go a node and never touch the networking yourself as they manage your money.
Bigger blocks could potentially alleviate some of these limitations.

Meanwhile I remember everyone around me talking about bitcoin in 2013, I remember the post on this subreddit about the suicide hotline incase anyone was depressed after after the price dropped by over 80% and didn't just bounce back. If you bought in feb 2017 you're fine, if you bought before the hype you probably didn't pour your life saving's into it and even if you did a 90% drop and you're probably still in the green. Meanwhile there are people putting these on credit cards, tons of people with no money are putting their money into it. Thinking the price will still go up is a gamble and nothing else.


I first heard about bitcoin when it was about $20, in under a year it was as $1200. I think you're the one that hasn't seen anything yet ;)


What makes you say this? The technology or the price? 
Remember the "panic" where bitcoin's price retraced from $11k to 9k losing all the gains it made in what 2 days? Every exchange was having issues, the network unconfirmed transactions hit over 90k. In november we hit I think over 170k unconfirmed transactions. Bitcoin in its *current state* is **not** liquid. If a bitcoin billionaire "retires" and decides to start to liquidate billions and billions of dollars of his holdings so he can build schools in africa. It would kill Bitcoin. If Jeff Bezos did that with amazon stock there'd be no problem. There's a saying:
*Liquidity is always there until the moment you need it.*


I'm not reading anything, there are no leaves to look at. This entire thread is "don't invest recklessly" It sounds like you're not betting the farm on bitcoin by your entry date, but I have friends with barely any savings putting down $10k on dumb stuff like hash flare because their calculators said they'll make $100k by the end of 2018. They *might* or they might not. I know lots of people are taking out loans and credit cards to put it in bitcoin, I see my facebook and there are people putting a lot into bitcoin.
And you know, who knows I called my friend an idiot for putting $20k into bitcoin in 2013 when the price was like $200-300 (and that was -all- his money at the time). He's  a millionaire now. That could still happen for people betting it all today. I myself made a ton of money, more than my entire (sizable) retirement and taxable investments made in that time and I only put in like 2-3% of my money in.




I fully understand the lookback regret. In 2015 I almost bought another 25ish bitcoin then decided to scale back and only buy like 10. Hell in 2013 I almost bought like 10 bitcoin for like $500 before decided it'd be dumb. You gotta play the game to win it. But don't bet the farm unless you have a 2nd farm.

Bitcoin has crashed 90% multiple times in the past, and yet here we are. Anyone who doesn't consider that it can crash 90% again is just deluded. I'm not saying it will happen, only that it's a very real possibility. 
If bitcoin crashed to  $1800  right now, it would still better than where it was 12 months ago, it would have performed better than the s&amp;p 500 has done despite this year being amazing for the s&amp;p 500.

Currently a transaction costs $16 to get through within one hour on average:  increasing block size doesn't have to be a permanent solution. It can be a stopgap until better ones are actually working.
If bitcoin stops rising like 10%/day people will soon realize their currency is worthless. The only reason it's working right now is that to volatility of bitcoin is so high that the fee is inconsequential to people moving money around. Even if you're sending $500 for a $16 fee the price could move more than the fee either direction by the time you have confirmation.


We have a problem today, we have a solution that would work today. You can keep trying to find long term solutions while relieving pressure today, it's not an exclusive operation.
1) This argument is essentially "We don't want to". Mainly because it benefits miners to have high fees and they have most of the power to accept/deny protocol changes. Protocol enhancements unrelated to scaling are not in discussion, no reason to bring it up for something that is considered a targeted fix for a problem that's happening right now. It shows inflexibility in the community.
2) Then you have a community problem, users should switch to wallets that are in their best interest over time. Saying everyone should pay huge transaction fees because developers are lazy, and we need to force them to update is not a great argument in my opinion.
3) Same as above, if they're not going to work on a problem because it's not urgent all you're saying is as future problems are foreseen in bitcoin, people are going to wait until it is a problem to start solving it. I want VISA to solve scaling issues on my credit card BEFORE I notice them. It bitcoin is to be used as a currency you can't have in the back of your mind the fact that the developers are lazy and will only do things once it's an urgent problem. 
4) Is this actually true for say 8mb blocks? I haven't heard any horror stories from the bcash people that nodes are too hard to run. Bitcoin has been running for years, surely computers have gotten more powerful since then.

People trying to buy bitcoin. I sold nearly that much recently and it took less than a minute to liquidate on gdax.
It works the same way as stocks. Sites like coinbase try to abstract it away from you and provide a very simple "buy" and "sell" interface, but they charge hefty fees and spreads. Only thing is if your gains are 100% a 1% fee doesn't seem crazy. On Gdax you can actually do it for zero fees if you're a market maker but that is more complex.
Here's the complex view:

As I understand them nodes will also need to be always-on. So the security requirements combined with needing to always run means the everyday joe would never run their own node.
If they never run their own node how do they get Bitcoin onto the ecosystem? Only way I can think of is to deposit it to nodes and have them manage your money for you (like a bank).
I'm not sure how this doesn't lead to centralization unless I'm misunderstanding on how to actually "use" the LN from the perspective of an everyday user (which I very well could be).

Bigger blocks aren't the answer, but 1MB blocks aren't the answer either. If a given person is expected to create 1 on chain transaction a month with a 1MB block you're talking a maximum capacity for bitcoin of 15.5million people.
If you're expected a single transaction once per year you're at 186 million people. If you can increase efficiency of transactions by 3x you're talking ~600million people doing a transaction once per year at most.
I don't know what the right answers are but it seems to me too many are willing to believe lightning network is going to solve all their problems, or 1gb blocks are going to solve all their problems. I think they're both wrong. A combination of solutions is going to be needed.
This subreddit needs to stop calling people shills for simply pointing out that larger blocks might be needed, and they also need to stop closing their ears and thinking the LN is going to magically fix everything on its own.

I said "If everyone over leverages themselves" a crash is inevitable. What that means is enough people borrow money to buy btc a "small" drop of say 20-30% could lead to margin calls, which further collapse the price, once people who put it on credit cards, personal loans, home equity loans start being in the red they're in real trouble and may sell before their losses are total, etc..
It's what happened in 2008 and the great depression.
Without leverage it's possible to just "HODL" through crashes, I lost 90% of my initial btc's value in 2013 and held it for years and here we are today. Since I didn't take any loans out and didn't invest more than I could afford to lose, holding was as easy as "not even thinking" about my btc.

If I understood the article correctly using google's method you would need 6500 years of CPU time and 112 years of GPU time to break a single hash.
The crack here is now instead of it being "impossible" it's now possible for a large organization to crack a single hash in a little over a month if they have a server farm with 78,000 cpus and also about 6000 GPUs working on it.
Which means even if a similar method was found for SHA256 it'd be from "impossible with all the resources in the visible universe" to "still pretty impossible for humanity".

It does not relate to BTC. What SHA1 is a hashing algorithm that is commonly used to sign things and prove that data is what it's supposed to be. Bitcoin keys for example use SHA256
Before breaking it faking an SHA1 would be virtually impossible even with every computer in the world working together trying to do it for thousands of years. Now it can be done with millions of dollars of equipment in about a month per hash. 
It's still not "practical" to defeat it as it'd likely take over $100k of compute time (not to mention a few weeks) for a single target. Anyone who's worth that kind of expenditure shouldn't be using SHA-1 anyways and it'd kinda be their own fault for using it in the first place.

From your own link (also contradicting the above quote):


Unfortunately, even if AMT is currently disabled, that doesn’t mean an attack was never possible—an attacker might have disabled AMT after concluding the attack, to close the door on their way out.
All that says is if the AMT was ever enabled you may potentially be screwed. However if it were never enabled there's no risk that wouldn't require a machine to already be hosed. (if something's changing your bios you're already screwed).

But as I'm correcting someone from a much much larger mistakes (not paying taxes at all) and being met with a "What you are doing should is illegal" and the post above had a "stfu" before being edited isn't constructive. I'm editing my post above to change the word income to short term capital gains, thanks again for the correction.
Sorry I didn't realize I was speaking to a tax attorney. Because you can in fact offset capital losses from income from ordinary paychecks to a limit and carry over excess to later years. If you're losing more than the annual limit you really should be using software or an accountant anyways to figure it out rather than yourself and this mistake wouldn't happen.
Also if you want to be pedantic read my post again:


In context it's only about taxes paid, not talking about losses are handled at all. The post I replied to was deleted but that guy was implying you had zero tax liability for selling bitcoin and keeping the money on gdax, which is not true.

The IRS is already on this: 
Essentially you pay long term capital gains if you held over a year, ~~income~~ short-term capital gains if under a year.

I'll wait until I know those exist, because those servers don't exist by magic and I've never seen an unknown device appear on my router or my office's router. If this hidden OS had a web server or web or whatever, it'd need an IP address and be detectable on the network. Feel free to show me one instance of the OS being on a network.

That quote was right....
Your bitcoin are **NOT** insured by the government. Coinbase has their own private insurance for the bitcoin they hold. That insurance company's underwriters probably never saw bitcoin being worth 10k, and there's a good chance they can't actually afford to pay out if coinbase somehow lost all their bitcoin at once (which if they're doing their job right is unlikely to happen).
The only insurance Coinbase has from the government is FDIC for their USD deposits.

It would, yes. However the likelihood of this happening is much lower than in Bitcoin. That said, gold is also considered speculative for "investors", and most people would recommend you keep very little of your portfolio in gold. I think Bitcoin and Gold are in the same asset category.


How many dollars did Julius Caesar spend for his gold? My wording was specific, I called it "wealth tokens" at one point. A dollar bill represents wealth, it itself is just paper. For much of history you could pay people directly with gold or tokens for fair gold value. And in any case as above, bitcoin represents the same asset class as bitcoin.

Right now for $100k I can change bitcoin's market cap by over $100 million dollars (although briefly).
Market cap is useless as a number for bitcoin when trying to compare it to its impact on the larger economy. The market cap right now is over $100billion and I can assure you no where near that amount of money has gone into bitcoin. And **that** should worry everyone.
Think about it, where did that "wealth" come from? What former billionaire is now flat broke since everyone who invested in bitcoin took his money? When bcash split off, who put in $23billion into it? Why is it "worth" $23billion?
Everyone seems to hate fractional reserve banking, but not realizing that bitcoin as of right now is almost the same thing (in terms of creating "fake" wealth). We're all pooling our "wealth" into bitcoin and as long as only some of us takes it out at a time it works. But if we all took it out at once? It'd collapse the system completely.
The only way Bitcoin survives in the long run is if people can use bitcoin directly for goods and services. Right now that just isn't true as very few people accept bitcoin as payment. (Processors that just take bitcoin and deliver fiat to businesses don't count).
Until it's usable as a currency in a real sense, Bitcoin's value depends on people not actually claiming their "wealth tickets".

According to your article:


The ME works with "system firmware during boot", the vulnerability that started all these articles and posts since yesterday wasn't with ME, but through the AMT as an attack vector. The ME isn't an attack vector if it isn't actually given a network address and the host OS can't access it, and the motherboard hasn't done anything to it.
Any attack on the ME means you already have some very low level access to the machine, and by that point it's really game over anyways.

The article lists no specifics and nothing at all about ME other than "it's closed source". You know what else is closed source? Windows and OSX. Why aren't you completely afraid of those?


If it's completely undocumented how do they know it has direct access to what's on your screen? I actually am very curious as to how it interacts with a GPU in order to see what's on your screen.


The very definition of fear mongering. There are zero specifics in this about how any of this is possible. If I were you I'd be more afraid of your router, we've already discovered China has embedded backdoors into commercial routers in the past unbeknownst to the manufacturer. If we're going to be afraid of vague threats and state actors whose to say the NSA doesn't already have the root certs and therefore can see all your internet traffic?
The only thing we seem to know about ME from any of these links is that it's an OS that lives on the CPU and therefore could theoretically do anything. But then it uses words like "can see your password". For an OS that fits on a CPU it sure seems to be able to do a crap ton of stuff. How does it access your hard drive? How does it know the filesystem the hard drive uses? How does it know the OS layouts? How does it connect itself to a network invisibly?
None of these have answers because everything in these articles are pure conjecture based on only one real fact: ME is closed source.


I am a software engineer, and while I haven't reviewed the closed source I can guarantee you whoever wrote these articles didn't either, and therefore they are also speculating as are you.

The nice thing about wanting 10x+ gains is you treat it as an all or nothing bet. It was never an investment, it was a bet, so I was fully willing to lose all my money.
Had I over invested I might have panic sold after my first crash, or sold after only a 2x gain for fear of losing it all. This is why people suggest only invest what you can lose.
For what it's worth I don't think bitcoin will see a 50x gain ever again. (unless the price truly collapses and 50x means it's back to 10k)

If LN succeeds there would eventually be more LN nodes than bitcoin nodes. 
This entire thread is a bit meaningless, whatever message you're trying to say about bch will eventually be true for btc too... (unless LN fails to take off).

He's saying more than that. He's saying bitcoin itself produces no new value. And this is 100% true. No commodity or currency produces value, they store value.
Bitcoin generates zero interest and zero dividends. It does no work. The mining operations, payment gateways and users are what produces the value, and bitcoin stores said value.

Bitcoin has no liquidity (in big boy terms, for normal people who at most have a few million it's liquid enough). Its "market cap" is an illusion, taking $1billion out of bitcoin would completely crash the price. It doesn't mean the price will definitely crash one day, but it certainly means it can easily crash by the actions of one or a few people. Bitcoin is still at the "don't invest more than you can lose" stage.

What helps you skip the middleman is every computer operating the blockchain. It's those people that create the value you're speaking of with their computing power.
A company creates value by producing products/services, employees of a company "are" the company. Users of Bitcoin however aren't themselves "Bitcoin". Bitcoin doesn't mine itself, it doesn't transfer itself, and is in fact 100% inert without outside entities using it.
This isn't a bad thing, it's just a characteristic of currencies and commodities in general. Bitcoin is the product, it's the result of value being generated. The machines mining the bitcoin are what "create" the value.

If index funds lose 50% of their value we're in the greatest depression in history, if it goes to 0% society has collapsed.
If bitcoin goes down 50% many of us won't even blink, if it goes to 0% it would affect a minority of people worldwide. 
To say diversified index funds aren't safer than bitcoin is just plain wrong.

This has only been true for diversified investments across markets. With bitcoin it really is too volatile to say one method is better than the other.
Dollar cost averaging is typically a way to reduce risk, and as we all know risk is reward. In the case of the previous months of bitcoin in hindsight lump sums were the way to go, but past results don't guarantee future results.

American express produces credit cards that I can use in stores so I don't have to carry cash (and others use because they don't have cash). They developed the computer systems that keep track of all these transactions, they make sure everyone gets paid when they should. They provide customer service, insurance, benefits. They also increase sales for many organization as well as reduce cost to some people.
Meanwhile Bitcoin simply "exists" and does nothing. The miners, the users, the exchanges, the banks, the storefronts, etc... are what produce value using bitcoin. But bitcoin itself is just a bunch of numbers that do nothing on their own.

The miners and people running nodes are what provide the medium of exchange (the blockchain is the medium, not bitcoins). A bitcoin is just a string of characters.


You language is important I'm not saying bitcoin **has** no value, I'm saying (as the title of this thread does) that bitcoin **produces** no value. In fact bitcoins are the **product** of mining operations that discover blocks.
I'm a fan of bitcoins and the blockchain is a fantastic technology, but it's important to be accurate and understand it instead of calling it "magic internet money".
Bitcoin and currencies in general are a *store of value*. It represents work, it represents debt. When you have $10, the world owes you $10 worth of work. When you have 1 bitcoin, the world owes you 1 bitcoin worth of work. How much work $1 represents and how much work 1 bitcoin represents determine what they're worth.

having and producing have different meanings last time I checked the dictionary.

Have you ever used AWS in a serious production environment? What exactly do you mean about "not having control over professional services"? You can hire 3rd party companies to manage AWS for you, or do it all yourself. Also what do you mean by trusting "AWS to manage all of your data"? They don't manage data if you don't let them, just provide servers and infrastructure.
AWS is increasingly used in the healthcare space (first hand knowledge) which has HIPAA concerns with protecting data. They'll even sign a BAA with you which means they're confident that they won't be the cause of data loss. (Government fines for HIPAA violations are no joke even for a company like Amazon)

Market Cap doesn't mean anything for bitcoin, inflows/outflows to fiat is the only real metric you can use and we don't have any accurate way of determining this. If I sold $1billion in bitcoin right now I would tank the price far more than $1b in its "market cap", if I bought $1 billion in bitcoin the price would increase far more than $1b in "market cap".
$1million is still very unlikely though.

Nicehash lets you also do the mining. I run it on my gaming PC when I'm not gaming (My apartment has free electricity). So from my point of view it's just "free money". It does feel odd to think that I'm now "paying" like a few cents per hour to play games.

Both coins will add up to the value of 1x.... but it doesn't mean 50:50 it could be 99.999%:00.001% Also panic and confusion may devalue the whole sum, or speculation may increase the whole sum.

It's not illegal to ban cash. However if the restaurant makes it clear its credit only, and it's post paid and you only have cash legally they have to take the cash. But then they are free to ban you or have a surcharge for cash transactions. 
If it's prepaid they can just refuse service.

You can skip this for windfall years. If your taxes are higher this year than past years.
