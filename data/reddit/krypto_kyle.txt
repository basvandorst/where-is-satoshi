FraggleRockRefugee, 
You are absolutely right.  Bcash has a marketing team and Bitcoin has a development team.  Instead of wasting time and energy bashing and fighting Bcash we should be pooling our resources together to get Bitcoin where it needs to be.  The Crypto Recession will wash away all the grime and dirt.

Thanks PaulJP.  He did a good analysis on what to expect if you get into mining yourself.  I'm pulling about .16 kWh running those.  So, on average about $4.15 energy cost PER miner.  I'm fortunate my current average hash rate is right about 14.5.  I've have seen it spiked to 16 TH/s at times, but that is uncommon.  
I'm running those miners on a 110-120 PSU on a 20 amp circuit.  You have to check your breaker to ensure you have the proper amount of amp support.  It is recommend to keep your continuous power usage below 80%.  For example, one mine is about 13 amps on a 20 amp circuit.  So that's well below the 80% threshold.
I've read that if you can power with a 220v for 20% more power.  I could do that, but I am just trying to pay my electricity bill and support the bitcoin network.  
I've purchased my first bitcoin back in 2012 from the infamous MTGox.  So, I am ecstatic that I can finally make an impact in supporting this fantastic network and community.  Currently working on more projects to do what I can to get bitcoin to everyone and support the growth.    
Also, you should purchase you miners (if you go with Bitmain's S9) directly from them.  Their price usually fluctuates and is sold out, but if you have patience you can get yours too.  If you buy from others the price is either doubled or beware scam.  Feel free to message me, I'm 100% getting more miners on the network for support.  It's not about the gains but helping bitcoin get where it needs.

I’ve had them up for 4 days, and I am pulling in right now .017 BTC.  Minus $4.15 in electricity costs daily.

You can think Jack Dorsey for lightening network.

I would much rather purchase and drive a  boring Toyota any day you would ever see me in a Lexus. 
I prefer dependability before glamour.  
Also nobody needs to learn German or even find a German mechanic to repair a German manufactured automobile.  None of that doesn’t make sense.

That's exactly what I meant by that comment.   He was the biggest contributor to the project.  You can thank him for LN.

Germany didn’t stand up the wall - The USSR did.  
If you want more goverment control, I think you should reconsider how your ideologies are aligned with a decentralized currency.  
The point of Bitcoin is not for more government control and influence, it’s less 
Decentralize it baby.

If they are the same car manufacturers then why you paying extra?  
Your just getting ripped off. 
I be happy with a corolla any day and I’m not getting ripped for “luxury”

I bought at 13, 20, and 3k... still holding.  You can best believe my car isn’t better than his Toyota.

Welcome brother.  Don’t be like me and not hold from 2012.
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:50:30
Am I the only one here.... 
Who buys when it’s down 
And not up? 
Holding before hodl was a thing
