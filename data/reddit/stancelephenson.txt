I hold on Robinhood currently but if they don’t allow you to transfer coins to wallets in the next year I’ll probably be switching to Coinbase. Robinhood security seems top notch as they’ve never been hacked before.

Thank you, this is great advice!

Bitcoin is also a store of value and a growth asset like gold. If you have no interest in spending BTC directly then Robinhood is one of the better exchanges.

Robinhood is hiring Bitcoin developers to help them create wallets and allow users to withdraw coins. When it will happen, who knows. But I'm hopeful it happens soon because I only hold BTC on Robinhood currently.

I guess we'll see. Worst case I sell at the next peak and put some into a real wallet during the bear.

It can take up to a week for the funds to hit your bank account. By that point BTC could be at $20K and you lose half of your investment power. Not super likely but you never know. The fact that Robinhood lists on their app that they will have wallet transfers in the near future gives me hope.

They partner with this company who actually does the buying and selling. I don’t think Robinhood is stupid enough to run a gambling Ponzi scheme.

Same here and I’m too scared to sell and then the price rockets. Don’t have enough savings to just buy a bunch on another exchange
