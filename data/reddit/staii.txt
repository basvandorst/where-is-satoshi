I am not completely sure, but I think it was always there.

The 5% would be randomly selected after they publish the wallet addresses, so if they lied about the addresses they'll be caught in their lie (so this proves that within some probability they have all of the amount).

But then again, you could buy coins from the exchange instead of paying your electricity bill, and get those "fun new things".
Up until the part at "but because every day", I thought you would say you are supporting the network, which would make more sense (to me at least).

Can't this be done with contracts? I am not very familiar with the details, but it seems very similar to [this]( Here is what I imagine:
* Party A creates a transaction, locking 10 BTC to the Bitcoin Foundation, that requires "1 out of 2" signatures from Party A's or Party B's private keys. An expiry date is put on the transaction.
* Party B does the same.
* Both broadcast the transactions to the network.
Now, if the transactions goes bad, the offended party, say Party A, will sign Party B's transaction. In return, Party B will do the same.
If all goes well, the lockup expires, and both get their money back.
What do you guys think, can it work this way?
Edit: formatting.

I have no background in Economics, but doesn't this "deadweight loss" not consider the value that could be brought in the future by education, and only look at education as if it was a commodity to be sold?
What I am thinking is, when education is supported by taxes, some guy who could not afford it would be educated, and that guy would generate wealth for the community in the future. Does your view of the issue cover that case?

Yeah, but he needs to up with 43 bitcoins to repay his loan, he says he bought them at $80-$180, let's assume the mid-point price of $130, this means he came up with $5590 to buy bitcoins with.
How do you come up with $5590 as a student who has a student loan, in a matter of less than a couple of years?
Edit: When I said "I could no longer afford buying any", I mean, for the purpose of repaying my loan.

That's interesting, but doesn't really answer my question.
"Doesn't the deadweight loss not consider the value that could be brought in the future by education, and only look at education as if it was a commodity to be sold?"
I could learn a new trade or skill by working for free, but it would be much harder to learn, say, pharmaceutical research this way.
Assume I am in a nation that has not been saturated with college education graduates yet (that is, a nation unlike the Western Democracies).

You're new, but the Bitcoin community has seen this happen multiple times (someone runs away with BTCs). They didn't seem to think their business was worth more than the amount of BTC (and at the time, the BTC was even cheaper, in dollars).
@_date: 2013-08-21 19:44:41
I don't understand (really, I am probably stupid in this matter). If you are moving the fiat money at the end of the day (even in bulk), why can you be cheaper than Western Union?

Something along the lines of this TED talk by Dan Pink: 
The basic idea is, if what you are doing requires creativity (not just donkey work), you do better when you are working off intrinsic motivations. So, when there is a small monetary reward, instead of talking to your intrinsic motivation, the reward talks to your extrinsic motivation. And the reward is too small to move you.

Umm.. I'm pretty sure the link was there all along (and still is), under "very similar to this". But anyhow.
Yes, what the link describes requires a real person, but the link is describing just _ways_ to make contracts. It is not an exhaustive list. You can get creative and create new contracts (similar to what I described, for example, to exactly replicate the functionality of NashX without a third party).

Didn't someone once show that paying people small-ish amounts of money for OSS contributions actually makes them _less_ likely to contribute?

How will this work if the destination country doesn't have a strong Bitcoin market?
You send Bitcoins to India, the recipient goes to a local exchange, gets local currency for his Bitcoins. Overtime the local exchange has an abundance of Bitcoins and too little local currency, and has to transfer the local currency somehow ... and you're back to running a Western Union.
Correct me if I am missing anything, I am really wondering how this can work without a vivid Bitcoin market at the destination.

How do you see those as "bubbles"? Aren't bubbles when people suddenly value something at a much higher value than they're true value (and it bursts when people realize they've been wrong)?
The examples you provide, while interesting, are a case for "mispredicting the importance/impact of a technology". It might apply to Bitcoin too, but I don't see it answering OP's question.

Serious question here: if you had the money to buy 43 bitcoins at $80-$180 each, why did you have loans to start with?
I have a ~$50K non-study-related loan. I could only afford buying bitcoins when they were ~$4 each. I can now repay about 50% of the loan, but my point is, I could no longer afford buying any when they were in the hundreds of dollars: I would have needed an extra loan for that!

Read the link I provided about contracts, here it is again: 
When they release the money, it goes to the Bitcoin Foundation (or whomever they'd like to donate to), so they would want to hold on on releasing it until it expires, and they both get their coins back.

Because ASICMINER mined this block, and ASCIMINER shareholder are given dividends from ASICMINER's activities, including their mining.

The point is, you (the site owner) can still run away with the 1 BTC.

How is it "easy"? Please elaborate. To the best of my knowledge, you need to somehow split the network into two, and have each part see a different transaction.
