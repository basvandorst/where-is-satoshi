Two questions:  
1. Based on your "technical analysis," what is Bitcoin's actual value?    
2. Why is Bitcoin's market price less than its actual value?  
If you can come up with sensible answers to these questions, you will have an idea of what to do next.  
Actually, if anyone can answer these questions, I'd be interested.

Just to amplify on my point...
As I see it, Bitcoin potentially has the following values:  
1. As a store of value.  Like cash, you can count on it to by things when you need things, instead of having to keep all the things on hand all the time.  Except, Bitcoin is so volatile, thus far, it doesn't have much utility as a store of value. 
2. As a medium of exchange.  It is theoretically easier and more secure to use Bitcoin for certain exchanges than other mediums of exchange, such as cash.  Sending cash in a box to Japan for a smartphone is not practical.  But is Bitcoin really that much easier to use and more secure than other mediums of exchange, such as paypal, visa, etc.?  Is there really such a clamoring in the general population for an alternative to the current mediums of exchange?  
3. The aesthetic value of Bitcoin.  Just like there are a certain subset of people who enjoy Renoir's paintings and are willing to pay good $ for the pleasure of owning a Renoir, I suppose there are a certain number of people who enjoy the idea of owning an alternative form of currency that operates outside the normal banking system.  
4. The fun of thinking what if Bitcoin makes you fabulously wealthy.  It like when I put a few bucks down on a lottery ticket everyone in a while, because it is fun to daydream about quitting my job and eating my way around the world.
