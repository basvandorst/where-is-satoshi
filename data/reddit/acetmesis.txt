The tumbling server is trustless, yeah. [

Fees are necessary to prevent DoS and Sybil attacks: users must pay to participate in a tumble, raising the bar for attackers that disrupt the protocol by joining the cycle and then aborting. By default, this fee is set at 1% by the Tumbler. When the network fee of the 0.1 BTC is taken into account (0.00054900 BTC) the overall fee to the user becomes roughly 1.55%. 
The Tumblers are actually Masternodes, which can choose their own fee rather the default 1%, if they would prefer. However, the fee must be there, and it must be sufficient to deter attacks.
The TumbleBit whitepaper goes into a lot more detail: [

You're right to flag this as it brushes over the facts a little too broadly. A "blacklist" would be almost impossible to create and even if it could be created, it would be impractical to enforce: [this report on Bitcoin money laundering by Elliptic]( examines trends in movement of "well over half a million bitcoins that moved directly from illicit sources", the blacklist would grow to cover a large proportion of Bitcoin users very quickly. It's much easier to use blockchain analysis to identify the source of funds and suspend or block a user's account if they have incoming transactions from specific sources. This is what happens. Notably, Coinbase has been known to do this, per their [User Agreement]( (under 7.1 Suspension, Termination, and Cancellation).
That's not to say that such blacklists aren't being attempted: [ If they succeed, the list could be used by regulatory bodies to crack down on exchanges for money laundering (the above Elliptic report found that almost 50% of BTC originating from illicit sources goes *directly* to exchanges). The exchanges, in turn, may choose to go down the same route as Coinbase in that instance.
I'll think about editing the article to make this clearer. It was lazy to just use "blacklisted addresses", since it is misleading and only tells a fraction of the true story. Bitcoin is highly censorship resistant. Blockchain analysis *is* becoming more sophisticated, but a true blacklist will be hard to implement.

I feel like full disclosure is in order as I am invested in Stratis and so I'm in no way impartial. There's an FAQ with a bunch of info if anyone is interested though: [

C PoS implementation of the Bitcoin protocol - mostly based off NBitcoin by Dorier. But yeah, they're an altcoin.
However, they are building out services which are valuable for Bitcoin, such as the Breeze Privacy Protocol. That's an in-wallet implementation of TumbleBit and lets you Tumble your BTC using a wallet UI. So in that sense they are working to provide services of value for Bitcoin

Nopara actually worked on the Breeze wallet for a while, I think the difference in opinions was one of the reasons he moved to his own privacy solution, which is coinjoin in the end

Privacy solutions for BTC seem to be taking hold recently. Very excited to see what these solutions bring to the whole ecosystem. Thank you to everyone who works so hard for all of our sakes.
Definitely looking forward to playing around with the Breeze Wallet privacy protocol.

Yeah man, congrats also - read through your docs, really really informative
