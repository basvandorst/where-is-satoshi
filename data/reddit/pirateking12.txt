I’m not all that educated on it. I got into crypto I’m august but didn’t actually read up on it until September. Anyways that would be insane. It really shows how we are advancing as a race. Right now I think of crypto as a flip phone going to touch screen phones or dial up Internet to high speed WiFi. I can not wait until it is vastly adopted.

Honestly. Friends and family have asked me if I’m going to sell soon and my answer is always no. The day people realize crypto is the future isn’t too far.

I understand that. So since there is a limited amount the value is always increasing as more people buy? Or am I totally off?

I’m highschool when I heard about Silk Road. Never bought any though. Then again when I bought a fake ID a few years ago, still didn’t buy any. This summer I bought my gf a fake Id and looked more into bitcoin and I’m glad I finally got into it.

I’m definitely on board with that but 18k on 2k18 would be cool.

I read that I should have a control of my own keys with the hard fork coming in. I also read that I should get it out of coinbase before that happens

How do you know if a node is up 100%. I’m using the link you gave in breadwallet

How can you tell which one has 100% uptime?

That’s the plan. Currently I only own .02xxxx of bitcoin (idk if that’s the proper way of saying it) right now I’m limited to a paper wallet or one of those. Once I have enough money(next paycheck) I’ll buy a hardwallet. I just need a place to store until then.

Gotcha. I just read up more and am planning on transferring to Bread wallet. Is that a smart move?

Hey I’m new to this. I’m a noob using coinbase. What do you mean move it? What are some better wallets I can move it to. And what do you mean before it’s too late? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:47:12
What do you mean by this. I’m new and own some on coinbase. Any advice?
