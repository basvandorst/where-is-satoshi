People repeat that there are 1000 times more profit to do runnning a Darkmarket than closing it but that is false. If we were talking about a regular businness where risk can be managed with several tools then that is true, but we are talking of people that are risking 20-30 years of his lifetime in prision if captured, so that is a gigantic factor that you have to weight when you decide beetween : closing the shop, getting a few million dollar right now and eliminating or reducing the risk of incarceration; or getting those same millions but in much smaller quantities and in much more long term and spending money and resources in managing the risks. 
One example is sheep, the other is SR2 that was emptied by the admins and then converted in front shop for the same admins to do exit scams, and very soon you will see it in action again when Agora,BlueSky or Pandora are closed. 
The libertarian view that guys creating darkmarket will behave as nice players because "free market" is a fantasy. The truth is that the more time a market is alive the bigger the risk that will be "hacked" or "confiscated" so the incentives to just run away just get bigger and bigger (together with the amount of BTC in the wallets). 
The solution for this is Multi Sig marketplaces but none of the ones that use it are more than a curiosity for hardcore fans of this stuff. 
There is an answer for why the biggest markets dont use the solution that will not allow them to run with the user and vendors funds, can you guess it?

No, and that is why gold dont have a market cap, neither bitcoin. Companies on the other side do have it.

Really, I think at 24 you should be mature enough to not refer to reality as if it was based in a chessy scifi movie, but what I know, I dont have any disposable income to buy Bitcoin so I guess I must be an stupid statist or something like that.

He didn't answer logically because he is not having a rational conversation, his posts are like a commercial or a pitch sales for a product, and it appeals more for emotions that for rational thoughts. You trying to show him the fallacies of his argument is like trying to argue using logic with a used car salesman.

The part where he  don't name facts or past cases of success. Why dont he name one verified case where a open source distributed ledger has benefited any poor community, or at least anything similar that is based on reality and not only on hypothetical stuff that has not happened yet.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:04:57
Im with you man. The circlejerk has made this sub a fan fiction hub more than anything, the irony is that they call it "analysis". Keep it up.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:57:16
I think you dont get it. His intention was not to shout it from the rooftops (he has a throwaway account) , his objective was to incentive other people to give too.

You also have to realize that one of the big benefits of WU is that they have a vast group of offices in countries where infrastructure is not provided by the state, I live in Colombia and there are like 5 guys selling BTC in my country (only in the big cities) but the national companies that work with WU had hundreds of offices in even the smallest town. In that office the most ignorant person can go and only with his ID get cash back sent form any place from the world. Now you want  this person that has not gone to any school and lives with like 100 usd a month to buy a technological device, learn to use it (without any formal education), then learn how bitcoin works, and learn enough from it so they dont get stolen or he get scammed with a dishonest OTC seller. People need to understand that more than half of the world dont live like in your precious societies, here "the people", is uneducated and exploited by physical force , and for some here to believe that by hoarding a digital commodity are doing a big favor to humanity just make me kind of mad and sad.

@_date: 2013-12-24 16:15:39
I donwvoted not because solving that problem is "futuristic fluff", but because your post is nothing more than more of the same wishful thinking that plagues this subreddit. Now and never has been Bitcoin, the money of the people, it has been not more than the money of a very minuscule group of technology enthusiasts composed almost of young men from first world countries. I live in a third world country and let me tell you that "the people" (as in poor) in my country don't know, and don't need to know what Bitcoin is, what they need is to get a dignified job and to not get killed in the streets (stuff that your country has and that maybe you think is normal in all the world) but will be a very long time before they get that, and it will no be thanks to bitcoin.

This is not an "analysis", is wishful thinking at his best.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:01:46
So your case of success is a  project that a guy has to make reality some day, but that right now has gave ZERO benefits to "the people". 
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:00:18
I cannot say that about the internet. The "Internet" has been an invention that has benefited the humanity in many ways. Real analysis use real proved facts to relate facts and make new hypothesis, that is why this is wishful thinking at his best.

In the real world they dont. In the fairy world of our analysts they will be doing very soon because..... yes.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:23:20
You don't refute my claim that your "analysis" is not supported by any data or fact from the real world. You only tell a very nice story of how things must be in the future according to the limited understanding you have of the world and his many aspects (financial, social, political). You are not doing a favor to the humanity pumping BTC, is people like doctors and social workers that go to Africa or slums that are doing it, those are the ones that think in "the people", hell even Seans outpost is doing real stuff and he is doing it the same old way, buying stuff and shelter for those that don't have it (buying it with fiat). So please get off your high horse for a minute and understand that not because we don't cheer you up we are ignorant or we are not trying to understand BTC and the world a little better.
