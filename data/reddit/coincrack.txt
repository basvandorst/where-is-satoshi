Blacklisted by who?

Looks like they "forgot" to put our ad up... well...  50% off all bitcoin orders today only on CoinCrack!

We've had loads of fraudulent chargebacks at CoinCrack.  We even screenshot profiles before and after followers are delivered and still, PayPal replies with:
"The credit card issuer decided the chargeback in the buyer's favor as the buyer met the card issuer's requirements."
I bet they would side with us (their real customer in the transaction) if it weren't for the CC company.

Always love to see happy customers =)
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:47:34
Oh wow thats lame - our customers love us and are extremely happy with our services.

Every 40 days YouTube adjusts their algorithm and blocks videos it believes violate there terms.  Unfortunately, that's what happened with you.
We work with customers every day to ensure they're happy with our service - and often times refund there BTC.  We would have happily done so for you if you would have brought the problem directly to us. But since you decided to publicly bash us instead...

Thanks for putting up our ad =)
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:27:08
Yeah I should have tried that

We'll contribute 100+ (fake) retweets to every tweet that uses the hashtag

We've been offering 5% off BTC purchases for over a year and I've never heard one customer say anything about it.  I doubt your average consumer will "figure out" Bitcoin to save 5%

We should create a list of places on Foursquare - they have a robust API and are primed for stuff like this.

Which ad networks do you use? Which have the best quality? Anything else you've learned about the ad side of things?
As an advertiser, we struggle to get quality traffic from any of the ad networks. Any tips?
Have you considered running affiliate ads? If so, shameless plug =}

In the currency of your preference...  Just replace the USD with whatever currency symbol you want.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:12:49
As an advertiser, we've never had any success with it though.
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:57:50
We definitely need more affiliate programs in the Bitcoin space.
For example, incentives is the sole reason people signup for and promote credit card offers.

We have a similar idea at coincrack.com, but based on our experience over the past few months people talk a big game but don't actually want to spend their bitcoin.
There's too much money to be made on trading BTC at this point.

One popular reason I've seen people buy them is for their company blog.  Buying retweets boosts the number thats displayed alongside the tweet button on your blog post.

Only thing I can think of is putting you in touch with some of our customers, but I can't for privacy reasons.  If there was something I could add to the site to make you feel more comfortable LMK.  Im sure other potential customers have the same skepticism and anything we can do to ensure our legitimacy would be a win.

Sup Reddit!  Been noodling around this idea of selling cool shit for Bitcoin.  Finally got around to building it.  If people like it, we'll start launching more products.
We partnered with a company that delivers Twitter followers.  It's pretty incredible actually.
Give it a shot.  Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:01:40
We're super legit =) I work for CoinCrack I'm happy to answer any questions!
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:28:51
Nope.  It looks like that every single day at this time.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:39:37
The best is buying thousands of followers for someone.  They start freaking out trying to figure out why they're popular all of the sudden =)
We use Coinbase for bitcoin processing.  Banking on them adding Litecoin in the future.  Fingers crossed.
