The value of a public ledger is so that everyone knows that person x didn't spend his bitcoins twice.  The value of the public ledger is not that tax authorities get instant and warrant-free access to everyone's financial dealings.  I do not see how conducting some transactions off of the blockchain undermines the security of the blockchain--in the end, the blockchain will remain as the ultimate authority of who controls which bitcoins.  There are clearly risks of transacting off the blockchain, but there are also clearly benefits.

It depends entirely upon what that 100BTC means to you.  Is it essentially your entire net worth, or is it play money with which you can speculate?  Are you an accredited investor?
I think it is wise to have the majority of your long term investments in some kind of diversified portfolio.  The late Harry Browne advocated what he calls the "permanent portfolio" and I think he's got a pretty good plan.  You can read a summary of it on wikipedia:  
Of course, if you are young and have high earning power, you may find that 200BTC doesn't actually represent that much of your net worth when you consider the present value of your future earnings, and thus may consider more speculative investments.
Beware anyone telling you to buy at a predictable low and sell at a predictable high.  There is just no such thing.

I think there is plenty of room for a market with lower fees, the question is whether it is easy to use, the general public will consider it trustworthy (which is not quite the same thing as it actually being trustworthy) and finally, whether there is sufficient interest to generate a network effect.

purse.io has you covered for this.

I imagine someone will come up with a tool to allow ebay and amazon sellers to automatially post their current listings to open bazzar.  The prices could be adjusted dynamically to split the fee savings between the seller and the buyer, meaning buyer gets lower price and seller gets higher price.  I find it hard to imaging many sellers refusing to participate in this, and I find it hard to imagine any buyers not preferentially using this platform.  On that basis, I predict very rapid growth.  Sellers won't leave amazon and ebay, but they'll list their stuff on openbazzar, and when buyers find out all the stuff they want to buy is cheaper on openbazzar, they'll come running.

When I needed to buy several thousand dollars of bitcoin for the Augur Rep sale, I used localbitcoins and sent someone in China a Western Union transfer.  There may be higher fees to send from Panama, but it is a really easy way.

I think it is pretty clear that the technology for something like this is suboptimal.  The various available solutions are rather technical or require some elements of trust in third parties.  I point this out only to point out that there is a real opening here for someone to create a better solution.  Cryptocurrencies could really represent the next wave in estate planning.  An excellent way to avoid estate taxes.

Soon, the process will be improved with Augur.  I think the next five years will bring tremendous disruption to the global gambling markets!

I had a couple of orders on purse frozen for suspected fraud.  It was because I was using a prepaid credit card.  It took almost two weeks to clear everything up and get my account back in good standing, but it did happen.  Never discussed with customer support that I was using purse, but I'd be very surprised if Amazon has a problem with it.
