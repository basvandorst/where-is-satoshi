@_date: 2014-05-20 18:51:55
We appreciate you showing us bitcoin was below Visa/Mastercard. We fixed this issue, and have put Bitcoin above Mastercard/Visa which we prefer payments in bitcoin rather than the traditional credit cards. Thank you  again for your valuable feedback to us in helping us promote bitcoin globally and online!

Yes, and they also own the insurance companies. So they own "Pearle Vision, Lens Crafters, all the brands" 
Here is an interesting video on the CEO talking 
Thanks for input. I think a lot of people don't realize it tho
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:50:23
Im sorry don't understand? Were going to try to spread the word, as more people need to accept it. Dish gave great exposure, we just want to give as much as we can in our industry, and thru as many channels

Selling eyewear online? I am not saying I want traffic, but wanted some love from the people. We have a lot of customers, we're not looking to market on here. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:57:43
Thank you very much! We hope that you support bitcoin and encourage other merchants to do so online. We are trying to spread the word. Advantages are so high, and this method of transacting payments is just what the world should be like. Masoneyewear.com i just a small fish in a large pond of users we need to have to make this currency evolve like email. Moreover , this will also increase the value of bitcoin due to the limited supply of this crypto-currency.
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:13:06
don't worry, i won't let your rant get in the way of mine, fulminate away good sir.
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:08:59
We're using Go-coin to make these transactions happen.  Thank you for the comment. We hope you have a nice day.

So you are going to attack me negatively because I adopted bitcoin, dogecoin, and litecoin? Anyone doing that?
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:11:06
We have  our Miami showroom which we encourage the customer to check out on our website via bitcoin.  We also try and educate them on how bitcoin works, and for each patient that comes in the door (because' were a doctors office here, Dr Chrycy) - we tell them about bitcoin and the benefits. 
Not everyone is comfortable with paying with it, but we want to spread the word out there to the baby boomers, and older generations.  We think that we may be able to do that in a small portion. If everyone did that, bitcoin would be adopted globally tomorrow (given the green light by all governments of course)
