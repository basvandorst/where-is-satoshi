"It may take a week or more for us to reply."
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. At least you are open and honest about how miserable your support is. Go screw.

In the general case: online wallets are a crap idea and steal control away from the user.
In the specific case: Coinbase takes your personal data, sells it off, hands it to the IRS and gives them the impression every time you take coins out of their system you're "selling" it (what the fuck), and on top of that has been known to freeze or steal vast sums of people's money without any kind of explanation.
Their customer service has always been crap but it's also simply **opaque** - half the time if something goes wrong, it will be days or weeks until you can get them to tell you what's going on, even if a lot of your money is on lockdown.

Yeah, they love to screw them.

I guess this is a good idea if people want to proffer their anuses to Coinbase for a fresh screwing, but I'm not interested.

As usual, Coinbase is utter garbage. Hands down the worst service I've ever experienced in any business ever, not just Bitcoin related stuff. Anybody who doesn't like losing their money (and apparently, now, risking IRS fraud) should steer clear of them.
Can't wait until they go out of business. They've been pulling nonsense like this for years now.

I resent traders being put in square quotes. There's nothing wrong with trading btc like a stock.

Wikipedia and Mozilla are garbage companies for a variety of reasons. They don't deserve my fiat cash, much less my coins.

Who would have thought that something named "darknetmarkets" was shady!

That's the unfortunate state of things. Right now you get to choose between:
1) card transactions + other luxuries
2) not being treated like garbage, having your personal data mined, getting in trouble with the IRS because you swapped coins between your own wallets, etc.
The reason for this is largely because of how the credit card companies work. You may not know this, but credit card corporations are a monopoly - there are maybe five or six big ones, and they regularly collaborate and are largely all the collective bitch of the same people. 
When you work with credit cards, you become beholden to these people. Why do you think CB is selling out so hard / has always been garbage?

Wew lad. 2 da moon. I don't believe this, but wouldn't that be nice?

I've always told my friends never to use Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-12-07 20:36:11
Use a real exchange, dude.
@_date: 2016-12-07 20:13:26
Whatever. Circle was sending little messages to people, inquiries demanding to know what this and that btc transaction were for. They're just as scummy as Coinbase if you ask me.

Psychopaths tend to be the ones who gain the most power in any system. Example: Reddit mods.
