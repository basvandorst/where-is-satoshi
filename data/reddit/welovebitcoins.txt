So nice to see this charity doing well. I think it's well deserved, for being a pioneer in this field accepting Bitcoins.

Yea, I saw the ones in Hollywood several days ago now and finally found the source!

I am sorry you don't like my username and yes I am new to posting here. I have been reading reddit for awhile, I just never posted. Today, with the news in China, I was feeling pretty depressed to be honest. I saw this and it cheered me up. It made me think that there is enough of a bitcoin community to survive the bad news. So please, stop attacking my post and making false accusations. I am sure someone from LA will confirm this and post a picture as well.

Thank you for your post. I think its pretty cool that you sent this, because as you know, I am new here and people thought I was some sort of faker. I am very interested in Bitcoin and seeing it succeed. A lot of us want to see it shown in a good light but From what I can tell, there are a few people trying to put down BTC here and so I do not blame you one bit for thinking I was shady and for trying to call me out.

There are quite a few posts now on this, but here is one

Your title made me think of another great way to use Bitcoins. Vending Machines! The company selling the products could have a QR code on the machine, and you just scan it with your smart phone. No more need to carry around worthless, dirty change in your pocket! ;)

I know you didn't photoshop this because I saw two billboards in Hollywood also. See my post.

I'm sorry but this is def not Photoshop. I really did see this today and I invite anyone in LA to go to either of these two locations and see for themselves. But I think its obvious its not fake. You can see the ripples in the material for instance..

This would be super cool if Honda accepted your idea. I have never worked in the auto sales industry so I am not one to give any good advice, but usually if you can prove the demand is there, big companies like this will try to cater to it if it would mean an increase in sales. That is probably obvious, but just saying. This is awesome and good luck- let us know what happens!

I thought about this also. Do you know what website/company it was that tried to do this and failed? If they set it up so the bidding was in fiat and paid in BTC that might work. I really have come to dispise eBay and would rather rather barter on a BTC friendly site.

I like the comment at the end of this article:  
"If a person were ro reference USD currency would they say, for example "Dollar isn't worth as much today" or "The dollar isnt worth as much today?" Seems correct to have the word 'The'." 
I think its because on the website they are refering to it as a currency, so its the currency itself- like, the franc, the pound, the euro.. etc. They dont say "the bitcoin" everytime on the website so I think its just how it is being used in the sentence.

There are 30 billboards in LA, and per the website 12 million is the estimated reach. There photos/videos and a list of locations are on their website:
Very similar to this. I think this is ALL awesome! The more bitcoin promotion/publicity- the better!

Good point! Maybe they could stick a clear enclosure over it so that at least it would be obvious if people were trying to cheat with a QR sticker over it.

This is really sad to me. I had been a windows user for years and finally changed over to Apple in mid 2000s, have the iPhone and everything. Luckily, I had downloaded the Coinbase app right before they banned it, and currently it is still working. But I am afraid that once I do any major update it wont work any longer. I am STRONGLY considering switching to an android smart phone. Apple is going to lose a lot of customers if it keeps this up.
