I want 10, don't have it yet, but might. I have some and don't know if I should sell or not and buy when it goes 
back down. 
I love the idea of bitcoin and all the things you can do with it and it's potential. So I will always keep at least 1, but those other ones; to buy or not to buy. Doubt I'd ever go past 10 though I like that number maybe 11 just maybe but never more for me.

That feeling sucks man, I know it to well FOMO is a disease, we need a FOMO anonymous group. Like literally It's when you finally feel good to go in it has to drop. I learned my lesson. Buy when prices are stable for a while, never when volatile. Emotion takes over during those times. It's like penny stocks people see a price go up, jump in and then watch it plummet shortly after. The difference with bitcoin vs penny stocks though is that bitcoin has truly amazing technology behind it and I have not doubt that prices will eventually soar even if not right away. So you'll be happy to have gotten as many as you can now. 498 will be a bargain in the future. I think I will set my account to buy a certain amount every month from now on too.

Ya but your also locked in at that price even if it tanks far below whatever you bought it at. The 5 day thing is ridiculous. They really need to get on bitcoins level when it comes to money transferring(The banks I mean)

Oh perfect I have an idea and was wondering why you guys might not have it. Is it possible to implement stop-loss orders and possibly trailing stop loss orders on your exchange?

I would love to know how to write programs.
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:40:34
Why are there so many at .031111111 and .0155555555 all with a penny difference in between them? Is that some sort of market manipulation? Not only that there all placed instantly. What program can you use to do that?

I see two charts which basically say... It could go up oorrr it could go down. Anyone could predict that.

Localbitcoins is a good spot, I buy bitcoin for Neteller and Skrill on there, although in person is always the best. If you're interested just let me know.

Ya, but you have a $200 buy limit for instant buys which only goes up to $1000 max. Definitely not helpful if you're looking to buy right now and several thousand dollars worth.
