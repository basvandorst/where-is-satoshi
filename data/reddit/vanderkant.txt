Move your coins to a new address/wallet before claiming the fork coins with the privkey of your old address and you're safe. As simple as that.
@_date: 2019-10-05 23:48:39
Export your privkey, get another wallet/app, and import it there. Try Guarda Wallet, it's reliable and easy to use.

Stupid idea to buy $10 worth of BTC. You'll only get "dust" in your wallet, and you won't even be able to send/spend/cash out half of it due to fees.

Other than harassing them on Twitter ([ and filing a legal complaint, I'm not sure what you can do.
The HitBTC team is anonymous, so virtually untouchable.

Buy on Coinbase or Kraken, then withdraw (=send) the BTC to the recipient's address, done.

LN is crap and nobody uses it. It will never be a global financial settlement layer.

Dude, just give up on  Bitcoin Core, and get a light wallet. Otherwise you're going for 260GB of data to sync.

My pleasure. This is a well-known and useful tool, keep a local copy, can always come in handy ;)
@_date: 2019-12-11 06:04:53
Sure, joke aside, you have the right to be a novice ;)
You can't mine Bitcoin anymore on a computer. There is specialized hardware to do so (i.e. ASICs), but as a casual miner it's not worth it, unless you have free electricity, and even in this case you really won't make much and will probably not ROI your rig.
So, what you can actually mine on a computer are PoW altcoins, otherwise known as shitcoins. You can see a list here: [ Note that some altcoins cannot be profitably mined without specialized hardware too (because there are ASICs available for their algo, for instance Zcash, Bitcoin Cash...).
Other altcoins can be mined with a GPU (Ravencoin, Bitcoin Gold, Ycash...), some with a CPU (Monero, Vericoin...), but in any case you'll have to be a minimum tech-savvy to do it. And chances are low that you will be able to be profitable at all anyway, especially if your electricity is not cheap (&lt;0.05$/KwH)
I'd suggest you to take the time to get yourself familiarized with crypto in general, and mining in particular, before you jump in.
And stay away from cloud mining offers! They are all scams.

I guess they call it "warm" because it's more secure than a regular hot wallet, since they use HSM and a strict withdrawal policy ruleset.
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:55:33
New ASICs delivering higher hashrate being turned on is one of the main reason of the difficulty climbing these last months IMO.

This is a game changer. I'm buying Bitcoin at $10,000 a piece right now.
@_date: 2019-09-24 04:38:50
It is common knowledge that Bitcoin Layer 1 can't act as a currency in its current state. 7 tx/sec is not enough, among other things. Bitcoin can be a "store-of-value" and a speculation tool but for now that's about it.
Some people promote Layer 2 (like Lightning) but it has failed to deliver on its promises until now. Not to mention Layer 2 completely defeat the very purpose of blockchain (decentralized, no third-parties, etc.).
So def more like a commodity for now.
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:53:37
Lol wait until you get hacked or you make a mistake while sending a tx. There will be no bank to credit you back.
@_date: 2019-09-23 04:44:57
In this case your exchange needs to initate the transfer, which apparently they have not done yet. Reach their support.
Btw you paid a withdrawal fee, not a tx fee.
@_date: 2019-09-09 05:36:29
Electrum has been targeted by a lot of phishing websites / malicious wallets over time. You probably landed on a fake website and downloaded an infected wallet.
Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:28:27
Yeah not easy to be safe in this space... You need to be paranoid. Double/cross-check everything. Read a lot about how to protect your funds and then apply multiple/best security practices.
This starts with being extra cautious when interacting with critical piece of software/security like wallets/privkeys/recovery phrases.
If you're looking for long-term storage then :
* Choose your wallet / keys generator wisely ; trust only the oldest names in town, make deep researchs / look for reviews / info before using any, and make sure to land on the legit website when you have made your choice.
* Generate your wallet/keys on a clean, air-gapped / never-connected-to-the-internet-before computer. Never do it online. Never do it on a website.
* Store your privkeys/recovery phrases in \*multiple\* and \*secured\* places, either electronic (such as in a strongly encrypted device/file) or physical (safebox...). I personaly prefer encrypted electronic backup over physical backup, even though I guess much people would disagree with that.
* Alternatively you can buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger -- but in the end you'll still have to store your recovery phrase in multiple secured places if you want your funds to be safe.

Why do you bother downloading Bitcoin Core...? If you need a wallet, just go for a light one, you'll be set up in seconds and will not have to store and process 250 GB of data.
