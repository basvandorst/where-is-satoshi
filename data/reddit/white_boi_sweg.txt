Do you think Etherium isn’t a good buy? I bought at $398 and sold it for Bitcoin too (at a slight loss unfortunately) and now it’s looking pretty good IMO. Wish I would’ve held onto it

That’s good advice, I wouldn’t get into Etherium again at this point either. With this recent Bitcoin drop I’m hoping it hits 12k again at least briefly

Awesome, now if I only had more than .1696969 coins...

Do bitcoins act like a liquid if you dive into them?

Hey OP nice phone, I for one like seeing these “thanks bitcoin” posts.

No shit, I go to Comfort Dental (there’s more than one), thanks for this info OP 20% off is something I might let some coin go for

I used to use bitcoin to buy stuff back when it was around $150-250 a coin. Never once thought I’d get rich, just wanted to buy stuff online. Probably should’ve thought about the money more and held some lol. Anyways I didn’t care about learning the technology but I did care about using it for its purpose if that counts

Not that he’s not being a dick, but he’s talking about the background I think

The fact that BTC is relatively anonymous is part of the technology, yes I made use of that part as well. Don’t worry, I just bought some grilled cheeses

As a pizza driver I’d be happy to accept btc as a tip, good work op

I always wondered how much bitcoin is locked behind wallets people lost the keys to or forget about. There’s a lot of unuseable and forgotten coin out there
