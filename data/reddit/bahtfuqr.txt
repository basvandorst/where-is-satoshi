Because when I get paid $100 I have $100 to spend today.. Tomorrow etc.. 
If I buy $100 bitcoin,  tomorrow I may only have $50 to spend. 
Simple. 
Sure I may have $200 bitcoin to spend tomorrow,  but there is too much uncertainty about it's price and rapid fluctuations at the moment. 
Personally bitcoin for me into buy and hold in the hope that one day.  It'll be worth a shipload... Then sell for real money.
