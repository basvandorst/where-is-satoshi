lol dude you history is full of this crap. I'm not even going to bother.

There is a damn near infinite supply of immigrants, and you think they give half a fuck about what the government is doing here? It's already an upgrade for them.

Nope, they’ll just import more immigrants.

lmao enough with the sanctimonious garbage. I'm well aware no species lasts forever, but humans are not nearly to that point and we're not going to stop reproducing because the government sucks.


what a stupid way to misrepresent what I said. I have no problem with immigrants.


The topic of the post is about the US attorney general so pardon my adherence to the topic at hand.


Yes you're so much smarter and wiser than normal humans. Truly you're enlightened beyond your years. I know at age 14 you think you have it all figured out, but someday (hopefully) you'll look back and realize what a pretentious idiot douche you sounded like.

This is bordering on parody. Wow.

You didn't respond either, past "Try reading it again hurr durr." If your goal is the complete worldwide stoppage of reproduction, that's both unrealistic and a literal death sentence for our species.
Furthermore, everyone wants to live in the United States. Like I've said *twice* already is that the government here will continue importing people from everywhere else to maintain their tax cattle population. The people imported will see a quality of life improvement and will not care what bogus goes on behind the scenes here.
