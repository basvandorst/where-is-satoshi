So what happens when after an operation you end up with less than a satoshi? You just ignore it, right? Because nobody cares about a satoshi lost here and there, just like nobody cares about a penny lost here and there. But remember not to operate it further or you can propagate the error and create a real mess. That's a valid approach if you are just starting out. But when you get serious and don't want to make accountants and investors nervous, you need to learn the real deal: use a Math library.

Cold storage is not "also know as" paper wallet (an offline machine is also cold storage), and is definitely *not* the most secure way to store bitcoin. As I have already told you, multi-signature is safer. But at this point it seems like you are not willing to change your mind. You just wanted us to tell you "yeah, paper wallets are 100% secure even if your granny created them, so ETFs are useless". I'm done here, bye.

Except they are not integers, they are decimals. You can stop with that dumb argument now, you know. Using integers is just a hack you use because you either don't know about Math libraries, or you wrongly believe you are gaining something from not using them.


Do you have any evidence that they are actually professionals, and not 12 y/o like you? Some of them didn't even know what I meant by "Math library", so clearly they have never even used one.

Oh! Got it and I agree, sorry. It's just that I had to reply to lots of trollish comments telling me I don't deserve to have something that goes up in value. They don't realize that already happens with tons of other things, like land, that are more accessible to the rich (so apparently only the rich deserve to get a cut of the global economic growth). But anyone, even the poor, can get fractions of a Bitcoin.

Without an economic incentive for the miners there is no security for the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:00:47
You are comparing apples to oranges, because the wealth you can earn by spending your money into producing something is a lot more (the sky is the limit) than what you can earn by doing nothing (the global economic growth, which is what, 1%? Wikipedia says 3% for 2012, but keep in mind we are living in an inflationary money, consumerist world, not a sound money world).
If you already own enough wealth that 1% yearly is enough for you to live, then by all means do it. But you could also spend 1% of it every year and live 100 years. By the way, by not spending your wealth you are doing two things: keeping the price up for others, and also taking the risk of never spending it (eg: the economy dying, you dying, etc.)

You keep saying that a paper wallet is safe, but that's not an universal truth. It depends on who created it, and you will also need to secure it physically. Besides, it's not even the safest way: multi-signature is safer, and that's probably what the ETF will use.

The US government took millions of USD from Gox by force (for not having a license or whatever), not hacking, so the guy apparently decided to run a fractional reserve scheme a few years in hopes of recovering. At some point there was a "bank run", Gox didn't have enough coins, and Mark started fearing jail so he declared bankruptcy to protect himself and whatever was left of the company assets.
People here prefer to have a concrete, physical person (or a caricaturized version of it) to hate, so they hate Mark and not the US government.

Bitcoin's blockchain can be used for smart contracts. In fact, when you own bitcoins, that's actually just a very simple contract, whose only requirement is that you sign it with your private key. People are trying to use their own blockchain for dumb purposes like storage or messaging, but I doubt something will come out of that. In most cases they are just trying to scam people and take their bitcoins in exchange for vaporware and promises of wealth.
Some people are even trying to separate the blockchain from the currency. But those people don't understand that Bitcoin's security comes from the economic incentives that miners have. Without giving miners something of value in return for their hashing power, the total hashing power of the network will be too low and that will make it too insecure for anything useful.

Also, what does the 600k missing have to do with PHP? If you seriously believe that one particular language or another can make you magically lose money, you are no programmer. Don't you know the US seized about 2 million USD from them? They also got into trouble with scumbag Coinlab who sued them. Since then, the poor guy has been running a fractional reserve scheme, trying to somehow recover the "lost" coins. A few years later he decided enough was enough, so he just filed for bankruptcy.

Other active trolls are:

- witcoins
- FearManifesto
There are more, lots of them come from r/Dogecoin because they don't know how to make their copycoin grow any more, so they just troll and spam all the other coin's subreddits in hopes that they will benefit economically somehow from that. They have even coordinated some submissions + upvotes/downvotes to send FUD to the front page of r/Bitcoin. And [here]( you have them coordinating a pump and dump scheme on IRC.

lol? A Math library is not a "framework", and it's certainly not "startupy". It's one of the most basic things programming languages add to their tool set.


If only ever general purpose programming language had a battle tested Math library specifically designed for such use case... Oh wait!


Which language do you use that doesn't have a Math library for dealing with floats? Please enlighten me.
And btw, it doesn't seem like you know what "low level" means. If you are using an abstraction like a Math library to deal with floats as if they were... floats (crazy huh?), that's high level. If you are converting them back and forth to integer and other unnecessary stuff just to make your machine (who only understands binary) work, that's low level.

You got it all wrong. First of all, Bitcoin is PoW. You are talking about PoS.
And second, PoS is not cryptographically secure. Ask any serious cryptographer who has studied the subject. No, Nxt pump and dumpers don't count as serious cryptographers. Nxt and similar coins are secured by keeping them centralized in various ways, like frequent changes to the protocol that are accepted blindly (Nxt) and checkpoints (Peercoin), which is the opposite we want in a currency. If you like those coins you might as well just use e-gold or whatever. Oh wait, it got shut down because it was centralized. But I'm sure this time will be different! (lol)

@_date: 2014-11-25 05:18:54


My bottle caps scheme has never been successfully attacked. Does that make it a secure decentralized system?


Because it's centralized through whack-a-mole style patching and unnecessary complexity. If the design is flawed, adding shit to the implementation won't make it secure. If development stops, eventually hackers will catch up and fuck it up. And if the whack-a-mole game never ends, then it's centralized and can be easily killed by attacking the developers themselves.


So why are you here? Just trollin' ?


If you knew anything about crypto, you would know that there is no "mathematical proof" for Bitcoin's design either. It's a practical solution, it just works.


So you demand "successful" attacks, but then argument about a theoretical "vulnerability". Pumpers gonna pump I guess.

@_date: 2014-09-28 18:33:04
You are confusing monetary inflation with price inflation. Bitcoin is up in price 380% since last year which means it's a deflationary currency (goes up in value, prices nominated in this currency go down), even with the monetary inflation it has had. What matters is supply vs demand.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:27:23

You are mixing up "representing financial data with floats in the problem's domain" with "representing financial data with floats in the machine's domain".
The former is definitely a best practice since that's how we deal with it in the real world, but you don't seem to get it. You are still too close to the machine.

That's what these libraries for dealing with float operations are called like. And we are talking about float numbers. Turning them into discrete (integer) numbers is just a hack.

Yes, they claimed the coin was open source, but then it turned out the "innovative" part (whose design was already proven to be flawed, because they weakened CoinJoin instead of using the original one) was closed source. They said they didn't want others to start cloning it before it had taken over the market, and promised to eventually open source it. Dumb money still flowed in as usual. On top of that it was insta-mined mostly by its founders due to a bug that they decided to exploit instead of fixing it.

Tell them about these facts:
- Private money has always been a thing. Only recently central banks took over and brainwashed everyone into believing they are the only ones with the divine right of printing money. They also created laws against that because they know people in their right minds would never choose government money over private money.
- Money and wealth are two different things. The value of money is given by the people. To say "you can't create money, you have to work for it" makes no sense. Anyone can create money. What's hard to create is wealth. Money can be used to trade and store wealth.
- Bitcoin's creator solved a really hard problem of the Cryptography science (the exact science of encoding messages):  .  This started a revolution because distributed autonomous organizations are now possible. Bitcoin is the first DAO, and the first decentralized digital currency, that's what makes it special.
But this is only useful to educate normal people that are temporarily ignorant or brainwashed. Don't bother arguing with trolls or morons like bullco.

That's retarded. As much as I would like Bitcoin development to be decentralized, it's not: There are core developers with certain permissions on the repository, and then you have contributors, with no permissions at all, because anyone can be a contributor.
Sure, anyone could fork it and create his own thing. But that doesn't make it decentralized.
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:25:12
Why not mine [Monero]( then? 
It's CPU-only and is based on the [Cryptonote]( technology which gives it more anonymity than Darkcoin by using ring signatures, and is not a Bitcoin clone but a full rewrite, and of course uses the blockchain technology.

Ever heard of multi-signature? Why put a lot of trust on Coinbase, when you could be putting a little trust in Bitgo, Bitalo or GreenAddress? They are not perfect yet, but they are definitely better options. Heck, even Blockchain.info (no multi-signature) is better than Coinbase, because they encrypt your data client-side.

Why not Armory or Electrum with cold storage? How are they not handy? Once a week or month you move some coins from cold storage to your hot wallet. Just create a transaction, move wit a USB pendrive to the offline machine to sign it, back to the online machine and you are done for the week or month.
It's pretty comfortable, considering we are in such an early stage.
Sorry for your loss. You should get over it and start again IMO, this time doing it right.
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:18:02
Yeah I agree. I'm just saying unless you have a very specific reason to do different, you should use a Math library and not try to solve something that has already been solved and abstracted away ages ago. I for one wouldn't rely on my programmers knowing the inner workings of the machine.

I didn't think this comic was pro doge. I read it as doge is going "to the moon" because of how hard Bitcoin is going to kick its ass. Can also be read as Bitcoin kind of respects the top coins, but doge turned out to be too retarded so it got kicked out.

Don't listen to the ones blaming you, keeping your coins safe is hard at the moment unless you are a security expert.
For more security you should use cold storage with Electrum or Armory. Use that as a savings account.
If you want something similar to Tor but less likely to get man-in-the-middled you can use a VPN.

That criticism about PoW is right, but it's still the best option we have. I'm sure improvements will be made over time. There is a cryptographer working on PoS who plans on using tamper-evident logs. Not sure how that fixes the issue but it looks like serious business. Unfortunately he steered away from his original idea of working with Bitcoin. He now wants to create his own coin. The good news is he plans to use a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain and start from there his own fork. This the coins you own today in Bitcoin you will also own them there.

There is a difference between using ~1% of your wealth as income to fund wars, and using whatever amount of money created out of thin air you can get away with. With the former, WW2 couldn't have been funded. With the latter it did.

You are comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin's price inflation is negative, meaning it's deflationary. But instead, you posted a graph of Bitcoin's monetary inflation, compared it to USD price inflation, and arrived to the wrong conclusion that the USD is doing and will continue to do better (less inflation) than Bitcoin. You are misinforming the people and therefore hurting both them and Bitcoin this way. I hope you are happy.

That's debatable. If I'm storing my wealth, it means I won't need it in 6 days. And I don't mind if after a year it went up 6000%.
Gold is a store of wealth, and no one would consider reselling it after 6 days. And after a year sometimes it's lower, which never happens with Bitcoin. So I say Bitcoin is a much better store of wealth.

Are you here 8 hours a day "disagreeing"? I ask because unlike many of the other people in this thread, I don't remember your username. If you are not, then we are not even talking about you. Like I said, it's not about people who "disagree". It's about people who spend literally 8 hours a day every day trolling.


We have hard evidence that many governments do this on several subjects. To assume that someone is also doing this for Bitcoin is not far fetched at all. And you have no evidence of the opposite, so I don't know why you want to be so sure about it.
So again, unless you are just a new troll account, we are not talking about you and you have no clue what you are saying, you are being fooled by these trolls who want to look like peaceful and casual disagreers, also known as "concern trolls".


I'm disturbed that the idea of a government doing something evil is so inconceivable to you. No wonder you and most people are being fucked in the ass by it.

Classic shitcoiner argument. Just because I think they are slowing down one of the greatest inventions of mankind, doesn't mean I'm "intimidated". But they are definitely hurting the ecosystem by burning people. Most of the altcoins are literally scams, created for the sole purpose of taking people's bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:58:32
I mean libraries that let you operate like this:
add("1.5482", "3.2476")
So instead of using 1.5482, which traditionally your programming language will use as a float (and therefore as a binary which will lose information), you use a string which lets the function operate with the exact value you meant to. Same for every other operation.
Some programming languages might have decimals and let you operate directly with that without a special library. Maybe a functional language like Clojure?

If you ask that, people will try to sell you whatever shitcoin they invested in.
The answer is: It's just something that people like to say to look more neutral, and less like a shill. None of the current altcoins are promising, in the sense of replacing Bitcoin. Remember that Bitcoin keeps replacing itself all the time. The code evolves. Just the other day Gavin posted here on Reddit to clarify that he's not against anonymity (zero proof schemes) at all, like altcoin or anti-Bitcoin shills want us to believe. He just wants to make things right. You can't add changes like that without a lot of thought. Better wait for such technologies to be well tested and understood, and then add them to Bitcoin.

As usual, dogecoiners don't even know how their own currency works. You can't mine a coin faster just by making it more popular. The rate at which it will be mined is hardwired into the code. Dogecoin's creators decided that dogecoin should be fully mined in 1 year (so, at the end of 2014), which only makes sense if your coin is a joke.

So you don't mind having Frankeh in every "moronic monday" (or any opportunity he sees) asking always the same question and using whatever answer he receives to try to mock Bitcoin or whoever replied to him? Because that's what you are gonna get.
I obviously don't mind the question if someone actually wants to ask it. But all this troll wants is to make everyone lose their time reading/answering.
To be honest I think the question is retarded in this context. Why would anyone come to r/Bitcoin and ask "why would I want to use Bitcoin?" in many different threads? That question could be asked if someone is telling about Bitcoin and you don't get it. But to have someone here on r/Bitcoin always asking the same is just dumb and annoying. Especially when you know he's trolling.

I never said anything about storing floats. You need to go back to the basics and learn what "abstraction" means.


You have never done benchmarking and optimization. Or you just love to write shitty code.


All I did was calling a function. How is that running 100 meters? Meanwhile, with your method, you had to think about types, and converting your data back and forth, and always remember that you are storing satoshis. Programming... you are doing it wrong!

Yes. These sort of schemes are meant to be safe even if the attacker knows everything except the one thing that has to be secret: your password.

Some of us took our time to understand Darkcoin long ago, and concluded that it's crap:
- insta-mined due to a bug they conveniently decided to keep
- the only part that's not Bitcoin code is closed source. And it's basically just a flawed version of CoinJoin. CoinJoin was created for Bitcoin and works just fine, no need to create a new coin for that.
- lies, promises, and more lies. They keep saying they will open source it, but it never happens.
- Another lie: They got scared by the ring-signatures innovation that the cryptonote coins are using to achieve a higher level of privacy than CoinJoin (according to Gregory Maxwell, creator of CoinJoin) so they said they were going to add that to Darkcoin. Guess what, that never happened because *insert excuse here* (the truth is the creator of Darkcoin is not a cryptographer).
- at some point someone posted in bitcointalk.org a method to deanonymize Darkcoin using that masternodes mess. Raw CoinJoin is much better as expected, because it was created by an actual cryptographer. They have probably now "fixed" that as many coins do, but it's always a temporary solution. Instead of solid cryptographic design, they just love to play whack-a-mole with the vulnerabilities.

I was precisely going to tell you that wealth is subjective, and therefore it has nothing to do with physics. It's just that we normally value the same things the same way. For instance, we all need to eat, have the same type of shelter, entertainment, etc. But you can clearly see how someone wouldn't give $100 for a painting (or even accept it as a gift! "it's ugly!"), while others might love it and want to pay a lot of money for it. And it's definitely not the same between different species: That expensive meal you just ordered? Your cat won't like it, it probably prefers to eat raw fish or whatever.
So here's my definition of wealth: "What people want". If you can get more things people want, you are wealthier. That's also why one day you can have wealth, and the next day "magically" lose it because people don't want what you have anymore.

This is just an altcoin narrative that altcoiners try to push, and is completely false. The truth is 99.99% of all the innovation comes from Bitcoin alone. Altcoins simply copy/paste that, and add other things to look like they are doing something. All the Bitcoin clones try to keep up to date with Bitcoin's commits, because they can't obviously maintain their own independent forks. Some do it explicitly with git tools, others simply copy/paste and commit the changes as their own.

A cut and an increase in value are the same thing, so the answer is the same: I already own it. I own something that has a fixed supply, and it will normally go up in value over time. And there is really no way to stop this, because it will happen with anything that people want and can't be created out of thin air. Let's say you own a Da Vinci painting, a weird rock, or a piece of land. It will tend to go up. What can you do about it? Is it even a problem? Why?
Even if you could give the creator of the chair until the last infinitesimal of a penny that you think he deserves (I don't even know how to begin to think such a system. I say it's impossible), would it be worth it? In fact I think deflation has its own benefits. Like other commentators in this thread said, it can stop consumerism, reduce the ecological impact, stop wars, etc. The creator of the chair will probably be richer this way, because the ecological impact and wars (those are the real tragedies of the commons) reduce our wealth and life quality at best. At worst it maims us, kills us, etc.

You are basically saying that:

- Only a small number of wealthy people will ever jump in.

VPN for convenience. It's fast and you can browse the web normally. Only a handful of websites will block you partially or completely (eg: In bitcointalk.org sometimes you can't post because each IP can only make certain number of comments per unit of time). Don't use it for anything *too* illegal (unless the VPN is in a country that doesn't give a shit about *your* country), remember you are trusting the VPN not to hand you over short term (I doubt there is a VPN that doesn't keep logs for at least 2 weeks, no matter what they say).
Tor is only for serious shit, like hacking for a living or people in real danger like Snowden, journalists, rebels, etc. Has the downside that it makes it easier to MitM noobs since anyone can host a node (intelligence agencies and law enforcement obviously do this), so normally you shouldn't use it. It's also inconvenient because it's slow, you shouldn't use javascript either nor log in to any website that doesn't have SSL.

Whatever language you program in, go google "*yourlanguage* arbitrary precision library". Then see who wrote the library, how many people use that, and what kind of people they are. Are they "complete fucking morons" like you claim? Are they better or worse programmers than you? Are they well known and respected? Are they by chance the creators/developers of the language itself?
If you have never used an [arbitrary precision library]( you have no place in this discussion.

@_date: 2014-10-02 16:26:38
Easy: If someone spends 8 hours a day "disagreeing" with everyone in a subreddit dedicated to a subject they don't like, it's probably safe to assume it's a troll. And that's also the reason some people believe they are being paid: They seem to have more time for trolling, than regular people have for their own jobs, and than most bitcoiners have for reading and talking about Bitcoin.
After a couple months reading you start seeing the patterns. It's always the same trolls, with the same fallacious arguments and the same permanent negativity. Sometimes one troll account stops posting, and a new one starts posting with the same style of writing. For example, there was one of these troll accounts that had predicted that Newegg would never accept Bitcoins because they were smarter than that. One year later, Newegg started accepting Bitcoin, and this troll got humilliated so bad that he decided to create a new account. See for yourself:
And here's his new account:
And here's an interesting explanation for his behavior:
Then in this thread you also have who is a troll whose only argument seems to be "Hurr, I'm just disagreeing and I think Bitcoin is stupid and I don't like it. But I'll still spend most of my day literally every day here talking about it because it's fun". You probably already noticed that.

Uh, thank you genius. But unregulated stores of value are supposed to hold their value long term, not day to day. Whatever coins I owned last year, they buy 500% more stuff today than they did then. This little fact seems to make trolls like yourself very nervous.

Why would anyone use something that is exactly like Bitcoin but weaker and with less adoption?
@_date: 2014-09-15 16:28:18


Nope. The reason people get mad over that is that it's hurting and slowing down the adoption of one of the greatest inventions of mankind (Bitcoin), just because a bunch of kids with no money (but a lot of energy to post memes all over the place) want to become as rich as Satoshi, but without offering anything of value to the world.

Well said! In another comment someone asked "what's the risk of holding money?", implying it was riskless and therefore bad.

I got into Bitcoin for the following reasons:
- It's innovative
- It's deflationary
- It doesn't require trust
Dogecoin is not innovative, just a copy/paste of Bitcoin plus a picture of a cute dog, and it's inflationary.
Stellar is not innovative, just a copy/paste of Ripple, is inflationary, AND requires trust. I'd rather have dogecoins than stellars to be honest.
Keep in mind that as a bitcoiner I will be granted a certain amount of stellars by default. So I'm being totally objective on my negative critic against Stellar. Not "bitter", as if I missed the train like shitcoiners love to say or whatever.

You are still trying to argue that anything slightly better than Bitcoin would inevitably win. That's why I say you are ignorant on the history of computer science and communications. Do you think the protocol used for emails is the best one? It's a piece of shit, but no one is going to beat it just by being better. It would have to be immensely better, revolutionary. Else everyone will just continue to use the current one, which "just works" (tm) and is used everywhere. The same happened with TCP and many others. It's no coincidence that years ago Assange and those Google engineers compared it to Bitcoin. Great minds think alike. Too bad you are never gonna experience that.

Half the comments in this thread are the usual well known trolls (hodldown, shillslayer, skilliard, etc) that spread misinformation 24/7 on this sub. They also vote brigaded it and put it into the frontpage, and also created a post on to celebrate themselves.

There is no point of comparison between BIP38 and brain wallet. BIP38 uses a KDF (designed to be slow, uses a salt, etc.), while a brain wallet just uses a hashing function (designed to be fast, no salt). On top of that, attackers can use already existing ASICs to create huge databases of brain wallets, so forget about that.
You can use diceware to create the password for your BIP38 wallet, 5 or 6 words should be more than enough.

@_date: 2014-06-11 16:09:08
Have you seen all those posts of newbies asking what the heck is mining and how can they do it? The same retards are now throwing money at Ghash for mining contracts. Ghash sends them some coins, yes, but in reality it's ripping them off and buying more and more mining gear for itself.
Then there's another bunch of retards, people who for some reason own their own ASICs, but don't know the first thing about computers and can't set up or join a p2pool. So they see Ghash's good looking website and ease of use, and decide to join them even if that hurts Bitcoin and gives them nothing that a good p2pool wouldn't give them.
Yes, idiots, you can do merged mining with p2pool. Why the hell did you even buy ASICs? For fuck's sake.
@_date: 2014-12-26 21:58:40

The point of using a blockchain is that no single entity has full control over it. Why would a private entity like Chase bank want to use their own blockchain?

- Not really anonymous, just a copy/paste of CoinJoin
- Not even as good as CoinJoin, which was created by a cryptographer (Bitcoin guru Gregory Maxwell), because it was modified and ruined by a non-cryptographer

So instead of just making a function call for the operation, we have to keep converting back and forth from float to integer and keep in mind low level details like "in the db it's stored in satoshis"? Wow such a time saver!


You will never find a performance bottleneck in an arbitrary precision library, and clearly you have never done benchmarking and optimization.

I disagree. The simplest thing to deal with floats, is just using floats. You instead are trying to think things in the machine's domain and adding unnecessary and error-prone steps, instead of thinking in your problem's domain and using appropriate abstractions (a Math library).

I never said anything about storing the data, just let your database abstraction layer deal with that. You guys seriously need to learn what "abstraction" means.

Crytographers from our community have already exposed how insecure PoS is. In fact Peercoin has been successfully attacked in the past. PoS coins are basically playing whack-a-mole trying to keep it secure with dumb patches instead of sound cryptographic design. Eventually someone catches up and fucks everything up. Most altcoins don't even have cryptographers, they are just lame web devs trying to take other people's bitcoins.

Don't worry, Stellar is nothing like Bitcoin. Like the other commentator said it's just a rebranded Ripple (a centralized, premined shitcoin).

According to all the information that got leaked, the Dogecoin community didn't accomplish shit, it was all Moolah (a private company) organizing these things behind the scenes and then taking advantage of the dogecoiners. They were also the ones who put most of the money. They were all just publicity stunts that worked really well for Moolah and bad for the dogecoiners.

You are simply wrong, and you are the one who is blinded by dogecrap.
I can make the argument against dogecoin that it's redundant and is not the most adopted coin (I could even say it's accepted exactly nowhere, but dogetards will come out of their holes and start barking about irrelevant examples).
For a protocol, being good enough (which Bitcoin is) and having greater adoption (which Bitcoin has) is the key to success. Maybe you can't see this because you are ignorant about the history of computers and communications? Correct me if that's not the case.

In a world where everyone uses sound money (eg: gold, Bitcoin, etc), I deserve it because I already *own* it. For example, if someone builds a new chair, all chairs become a little cheaper, and money becomes a little more expensive because now there is more wealth (chairs, computers, whatever) but the same amount of money. The guy who created a new chair made money by selling it, and at the same time it made humanity wealthier by making wealth more accessible, especially chairs.
Note that in the process nothing was stolen from anyone, no one was forced to do anything at gun point, no wars were funded, etc.

You mean in a much weaker, and closed source way. Someone posted the way to de-anonymize it on bitcointalk.


Yeah, Monero is not for normal users yet, you need to be able to use a console. Only smart money is flowing in.
But it is doing everything right from the core, it has a great development team, it has partnered with I2P, and has already achieved much, much more than Darkcoin. It's obviously easier to have an UI if you simply copy/paste Bitcoin's code like any other shitcoin.

'wtfbitcoinwtf' is wrong. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning you *can* be anonymous. Besides, like ferroh said, there are already solutions like CoinJoin that can be used on top of Bitcoin (see: Dark Wallet).

@_date: 2014-09-18 19:13:42


Yes you can. Watch me do it:
1 satoshi divided by 10 equals 1/10 satoshi.
Just because the protocol has a temporary restriction on that, doesn't mean it can't be done. In fact Satoshi said it was temporary.
A good example of this is fiat money. Did you know financial software stores more than two decimal digits? (doesn't matter how it's stored) So people actually owe each other less than 1 penny. Just because right now we don't care about anything less than 1 penny (at the time of the payment), doesn't mean it can't be done. And debts can accumulate, for instance if I owe you 1/10 of a penny 10 times, now I can pay it to you.
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:12:48

Watch out, we have a badass over here.
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:22:14
Yes. People here want really bad to have a single asshole to blame (Mark Karpeles), but the truth is that no business that size could have survived after having 2 millions stolen by the US government and having to shut down there. Since that moment he ran a fractional reserve with the coins left and hoped he could eventually recover and come back to normal, but for various reasons that never happened and ended up having to shut down completely, for fear of being jailed if someone proved what he was doing. Which was obviously illegal, but I wouldn't say immoral.
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:58:06
Mark is a nice guy.
Edit: Wow thanks for the gold! :p
@_date: 2014-09-19 05:52:49
This is kind of what I wanted to say, but I was too much in shock by OP's question. I mean even if the government had forbidden something like this, you should probably do it anyway. I wouldn't want to live under such level of control, so I might as well enjoy my freedom or die trying.

@_date: 2014-02-16 11:31:50
You won't make anything with a CPU or GPU.
What some people do with their GPUs is they mine other coins and then they trade them for bitcoins.
For example if you jump into a new coin you will have very little difficulty and you will mine a lot. Then if it gains some value you can sell it for bitcoins.
The only way to mine bitcoins directly is with ASICs. Take a look at the current total [hash rate]( of the network, to see what you are competing against.
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:52:04

Hi Andreas. There is just one thing I didn't like about what you said. You were talking about how anyone can now create a currency, and that it will be as secure as any other. I know you didn't want to complicate things with mining, but please find a way to explain people that Bitcoin's network is by far the most secure one at the moment, and doesn't seem like that's going to change anytime soon.

Why not? It can do so perfectly, and it has done that since the beginning. Maybe you are new here? Did you arrive *after* our bitcointip bot was banned in almost every subreddit? We donated thousands of dollars in reddit alone, long before dogecoin even existed.
Dogecoin solves exactly 0 problems that Bitcoin doesn't solve. It's redundant and it's soon going to end in the coin graveyard with the other hundreds of copycoins that are there already. Deal with it.

And by that he means they would be breaking their own rules, precisely because Bitcoin could make the editor rich (that's what they got wrong originally, they approved it because they didn't know that bit). Meaning they think Bitcoin can actually be a great investment, but they won't be officially buying any because that would jeopardize their impartiality.

@_date: 2014-10-08 20:27:17
PoS is still being researched but so far without success. The main problem is that there is "nothing at stake". You don't need to perform any significant work to mine, so you can mine all the forks that you want in parallel at virtually no cost. PoS proponents will use all kind of weird arguments that only show that they don't fully understand the blockchain. Like when they say "but you need to own a lot of coins, and if you attack us you would be attacking yourself!", which isn't true because you can sell them before starting your attack, effectively reducing your risk to zero basically. In PoW you need to own a lot of hardware and have a physical place for it and electricity and cooling if we are talking about mining operations like Bitcoin has nowadays. And you obviously can't sell it as soon as you finished your attack (besides you would leave a lot of physical evidence of your fraud), let alone before the attack.
Blackcoin and similar coins keep it secure by playing whack-a-mole with the vulnerabilities or using checkpoints (checkpoints are basically that the dev periodically says "this block can't be changed anymore", instead of letting it be consensus based), instead of relying on a solid cryptographic design, which they can never have until someone finds a way to make PoS secure. Eventually a hacker will have enough incentives to catch up with the updates and steal all the coins he need.
@_date: 2014-09-11 13:47:57
What's the point of "hardening"? Either the cryptographic design is sound, or it isn't. I wouldn't want to put my money in a coin that is playing whack-a-mole with hackers.


Oh ok. Well, cryptographers from our community have already exposed how insecure PoS is. See what Gregory Maxwell has to say about PoS, and how Peercoin was attacked and had to use checkpoints instead of distributed consensus (which made it 100% centralized).

makes no sense. I see him wasting a lot of time with the trolls, sometimes he even writes long and polite responses, while they obviously don't give a shit about arguments, they just want to see Bitcoin burn.
But then he says "Oh no, banning them wouldn't work because they can create more accounts". So spending hours replying to them and/or deleting each individual comment is time better spent?
And what happened anyway with his argument "We don't ban them because free speech"? I thought that was the reason before? Is he starting to see that trolling is the opposite of free speech, or he's just using whatever argument he can come up with to try to make our complaints go away?

It's like before the internet, communications networks were private and everything sucked, innovation was not possible. After the internet, information flowed freely, everyone was free to build on top of it, and you see what happened: endless innovation. And the same is happening now with financial networks. You no longer need permission/approval from the private owners of the network. Now everyone can send value from/to anywhere in the world in a second, without asking for permission, and without paying ridiculous fees. No longer the rules or properties of the currency can be changed at the whims of a central entity (eg: no more debasing of your currency, no more stopping you at imaginary borders, etc.). This will change everything.

Agreed, such idea has been abstracted away ages ago into Math libraries. Unfortunately not every programmer knows about this and so they don't use them.

Yes, yes, we always have to wait just "two weeks" (tm). Like I was saying, Darkcoiners have been saying it since the beginning, there is no reason to believe this time is different. And if it is, people will just copy/paste it and create something "better", the same way Darkcoin did with Bitcoin. So what's the value in Darkcoin exactly? Sloppy anonymity, vulnerable to DoS, zero network effect, shitty name, ninja-mined, not approved by any known cryptographer. I don't see anything of value here, sorry.

*"In order to pay the large costs of the First World War, Germany suspended the convertibility of its currency into gold when that war broke out."*

In response to the constant and unmodded trolling in this sub which has in my opinion hurt Bitcoin's image, scared noobs away, and drained an incalculable amount of energy from honest bitcoiners like you and me, we decided to create a sub that will try a different policy. No, trolls, no shitcoiners, etc. A bot will be mirroring all the links and posts from r/Bitcoin to give it a kickstart. If you think this deserves attention, please let other true bitcoiners know by copying this message.

Yeah and you don't need to use a computer, just use pen and paper. No need to add extra coplexity, am I right? Keep it simple, stupid! Right guys?


Gee, I don't know. Why use a battle-tested library and stay as close as possible to the problem domain, instead of rolling my own code which requires low level assumptions like "Remember that we are storing everything in satoshis!"? I wonder...


And writing more code and having to document low level details doesn't?

It's not even happening, at least not the way shitcoiners try are painting it. First of all, the protocol works just fine and it doesn't need to be updated all the time. Second, any changes will affect a ton of people that are already using the coin, so they need to be well thought out and tested. Third, some things are being researched, so it's not that development "has halted". It's that there are things that we don't even know how to do yet, or haven't decided which of the available ways is the best one. Eg: anonymity. Why implement a half-baked solution now, when we a) Already have CoinJoin which works perfectly without touching the protocol and b) A perfect, zero-knowledge solution could come up in the following years and blow all the anon coins out of the water?
And about funding, Lighthouse was created recently and eventually it should make decentralized funding work. Also, some researches/cryptographers/developers have explicitly rejected funding, like Gregory Maxwell. He believes in Bitcoin, and continues to work on it for free.

That's not innovation, that's just dumb, and is precisely why Satoshi made Bitcoin's script Turing-incomplete. Have they proven it to be secure yet, or is it just another bullet point their promises list?

@_date: 2014-08-27 17:04:36
You need a scheme that is
a) very secure
b) can be recovered in several ways
I like this one:
- Create a cold storage wallet with Armory or Electrum.
- Create a password-encrypted backup of the seed and store it in a different location, like a friend's house.
- Create a 3 of 3 backup of the seed (no password) and store each piece in a different location (eg: one in your house, one in a friend's house, and another one in a family member's house).
If your house explodes, you go get the password-encrypted copy. If you forget your password, you go get the 3 pieces. If you die, your family can also put the 3 pieces together.

You can fantasize all you want with Bitcoin development being decentralized, but it's not: Certain devs have more permissions than others; they are called core devs and we trust them to keep Bitcoin on track.
Then you have the contributors, which is basically anyone in the world who creates a pull request and is accepted. I don't trust those, but I trust core devs to review those requests before approving them.

You ask what's next as if putting your savings into Bitcoin was such a crazy idea. A lot of people have already done that long ago, including myself.

Well, in itself is not a problem. But it brings the others: worsening of the distribution of wealth, ecological impact, and wars.
If you buy things you don't need just because your money is evaporating, you are effectively giving your money to the rich. And they do know who to protect their wealth and can do it. The average person can't (because of a lack of time to learn, barriers to entry, regulations, etc.), let alone the poor.
You are also effectively funding the contamination of the world.
You are also effectively giving more money to the government for no reason through taxes, which they will then use to fund wars, terrorism, mass spying, torture camps, give money to friends (which are already rich, obviously), etc.

Actually skillird4 is completely wrong, as Proof of Stake has been proven to be broken, so we can't even think of it as an "alternative". That's why Bitcoin core devs don't even bother with it, and not because it would be "controversial". Only trolls say that, because they have an agenda pushing shitcoins like Peercoin, Nxt, etc. Bitcoin devs are always open to discussing new ideas, you can find them on IRC.
For instance, they have listened to this man and are awaiting to see what he comes up with:

I don't think the risk is too high. But the reward is. The reward/risk ratio is insane, and I think I would be a fool if I didn't take this opportunity. I have been following Bitcoin for several years. Went all in in 2013. So far it's going very well, and within the expected boundaries.

For a second I thought the same, but the truth is you can't expect their customers to learn how to use Bitcoin in a month. Two years seems pretty reasonable.

I save in bitcoins. The potential reward is too big compared to the risk.
If you hold for at least 1 year, and the price goes up 10x as it has done every other year, you can then cash out 1/10 of that (to recover your initial capital) and voilá, now you have a 100% risk-free investment.

If Satoshi, instead of creating this "contract" to somewhat "fairly" distribute the coins, decided to simply put himself as the sole owner of all the coins and then give it to friends or colleages, or even run an IPO like some scamcoins do these days, Bitcoin would have never taken off, because it would have been a scam.
So you learned about Bitcoin, liked the idea, decided to buy... And now that you are in you want to stop the fair distribution to increase your wealth. First of all, that would be dishonest and unfair. And second, it would kill Bitcoin. No one else would want to jump in, and also the security would go to the floor as there will be no incentive for miners.

He's probably like witcoins: He learned about Bitcoin *really* early, but was nervous so he chose the "safe" option and didn't invest. He wanted to make sure he made the right decision and so he told everyone it was a scam and it would fail. The price went up, he was still in denial, so he continued with the FUD. The price went even higher and now he can't stop. He *must* make sure that Bitcoin fails, else he will be an idiot who could have been a millionaire or even a billionaire.

Huh? First of all, the US has never been in danger, except for the cold war (one does not simply stop nuclear missiles). And second, people didn't decide to go to war and then continue spending most of the budget in enriching the owners of the war industry. The government did. In fact, people protested against wars multiple times. But that's all they can do, they have no power.
NASA scientists did an AMA here on reddit. They said we could have entire cities on the Moon and Mars by now, if it weren't because of all the funding that went to wars, terrorism, coups, mass spying, etc. They also said that's just the things we know *for sure*, because with tech and science you never know what else you are going to discover. So probably we could have gone a lot farther.
But I guess you know more than them...

This happens a lot in reddit. Someone (you) posts something that sort of looks like he's defending science and attacking pseudoscience but was in reality just an ignorant comment and gets upvoted. Then someone (me) makes a more objective and detailed explanation which makes parent (you) look dumb, so the flow of votes gets inverted. And some other times it's simply that the distribution of the times at which the people who agree/disagree with you read the thread is heterogeneous.

A first step could be letting anyone in the world buy your music using Bitpay (a paypment processor built on top of Bitcoin, so that you don't have to pay a developer to make Bitcoin work on your website), and pass what you save in fees to your customers as a discount. Also, Bitcoin transactions can't be reversed, so you won't suffer from chargebacks (which some merchants complain about when using credit cards or Paypal).

Thank you Captain Obvious!


Uh yes it does, because you know exactly when it will happen and the exact maximum supply. For example, if right now there are 13 millions, and you know the maximum is 21 millions, you know that the change in price due to an increase in supply will be less than 1/2. So if you put $100, and the demand remains stable (very unlikely), worst case scenario it will be worth $50 after several decades, while the best case scenario is still the moon.

I can think of these reasons why the average Joe or BigMoney guy might prefer to buy shares of that ETF:
- You don't have to worry about security, because the shares are at your name. A hacker can't simply take the shares and send them to a cyber cafe on Russia just because you aren't a security expert.
- Should something go wrong, you have a legal entity you can sue.
- Maybe it will have some sort of insurance like other financial products?
I'm sure there are other reasons.

Correct. PoW can't be attacked for free, it has a cost. In the case of Bitcoin, it's in the millions of dollars range.
There might be things to improve in PoW, but it's definitely not broken in the same sense PoS is broken. PoS can be attacked for free, that's why all those PoS coins are using checkpoints and are 100% centralized.

You just need a PGP implementation. For windows you have this: 
You can probably find a website that lets you use PGP if you just want to play with it a little.
The wikipedia articles on these things are good:
Digital signature is another use for public key cryptography. When you want to send an encrypted message, you encrypt with the receiver's public key and the receiver decrypts with his private key. When you want to send a signed message, you sign it with your private key and the receiver verifies it with your public key.
Desktop email clients normally have a feature to do these things automatically, this way once you have exchanged public keys with someone you both of you can send everything encrypted and/or signed, and the email client will take care of encrypting, signing, decrypting and verifying. I use it with Thunderbird + Enigmail.
