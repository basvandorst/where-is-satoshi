Are the physical locations accepting bitcoin or are they simply allowing you to pay for your tickets online using bitcoin.
 
It's a really important and overlooked part of the article that they didn't bring up.

Hello Kettle, this is pot calling.

And you're surprised?  Here is a company that controls what software you can install on it, how you make payments and what you're allowed to use their hardware to do.
 
They cannot make money off the software and they cannot make money off the customers using the software so they will not allow it.  
 
This is why you do not support hardware or software of this nature.

So you go online to create an account.  You can use the ATM to buy coins which you then go online to redeem.
 
To sell you need to go online and put bitcoins onto your account and then choose how much you want to sell and get a code.  You then go to an ATM and put in your sell code.
 
Seems like so many redundant steps when you could just be doing everything online.  Every step involves doing something online first so why use the ATM?
 
I've worked in the kiosk industry for around 13 years (interfaces, hardware, software, etc.)  and the process they put customers though seems very confusing and very redundant.

So it's a dead man's switch that sends a message to people if you do not respond to an email once in a while?
 
Great idea, they do this in the new Shadowrun game.

Was this something they didn't fix because they were making money from it being a known bug but decided to not fix it until so much awareness was brought up?

I once stayed at the 157 acre property in Rodeo, New Mexico that john McAfee spent $11.5 million to buy and develop. It fetched roughly $1.6 million at auction.
 
A friend had a wedding there.  The level of strange bad shit crazy things (when it came to money spent) there was pretty high.

[Here is some of the info about the ranch](  It is now called [the painted pony resort]( I copied/pasted some of the details about the purchase/sale price, because that's the real crazy part of the story.
 
The location had fiber line run to it.  In the middle of the desert, like 75 miles from a mining town.   You'll also see the ranch has no power lines run to it.  This is because there were "a lot" of geo-thermal wells drilled all over the property to power some giant power backup system / storage with backup systems in place just in case.
 
It also had a landing strip.  The first night we stayed there I stayed outside in a tent (I had planned on hiking the week I was out there, but there were brush fires destroying everything around us).  I asked the guy who lived in on the property to manage it about turning the lights off at night.  He said if we turned off the lights the air strip would be in use and we could have "problems".  
 
That's just a few of the things I remember.  It was like 10 years ago now give or take so I don't remember much more.
