We need to be sure that consumer hardware can support the larger blocks. Even today it's still too expensive to use larger blocks. Slightly increasing the blocksize may seem like a small change, but don't forget the large impacts it would have. Even a simple increase to 2MB would **double** all of the requirements (disk, bandwidth, processing). The blockchain is already around 150GB, how long will it take before you need to get a new hard drive each year? 
Segwit already provides sufficient on-chain scaling, we just need more companies to support it. Remember: ask companies to support Segwit!

I really hope so, Lightning is so important! That looks like a great mock up, have you seen some of the dedicated Lightning Network wallets like Eclair?

Right now Lightning is still being tested, so it makes sense it's not part of the main release. I'm sure as it develops they'll make it compatible enough so that lots of different wallets can seamlessly integrate it.

The full nodes are run to support the Lightning Network, not just the base layer. Sacrificing decentralization because people "might" not be able to transact on layer 1 is crazy. Segwit adoption is only around 10% right now. Fees will go down naturally as more and more companies adopt Segwit. Have a bit of patience - keep asking companies for Segwit support. That's what's needed. Layer 1 **must** be decentralized if you wish to maintain the security of the network.

Duh, don't buy more BCH. Others will though. Take their BCH and SELL IT. They aren't HODLing, you aren't HODLing - so who is? NO ONE

It's if you have a store. Just like you can accept other coins. They will buy the Bcash (because they were going to anyway), then give you the Bcash they bought in exchange for whatever you're selling. Then you take the Bcash they gave you and sell it for Bitcoin. It's pretty much like taking the money from the Bcashers and converting it into Bitcoin. Increases your stack and decreases the value of Bcash at the same time.

I'm a bit drunk right now. I thought it was a good idea ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

What's up with Cobra? This isn't the first time he's going against what the developers - and even the community! - want. First the incident with replacing the download on bitcoin.org with a Bitcoin Knots, entirely without discussion and now this!
Here's why this is dangerous:
1) First, Cobra is suggesting a proof-of-stake algorithm - or even a hybrid PoW/PoS. **This is dangerous!!** It is stricly weaker than Bitcoin's current trust model. See the discussion here for more information: 
2) Cobra is advocating a hard fork. We've already established hard forks are dangerous. Bcash even proved this with their utter failure (it's at what, 4% market dominance now??)
3) The goal of Bitcoin is to be the worlds most secure store-of-value. Are we seriously going to throw that ALL away just because Cobra is afraid of a few miners?? We've overcome miners trying to push their agenda before and we can do it again. **WILL WE BACK DOWN BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID??**
The correct solution that Cobra is entirely missing is to promote alternatives in mining hardware. The first step is identifying the problem. If miners really are becoming more centralized, lets get companies to build new hardware! Samsung and Halong Mining has even started getting into the mining hardware game, it's all coming. As a community, we need to support those companies to promote decentralized hardware. We can do it.

They want to spend their Bcash. They'll just go to another store if they can't. Chances are you have competitors if you are running a store.
