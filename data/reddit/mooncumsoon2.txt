FACT: I mine uniquely-shaped bits of dried snot out of my nose every day. INCREDIBLY SCARCE! Certain to be worth 10 million dollars a piece when the dollar goes to zero and everyone will be literally begging to use them as money.

You are an idiot, dont do this.
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:41:31
Sounds to me like you are very poor, you only have 200 dollars to invest, the last thing in the world you should do is put your money in a gambling chip.
@_date: 2019-07-01 09:51:25
Buttcoiners overdoing the hopium.

You are gambling and will get rekt by the insiders. Hope this helps.

Limitless boosterism.

It will never be widely accepted as money. All your devs and industry leaders admit that openly, now they are talking about e-gold.

You are gambling in a rigged market. Stop now before you get rekt.
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:58:27
Seems like a lot of bother for no good reason, maybe try fiat.

You see, that's not a "plan" is it, its a massively massively improbable scenario, that you just fantasied.

Yes, gone, bitcoin works like internet banking, if you forget your password, your balance is zeroed for all eternity.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:51:27
 "And we are not even mentioning all those stores that accept Bitcoin directly to their wallets". Because there aren't any. 
"We’re just concerned that it spreads a false message that  cryptocurrencies are all about speculation." You're right, they forgot hodling.

But as for buying groceries in a grocery store...
@_date: 2019-04-11 08:22:44
Mainstream adoption cancelled long ago. Why would this get no-coiners to buy crypto? They already have debit cards.
@_date: 2019-04-25 10:21:34
Nobody uses these machines, they are just very expensive ad hoardings.

It doesnt work, no-one accepts it, and you can lose all your lovely crypto in a flash. But if youre HODLing, who cares?
