happens in all types of markets not only crypto
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:14:06

@_date: 2018-01-21 00:03:43
Seems like everyone likes to talk about the crash and never the recovery.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:15:25
I'm hodling too. Since $2,400.

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:10:32
Never thought the day would come. First futures, now ETF. Volatility traders will be pleased after a VIX 9 for like a year on the stock market.
@_date: 2018-09-30 04:24:04

Great milestone for us all
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:32:21
Need a few more market crashes and it'll scare all the idiots out. Then we have a chance at being "stable". Too many fools are buying it as an investment.
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:00:41
I have never been a fan of coinbase in all honesty
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:42:15
If Bitcoin was a mainstream currency, would they still be able to do this?
