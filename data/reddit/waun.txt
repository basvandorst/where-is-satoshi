Science can tell you that there is an x% chance that an asteroid will strike within the next y years. 
I'd say that's predicting the future. 
But I digress. This is not @_date: 2016-11-09 11:04:06
It wasn't just the mainstream media. When it gets to presidential briefing level, there's reasons for it. Even Trump said it was in his briefings, but he didn't believe it. 
Also, the reason for the poll differences is that a lot of people were ashamed to be voting for Trump.

A bank run isn't a single person or small number of people pulling money from their bank. That's normal bank operations.
A bank run is when a bank has so many people requesting to take money out that due to fractional reserve banking it can't fulfill all the withdrawal requests.
Given that at one point 1 in 7 people in Hong Kong were out in the streets, there is a very good chance that a bank run would disrupt the banking industry in Hong Kong if enough people participated.

Not to be melodramatic, but is this a situation where for Bitcoin to thrive, the idea of Satoshi must be destroyed? 
As others have mentioned, Bitcoin is all about the trust in math, not in any person. SN has been held up as "the One" for so long that whoever ends up taking on that mantle becomes nearly unassailable and would direct the future of Bitcoin in the same way that everyone listens to every word that the central bank Governors say when announcing interest rates. 
There's no need for SN to exist other than as a historical figure, and I dare say being SN is too much power for any one person or small group of people to hold. The power should lie with the masses.
Bitcoin doesn't *need* that central authority, but we've all willingly given it to SN. Just think about all the talk of Excalibur. Destroying the idea of SN, either through false claims or whatever will eventually make people realize they don't need a Satoshi as a god at all.

14 is unlucky in China, 13 is good. 
That said, money is even better so i doubt people are placing orders based on what a particular number sounds like. Your post is slightly condescending and offensive.
