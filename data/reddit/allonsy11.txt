Perfectly normal in the investment world. Keep things hush as to not exploit or over-inflate the market/asset.

Before everyone jumps to “bch is shady”, etc. learn what actually happened. Coinbase halted trading for two reasons (overload and insider trading).
 We’ve already seen overload issues with coinbase, so there was no surprise there.
As for the insider trading, it is alleged that coinbase employees exploited what they knew (that Bch would hit the exchange), so coinbase took action about that. 
Full disclosure, i am not invested in bch, but just want to make sure everyone understands the issue was solely coinbase and not bitcoin cash. All other exchanges were working like normal and trading was not halted.

I agree that you definitely need to educate yourself on charting prior to trying this tactic.

That’s why i mentioned as long as you can read a chart. There are plenty of places to learn.

Everything, especially high volume fluctuates enough daily to be able to do this. If you monitor something long enough, it is possible. You will not get rich overnight, but it is definitely possible to make slow and steady gains that begin to grow exponentially.

Opposite. Wait for a dip to buy, then sell at a peak. You will need to watch for a bit and be able to read a chart, but you can make an easy 50-100-1000, depending on the amount you flip.

Quick flips on every dip and the money will start to grow exponentially.

Not if you're reinvested

Just make sure you are buying enough to offset the fees. If not, don't make the quick trade. the fees are far less than the avg stock trading platform. Just saying that There are a lot of traders using this tactic who make money. Not to say holding is bad, I just like to put my 2 cents in when I feel some people think that the only way to make money is to be in the "next Bitcoin"
