Get ready for $3500 by late Nov.

Why hate Bitcoin? Its doing what all markets do which is correct after a parabolic blow off top. If it had never went parabolic we'd be sitting at 1500-2000 right now.

 (Just my humble opinion)

Ouch, only 60, that sucks! My parents died at 49/48 respectively 9 years apart from natural causes but I hope to out live them both and by about 40 years!

It baffles me when people say stuff like that. I invested a few grand, that turned into a few hundred grand, and yes I get literally sick to my stomach watching it drop but I didn't invest a penny I couldn't afford to lose.

I agree, but I don't think its as much a greater fool's theory as much as a market cycle like any other market cycle. We've yet to see any real institutional money come into the space. My guess is it will be another dot com type bubble that eventually gives birth to world changing tech, but most of those types of companies are born in the ashes of others.

I love how people make these types of posts but ignore the fact it costs 6k to mine a bitcoin. If we fall to 2k its not coming back, its dead. You really think the manipulators are going to let that happen?
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:46:08
Quick math lesson. $200k buys a lot more coins than $70k.

You seriously underestimate the power of greed. Of course the bubble will re-inflate because when price gets low enough you'll have the big players come in so they can sheer the sheep one more time.  The next bubble will be in the trillions of dollars. After that, its anyone's guess where crypto goes.

Except one important point, Bitcoin did not cost $6k to mine in 2013. We're seeing the triple bottom form - its highly unlikely we're "just getting started."

I would be careful what you wish for, when you drop below production cost you risk collapsing the entire house of cards to the point it can't be rebuilt.

The last two major bull runs were triggered by upcoming halvenings. The next one should hit summer of 2020. If past performance is any indicator we could see 100k Bitcoin that time around. That's one big IF in my opinion but its possible.

I'm already betting big on it, if not i would have sold my coins already. I could be wrong, God knows I've been wrong plenty of times before but no risk no reward.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:15:24
You hope it falls to the point that no one can afford to mine it so you can buy a coin that no longer has any real world utility? Sounds intelligent. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:45:06
The real money hasn't touched crypto yet, when the big players come in we'll be talking about trillions, not billions.  It'll make 2017's bubble look like child's play.
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:56:04
You can't claim they came in in huge  when the total market cap wasn't even a trillion dollars, that's not even large on a global scale, much less huge.

Comparing the immature market of 2013/2014 to the 2018 market is naive at best and malicious at worst. BTC costs ~6k to mine. That's the major support level. And we're seeing a triple bottom trying to form. Its much more likely we begin seeing some relief by the 4th quarter of 2018.
