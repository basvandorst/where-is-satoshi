Looks like they just closed and guess what everything is going up as predicted by many

Could it possibly be someone who has shorted bitcoin in the futures and has placed that there to prevent it going up?

Yes I agree with this Amazon never check returns and just send them out again, just send it back for a refund.

Funny how amazon are unable to own it or design there own they try a different route, I’m guessing being s they filed it back in 2014 they didn’t get one
