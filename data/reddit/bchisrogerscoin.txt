Even the lightning developers don't have a clue when it will be ready. One was asked yesterday and he said "When its ready" to the absolute dismay of the professional programmer who was asking. Seems like certain people want the Bitcoin price to be capped/drop or its reputation to be damaged by abysmal confirmation times/fees.
The blocksize needs to be raised until lightning arrives.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:13:50
It doesn't. One of Japans biggest companies has said they WILL make BCH a globally used payment system, they have the money alone to cause a "flippening" (I can't believe I used that word) let alone people like Jihan Wu who reportedly owns like 10% of all Bitcoins if Core don't raise the blocksize or lightning isn't implemented within a few weeks. Then BCH will just be "Bitcoin" once Bitmain bribes or BUYS the remaining exchanges.......
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:05:00
It will. The last time a currency other than the dollar gained momentum the USA blew up Iraq and Libya.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:56:24


2.7x per the testing prior to implementation, which is great, but even if that happened NOW it wouldn't be enough. It should most certainly be less than 3USD to open a lightning channel now or in the future.

Which country will this node be hosted within if it will be used directly with, for example, US companies? What if US Government says US companies can only work with US nodes? I can see flaws in this concept immediately. I hope this isn't all lightning has up its sleeve...
Lightning needs to be implemented within the wallets themselves, not big nodes. Big nodes = 100% guaranteed centralization and Government oversight. The nodes need to be decentralized for lightning to achieve it's intended goals.

The real question is why would 1 million people spend 50+ USD to open / close a lightning channel in the first place.....the answer is no one would bother. The cost will need to be a nominal amount, like 5-10USD, for ANYONE to bother.

Bitcoin is P2P digital cash, if you're too bone idle to even read the white paper you shouldn't even be posting in here.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:22:35


You're an idiot. More users means more fees, if the rate of new users out paces the rate of people spending 50USD to open and close a channel (to send MICROPAYMENTS) - then the fees will continue to rise and lightning to become used even LESS.
NO ONE will spend 50USD to open and close a channel within lightning to send micropayments. 
The only way lightning is usable with this blocksize is if the price goes DOWN to about 9000USD or below. Only at that level do the fees make it reasonable to open and close channels. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:54:45
Bitcoin is a Peer to Peer payment system. It's in growing pains. People should NOT use another coin, Bitcoin should increase the blocksize to tie us over to lightning - its not fucking rocket science.

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:26:09
The community was against the blocksize increase then. Then Bitcoin went mainstream RIGHT at the time where the capacity was fucked. We need the community, IN THIS SUB, to start demanding a blocksize increase.

You got upvotes because of this:-


Unfortunately, the rest of your post was a load of complete *bullshit*. The sec is saying they consider ICO's to be IPO's and IPO's are regulated by the SEC. How you took that to mean Bitcoin is also an ICO and therefore now legally considered to be an IPO makes me think you are intentionally trying to mislead people. I struggle to see how someone who can actually read and write could accidentally misconstrue this in the way you have.
I was telling people since day 1 that ICO's will be regulated by the SEC, in fact anyone with a brain saw this coming a mile off. Us Bitcoiners have been looking forward to this day for months. This is great news.

You're confused. Lightning will *require* a blocksize increase to be able to work! Or are you saying you'll pay 30USD to open and close a channel to tip people 0.01USD on reddit? No... no one will. Lightning will need a blocksize increase to be our scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:06:27
Bitcoin was easily usable for payments for the majority of the World up until about 2 months ago. The fees were consistently under 5USD up until a month ago. Now the fees are regularly over 20USD. Bitcoin needs an emergency hardfork to 2MB or it may become the bubble the retarded news outlets have been bleeting about.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:53:02
Seriously, it is URGENTLY needed now. Even for lightning to work we need a blocksize increase. The community should be calling for this. Don't reference my account age, I've been here longer and hold more Bitcoins than probably 95% of the entire community.
Edit: 


It isn't up to the Core devs, they have stated a thousand times its up to the community, when we call for it that it will come. Now is the time to call for it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:03:08
If Bitcoin goes to 50k before Lightning arrives, who will pay 50USD to open a channel for microtransactions?
If no one bothers to open a channel for that reason how will lightning have a beneficial effect?
Lightning only has any use if it makes financial sense to open a channel for the size of the intended - small - purchases that will be made. It is basic logic.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:50:44
Yes, for the last 3 days in a row. The Mempool was showing the same level and it was about 5USD for low priority, normal priority and it was around 10USD. I think your ledger is wrong right now.

Emergency 2MB hardfork halves this issue instantly, 4MB hardfork quarters it. This ties us over till lightning comes - perfect. We need ONE prominent person to call for this and the dumb fuck sheep will be rallying within 5 minutes for the same.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:43:48
Bullshit. We need a blocksize increase in Bitcoin even for lightning to work, the lightning Devs estimate we need 133MB blocks to serve the world through lightning - so tell me again why a 2MB blocksize increase right now is a problem?

@_date: 2017-12-13 17:16:14
Ok, when lightning is implemented. When lightning is implemented if no one uses it, how will it benefit the network?
Imagine, for arguments sake lightning doesn't come for another year and by then Bitcoin is 100kUSD. To open a channel it would be about 150USD, to close the channel 150USD - who would spend 300USD in order to make fast **small** transactions (the goal of the lightning network?)? Literally no one.
Obviously the plan is for lightning to be able to do something, which means the blocksize will HAVE TO be increased at some point soon or lightning won't achieve anything at all...unless it becomes fully functional around these present prices. Do you see the issue? It caps the price.
Holy fuck I've just made a realization.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:51
Blocksize solves that. But the dumbasses are still only just catching on.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:20:11
My friend, lightning will need a blocksize increase to work *itself*! We can't pay 40USD to open and close a channel to make micropayments!

@_date: 2017-12-17 06:29:22
Of course, people will jump at the chance to open/close a channel for 50USD so that they can send tiny little micro payments. Oh, wait, to beat VISA the fee would have to be under 1.5% which would mean the minimum logical amount to lock would be 5000USD right now - yes, people will line up to lock 5000USD of their money in channels. Everyone has that spare. This will be global adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:23:50
2.7MB actually and it's great, but not quite enough since the influx of new users!

@_date: 2017-12-20 11:48:26
So even less on chain - great, right? So how will small miners break in to the industry when it costs them more to receive their reward from  the fees than the worth of the reward? Lightning will allow fees to rise, high fees will centralize mining by preventing newcomers. What was the problem with big blocks again?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:43:02
Thanks very much bro.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:48:13
They should raise the blocksize if they're competent, 2MB to tie us over till the Lightning Network arrives. Lightning network needs bigger blocks to work anyway. It's literally a no fucking brainer at this point. Why should we thank them? It's their fault Bitcoin Cash even exists right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:09:18
It's a world changing technology if people use it. Again, who would pay 50USD in and 50USD out to tip people on reddit or buy coffee? So how will lightning reduce the load if it doesn't make sense to use it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:13:35
Why on earth would someone use Bitcoin at 10USD fees to buy anything under 1000USD? It's meant to be a P2P cash. Where is lightning?!

They benefit from mobile phones and electricity too. In fact they benefit from everything you benefit from, do you wan think they are all sitting around in caves? Or would you rather you lost access to everything just so a "terrorist" didn't also have access to it?
Also, one mans terrorist is another mans hero. Do you think the children in Iraq and Afghanistan think US Soldiers are heroes when they blow up their siblings? Or when a group destroys your home, your city, your culture and entire country under false pretenses they sound like a terrorist? 
Governments have been using "terrorism" to introduce  new oppressive laws for the past 15 years without too much public backlash, we've come to a pretty pathetic point in society where the people themselves start using the same fictitious arguments to help have their own rights removed.
"99% of all terrorist plots or criminal action in the USA are devised in a home, we propose every home in USA is monitored with sound recording equipment and CCTV - if you have nothing to hide whats the problem?". People like you (your friend?) are the kind of people that in 20 years will be agreeing with this statement.

@_date: 2017-12-21 12:51:07
This is why we need an emergency blocksize increase just to stall these issues until Lightning does come. I'm so fed up of repeating myself on this. Surely people are actually realizing this is what is needed by now. The problem seems to be the herds of new people that need someone "important" to tell them what to think. Use your own brain. The blocksize needs to increase for lightning to work, increase it to stop the issues we have NOW. There has never been a better time and we are BLEEDING users all day everyday right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:17:05
Because Core, that were pushing it for 3 years, didn't even bother to release a Segwit wallet with a GUI yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:19:18
No, they will move to BCH if the blocksize isn't raised. How about that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:05:58
Holy shit. I'm so glad I found this. My love for Bitcoin just returned.

Yes it is. Its not just viable it is *essential* for Lightning to be able to work at all. No one will pay 40USD to open and close a channel on lightning to make micropayments.
The only other way lightning takes off is it the Bitcoin price drops, this is the only other way the fees will be low enough for lightning to be operational.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:56:52

If Dimon shorts the futures he expects the price to be lower on a certain date, the Winkees had 10M spare to buy Bitcoin 5 years ago - before they were Bitcoin billionaires. 
I reckon as soon as the market heard Dimon had a short there would be a collective effort - imagine all the multi multi multi millionaires in this space who would love to prove him wrong. Jihans / Rogers crew alone spiked BCH from 900 to 2600USD in a single day.
What I'm saying is my personal guess, but they presumably have a reason to be so confident....they are essentially market makers.

I mis-wrote. I specifically mean the CORE developers. I was there doing it too with them, I actually personally began the BIP148 movement. Now I feel like I've been sexually abused or something.
Bitcoin is no longer Bitcoin at this point, Bitcoin cash is literally the Bitcoin I invested in years ago. I fucking dumped my Bcash at 190USD, more than removed of them. It's the biggest financial mistake I have ever made in my life.
If we don't have a hardfork to 2MB in the core chain soon we are so fucked. Right now, Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core is a ponzi scheme and this sub is so full of newbies that think this issue is the same as others in the past. It seriously isn't, if BTC "dips" right now like it used to BCH will take its place so damn fast.
We NEED a fucking hardfork right now for Bitcoin to be Bitcoin. I've been debating selling removed of Bitcoin for the past weeks PRAYING someone will come out and call for a blocksize increase.
My patience is really running out. I imagine there are literally thousands of people like me. I'll have to delete this pretty fast because its got far too much information.
Edit: no one will believe the amounts anyway

Price goes down while exchanges are down and up when they go up again...right now the price is stable, so price will go up soon. Buy now or regret forever, lol.

The next test from 20k USD will be the end of Bitcoin's dominance. !Remind me 3 months
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:18:16
I spent 40USD earlier today, to confirm in 2 blocks, to move x usd of BTC to an exchange to sell for BCH before I changed my mind. You're a fucking liar and its dumb fucks like you why we're in this position.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:45:52


The above, at least, is the truth. We are in a terrible position because of those


I can see this doesn't apply to yourself, or you wouldn't be asking for opinions in the first place, so my apologies.

It's really weird. But I recognize that wall. I think this is the head quarters of a BTC company and I think I originally saw your wall more than a year ago.

Without Roger's tweet the fact is the sequence of events wouldn't have happened, he inadvertently made Andreas a millionaires.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:30:01
We need to increase the blocksize to 2MB. It needs to start from within the community itself. People need to realize that lightning still requires cheap on chain fees for it to get started or be used at all......
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:14:56
This is awesome. But can someone PLEASE put a date on this on main net?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:50:46
Never NEVER trust a UK company with this kind of money.

The Canadian Gold mint recently refused to accept Gold bars that they *themselves* had minted because it turned out they were FAKE. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:47
Excellent. I'm so pleased to hear.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:15:11
Just curious as to what percentage makes you generally right, 50%+ right?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:59:47


Segwit is an effective blocksize increase by 2.7mb when FULLY implemented by all parties. Lightning will reduce the RATE at which the blocksize will NEED to be increased.
Do not be confused the blocksize WILL need to be increased, if Bitcoin goes to 50k in a months time and lightning arrives do you seriously think people will pay 50USD to open a channel designed for microtransactions? No.
Now is the right time to raise the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:57:56
You have to be able to USE IT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. Lightning Network isn't even here yet, let alone working as intended. The blocksize should be raised.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:33:52
Salute the hero!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:21:21
Yeh, or you could just raise the blocksize to 2MB as an interim until lightning arrives and stop bleeding users into BCH in the first place. Or did the central banks tell us we aren't allowed to use BTC as a currency? Sorry, I forgot.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:32:06
This is weird. What Roger said is true.
If I went on "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire" and won then the show made me a millionaire....or did my own intelligence cause it. Both did.
Without Roger's tweet the fact is the sequence of events wouldn't have happened, he inadvertently made Andreas a millionaires. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:37:17
This is pathetic. Are you trying to bully him? Look at my name. That should tell you how low this is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:52:18
Yes it is. Its not just viable it is *essential* for Lightning to be able to work at all. No one will pay 40USD to open and close a channel on lightning to make micropayments.
The only other way lightning takes off is it the Bitcoin price drops, this is the only other way the fees will be low enough for lightning to be operational.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:45:09
Fuck off............
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:15:32
Why just considering? They should literally let people deposit them into the platform and then keep all the transactions internally and deal directly with Bitpay if they're scared to hold Bitcoin, no transaction fees nor delays and more profit. It's a no brainer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:38:36


Yes! It is okay, its VERY okay.....for who?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:14:10
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:52:02
Even the lightning developers don't have a clue when it will be ready. One was asked yesterday and he said "When its ready" to the absolute dismay of the professional programmer who was asking. Seems like certain people want the Bitcoin price to be capped/drop or its reputation to be damaged by abysmal confirmation times/fees.

**This is bullshit**. Those wallets include HUGE exchanges where every one of those customers has their OWN Bitcoin stored in the same wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:35:04


I do, so its okay.

LOL number 2 is brutal. "Does your daughter still think shes clever since you humiliated her on a global scale and it turned out she was right, and you wrong?"
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:23:07
Fucking exactly, but the dumb mods in this sub don't let us talk about doing it and now look whats happening, BCH is literally shitting on Bitcoin SPECIFICALLY and ONLY because we didn't increase the blocksize from 1 to 2MB.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:57:33
If you made that then seriously, fuck you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:07
WRONG. We need a blocksize increase since yesterday. WHY WONT YOU LOT START REALIZING THAT THIS IS WHAT WE NEED???????????????????????? LIGHTING DOES NOT FIX THIS WHEN THE PRICE OF BTC IS THIS HIGH WITH THIS BLOCKSIZE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:31:02


No, this proves me wrong.
