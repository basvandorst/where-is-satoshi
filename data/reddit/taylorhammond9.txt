You know what, fair enough. I'm not educated on the subject, all I see is people losing half a million in bit coin, and it just looks like a mess. I don't see that much with doge.

I disagree, at this moment it's more stable than bitcoin (sounds hella weird to say)
I just think the bot that just goes around saying insufficient funds is stupid. It's just a troll bot. It's not the real thing. And yet people will continue to upvote it, and downvote me when I say anything about it.

So what? Why does that matter?

I'm in the same boat as you OP. I'm 17 few 7 more months. My Paypal account got locked until I could confirm to them I was 18, got all my money out though.
I'm nervous to sign up and get some money in there if they are going to pull the shit Paypal did and lock my account (and possibly take the money if that's what they will do).
Can't wait until I'm 18, so stupid that this magical number is effecting whether or not I can spend my own money through websites.
*edit-* Thinking about it just makes me more mad. I can be trusted with a job. I can be trusted with a bank account. I can be trusted with spending my own money. I can be trusted with driving (and buying) my own car. But connecting a bank account to a website to use the money you earned on your own just because of a generic number that doesn't *really* effect how mature you are, but is just a bullshit number? Nah, go fuck yourself.

This was hilarious the first time, now it's just stupid.
