Right, like Solyandra, Cash for Clunkers, and "shovel-ready jobs"? We may as well just have printed cash and then burned it. The only way the economy has continued to float along so far has been via *massive* currency inflation, nationalizing 90+% of home mortgages through Freddie and Fannie, and cannibalizing giant banks like Lehman Bros. Yeah, thay Krugman sure is a genius, his master plan was *sovietization*! I could surely hold my money in a bank with a negative interest rate I suppose, or I could just hold it in bitcoin which is long-term deflationary. Let's see, as a billiionaire, which country should I invest my money in, one with a high corporate tax rate and a low interest rate like the USA, or one with a low corporate tax rate and a high interest rate, like Hong Kong? Tough call. The left is just on full denial mode of the stagflation they have now caused, and begging everyone to just pay higher housing prices on longer terms and get nothing for interest on their savings account, to pay for their ivory-tower policies. How about some more giant 0% loans for the largest domestic *and foreign* banks in the world, expensed by the FED in USD, I'm sure that will help the American middle class!


What you are talking about is fascism.

I'll believe there is a "capitalist" camp in China when they stop printing yuan at a breakneck pace. That's just corporatism, there's no free-market involved. Maybe people are pulling out of China because their factories keep blowing or because their banks lie about their balance sheets. Maybe China is in the first stages of it's inevitable housing bust. Whatever the case, to say that "nothing happened" on the Chinese stock markets over the last couple weeks is a little absurd.

Yeilds barely moved because sentiment that China is currency solvent hasn't changed. Get your facts straight, because the stocks went into freefall right after the T-Bill sale, not right before. They were already up 80% on the year anyhow so this whole China panic is just their latest inflation-crazed bubble popping.

2 weeks ago SSE composite started a slide from 3900 down to 2900. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:14:37
So when you said "nothing happened", you meant, "nothing except for the largest single-day drop in in Chinese stock composites, ever".

No, it's because the market for Chinese T-Bills is completely *artificial* and has no real supply/demand relationship built in, because any country can just print up more T-Bills whenever they want and sentiment in China's currency solvency hasn't changed, so the rate at which lenders are willing to lend China money hasn't changed.

Chinese markets halted trading on an emergency loss-stop. But other than that, yeah, nothing.

Yeah they could always nationalize more property and print more money! The point I'm making is that those "policies" that you are suggesting are immoral and tantamount to de-facto plutarchy. Neo-feudalism, nothing more. This is exactly what bitcoin was invented to stop.

I'm not arguing that stimulus is pointless, I'm arguing that what you call "stimulus" is the same thing I call "theft" and "slavery". Maybe it balances the books, but only at the cost of human blood.

Yeah, banks suck Everyone should just use unregulated foreign exchanges. Makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:42:36


You are misusing that word. It has resulted in massive currency inflation, but only mild *price* inflation. Why is that? Because all the new currency went into the accounts of the 1%. That is literally what you are defending, the 1% trying to print themselves into unlimited power over everyone else.


So if nobody holds any money in banks, then why would negative interest rates on bank holdings be an effective tool for economic recovery?


Not even close, and this argument proves to me that you are an amateur in finance.

lists of Tor IP addresses for blacklisting.
 


onlynet=tor, which leaks connections on the P2P network with the real

Very interesting, indeed.
