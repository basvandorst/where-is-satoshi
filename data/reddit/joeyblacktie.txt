Thank you for shooting the link. Going to read into it tomorrow for sure

so let me pick your brain on something since you mentioned the ETF's and property. I definitely agree with the property part and would love to dive in on that, but You know how Youtube starts twisting around the suggested videos when you get on certain tangents. Ever since I started to soak up everything i could on BTC i've gotten hit with a lot of videos that say not so good things about the state of the global economy. Some of it is hype and some of it sounds very well thought out. IF there are bubbles that are going to pop, seems like buying property should be put on hold  until that market crashes. As for the ETF's how resistant would they be to a crisis? I don't want to feel like I'm drinking the koolaid, but it seems like BTC might be safer to an extent. By all means, shoot me the devil's advocate to my thinking to keep me grounded. I genuinely like to hear any and all sides

ahhhhhhh you're right. I'm playing around with the BTC-USDC trading pair for my next buy. Everything makes sense again.
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:13:04
Hey guys/gals. So I've been playing with the idea of using fiat to buy stablecoins like USDC, then using that to purchase BTC. What would you say are optimal strategies in buying/selling this way? And just in case someone asks, I like to do limit orders sometimes the fiat just sits. figured why not take advantage of the interest you can get certain places.

@_date: 2019-11-14 05:27:03
i like buying what I can on the dips, and I have to say that the Youtube TA channels have been really great in this regard. While I wouldn't ever touch leverage trading, I have found the analysis to be valuable in finding PROBABLE price targets. Bitcoin does what it wants of course, but i tend to do a good job at getting decently close to the bottom of the dips this way.

is it too tinfoil to think that some big manipulation is possibly on the horizon of the Bakkt launch? I havent been active in the community for long, but there definitely has been a patten of big money saying one thing and doing another. First in recent news was the GS release telling investors to buy in. Now, we have this big news about Bakkt and everything seems hopeful for a huge breakout. But it feels...too bullish. Am i crazy for thinking this? I mean, if we're talking about real big money entering in (assuming it not already priced in) wouldn't ICE want the prices nice and low to create a bigger splash for when their investors come in? I feel like if whales where capable of doing so, they would try to do something to tank the price right before Bakkt releases.

@_date: 2019-08-28 04:43:28
IMO it has a use. I laugh myself with the moon-boy predictions and the clickbait titles, but there is something to be said over the analysis and using it to make informed decisions. 
As dumb as they can get, I would have to give them some credit in getting me to understand charts and setting reasonable buy orders when DCA'ing.

So i've seen some YT videos mentioning a CME futures "gap" in the 8k-8.5k region. I've read that said gaps tend to get "filled". My question is what are CME gaps? What does it mean when they get filled? I'm not a trader mind you, but it gets brought up from time to time whenever price prediction comes up.

There will be a day in the future where bitcoin will have a value beyond our imagination, and they'll laugh and marvel over there being people who complained about sats being given away because it cluttered a thread.

I like the idea of staking/getting interest for parking your btc with companies, but I hate the idea of giving up my custody. Do you think there will ever be a time where we can safely use these services? If so, what do you think will need to happen? Better Regulation? Better Tech?
@_date: 2019-08-16 01:59:10

i saw someone posted in another thread about "tethering up" when cashing out on btc. Selling and putting into a stable coin...what's the strategy in this?

@_date: 2019-08-14 04:55:42
essentially because of deposit limits and wait times when trying to onboard again correct? That makes sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:13:18
Well I just had it delivered and installed yesterday. Every person who asked so far replied with "What?!?" when i told them it was for bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:53:45
Lol in my my I envision shady people dumping wads of 20's to their hot wallets, wearing sunglasses and baseball caps to obscure their identity. It's probably be less interesting than that though.
@_date: 2019-12-13 03:29:34
it's definitely low, but I'm treating it as more of a passive income than full fledged operation (i already have enough on my plate running the actual business). The % is 4% off the transaction amounts, but again, for me and the reasons why i didn't just buy one, it's a good fit.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:53:30
I like that before you can even buy they have a disclamer pop up that you have to accept, which details this very thing. Granted human nature means most people will gloss over, but this will definitely be on my radar. For reference, I keep it quiet in my store and I'm always in the front if someone is in the store, so it would be very hard for me to miss something sketchy going on.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:51:53
absolutely...but in the long run that doesn't matter since i'm in it for the long haul. More importantly, since i won't convert to fiat i view it technically as a loss for the store (fiat that i normally would use to pay bills)
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:19:04
Personally, i think this thing is going to sit virtually untouched....I have a feeling my buddies and I will use it more than anyone else....that is....until we start the slow climb up. I imagine once the retail FOMO hits, there will be quite more usage. 
I do hope to plants the seeds along the way for the curious. You gotta think for someone with no knowledge, they have to go through that journey to be ready and willing to dive in.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:30:49
Yes it is! I'm sure the better pictures I took will be updated, but seeing as how it got sent to them about 20 minutes before i posted this I'm guessing it might take a day or two.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:12:10
If they want to give up their sats I'm not saying no
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:18:03
I actually love the idea if you guys want. I'm just as curious as to how many people use it, the types of people, and perhaps any other notable info.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:49:58
Glad to help! Coinflip handles the map stuff.
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:17:06
I just re-noticed it. You got an eagle eye for the details lol
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:56:27
I'm viewing it as a real world adoption experiment. If this thing just collects dust I'll be taking in $150 I wasn't making before. But it would just be awesome to see how it works as the price makes big moves. In a small way I'll be a part of that and that's enough for me.
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:43:24
that's awesome for you to say. i really appreciate it!
@_date: 2019-12-13 06:16:10
Couldn't tell ya since they're renting the space and provided the atm. I'm guessing several thousand if my memory serves me right from when I considered buying a similar one and searched for them online
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:14:46
No cost to me. The company coinflip pays me to put the ATM in my store and handles everything.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:53:44
This one took about 5 weeks from signing the contracts to being in the store. Hang in there! I'm really interested to see what happens when bitcoin starts pumping. Like what will the FOMO look like in person if at all.
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:45:17
Well at least from my angle it's pretty straight forward. They handle everything and cut me a check for renting the space. $150 a month or a % of the transactions up to $500 (which ever is greater). 
I suspect the greatest challenge for me is having to be the ambassador of sorts for the people that know nothing about bitcoin but are curious about the ATM when they see it. I don't want to be dismissive if they have no clue, but I also don't want to cram them with too much information that they technically should do a little homework on themselves.
@_date: 2019-12-13 03:56:54
If someone came in and wanted to pay in bitcoin I'm definitely not turning it down. I'm all for it.
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:30:52
yes of course.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:41:30
I meant it more in how i perceive it. If I do say $1000 in sales by btc, that's $1000 that's going into a wallet and not coming out. So in the day to day operations that's $1000 less i have to pay my bills. so kind of like a loss.
@_date: 2019-12-13 07:11:56
For the space it takes, and the zero effort I have to devote for running it I would say it's appropriate. I posted in other comments on this thread the money involved. What I'm really curious is how it's going to play out with people who don't understand it coming into the store. I'm sure some interesting conversations are sure to follow
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:10:28
more of a traditional smoke shop than anything. The ATM just happened to fit by the vape section lol. They found me and i'm sure they chose my spot because of the location and hours i have.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:20:02
it was on the table for a bit, but for various reasons this was the safer play for me.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:11:18
In about a month I'm going to post a report with some stats on how it's going. stay tuned!
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:22:39
I hate scammers. Deal with it from time to time in various other forms and I shut that shit down. I don't care if i ruin someone's hustle, they're not paying my lease to use my store to help them.
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:10:28
Renting out the space in my store (I thought it would be the best route for multiple reasons) It's a CoinFlip ATM, which has 6.99% markup. Buy and sell. 
The KYC is actually pretty decent. For under $900 all it asks for is a name and a number to register. The number does come into play with a text verification. In theory, however, I don't imagine it being very hard to slap a "John Doe" in the text field with some sort of burner phone to register. Then use whatever wallet to scan the QR
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:01:11
I tried to get them to pay me in bitcoin, but they said they don't do it for accounting reasons :/
@_date: 2019-12-13 07:08:43
Yes and in general there is a subtle effort to nudge the customer towards cash. Normally though the fees we pay are passed on to the customer by baking it into the price. A discount for bitcoin is a little tricky. At least at the point in my planning. I'm torn about it bc I see the merits of incentivising adoption, but I'm kind of a dick when it comes to discounting things in general. I try to get sales more through my sparkling personality ha ha
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:41:56
In the beginning (several months ago) I was looking into buying my own and supporting it. I came to the conclusion that the logistics involved were a little too much with already running my actual business. 
Coinflip cold called me last month and I definitely liked what i was hearing. Checked it out in comparison to other similar services and I liked the idea even more. Mind you I'm very paranoid about ANYONE calling me first to sell me/sign me up for something. Everything they're offering (backed up in writing) works perfectly for what I need to feel comfortable with them.

@_date: 2019-12-13 05:35:45
If you were looking at the bitcoin atm map, then yeah I saw the same thing. I guess a minor plus is that the other ones seem to all be around 11% in fees where as the Coinflip one in my store is 6.99%.
In the end it's not as cheap as going through an exchange, but this ATM's surprisingly lax KYC is really interesting.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:29:17
I'm not sure, but i would default towards $900 a day. I was asking the sales rep tricky questions like this and I could tell he was taking the high road with legally proper but somewhat vague answers. Didn't want to poke too hard for fear that they would view me as someone trying to do launder. Can't have them pulling the ATM so soon after getting it lol.
@_date: 2019-12-13 04:01:54
sir/ma'am I would be honored for you to be my first btc transaction if you do come by. I don't know how it is down in LA but up here people don't know a damned thing about it. It's either a finger on the pulse of how early we are in adoption, or there are some serious sleeper holders lol.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:50:38
It's funny because I was wanting one for a bit and then a sales rep from them cold called me last month. I took it as a sign after making sure it was legit.
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:34:24
6.99% + $1mining fee. Won't beat buying on an exchange but not bad for buying with cash in hand.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:31:12
I just noticed it ha ha. I thought at first it was a stylized effect but yup...the B has seen better days. Either I got a relocated one or it got hit in transit.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:58:30
My guess is that Coinflip wants presence in the area. My store happens to be located in a very good spot logistically. I imagine from there they'll spread out from me. I remember being a stickler for what their proposed saturation rate was going to be and they said they aim to spread ATM's out a few miles from each other.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:55:41
If anyone wanted to buy with Bitcoin in my store, I would do it with no hesitation.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:11:42
that's interesting you mentioned that. When i was playing around with the ATM last night, before you can buy, a big old disclaimer pops up saying the same thing. I guess it'a a big problem
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:51:40
Lancaster, CA. If the vape bans get a little crazy I'm planning to transition heavily into glass as a pivot to offset. I'll let you know and we can do some business.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:49:23
It's a base of $150 or 4% of transaction volume (up to $500), whichever is greater for the month

that shipping charge would sting on your end though.

@_date: 2019-12-13 08:15:27
@_date: 2019-12-13 06:23:04
I've debated this and while I can't rule it out, I would have to see how it pans out as far as the demand goes for people wanting the option (my profit comes mostly from quantity of sales, so 10% has the potential to cut deeper than I might like) As a HODLER every transaction I would do would be untouched, so it could backfire if I get too cute with discounting. Incidentally, I actually have my business for sale and I DO offer a 10% discount if they pay the full amount in btc.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:43:13
oh yeah i understood. And yes I will be watching. I have the ATM strategically placed close to the register to make sure it's just a little more difficult to mess with with.
@_date: 2019-12-13 03:04:01
It uses about 20 watts, so not very much power. Plus it only eats up less than a 2ft x 2ft spot, so overall It's a net positive for space I wasn't using anyways.

From a legal standpoint I'm merely renting the space in my store out to Coinflip for them to place and maintain the ATM. My tax implications will most likely be a 1099 like any other payment i get from companies

@_date: 2019-12-13 05:45:23
The total for the month. No daily maxes. Honestly I'm keeping my expectations low. It would be awesome to hit that $500 consistently, but I'm content with the $150. It'll be really interesting regardless to see first hand how much it's used.
@_date: 2019-12-13 18:31:54
pfftttt of course I do!
