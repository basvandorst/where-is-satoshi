There are efforts underway to solve this problem with side-chains. See [this news article]( for more info.
There was also a Bitcoin [talk]( about it 2 days ago.

I doubt they are going to get much adoption seeing the reaction to the Oculs Rift acquisition.

In my search for cool paper wallets, somehow I missed this one.
I'll add the ones I know about:
And now:

He might have tried to order a hit but the FBI had him by the balls the whole time and it was even them who suggested to put the hit on the mods.
Ross might have been hungry with power but he's now caught in the legal system of three letter agencies and basically has no defense whatsoever.
I am going to donate a small amount.
@_date: 2014-04-17 00:16:44
I will donate if they will support Linux.

Clicking on "News" takes you from a vibrant blue color scheme to a dark and cold black and grey color scheme. Needs work.
And why haven't they incoperated the "official" Bitcoin logo with two strike-throughs into Unicode yet? It seriously can't be that hard.

Basically, it will destroy Bitcoin.

Coinbase's reasoning for the off-blockchain transactions is that they have more transactions than the Bitcoin blockchain can handle and they need much faster confirmation times.

At first they look the same (especially at the edges) but on closer look, the lines in the middle are different. Some of the lines go different directions and are shorter. If this is true, that is lazy work on behalf of blockchain.info.

I think it was just one guy who wanted to make easy money like every other altcoin. Auroracoin wasn't and still isn't official in any way.

By not releasing the source code to the server software, you are actually decreasing the privacy of Mycellium. If you won't allow community servers, how do I know you are not profiling my wallet balance and selling it to third party entities?
@_date: 2014-04-16 07:57:03
Yeah imagine how confusing that would be. Seriously, even the currencies of the countries you mentioned have codes that distinguishes them from each other. Your point would be valid only if Thailand used a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin, then we could call them Thailand Bitcoin and just regular Bitcoin.

IP addresses are enough to build a profile if you combine it with meta-data from something else like e-mail's or advertisement links.
My point is that if they force me to rely on their 3rd party servers instead of offering the source code and allowing community servers (like Electrum does), I cannot know what they do with *my* data. I'll rather use a wallet that is fully open source.
@_date: 2014-04-18 08:12:14
There are some shortcomings of Mycelium:
Mycelium doesn't support Hierarchical Deterministic wallets and therefore doesn't support change addresses. 
Also, the server software is not open source.
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:59:52
Yes that is so super simple, why haven't they thought of that before?
Lawyers don't work like that. Lawyers cost money and Ross needs money for a lawyer right now.

Thank you for your excellent recollection but you need to provide sources for your info if you want to call this piece complete.
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:34:32
Yes! Two currencies with the same symbol is confusing. Either incoperate the "real" symbol into the Unicode  standard or adopt Ƀ.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:59:31
The Mycelium server software is not open source.

You should get your facts [straight](

Quick question: Do you foresee a future where Notepad++ is ported to Linux?
@_date: 2014-04-10 09:51:58
What about the source to the server software? 
@_date: 2014-04-13 10:37:38
I have always wondered what would happen if one of the large mining pools would suffer network outage or power outage. Would the other pools be much closer to 51% hashrate? What if two large mining pools go out at the same time?
What I'm getting at is that the posibillity of a 51% attack on the blockchain doesn't seem far off.
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:22:57
You make a very valid point, one that I haven't thought of before.

How much bandwidt (in MB or GB) does a full Bitcoin node use per month?

Still more threats. Now he's saying he knows where Andreas lives.
