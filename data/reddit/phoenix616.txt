You can decompile it. Also Apple could just require the devs to submit source and compile it themselves if they wanted to. (They don't need to 'though. They already have automatic code checks in place)

I'm not sure that this is impossible to achieve. Such code follows certain patterns and should be detectable by a properly trained analyzer.
Actually they also could just check the couple of new crypto wallets with a more manual approach. There can't be that many new crypto wallet apps being submitted every day.

I nowhere said that you shouldn't trust anybody but yourself as you should be able to tell from my previous comment.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:13:31
I wanted to point out that you shouldn't blindly trust a random program by some unknown dev, you wouldn't trust that guy on the street to sell you a "new" car without at least checking if the motor and breaks work, would you? And if you don't know about cars (or code) you would find someone you trust (maybe because it's your childhood friend ore maybe you just paid/have a contract with him) to check it for you. (Hint: You don't pay the appstore to check that stuff, they are protecting themselves)

It's not like they could check the source...

The problem is that Apple already checks apps for malicious code so people are already trusting each app they download from the app store. (It's the Apple walled garden we are talking about, not Android's kinda open ecosystem)

Sorry to break it to you but nothing happens for a (humanly intended) reason. 
People stumble through their lives rather aimlessly trying to do the best they can with the limited information and resources provided to them.

They can't. That's why you should only (at least for critical stuff like money) run open source programs which's code you (or someone you trust) revived and only self build/from trusted sources.

People should learn and inform themselves before pumping thousands of dollars into a random website. The warning signs regarding coinbase are everywhere. Sure it is not still not okay what coinbase is doing but some of the blame also lies on the users choosing such a shitty company.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:08:15
Well currently there are still new coins created and fees are just an extra. Also I don't believe anyone (in their right mind) is doing small transactions at all on the chain right now so if these were done with Lightning no profit out of fees would be lost. (And doing any large value transactions on Lightning would be foolish as lined out in the article.) Additionally opening and closing channels still costs fees.
You also have to remember that even if some miners stop mining Bitcoin then the difficulty will fall or others will start to mine again even if they just get a small profit out of it. And hardware only gets more efficient and powerful over the years so the actual cost of running a miner could also be lower in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:27:26
Paid with a low few a couple days ago and it confirmed in 3 hours or so...
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:45:44
Yeah, I would love if more vendors would accept actually fast and cheap coins like Dogecoin but we have to face the fact that we are currently at a point were only one cryptocurrency can be adopted by the public as they don't seem to understand the similarities (and also differences) between all of them. So we have to push solution like Lightning now as we can't wait another ten years until the general public has understood the concept behind multiple cryptocurrencies (and their easy exchange with atomic swaps which even in the community aren't widely used yet)
So as far as I can see it the timeline will be (if nothing big changes in Bitcoin):
1. Parallel adoption of Lightning and atomic swap solutions 
2. Battle between offchain solutions and swapping altcoins for micro transaction market share (I personally would prefer the second one as it can be more dynamic)
All of this wont happen if SegWit doesn't get adopted and with that fees get reduce (and maybe then people stop setting ridiculous high fees...)
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:56:33
Paid something like a 5$ fee recently on a 150$ transaction and bitpay confirmed it in 2 hours. So it seems that all of your values are just wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:50:06


This seems to indicate that the GUI would have any influence on the actual functionality of the feature (which is all that matters for exchanges) which it has none. SegWit itself is fully implemented in core, the only thing missing is the GUI which websites and hosted software will not care about.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:44:54
Yeah, same reason here, just bought a new keyboard couple days ago and paid with Bitcoin just because. Set a low fee and it confirmed in a couple hours, still acceptable imo.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:34:22
All that the bch devs did was change like two numbers though? (Blocksize and block time) There's no real improvements in their fork (like SegWit is)

@_date: 2018-01-29 21:56:08
Sure, but it's one of the most used points against it álà "They stole the name" which in itself is bullshit tbh., they shouldn't have called it anything but by the BIP number and tried to fork and make it the real Bitcoin. That they started to promote it as Bitcoin Cash shows that they didn't believe in it from the beginning. They probably just pushed it got some quick profit or to create chaos. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:48:31
SegWit is the evolution.

I bought something with Bitcoin a couple days ago. Set a custom lower few and it got confirmed in 3 hours... something here doesn't add up.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:16:27
They might have some issues due to the large amounts of people wanting to trade currently but when trades get in they always execute. Also I never had any issues with loosing coins in the deposit/withdrawal process so there's that. 
Besides that it was just meant as an example of an exchange working directly with a real bank. (the German Fidor bank in that case)
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:19:14
The technique for decentralized exchanging of different crypto coins is already here: atomic swaps. I'm not sure how that scales though.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:24:29
Crash? It's still up several hundred percent in comparison to a year ago, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:32:19
The thing is: They are not cheap nor fast. Bank transfers take a couple of days to actually reach your account and payment systems like paypal or amazon also [cost a percentage]( of the price.
The difference to Bitcoin is that the fees and the transaction time is only noticeable for the seller, not the buyer. (Transaction time when the seller tries to withdraw the money to their bank account or doesn't get paid until the end of the month depending on the plattform)
If sellers would start directly accepting crypto currency payments instead of relying on non-trustless payment processors that mimicking paypal (e.g. by selling on OpenBazaar) then the prices for Bitcoin purchases could actually be lower as the seller almost instantly receives 100% of the price. (Obviously this would require a more stable Bitcoin to USD exchange rate)
As for the convenience: you can make (almost) one-click payments with bitcoin too. (Depending on your wallet you might still need to confirm it, which I prefer)
Also Bitcoin is like cash (as in you actually own it) but it works on the internet. That's the convenience. You don't hale to rely on and trust third party banks/payment processors to make purchases on the internet. No longer will your account get frozen just because you bought a totally legit item from a seller that also sold drugs in the past or your transaction monitored and delayed because the receiver had a foreign sounding name...
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:52:24
Not sure what you mean that you kale to pay with their wallet software? I bought something last week with them? (Granted that was like $150 so your claim might hold true for microtransactions)
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:53:23
Maybe try a few that is a bit more in the range of the ones PayPal/credit card payments take? I would bet a transaction confirms rather quickly if you do that.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:03:20
Tbh. some of these numbers seem really off. Either you set a very low fee that you are willing to pay and your transaction will take a while, maybe even get replaced **or** you pay a high fee and it gets confirmed rather quickly. You don't have both, you as a user can choose what you prefer. (In difference to traditional banks and payment providers where you have no influence on transaction speeds or fees besides your choice of the company)
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:49:45
Just got the a new keyboard today that I paid for with Bitcoin. Is that not spending?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:28:16
Why are you contradicting you own point? Also most people don't use core as a desktop wallet nowadays and the backend already supports segwit. There is no (technical) reason for exchanges/payment processors to not support segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:21:30
They were "ready to start implementing the changes to support segwit" but people interpreted it as "ready to activate segwit support". (Which I personally would expect when you say that, all the code is open, there was no reason to wait)

An exchange where you are directly trading with your bank account (like on Bitcoin.de or Kraken) is (with the downside of having to rely on centralized banks) a lot safer.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:38:06
I think Jim would use an SPV wallet and not wait to download 180GB before being able to receive coins. (And these wallets will probably all implement Lightning directly if their devs are smart)
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:09:32
Yeah, the amount you pay isn't really suited for onchain transactions currently.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:23:18


At least with altcoin exchanges the reason for that is pretty clear: You could take them completely out of the equation by using segwit and atomic swaps to trade bitcoins/altcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:35:01
Well the normal time of 6 confirmations is 1 hour so it's "just" the double. But I agree that it would be a lot better if it were faster. Can't wait for Lightning to get adopted.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:25:43
Bought my new keyboard with it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Had to use bitpay though so no real Bitcoin usage :(
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:54:23
Why would you set a fee that high for such a small and meaningless transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:42:32
GDAX is for professional traders, the ones that make them money by trading so they give them some other perks like free withdraw which they will do seldom. The Coinbase site itself is used by many that don't know anything and they are profiting off of that inexperience. One of the reasons I cont use them.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:23:57
Also exchanges will loose profit once people start using segwit for direct altcoin exchange with atomic swap so they have an incentive to not support it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:48:05
The fees would be paid by the buyer though, steam would loose nothing if the buyer decided it was worth it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:20:58
With SegWit you can exchange coins with other persons completely trustless. The technique used is called atomic swaps. (You'd still need a place for fiat trading though but that too could rely on segwit scripts, although it wouldn't be as secure/trustless)
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:18:23
The keyboard cost 150€ so that would've been unlikely. Also I remember setting a relatively low one when I paid, maybe around 5€ total? Not sure how much exactly right now.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:52:30
It's not really tinfoil, that's called capitalism and maximising your profit. If I would have a company and some technology will threaten my profit I would only support it if it really gets necessary. (which is why we need to put pressure on exchanges that don't want to)
I'm not saying that they never will implement it or that every exchange is that short sighted. (e.g. exchanges could just offer tools for atomic swap themselves or build paid features around that)
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:53:29
What protocol is that?
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:01:05

@_date: 2018-05-14 11:37:51
This part is also important to mention: 


All you could withdraw is the duplicated coins that you got from the original hardfork last year, they never allowed trading or depositing it.
While that still begs the question what they will do with the coins that don't get withdrawn this email will probably get people who still haven't withdrawn them for almost a year to notice that they even have that coin than if that whole removal wasn't happening (and the urgency will help with that too).

I wouldn't call it "loose". They both got too big and different so they started splitting the companies in two in 2015 and that agreement included removing the prominent role in 2020 that paypal plays in ebay's system.

Democracy was the rule of the demos in ancient Greece. And who was a demos (=citizen) in Athen? The rich merchants and traders. They ruled. Not the people.
And now companies rule by Lobbyism which is basically the same thing as Democracy in ancient Greece.

The tl;dr is that the value of a crypto currency (especially a new one) is mostly defined by the cost it takes to produce new coins. So if the price is under that cost the coin is undervalued and will probably rise and the other way around.

So he entrusts a service with millions of dollars without taking the time to research it's credibility before? (A single search for "uphold" on would have been enough) Yeah, this is totally his fault. His best action would probably be to file for bankruptcy and try to get some money back from Uphold. He clearly shouldn't run such a business anyways.

Well at least with Threema you know that they aren't selling your data (you pay them so they have a proper business model, the closed source argument is still valid there 'though) and Telegram is in the process of open sourcing some of their code ( so that's a step in the right direction I guess.
But it's true, they aren't really secure as others could potentially decrypt it. (Wether it's via inbuild code you can't check because of closed source or via storing of keys on their servers and a user having to trust them not to do something evil) 
I guess a secure communication channel could only be established if the clients communicated directly without any server interaction in between them.

That's not the reason at all. Ebay and Paypal once were one company after Ebay bought them to do all the payment processing for them. Then they split up (probably because Paypal was getting too big on its own to justify having both companies under one management or maybe parts were just bought out)
Also Paypal will remain an available payment processor for Ebay after the Ebay-Paypal agreement ends in 2020, they just wont be used for all payments anymore and be featured alongside direct credit card etc. payments.

I wish exchanges would calculate their withdrawal fews more dynamically. Like "estimated transaction few + percentage of the amount/set few". That would combat these slow adjustments to transaction few changes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:27:49
They disabled it because of high transaction fees though (so a technical difficulty) not because of volatility (an economical problem).

That seems to be a proper wallet from what I can tell so you should be able to get your coins on both chains after the fork. It only matters where your coins are at the moment that the fork happens.

So what? Check it before pulling any changes from the remote repository. It's not like it gets automatically updated. Also you can see all changes made to a git repository, even [directly on github](
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:27:23


This is wrong. Forks are called the same as upstream projects by default.  Only the code's license could stop someone from advertising the fork under the same name as the parent which is not the case with Bitcoin afaik. (IANAL though)
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:16:34
Bitcoin.org has a [comparison of different wallets]( I suggest [Electrum]( or any other, non-centralized wallet. Once  the fork occurred there should be guides to get both coins out. (It boils down to transferring the real BTC to a newly generated wallet and importing the old wallet key into a 2X supporting wallet)

Security costs money. Sure proof-of-work is not the most efficient way (and concepts like proof-of-stake might be better in the long run) but it accomplishes what it's meant to do and which old tech couldn't: Trustless verification of transactions.

It's just like every other altcoin without market adoption or special features now. It probably will be delisted from most exchanges and very hard to even buy or sell soon.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:25:14
If my suspicions are right these forks will probably be a normal occurrence in the next couple of months if not years because they can't loose.
Every time they fork the main chain they gain money as they probably hold a large amount of Bircoins which they can basically double overnight. This will continue to happen until either a) people stop buying the coin (from them) or b) exchanges stop adding the forked coins that do not have network consensus.

Getting the money out of coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:52:12
Well the coin amount will *technically* be double, but the value will not be, you are right about that.

They are the exact opposite.
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:04:10

@_date: 2017-10-06 12:25:04
Probably, yeah.
One of my theories is that this is the true reason behind all this forking of BTC that is currently going on: The high value makes it possible to make some profit selling the forked coin before it crashes to nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:51:12
Not sure which "high fees" you are talking about. Bitcoin fees are [extremely low]( right now.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:35:49


I'm totally with you there. Just had a discussion about cryptocurrencies with someone at a party yesterday and the reason why he didn't get involved is because he feels like he can't really do anything with it besides hold. For him it doesn't make sense to buy Bitcoin just to sell it for fiat later (he wanted to actually buy stuff with it) because if he wants an investment then he can just uses a classic fond.

Well I personally don't necessarily agree with the criticism itself: I bought stuff from digital games over domains to actual physical products with Bitcoin before but it's not really that accessible for the normal, non-tech user. People want to buy on large platforms, instantly and without jumping through hoops like buying an Amazon gift card with Bitcoin first or having to search for the one shop that actually accepts Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:30:10
Well that trust isn't based on the value  though, it's on the inherit mathematically ownership and security of Bitcoin which no fiat bank can provide.
And yeah, in the end nothing really has any value beyond life itself and the time invested in it.

No, I belive that they should be truly decentralised like Bitcoin and others do it. They give people with different opinion the ability to fork both the blockchain and the codebase to just do whatever they want. (Which doesn't mean every person on the planet has to accept what they do) Tbh. one could do the same to Wikipedia too, all their content is under an open license.
Granted one could argue that a project like Wikipedia could be run on a voting base or as a DAO, but that brings other issues with it that make actually working on the project harder than it has to. I don't think Wikipedia's solution is perfect but its better than the alternative of total anarchy if you want to build a definitive and open online lexicon.
@_date: 2016-10-19 01:04:17

In an ideal world there is no block size limit. (As outlined in Satoshi's original paper)
Unfortunately we don't live in such world (yet). Most people don't even have fiber and have to put up with bandwidths below 1Mbit/s.

@_date: 2017-06-20 11:35:35
You are right that opening and closing would result in the same issues as sending two normal transactions, but while the channel is open you can send thousands of transactions which would (in the current state) way too slow and pricey for small amounts.
But I don't think that paying 10 bucks and having to wait an hour just to enable payments or redrawing your money is good either. The base tech needs to advance in parallel but I don't see a reason to not do both at the same time.
