I enjoy Copay  simple and easy  also the only windows Phone wallet + Ios + Android + PC + Linux + Chrome 
Also have the benefits of added hardware wallets like Trezor 
Breakwallet is also on IOS and Android 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:28:58
To the best of my knowledge, 
Trezor doesn't work with iOS  yet as iOS doesn't allow USD "On-The-Go" . I am pretty sure this would work once apple allow us to use  On-The-Go

I find it hard to believe that 119,756  stolen  BTC = 36.067%
That mean that the exchange held clients asset value total of 332,037 or $604 X $200,550,708
( total stolen 119,756 (36.067%) +  Total remaining assest of all user balance in BTC 212,281 (63.933%) = 332,037 
Come on ???
On BFX data  show that at the time of the hack 
USD lending $38,300,000
BTC Lending in USD $14,600,000
LTC lending in USD  $144,000
Total lending ~$53,044,000
At a max of 3x leverage, there must be at least $17,000,000 in trading account to borrow  from lender 
last time I look there was also ~$ 15,000,000 both the USD and BTC margin lending book . ( there was $8,000,000 alone on the FRR rate 
This doesn't include all the Hidden order
on  is show the last order book before the hack 
 BTC/USD  - USD Bids   $9,863,683
BTC/USD  - BTC ASK  31,112 ( &lt; X $604 = $18,791,648
Can you see what I am getting at ? 
I don't know the total of LTC + ETH+ ETC 
There is some user that say that Bitfenx OTC businesses had more volume than the spot market. 
I would think that BFX was holding $500,000,000+ of clients assets  and  $71,000,000 would only be around ~14% haircut 
Other question that need to be answered . How much has BFX and BFX owner put in out of their own pockets?

cex.io 
current price 0.00764999  but let calculate @ 0.009
150 GH/s = BTC 1.35 = $827 USD $898 CAD
 but you have to pay a fee  $0.24 per GHS
so 1 year contract
150 GHS = cost  $827 + (fee $0.24 x 150 = $37.5)x12 months) Fee $450 = $1,277
2nd year =  $450
2 years at Cex.io = 1727
2 years at VoS = $1800
the only benefits of Cex,io is that you can sell your GH/s or you can even buy the hardware and keep it at your house 
personally i rather buy at CEX.io at 0.006 or below = $550
i was lucky to get some at 0.004 :)

i am just hoping we can get back 25% of what we all lost

You can't roll up bitcoin and snort Cocaine 
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:23:33
if you brought 10GH/s it will cost you 0.076 or $46.60 USD + $ 2.0 monthly fee 
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:16:09

Good luck with the normal banking world , i am sure you dont send money to a ramdom bank before you have completely set up you account. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 12:14:46
What wallet where you using that has 2FA . Unless it was coinbase. 
Most the time the wallet get you to write down 12 or more words ( private seed)  
Just add those word into another wallet.  
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:50:40
sorry for the late reply . I was busy buying and withdrawing bitcoin from igot @ this discounted price. 
Thanks for helping out the community 
But you're not helping here
You ARE JUST A IGOT TROLL 
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:06:54
please change this as you didnt get scam
**YOU ARE THE LOSER scamming every one else** 
You just fail to complete what they have ask for KYC obligation. 
you should of completed this before you sent them money
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:16:00
i am sure around the world there is at least 100 new account open and thess ppl prob want to buy 1 BTC 
it just market manipulation 
Trader only make a little if they kept pushing it to $2000 , 
easier  to crash the price  to $100 and then push it back to $1000
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:15:13
Then Your a troll trying to create attention. I don't work for them and I have use both coinjar + Igot  and they are the same. 
 You need 2 documents and your done 
Grow up - all your doing is dragging down the bitcoin name in Australia 
If your too lazy maybe try - Just have to deposit AUD and give them your address

@_date: 2015-08-04 01:59:24
hard to believe that they charge 2% while other Australian exchange charge 0.5% - this is not including there always over price buy spread and under price sell spreads 
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:46:16

With their largest customer gone (Bitfinex)  there prob not going to be around much longer
Phil from Bitfinex has already said that there  no plan to sue bitgo as they don't think they could even recoup the legal fees 
@_date: 2016-10-02 10:51:17
Prob nothing ,  as it doesn't have a direct correlation .
Only after the world's market keep falling  they may turn to bitcoin  if it the only market going up. 
But if bitcoin is also slowly falling in price , they may just put everything it gold or  hold cash 
@_date: 2015-10-28 10:01:45

@_date: 2015-10-05 07:06:36
