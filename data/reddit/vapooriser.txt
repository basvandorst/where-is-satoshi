It might be at my parents house but that is a long shot too. I never switched computers or moved my wallet once so i never saved the passphrase, dumb move on my part.

Who doesn't want bits?!
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:19:21
Looks like you decided to stick more than just the TIP in!
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:27:15
And here I was thinking I was the only one with this...

How do you tip your bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-16 22:57:18
Good luck man, if I had that money to throw around I would definitely be doing the same thing as you.

You are holding 10k bitcoins and you are just finding out about one of the biggest bitcoin news sites? Im sorry but I'm going to have to call BS.

That really means a lot! We have put quite a bit of effort in it. Anything to take my mind off looking at the price of my portfolio ever few hours haha

All the t-shit designs are unisex, but yes we will be adding them to the women’s section shortly! Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:04:20
Thanks man! Personally, I haven't cared for any of the designs that have been pushed out so far. They usually just copy logos from Nike (just hodl it) with a slight twist, so I figured might as well make my own!
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:32:30
We do not right now, but we are working on it!
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:20:02
You are correct, we are working on expanding the women's selection as we speak. As for the T-shirts, they are all uni-sex and are always working on new designs, so hopefully when we can come up some that appeal to you as well! Thank you for the feedback!!
