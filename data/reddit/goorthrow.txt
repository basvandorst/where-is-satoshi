1. I have not shared this with my attorney
2. The punishment is beyond severe: Jail, a lifetime of servitude to others, a ton of restrictions - all the things to finally push me over the edge with government
3. No long-term jail, but anything could send me away for life.

Taking a moment to thank everyone for their responses so far. Thank you so much. I'm very grateful. I am weighing all options. The state will have a lot of control over my life. They're also forcing many other things on me. It's atrocious.

I love Mycelium! I've also been thinking about best practices for secure paper backups as well. I am familiar with Gyft. How would the service and gift cards benefit? Reduction of paper trail? Thanks for your response.

It's tech &amp; dating related.

I've considered this as well. Thanks for the suggestion.

I am U.S. based. No active passport. I'm worried about my only bank account being frozen (if they became so desperate for the dangerous person they've painted me to be). Allowed my wireless service to lapse. Haven't considered Internet connectivity beyond WiFi - I would think maintaining active cell service would be a no-no. And I'm not sure I could use a prepaid SIM with my phone.
I'm trying not to freak out. My heart is beyond broken about this. I'm trying not to freak or be scared, and as much as I struggle with current events, my matter, government, etc., death just can't be an option for me right now, but neither is sitting in jail or being a slave to the state.
I own mistakes in life, but not what I've been convicted of. No human being can say they knew what the outcome would have been.
