I'm out of Bitfinex as of now, it's way too risky to wait and find out. Too bad, their engine and trading platform was the best.

There's only one (bad) scenario: Tether(bitfinex) is not solvent, which will be a huge bust and will burn, not drag, the whole thing down.
Bank runs are scary.

Given the timeline I'd say it's likely related to Mac High Sierra root hack. 10.13 (first affected version) rolled in late september. 
Root access meant all of your security was essentially worthless. Cookies exposed etc. They could go in and out and remove all traces. If you're really curious, you could hire some professional data recovery for your disks, in case you haven't overwritten files from that period but i think chances for finding something are slim.
But anyhow, you should never ever use a third party for generating passphrases or checking passwords or whatever. Just type random stuff and you're good.

I think it's much bigger than that, Bitfinex managed to peg Bitcoin to a centrally controlled crypto (tether, which is also controlled by Bitfinex) and made that the reference price. USDT is useful on exchanges because it provides liquidity for actually shorting in USD (even if you actually short in USDT, not USD).
It's a huge systemic risk depending on one single opaque entity - Bitfinex/Tether.

It's not, most of volume is in USDT (Tether). Check out all the top exchanges, they're listed in USDT.
We're now seeing two markets for Bitcoin, a small one in real USD, one enormous fictional one in USDT, which is basically trading crypto for crypto.
I just wrote about it.

That's not the TLDR.
The TLDR is Bitfinex is pegged to USDT not USD.
They alegedly have been processing withdrawals the whole time. And reenabled deposits on 16 oct.

Oh you meant this year? Sorry.
Don't know why I thought of 2017.
