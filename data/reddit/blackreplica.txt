it took me about 30 mins to get my coins from my ledger wallet to bitstamp last night. So budget your time accordingly

I don't pay taxes on capital gains where I live, I spent about 70% of my free cash balance at the time of purchase on BTC. I tried to time the bottom, got in about 4.5K and went all in. I don't plan to sell anything before 40K and will never sell more than half before 200K

Its going to be a $700,000 lesson when BTC hits its fair value

I would etch the private keys on metal, just so it basically lasts forever but thats me. That just requires something like a crytosteel
Or just buy yourself a proper hardware wallet, get a 24 word private key, etch the 24 word phrase on something like a cryptosteel. You keep the cryptosteel somewhere safe and it lasts forever, and you always have the hardware wallet if you ever need to access or move your bitcoin quickly. Hardware wallets are really safe as long as you keep your 24 word phrase private and offline. Even if someone steals your hardware wallet, the device wipes itself after a few failed attempts at entering the PIN
Edit: Congratulations on buying your first bitcoin

I am a born and bred Singaporean  and BTC hodler. Crypto is nowhere near as mainstream as this post indicates

Is that metal plate for sale somewhere or a custom job? Only trouble is I guess I would have to manually engrave my seed phrases, instead of using alphabet plates like on my cryptosteel
