Appreciate your even keeled and reasonable stance. But don't you worry, the ETH is toxic too. The entire eco system is still maturing, some more than others. If you are interested in purely financial gain, it's good to be a crypto agnostic. If you consider the philosophy to be King,  which is what started this whole beast, then it gets pretty divisive. Like many here, I have paid with BTC, LTC, ETH et al. And I would agree that BTC does not have a stellar transaction UX regarding fee/transaction time right now. It will get better either through brilliance in engineering or greedy necessity. If there is a coin that will usurp BTCs market cap and use case, I don't believe it will be BCH, ETH or LTC. It would probably be something like ChaseCoin (tm) running on the ChaseChain (tm) technology, backed by the full faith and credit of J.P. Morgan Chase so Nana and Pappy Schneider from Pork Bend, ID can sleep at night knowing that the banks are keeping their hard earned dollars safe.

I would consider having a do over, it's best if your recovery phrase never touches an internet connection computer. Also there is simple redundancy in a good old fashioned pen and paper in a safe.

This is a fairly low effort FUDpost. Do you have anything productive to add? Both yourself and the author of that forbes article seem to have a tenuous at best relationship with economic fundamentals and market analysis. Either make a better argument or move on.
