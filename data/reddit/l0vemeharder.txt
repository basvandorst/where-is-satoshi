Realistically speaking, if it gets to 10k soon there will probably be a false wall at 10k, causing a FAST massive jump to ~10,500, then back to a steady decline.
ONLY if we get to 10k within a day or two.

You have a lot to learn but at 21 I dont blame you, at least you are being proactive and passionate.

I considered selling too then realized I bought my first coins for $19,9000 under 1 month ago. With today's massive dip, I am down close to 50%. I have seen the highs, but know how quickly it can crash back down.

You know what's worse is I had .2 coin last year (so I guess not my *first* coin) back when they were hitting the 1k wall, and I decided to get out after that mini crash. Seeing the 20k point caught my interest, but I picked a BAD number!

What a horrible 'entrepreneur' you are...maybe you should focus on that 'business' of yours and then you wouldn't have to beg for money on reddit

Yup, exactly the same as using a credit card. Not for the irresponsible whatsoever.
