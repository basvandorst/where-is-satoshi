We couldn't even push 15K in this one.   I doubt the next bill run will top that by 250%. 
In time, sure...but not in the next bill run

The ethernet jack on the Raspberry Pi 4 moves to true gigabit speed, for super-speedy wired networking and, as with the Raspberry Pi 3 B+, there's Power-over-Ethernet capability too (requires additional Raspberry Pi PoE HAT ).

As someone else has said, you don't have piece of malware on your machine (associated with this).  This is a super common scam tactic designed to far monger you into paying.
Process goes like this:
Website xyz gets its username/table dumped.
Usernames(and email records)/passwords posted to darkweb/pastebin
Scammer sends same email to every email with notation of password claiming machine is compromised, requesting btc or the world will end
Dumbasses pay to remove 'malware'
Scammer sits back and laughs
What should happen:
You get email with username/password
You go 'oh shit' and go change passwords on any website you reuse passwords on
You spend 2 hours time, and money
As a heads up to make it easier, if you're using chrome and save passwords, you can dump that table to excel for a fast find for ease of changing them
Going forward, use a password manager...make them random...don't reuse
Secure your super important accounts (email/bank) with mfa, or a super crazy awesome password.  Especially email...once that is compromised, the gateway to you being screwed is wide open with 'i forgot my password...email me a recovery' options

This is why I'm a hard believer and everyone sending me their private keys and letting me back them up

I have it on good record we would have been at 40-60k if not for that dip

If I were making 120k profit on a house sale (you neglected too say profit or not), and zero debt (car paid off/credit cards) and already had a place lined up within my means.... probably 60.

You're in luck!  You can cash it into your bank and buy an Amazon card with that!

This here.  May hit, but drop some too
Now....if we were talking 1mil mark ...yeah, that might be a stay up but... Nowhere close

You are technically correct.  The best kind of correct

Send them to me and I'll keep them safe for .1 btc
Serious answer.  Put them somewhere safe to you.  If someone has them, they effectively have access to your btc.

There's no way for them to mine the amount needed for that and return it to earth effectively (hell, we can't even get back to the moon!).  Much less, if they did mine it and return it, it wouldn't get distributed.  
Imagine what you want, but realistically, its clickbait
