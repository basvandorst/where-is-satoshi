It doesn’t matter. It’s like Facebook article headlines. Other people there aren’t listening. But they saw the same thing as me and they have no clue about bitcoin. So now they will just use this as a counter argument.

You are morphing Ponzi scheme in such way that you can pretty much say anything is a Ponzi scheme . So no

Hey if I could just not see it but it’s just in my face I just get so annoyed I don’t know what to do. Just wanted to vent
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:43:24
Then bitcoin itself is not a Ponzi scheme. That’s like saying Coinbase is bitcoin. Bitcoin fundamentally has no operator. Like learn yourself some bitcoin

What are you using to do this? Gdax?

lol he is. he was active on the forums. it's kinda of having a reddit and going through the comments and seeing their post and acting like they never existed.

My guess is he's rich and secondly, he's created something that could outweigh the money he already has.
by selling his zombie bitcoins. can you imagine the fear that will create. 
what fire that would give people who specific interests in seeing bitcoin fail. "bitcoin creator cashes out." they already try to confuse the violently unformed with this douche bag today. screaming "bitcoin jesus" says bitcoin is dead. or throwing "ceo of bitcoin.com cashes out all his bitcoin" you know how stupid majority of people. they will think bitcoin.com is analogous to bitcoin. a lot of people playing with bitcoin don't understand what it is and just seeing it as "people are making money of this"

What are you talking about? If everyone knew there wouldn't be a two valleys in bitcoin and two peaks in bch. 
The first valley for btc and peak for bch being prior to the announcement and then the second being after the announcement. people knew it was about to drop but didn't know the exact time and how. but a group of people knew within hours what was going to happen. 
Pretty much proving that some people with insider knowledge more than likely coinbase workers gave some people some insight that helped them get a head start. 
Like your statement isn't just asinine but is the opposite of what actually happened.

whoa. i guess i don't really know how to do this. still fairly newbie. and still using coinbase.

Cnn next week, “expert does the math, bitcoin and crypto currencies can be stolen by guessing where the secret password.”

If you are acting mainstream media isn’t stupid when it comes to crypto then you are either a shill or stupid
