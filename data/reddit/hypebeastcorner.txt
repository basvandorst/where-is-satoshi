Thanks doe the info, definitely working on getting a hardware wallet but Nano S is on backorder on site and I refuse to buy resell because I know they can be tampered with. Think it's safe to move whatever I have into btc wallet until Gemini verifies me? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:47:56
Definitely go speak with the guy who made the post seems like he's really trying to get this thing going. Probably gonna transfer my funds to Gemini before it's too late for me...sorry you have to deal with that this is actually bullshit.

I saw someone said their coinbase got shut down because they engaged in prohibited activity, he said "buying marijuana related items" (not sure what exactly. He claimed he did not engage in this activity and he had sent money to users. But even then my issue is coming from how did coinbase assume/know he engaged in this activity? That basically means they tracked his spending what wallets he sent money to and that kind of defeats the purpose of bitcoin being decentralized if your money is tracked...is he bluffing or is coinbase actually aware of where your money is being sent within their guidlines and prohibitions?

Took my money out of coinbase the second I saw there was a great amount of users experiencing this issue, I did not need to be next.

I'll try and find the reddit user and link to this statement, give me a little it's gonna be a tough find. Haha 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:34:53
I am here to address this issue. As a coinbase user I feel unsafe and am ready to transfer my funds into a different wallet as I feel one day I may become one of these frozen accounts for no reason. Should I fear? Should I move my funds into a different wallet? I myself have not been affected but I don't want to be...Read more into this and let me know what you guys think...

Sadly I can't find the sub that this guy was talking on. But yes thats true, its in the guidelines due to the whole silk road incident, but with that being said, your bitcoins will always be tracked back to you if they suspect your account is associated with any of those prohibited sales or buys? What can cause them to suspect that and allow them to basically track your purchase/sale...? I feel like its not as descrete as people make it out to be anymore

Thanks for the info, not really involved in any sketchy activity anyways but this has a lot of important info that people need to understand...
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:06:57
Probably wanna watch Banking On Bitcoin documentary on Netflix...
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:24:59
Thats exactly what I needed to hear, I was aware of a taxless period of holding but wasnt sure on the duration of the hold, thank you for the knowledge!
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:19:11
You guys wanna increase the value of crypto? Get chains like mcdonalds to adopt it. Imagine value.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:49:35
I'll check it out, thanks so much. Obviously taxes are confusing to someone whos never filed before and with the combination of bitcoin you have yourself a recipe. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:11:04
Yes, and it has some good historical points that need to be revisted 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:24:03
Anyone wanna explain if coinbase has "penalties" for sending a profit made off bitcoin to your bank account while leaving your initial investment in wallet and either keeping the profit USD or buying more bitcoin with that profit at a lower price during a dip? I havent held for a year yet and these tax rules are confusing. 19, new to taxes and bitcoin so if you feel like being a smartass do it somewhere else my feelings won't be hurt :) just need some wisdom is all. Thanks ahead of time.

Mind linking me or giving me more info on how much they decide to tax you? With that being said I have a small home business as a "job" selling clothing and I buy bitcoin with my profits but I'm not positive how to calculate taxes based on that being my only form of income...basically around a few thousands every few months depending on how much I can sell at a time. I'd like to take payments in bitcoin but I feel like that gets a little screwy since theres not much merchant protection selling items for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:01:41
Buy low sell high, but whats the best time to do this? Any advice? Thanks ahead of time! Personally, im in bitcoin for long term but trying to make smart large profits when applicable. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:17:58
Yeah trends seem like the way to go, just wanted any personal steps or rituals people go by if they plan on buying/selling at any time. Watching gdax mostly haha
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:46:44
Do you read a description on something while online shopping before you buy it?
Dont spend without knowing. Just because bitcoin is the topic its like people throw common procedures out the window...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:23
Outside the box thinking yes and logical 10/10
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:22:21
I'm 19, a college student(computer science/engineering if you care), no job but run a at home business selling things online. So, I use whatever I make to buy bitcoin with coinbase. Explain bitcoin taxation to me in a dumbed down kind of way anyone? 
*note* i'm not stupid i'm just young, we all start somewhere.
Thanks ahead of time!

Just wanted to say, yes theres a small rebound rn from yesterdays hectic "will it go lower?" scares, but realize this. For the bitcoin noobs it'll teach you when to invest, and not recklessly invest. Dont immediately spend your kids college funds on bitcoin at 19k (i've seen a ton of posts like that, no trolls actual people.) because you might be able to buy it lower. Dont be afraid to wait on your chance to buy bitcoin the bus isnt always leaving, after a increase like we've had its destined there will be a decrease. 
Finally the main topic I wanted to talk about is "BELIEVE IN YOUR INVESTMENT" believe crypto is the future, realize the power it holds. Small minds will call it a scam, media will always talk about a dip and say "bitcoin finally crashes" its all BS, a increase like we had they couldnt wait to talk about this dip. Trust in your cryptos. People use this everyday, the likely hood of "the end of bitcoin" happening tomorrow is unlikely. When centralized dollars arent working around the world, our cryptos will have value over the over printed dollar bills every country has. 
Buy the dip. Watch it grow!

Question, when making a profit on bitcoin how would you transfer that money to your savings? Sell your coin after it increases in value? And explain how the transfer works with like Coinbase or Blockchain for example, new to bitcoin obviously haha all answers appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:13:05
Thanks for the info man, I'll definitely do the 2 accounts thing thats a good idea. What wallet do you personally prefer? And you buy and sell? When you make profit, you havent really made the profit until you sell your coin? Feel free to message me as well if youd like! But thanks again
