I feel like Doge in where BTC was about 30 months ago. It's fun, can be mined on your home computer, and are easy to attain. The only thing different is that people take Doge more seriously.

I also have a Squarespace store, they have about 5 months before my contract is up with them, and honestly, not having bitcoin support is enough to make me move over to Shopify.
Stripe, the company that handles CC payments for Squarespace has a [landing page]( deicated to bitcoin. Haven't heard anything from them in a long time.
I like your work around and will probably do something similar. Thanks for the idea!

 If you explain any altcoin to someone they will say something like "oh, so it's like bitcoin, I don't trust that". If you explain ripple to them they think it's something new and innovative.

The idea is to make it cheap to assemble and small. 
The main case is 46mm x 21mm x 12mm, the thickness is mostly due to the large led thickness, so it could be much thinner.

As for the last point there are lots of securities paying over 1% a week in dividends, mostly mining companies. 
@_date: 2012-06-15 21:05:27
No tips, just lots of reading on the forums. 
@_date: 2012-06-01 03:11:58
That's for creating an ipo, which is what a mining company does. There are very few fees for us buyers. So far I've only been hit with fees for selling stocks and not buying them. 
The glbse market can be a little bit confusing at first but it will all make sense after a few days. Also keep an eye on the [securities]( forum on bitcointalk. Almost every company has a thread there. 
Right now most 1mh/s "forever bonds" are selling at about .3btc. But some companies have a strategy for expansion and some don't so it's a good idea to read a little about a company first. 
Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.

I do have Stripe working on my site, but it seems like the way Squarespace integrates with Stripe seems to be different than the way that the website describes enabling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:08:00


My thought was that BTC would be a general currency and different regions would use different alts. Like Europe might pick up ETH and parts of Cambodia might work mainly in LTC.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:37:53
How did you set it up? I can't seem to figure it out.
@_date: 2013-02-02 10:08:30

Addresses are where coins are sent, they all end up in your wallet. (someone might be able to elaborate on this).


You can, but it will be quite slow usually. [Here is a lot of info on hardware](


[Guiminer]( is very user friendly.


If they get access to your wallet they will transfer all the coins out of it and you wont be able to get them back. So be very careful.

The 8350 is a CPU not a GPU or APU. That said about 40mhash would be a good baseline based on the LTC wiki. 
I know I will get downvoted for saying this but, litecoin mining is more profitable right now. I suggest mining that and trading it directly to BTC.
Approximate profit would be about $0.40 per day mining BTC and $1.15 per day for LTC.
