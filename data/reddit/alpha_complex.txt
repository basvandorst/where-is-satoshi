Yes, the same private key is valid on both forks.

A logarithmic scale would make your chart more readable.

Yes, I believe that’s a safe way to go.

Let's see how it looks after the BitcoinGold fork.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:59:38
Once the uncertainty is out of the way, the surviving fork will recover in value.

Don't go in all at once. Start small, learn as you go.
Bitcoin has, on average, doubled in value every 9 months. But it also goes through multi-year declines. Don't expect much in the short term; only put in what you won't need for at least 3 years.

It's an attempt to take control away from Blockstream. 
Blockstream controls this subreddit (and censors it heavily). Read or to get the other side's POV.
2X will reduce transfer fees and delays. Blockstream prefers high fees.

If iota becomes popular, consider trying it. It has zero fees, and gets faster the more people use it.

As far as I've read, it's all safe as long as you don't spend during the day of the transition.

Development is moving fast. They just added a Lightning Network feature (which bitcoin has struggled for years to add, but failed so far). They'll be adding a privacy feature (like Monero has), and updating the wallet soon.

What in the world are you talking about? What simple change has Core made that has reduced congestion and fees? Whatever it is, it has failed spectacularly. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:58:08
Not even close
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:19:50
They're losing control entirely because they're unwilling to make a very simple change to reduce congestion and fees, and instead insist we wait years for their convoluted unproven solution.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:16:06
If bitcoin is to survive long term, it needs to be useful. High transfer fees will kill it if they persist. Lightning Network is a pipe dream, always 18 months away. Meanwhile transfer fees will reach $10 or more before then.

iota has zero fees, so is ideal for microtipping
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:12:30
Good, but probably not perfect. Keep some fiat in reserve, to buy more in case the price drops.
@_date: 2017-10-17 06:11:22
Interesting timing. Does that mean US customers can't own BT1 and BT2 tokens?

Bitcoin wasn't originally meant to have high transfer fees. It's unfortunate you're getting charged so much. The other cryptocurrencies are more reasonable, and some have zero fees.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:38:23
Welcome to bitcoin. Hopefully some day it'll be fast and have low fees like it used to.

Either sell at a loss and regret it later, or wait for the market to swing around, and probably change your mind. If you follow the herd, you'll always lose.
