Have you confirmed the tx on your ledger? I had the same problem earlier last week with a custom fee, after some attempts it worked out.

Does the ledger have any prompt on the screen?

I've been wanting to write this for a while. It's a simple text on what are the items to mark before you plan on going away, and how to let others know what are your assets. I hope you enjoy.

do you know what are the opening hours? where is it exactly located?

What I learned from Meni Rosenfeld was to split my 24 phrase into 4 eight word papers. Each of these pages could make a part of a 3 out of 4 multisig. Each of my four brothers has a page in his safe, and I only have the trezor.
This means that in order to hack you need to break into three different households and know that the piece of paper is worth something.
This gives you the advantages of a hardware wallet as well as a backup key.

I trust all my brothers, and they need at least three to betray me. Meaning that even if one is compromised, I can fix it.

And now your mom's pc is vulnerable so she can't keep her funds secure there.

just for argument's sake, this offer is not enforceable in Israel, as the Israeli Realtors Act of 1996 prohibits this activity and specifically allows only licensed realtors to be entitled for any commission. And even then, a signed agreement is required.

(decent disclosure, I consider Eli from bit2c as a friend. I bought around 0.5btc via their site in the past). 
The spread seems legit taking into account both the low trading volume and the liquidity. If you need to deposit $s in a foreign trading service, you need to convert your ils to usd and lose a bunch, then pay expensive commissions for wire transfers abroad. 
With bitusi you can buy the coins via credit card and pay 5%, no wire, no exchange fees, just swipe it at the embassy. Isn't that worth the hassle? Kind of. 
Now the fact that people are selling above market prices and selling at even higher prices seems ok. You need to understand the market here. Good luck withdrawing money to your bank account.

Apart from the fact that the scale that gold is shown on does not begin with zero.

You're the man. 
Will ask Meni &amp; Ayal to install in the embassy.

It's like the difference between medicine and alternative medicine. One is evidence and science based with a bug research community behind it and the other is basically a scam.

Actually, two things to do with this. First, it may have the funny papers with privileged men painted over them in beautiful colors. Some people like this.
Second, the raspberry pi inside might hold a private key for some actual money that is available in the ATM.

Actually, the F/M ratio was adjusted. The Israeli women in tech community is very active and includes groups like Miss Bitcoin and She Codes.

Also, might be actually more expensive than buying a pi and running one at home. The storage costs for hundreds of gigabytes and the active traffic will kill you.

And don't keep coins in exchanges.
These are the two major rules for hodling.

You mean "one real way and four ways to lose".

I don't think you'll make any bitcoins using an ipad. Probably better just to sell it for cash.
