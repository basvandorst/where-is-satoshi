I literally hate my life. I previously had 70 BTC and traded them away when they gained some monetary value, for CS:GO keys. I am so pissed at myself, I could provided for my family and done some great things in my community.
My life is a literal pit of depression and these posts, all be it really heart warming, make me sick to my stomach. Good for you OP.

Calling inside job. Why would anyone keep 62 million in BTC assets online? That makes NO SENSE.

@_date: 2017-12-07 03:36:13
God damn crooks.
@_date: 2015-12-16 03:53:36
Sounds like true scum baggery.

If you have a PayPal account, you should be able to get a PayPal debit card that debits from your account balance. I am unsure if PayPal limits that to US citizens only or not.

Awesome story. Just further confirms my confidence in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-16 03:54:46
+1 to this. Do it Steam. Make it happen.

Get PayPal debit card and use circle to debit the funds out. Works like a charm.

“The job as CEO of reddit is incredibly stressful and draining. After two and a half years, I’m basically completely worn out, and it was having significantly detrimental effects on my personal life.”
So basically... he's being a bitch... sounds like someone who doesn't wan't to put in the time to do the work... KTHXBAI!

So they generate the wallets and send them to me, I load them, seal them and give them, sound about right?
edit - OK I found how to make the wallets. Thanks man.

My experience with TruCoin was quick and easy. Although they charge 6%, its stupid fast.
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:56:03
I love you.
Enjoy the Gold for being awesome!

This is the most amazing display of pure idiocy of one human being I have ever seen.

I had almost 70 BTC back when was first gaining popularity. Needless to say, could have retired if I had it now. BAH.
