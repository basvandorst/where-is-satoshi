I can't sell for a while so that it'll fall under capital gains.  One can dream about selling though. :)

Wish they allowed Google Voice.  Oh well.

What are you going to do? Claim asylum from Uncle Sam? 
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:33:34
And that does not answer the question...

Remember that it wasn't too long ago that people were mining just hoping to get even one 'free' lunch a week.  That one free lunch has turned into tens or hundreds of thousands of USD for them!

Meet in a public place with security cameras and wifi.  I'd go with a coffee shop.  Talk to the person a bit to feel them out.  Do they feel shady?  No?  Proceed.
Show that you have the agreed amount of dinero.  Watch them do the transfer and confirm it was sent to the correct address.  Hand over cash.
Once that money is sent out from the account it's gone.  Assuming you double checked it was sent to the correct address, you're safe.

I have addresses generated by bitaddress.org that don't show up there.  I presume it's because there's no money in them yet.  So just checking the address isn't foolproof.

Probably because ASICminer already has their own working units.  BFL and ASICminer are apples and oranges other than the fact that they're both 'working' (I put that in quotes because of BFL) on ASICs.

There was a post a few days ago about those usually being bots.

To clarify on his point, there's probably no profit for you in mining with that machine.  Between electricity costs, machine degradation, cooling costs and other things you'll probably lose more money than you generate.

You'd take Paypal to SCC, not the buyer.  I mean I suppose you could sue the buyer too, but that's not practical for, among others, the reason you pointed out.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:54:35
Unfortunately there's no set answer to this.  Some say yes.  Some say no.  ASICs are undoubtedly taking over, but not many people have them.  Butterfly Labs is the mass-consumer ASIC vendor, but it's vaporware at the moment.  People ordered units 10-months ago and haven't received them.  Mining will be more profitable the longer that BFL doesn't fulfill their ASIC orders.
That said, the current ASICs out there are responsible for the huge increase in difficulty the other week.  And they aren't stopping.  So it's getting less and less worthwhile.  If you don't have cheap or free electricity then it's very possible you won't make a profit mining BTC, especially if you have to go out and buy a rig/parts to mine.

That's exactly what I was afraid of.  So what happens when the statistically impossible happens and two people use the same address?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:00:13
Try to reconfirm.  I just did it without any issues.

In all of Australia you can't find a free wifi?  Coffee shop?  Library?  Don't blame others because you can't think outside the box.

Afraid was perhaps the incorrect word.  It was merely used as an expression.  I'm not 'afraid' that North Korea is going to nuke the US, but I'm still interested in what happens if it does.  I more meant it like that.
I was playing around with using a paper wallet on litecoin last night.  My guess based on that is that if a person uses your private key then they get access to the money linked to that address.  Realistically there is no difference in importing a private key you know and someone else using the same private key generated elsewhere (aside from the statistical impossibility).  It'd be just as if someone hacked your computer and copied your private key that you had kept there.

You can buy them in person too.

No joke.  I first stumbled on bitcoins when it was about $0.08 each.  I had $30 that night and debated throwing it in there for the hell it.  Dumbass me fucked off to Papa Johns with that cash.

Why isn't mining for gold treason?

If you win the case then the loser usually pays the fees.  So that's not really an issue.


I can't find any indemnity clauses that really covers such a situation.  Their section 15 indemnification might sound like it covers them to a layperson, but it doesn't.  Otherwise everyone in business would have a clause that basically says lulz we can screw you by breach of contract and indemnify ourselves from that breach.  It simply doesn't work that way.  There's no other legal sandtraps either as far as my (legally trained) eye can see.
The only sticky point (and it's not one, really) is arbitration.  A cursory reading of section 18, Arbitration, would lead one to think that you can't pursue a small claims court claim against them.  But if you read carefully and do your research, that's not the case.  Here's why:


That doesn't sound like much, but it is.  It means you have to go read those rules, which are available here:  They use a weird search thing so I can't link you directly to their commercial rules; you'd have to navigate there yourself.
Anyway, the relevant bit from the commercial rules is:


That clause is included into Paypal's Terms of Service via reference.  So indeed you can take Payapl to small claims court!

I thought ASICMiner used their own hardware.  Your post implies they're using Avalon ASICs.  What gives?

And judging from your post you've been angry at yourself all the way back down to $70 as well.
