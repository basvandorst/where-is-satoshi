And, it's an extremely cool bar in a great location ...

Thanks, live here too. Was just reporting a conversation I found interesting. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:27:36
I thought that the interesting thing about that was that whole "thing" of unexpected value – value that accrues from an anomaly, and I don't really want to take that any further, beyond what fascinated about me about the Zimbabwe dollar note trade.

And even the mainstream media reported on it ...

Yes, his bar. I guess also still selling Z notes on the side.

Well, they do because the they were only printed for several months before they were discontinued, for obvious reasons – where do you go from there before everyone is using US dollars or crypto or bananas? – and so there's limited supply of an exotic fiat that speaks to how fiat can go wrong ...

Whether he's the principal coder or not, in this really bad (and recent) panel, he comes across as so evasive and shifty, it's difficult not to assume he's close to something very important

Watch Wright in this panel discussion if you're wondering whether he's Satoshi Nakamoto. He acts like a man with something huge to hide.

Not yet, but I came up with this (with an accompanying story): 
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:53:23
Why can't we simply call them satoshi? It's been there as an option from the beginning, and for a consumer, something that costs, say, 1,000, say, is not a challenging concept. Months ago, thinking about this issue, I had a designer come up with a symbol for it:

Schiff has dug himself into a corner with gold and silver and the demise of the dollar. It's premature, and he's too strident with his opinions -- and too proud about being right in the past on the housing bubble. He hasn't given't enough thought about digital currencies because he fancies himself as a macro-ecobomics guy and isn't thinking enough about the disruptive powers of the internet.

I'm not hopeful, never heard a good word about Mt Gox. Was warned against using it a long time ago. I don't think they will give an honest answer on what went wrong, just as Tepco hasn't on Fukushima. We're better off without Mt Gox. There will be better platforms, have been ...

This is very curious, and I'm still trying to figure out the agenda/s of these people -- who include, as I noted in an earlier reply to a comment, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, long bitcoin blowhards and enemies of bad journalism. The story is clearly flawed. It went to press too soon. No editor worth their salt would have let it run as it ran, except that Newsweek needed a sensational story to re-launch with, so they desperately and cynically went with what they had, which was next to nothing. We can all watch the "writer" slowly break down in kid-glove interviews by Bloomberg and CNN. If someone like Britain's Paxman got his hands on her, she'd be toast and so would the story. But for some reason, a number of people appear to want the story to be true even though almost everything mitigates against its authenticity. Why, I can't quite figure out ... any theories? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:50:44
Unfortunately, that is precisely what journalists do. They rarely change the thrust of their stories based on comments that don't reflect the brief they've probably already had approved by the editor. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 14:11:43
At the risk of being of being accused of over-plugging this piece of mine, just a week ago I weighed in and suggested what seems obvious to me: that the media will have to move from monthly/weekly subscription plans to micropayments for people who want to read/view something specific to a particular media outlet, and I suggested that this be denominated in satoshi so that the numbers make sense to regular punters, assuming wide-scale adoption at some point in the future ...

Here was my recent design, and with an explanation as to why the satoshi is important. I wanted it to look a little like the dollar for, what I think are obvious reasons: 
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:34:07
I wonder if it does need to be abbreviated. People are happy to use the words "dollars" or "bucks" or "pounds" and "quid" in Britain, and my point was consider how to make BTC digestible to people who find the concept of millionths of bitcoin alienating or plain confusing.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:10:59
The old rule: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. And where exactly are you flying to? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:59:43
I don't get the Max and Stacy position on this. They're normally super-critical of almost everything that runs in the mainstream press, and yet they seem to have bought this very likely cooked up story hook, line and sinker. They also seem to be following that line that the bitcoin community has been reacting with outrage because Satoshi Nakamoto turned out to be Satoshi Nakamoto, which is not what I've seen in posts here. Their critical faculties seem utterly absent on this issue, and neither seem to have considered the implications for Dorian Nakamoto if he really is simply an ailing man with a penchant for model trains. This, combined, with what looks suspiciously like a pump-and-dump drumroll on maxcoin, which they've been using their popular RT broadcasts to promote (fundamentally unethical), has turned me from a fan to someone who's very suspicious of their agenda. Max Keiser was formerly a Wall Street trader, so it could be a case of once a BS artist always a BS artist, or perhaps it's simply a case of their recent celebrity status going to their heads and they now think their endorsement is unassailable. Still, the point remains, why have they not been more skeptical about this Newsweek "scoop"?

"The future is here" or "Better than money". I think any slogan needs to be simple and non-technical for adoption to move beyond geeky zealots.

The critics here are right; we don't need Wikipedia to accept bitcoin as a condition to donating. But, all the same, it's worth pushing Wikipedia to make the move and accept bitcoin donations. Everything about it makes sense. Wikipedia is a community-based information source that destroyed print encyclopedias, and bitcoin has the potential to do the same to many traditional financial services we're still using. Meanwhile, thanks, this has reminded that I should donate to Wikipedia, which I'm going to do now.

I agree, and I wrote about this a couple of months ago:

I would have to decline, because if I accepted the deal I would wind up homeless, unable to buy anything to eat, possibly unable to leave the country in Southeast Asia I'm currently working in and find my way to somewhere where bitcoin has some utility.

What many have been saying here from the outset, but good to see Forbes putting it to the test with experts, and so much for Leah McGrath Goodman's "forensics".

Denominate bitcoin in satoshi, so it makes sense for regular people to make micropayments. I wrote this on the subject three days ago: 
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:51:19
I remember doing this in 2014, but I must admit it looks kind of lame now ... 
@_date: 2016-06-19 13:08:58
I totally agree. If nothing else, it's a great read and a fascinating insight into the psychology of Craig Wright, and surely Wright's motives in wanting to out himself as Satoshi are of interest.

Right, well, this is a Korean report on something said in Chinese, so I searched for the possible source in Chinese reporting today. 
What I can find is this from Caijing (it's old news, as in it draws on Yi Gang speaking on BTC in 2013 even though it was published hours ago): 
He reportedly says that, for the People's Bank of China (PBoC), BTC cannot be accepted as a currency in the near future, BUT that is a form of buying and selling and that "people have the freedom to participate."
That's from 2013, note. 
On March 9, presumably this year and according to the same report today, he said, digital currencies are an "inevitable technological development," but the banking system still does not accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment.
In another Chinese-language report today, which also sourced (presumably the same) comments in 2013, Yi Gang is quoted as describing BTC as "worthy of long-term attention." 
In summary, the Korean "reporting" is old news, and hopeful speculation until Yi Gang makes new comments in his new role.

Nobody even needs to be a Japanese culture enthusiast, particularly. Many people who aren't have read about Zen, or have some passing interest in Japanese Buddhism. Long before I knew anything about Japan, I was aware of the word satori (悟り), which is related to the word Satoshi, if the same kanji is used. I've seen people speculate on Nakamoto and it gets woolly, so I'm going to assume that a standard Japanese surname was chosen to give Satoshi credibility as Japanese.

That's a natural reaction, but a very old and good friend of mine asked that question, and I was cagey, and asked him how much he had saved and what he was worth ... And he told me. Exactly. And I felt like a bit of an asshole. So, I would say it really depends on whom it is and how good your relationship with that person is. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:28:43
Thanks! Never received a tip before, so now I have to figure out how to collect them. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 11:07:14
$12 and nobody could or would tell me how to buy and I didn't know about Reddit Bitcoin. By the time I'd figure'd it out, it was at $250. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:35:49
I bought around 11 bitcoin at the $450 mark, just before it began sliding in value. I make no predictions as to where it's headed, but I've never regretted buying them – and, yes, I've used bitcoin for some purchases – simply because I've enjoyed being part of a fascinating experiment. Even if bitcoin went to zero, I'd say to people, I was part of that and it was one of the more interesting things I've been part of in years.
