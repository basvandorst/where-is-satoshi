the starting point for one.
The real world connection to the coin.

think a little harder there is something you are missing.
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:29:35
or something you seem very defensive.
You asked about the meaning of a term I showed ambivalence on the topic of hoarding/saving you pressed for a definition of hoarding. I assumed google must not work at your house gave and you the standard definition used in the economics community.  
You assigned a half-dozen beliefs to me and crapped your pants.
Calm down little buddy if Bitcoin is as magic as you seem to think it is me asking questions about is not going to topple it.

This is how I read it hard limits and future solutions.
you don't happen to know the depreciation rate do you?
it is hard to figure with all the noise of the volatility. 
[edit deflation rate]
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:27:15
so the whole non-traceable thing is utter bullshit?
This could not be better for the NSA.

note to self never waste time talking to religious people.

but doesn't it then become fiat currency or some analogue of commodity trading without intent to have delivery?

Someone who sez someone to pretend superiority?
Now think a little bit about what information a miner has that is not in the Blockchain.info If you come up with nothing it is because you have not thought hard enough.  
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:58:04
but to know the starting point of coin they do don't they?

Hoarding is holding a resource to be sold for a profit without adding value it leads to inefficient distribution of resources.
In bitcoin I think it leads to it not being used as a means of exchange which undermines its value.
it ain't currency if you don't spend it.

it is kinda like the difference between terrorist and freedom fighter.

I am merging the 2 answers for my selfish needs.  
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:44:07
So at some point in the future drinks will be priced at a couple of Satoshi?
incentivises hoarding a bit.
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:09:59
grr arrg 
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:41:08
Your answer to number 2 is reassuring.
I am a little worried that being susceptible to HTF may increase volatility and cause flash crashes. reassure me.    
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:52:29
really? you did not get it?
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:12:23
nope but feel free it put words in my mouth whenever you want it so much more interesting than having a conversation.
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:16:42
So untraceability is not important to bitcoin?
