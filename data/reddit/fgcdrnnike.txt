Dnscrypt is open source. What vulnerabilities did they find?

uBlock Origin, uBlock Origin extra, HTTPS Everywhere,  SafeScript for Chrome / NoScript for Firefox are absolutely must-have if you are into crypto. These last two would stop any malicious .js being injected into your browser. The pirate bay started using bitcoin miners on their sites and it seems other sites are doing that aswel.
Privacy Badger is not a must but I still use it.
[Installing SimpleDNScrypt]( to encrypt your dns queries and avoid getting linked to a phishing site through a man in the middle attack would be ideal too. Select a server that provides dnssec aswel so your queries get encrypted AND validated. How cool is that? Bonus point if you install it at the router level using OpenWRT and protect all devices at once. While you're at it you could install Adblock on the router too.

It's not the same at all. Dnscrypt encrypts the content of the query you are sending. "DNS over Https" which btw it was first implemented by google  just translates whatever you type in the box to an IP, but in a HTTPS page. This is not secure at all, plus imagine having to type the address of every site you wanna visit and click and copy the ip every single time.
It's more for devs I think. However OkTurtles DO have servers for dnscrypt, but don't get confused these are not the same. Dnscrypt was developed by CiscoOpenDNS in 2011.

You can find all alternatives here: 
Although for android and iOS you will need to root/jb the phone.
