So, PayPal won't allow BTC sales, but will allow BTC voucher sales? Sounds fishy

I should've clarified; I don't think bitcoin ATMs will eradicate trading platforms such as Mt. Gox, but I definitely think it will eradicate fixed-rate  exchangers, such as BitInstant and MAYBE Coinbase.
Updated OP with this clarification.

Thanks for the kind words! Time to knock BitInstant off their high-horse

My other thread states my beliefs. So you now ask why I would PURPOSELY create something I believe will be "eradicated"? Simple; people have brought up some excellent points that made me think both can co-exist. I have been setting up this exchange for a few months, and it was only last night that I thought of the possibility of bitcoin ATMs replacing fixed-rate exchangers. However, there are a few unrefutable perks to exchangers when compared to ATMs that I will not be explaining because this is what will keep business thriving :)
Yes, that is what I mean by fixed-rate. You can count on significantly lower rates than the competitors. Also, expect some radically innovative features when the site is launched.

Yes, but this is no different than the other US-based exchangers. You can still be ANONYMOUS, even if the company is keeping records.

How exactly would we be compromising anonymity? Local payment options and automated Liberty Reserve payments are as anonymous as it will get, buddy.

OK, so I think it's fair to say that trading platform exchanges, such as CampBX and Mt. Gox won't go out of business, but fixed-rate exchanges, such as BitInstant WOULD. Correct?
I agree that it will definitely be a game-changer, in a good way!

Well, it was implied that exchanges will be need until ATMs come out. As for BTC supply, I assume the ATMs would be able to supply themselves because they would be buying and selling BTC, not just selling. If there was a shortage, they could either suspend bitcoin purchases, or use an exchange to stock up on more.

Thanks. Updated OP.
