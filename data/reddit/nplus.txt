I'm working on a payment module for OpenCart and an online store to sell coffee to Canada.  
Hopefully the payment module will help people setup stores to sell tangible items. The payment module is mostly done, I need to clean up a few things and confirm a couple things.  
I'm using bitcoinpayflow.com as the payment processor. They forward all payments after 6 confirmations to your bitcoin address. They do keep 1 bitcoin from your first payment to cover transaction fees. Any over payments or payments made after the order is satisfied are forwarded to your address. This leaves you with the option of refunding the extra payments.

I'm sorry, but until your site is fully HTTPS I won't be using it.

I'm not praising MyBitcoin one bit. I just don't understand why people aren't at all happy that they're getting 49% back.  
Yes I understand that they're still pissed off about loosing 51%.  
    
Edit: For the people who keep downvoting me, I'm not trying to defend MyBitcoin. I was lucky I didn't look into using MyBitcoin till about a month ago and by then there was quite a bit of talk about whether or not to trust the site. I decided to give the site a chance and sent a couple of messages through the built in messaging system. I wasn't going to depend on the site until I received a response (which never came).  
I think that most people had written off the money they had thought they'd lost with MyBitcoin. I would think that people would be a little bit less negative about the fact that they're all of a sudden going to be getting 49% back.  
Will it make everything OK? No, but it's a start.

He has a picture of one that caught fire.

[bit-pay.com](  
I'm going to be working on an OpenCart payment module for them soon (I hope). I'm finishing up payment module for [ right now.  
  
If you'll find either of these two modules useful here's my address: 1LhhqB7yod7ZdEDq6JHhkegmGyfz3ywCqV

I'm setting up an OpenCart store using the MyBitcoin plugin. I believe OpenCart can do digital distribution.
There has been some controversy about MyBitcoin lately - as long as you don't loose your password I think you'll be fine. Read the bitcoin forums for stories.

You can post in one of the "Newbie" pinned thread to be whitelisted if you're a developer related to Bitcoin. Working your way up the ranks is a pretty lengthy process otherwise.

I looked at bitwillet, but it wasn't suitable for what I needed. With a shopping cart the price varies quite a bit with different product combinations and shipping - bitwillet has no concept of custom/varying prices.
@_date: 2011-08-08 18:45:09
Yep, you give Bit-Pay your bank information and they'll deposit USD into your account.  
Note: You must be a US resident and have a US bank to use this feature.

Did you even read the article? It says 17000BTC in the second sentence.

Isn't this what [r/BitcoinMining](is for?
@_date: 2011-09-15 06:37:24
Here's the [source]( I haven't looked it over yet to see if there's anything malicious.
@_date: 2011-08-08 18:47:51
It's a start... I don't know why people are complaining that they're getting 50% back when last week it was assumed they'd be getting 0% back.  
Yeah it sucks that people lost money, but now it sucks a half as much.
@_date: 2011-07-14 17:14:12
If it can be integrated with OpenCart I would use it instantly.
@_date: 2011-08-17 14:38:52
Skip the blog-spam, here's the link for the [API]( package. The example code is using NodeJS.

How about Ƀ?
@_date: 2011-08-08 18:43:37
That's not my point. This is the second virus that I've seen the source code for an they both only look in folder where it should be.  
I'm not saying that no one has made a smarter virus that scans the whole computer.

My guess is that something went wrong sever side and it crashed. I don't think it being offline is malicious and I don't think that the lack of commutation is either. I think the sure owner has vanished.  
Yes it's unfortunate for those who have lost access to their coins, but there have been many warning signs lately that should have prompted people to not store their coins there.
@_date: 2011-08-09 07:03:41
I'm in Nanaimo. If you don't want to use cavirtex and are willing to take the ferry for some coins I'll happily sell some to you.

This is all the essential information that should be provided for a question like this... a question that is asked far too often. As I mentioned in another post, there needs to be more information for beginners in the sidebar.

I hear you, I'm just about to start my final year of my comp-sci degree.  
Good luck with school!

To fool most viruses, you just need to store it somewhere "non-standard" (ie. not in %appdata%/bitcoin/wallet.dat"). That being said, you should store it somewhere safe &amp; encrypted when you're not sending money.

Same.. wait more than a couple hours and try and contact them when they're back.

Take a closer look at Bit-Pay.
@_date: 2011-07-29 20:42:20
Depends what you're using MyBitcoin for.  
If you're a US merchant, then take a look at [Bit-Pay]( I'm not in the US so I'm desperately looking/waiting for something else to pop up.  
If you want an online wallet then there are a lot of other solutions. Right now I'm using [Canadian Virtual Exchange](

If you look at [r/gaming](r/gaming) they have a small header. We could have something similar, the tricky part is to not make it too intrusive and take up too much screen space. That's why I suggested using the subreddit description AKA the sidebar.
@_date: 2011-07-29 15:07:50
Paxum seems to have a ton of fees left right and center, so personally I'll be sticking with cavirtex.com.

I would like to see an option for this so I could choose CAD. I'm sure people would like other currencies as well.  
Also, may I ask why you need someone to take over the project?
@_date: 2011-08-11 01:15:03
Can we put the answer to this in the sidebar? This question pops up every couple of days.

Stealing from anyone is a fucked up business model.

Are URL shorteners necessary for Reddit? If anything they cause more harm as people are less inclined to click the link if they don't recognize the domain.

I'm working on setting up an online store. The shopping cart software (opencart) that I've selected has a MyBitcoin payment plugin. I'm still trying to decide if I should move forward or look for another payment processor.
Any suggestions?
@_date: 2013-09-08 16:09:45
Cool, I'll have to check it out next time I'm in Vancouver.
