If your money is held in escrow on a black market drug website, you’re gonna have a bad time
You’re not smarter than the attorneys at the FBI and what you think is or isn’t “egregious” doesn’t matter

holy shit it's gigitrix
what's up blood
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:15:10
Pretty good, although I haven't harassed a twitter bot for quite some time now haha

Just like how fiat made gold obsolete?
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:02:11
Equally stupid comparison

How do you think people pay for drugs on the internet?
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:13:30
Mostly drugs and speculation though

Saving this post for the inevitable bubble crash. Will btc rebound after and continue to grow? Who knows. Btc is overly inflated and buying it is gambling, not investing. All those subs are moderate risk moderate reward mindset which is sound financial advice. Dumping your paycheck into btc is a gamble, not an investment.

My lost iPhone has hundreds of dollars in its breadwallet. Always backup your private keys people.

The space race changed everything
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:21:07
Not bad at all! Very nice work

I KNOW BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE

That's strange, seeing as my 401k has grown 10% in 9 months. Congrats on your new fortune but you must suck at stocks.

Or they don’t give a shit about what is arguably a speculative investment and are sick of hearing about it
@_date: 2019-09-29 19:39:39
Right, but characterizing the US as having trash credit that couldn't buy a used Civic is quite unproductive

Suddenly black market bearer bonds will be all the rage
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:53:21
Or they never will.
My Zimbabwe trillion dollar bills will buy the world any day now
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:10:49
You can do that already mate

Please don't buy a rental property. The last thing we need is more assholes inflating rent and home prices in this country. It's bad enough with all the foreign investment doing it.

A trillion is a lot of money but when you view it as debt to income ratio it's not the end of the world
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:47:58
Could be both, who knows
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:39:56
Cool, glad to see you're so stoked about exploiting working class people 
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:09:57
About how much does all that cost in materials?
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:37:50
No, artificial scarcity drives up rent
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:10:21
Do you plan on having children?
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:54:18
... for them to get in on the most recent pump and dump?
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:12:57
People like you are a diamond dozen.
