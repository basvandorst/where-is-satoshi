You may sell now. 
This is pump and dump. It works like this: 14k 13k 13.5k 12k 12.5k 11k 11.5k 10k 10.5k 9k down to 4K or even lower.  Just watch it.....
It will not touch 20k again.

So? The market is helping my shorts. Every drop makes me a little bit richer. 
People think they are holding their coins and therefore can't lose. Actually they are not holding it, their coins are losing value and they are betting against me or the market.
They are doing something without realizing it. Their money actually went slowly from their pocket into mine or someone else's pocket. 
The funny, tricky psychological thing is people think their coins have value. 1 btc = 1 btc right? But actually they wanted to be in the fiat world again but being a bit richer than before.

The idea of bitcoin is great. But after a few ppl acquired large amount of bitcoin, industrialized the mining process, pump and dumps the market, it has become a shit show. Not only they destroyed the purpose of bitcoin, but also slowed down the development process of bitcoin. Bitcoin becomes something that was never designed for. 
People like to talk about "fundamentals" , "decentralization", "store of value", "adoption" etc. Where are these ppl now? Oh dear, save us from the buzzwords bingo bullshit. Bitcoin is now just a speculation object, which is getting less and less reasons for speculation.
The drop from 20k should be the wake up call. Nononono, it's gonna moooon and bitcoin will worth more than apple and Amazon combined and replace the us dollar and cures Cancer

It's not a dip. If you want to make some money then short it. 
No one is building positions or buying cheaper coins. The money is parked for withdraw if the approval fails.
You will not see bitcoin worth more than 20k even the ETF gets magically approved.
That's all I can tell you.

Stop crying, just learn to short Bitcoin with your bitcoin. You can also lend bitcoin for interest. 
If you just want to hodl thats your human right but also your problem
You are actually betting against the market right now.
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:25:03
Let's say you have 1 bitcoin bought at 20k. As long as you don't sell, you have 1 bitcoin. But as you can see. But coin worth only 6k now. 
Assume I placed my short at 20k with 1 bitcoin. Today I closed my position and transfered my gain in usd to my bank.
Now who paid me that 14000 USD ?

Let's assume you are telling the truth that you really have some friends in Turkey who are interested in a solution to the problem. And they didn't want to know any solutions until today 10.08.2018. And you were too lazy to inform them about a solution before this date.
Let's also assume the idea of Bitcoin is the solution to the problem, because of the white paper.
After your friends saw the movie "Stop posting shitpost" about Bitcoin, they are so excited that decide to buy their first bitcoin.
After a while they learned that Bitcoin is owned by few whales/investors/mining industries/… and the price of bitcoin is heavily manipulate.
They are now very disappointed and want to sell bitcoin for lira again. Unfortunately the price of bitcoin dropped another 5% while they were watching the movie.
So they ended up with more problems with less  money.

If you buy high and sell low, then you are a inexperienced trader (technically). Your loss is someone else's gain.
If you buy low and sell high, then you are a lucky or experienced trader (technically). But then you are in the fiat system again.
Your intention is actually getting into the system again but being a little bit richer than before.
This picture assumes that buying/holding bitcoin is fighting against the system. What this picture actually do is manipulating your way of thinking to justify your actions.
Don't let them fool you. All they want is money from you. It's not about freedom, justice or whatsoever right now. The idea of bitcoin is good but ppl fucked it up like always.

That’s the point. You don’t need research for this kind of stuff. You don’t need hardware wallet to encrypt your email do you?  I can pgp my private key and burt it cd. I can even upload it to the cloud.
There is no hw wallet in the white paper of bitcoin.
Because you don’t fucking need it. It’s an invention for making money. 120 Dollar a piece? What the hell?
Let’s say you have a hardware wallet and someone point a gun at you. Congrats you lost all your crypto at once. (Offtopic)
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:45:04
Bitcoin is store of value. 
Ethereum is useless and can’t be store of value, because it has more use cases. Staking is shit. Let’s stay with PoW because the mining industries are already behind it. DAI is DAO, is working but it’s still shit because it’s pegged by USD/ETH and not Gold. 
Nothing will change. Because we all know ethereum is monolithic. It doesn’t improve. VB is lazy.
Ethereum will unfortunately not succeed. Please everyone just let ethereum go and buy more bitcoins. 
Bakkt is coming and ETF soon. Miniscript for smart contracts. Man i am bullish. But please just don’t hodl bitcoin but also dump/short ETH.
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:47:42

@_date: 2019-08-25 19:02:48
I don’t get all the wallet thing. It’s so bullshit. You download the bitcoin client and put a password on the private key. Then you backup the already encrypted private key with truecrypt in a container or just winrar it with another password or using pgp. That’s it. done. Why would you pay 100 bucks for a hw wallet and think so complicated. You don’t need it. You don’t need special os or anything. FFS people stop making this complicated.

How many tps then? The major part of the transaction is off chain? So as long as the scalability on chain doesn't get improved, there will always be an issue? Can the contracts / balance sheet be stored on a normal database? Why is it essential to store them on chain?
All the codes, contract, signing and nodes well done, but how will it bring stability in the price and distribution of bitcoin? 
Bitcoin is supposed to be the "next gen financial whatever". But what I see is that there is a problem in the design of bitcoin and people are investing so much time and effort to solve a problem by design. The "eco-system / mining / trading" is already fucked it and makes it worse. That's not even bitcoin's fault.
