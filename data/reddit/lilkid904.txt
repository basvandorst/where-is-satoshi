I still stand by my point. Why would Blockchain state claim to being partners with a scam site. Day trading is a lot easier if you have a larger amount of money to trade with. you can sell at a couple of cents higher and have huge gains and it goes the same way when it drops. there interest rate was half what the other sites offer and the other sites have been open for a few months with no problems and that were not backed by the biggest name in btw.

to make your analogy better it would of been with a cop walking by my side saying don't worry we got your back. But I guess who the hell would trust a cop :-p

I think they should be part responsible since they claimed they were partners which means they share financial responsibility. They make so much off transaction  fees its ridiculous.

It was assumed that if someone as reputable as Blockchain listed them as a partner that they putting there stamp of approval on it have done said research. The way of making money was assumed that they day traded bit coin and or also followed a ponzu style system but this was 100 % scam ran off in under 2 weeks and Blockchain which is the father of bit coins said " Hey we are Partners with these guys so your in the good." I did expect a risk and maybe take lost loose a 1000 if they did bad, but not run off with 5k after 4 days.

Lost a lot of money on this over $5,000. In the process of seeking consul if we can hold block chain liable for this scam since they claim they were partners.
