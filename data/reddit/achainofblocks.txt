Thanks. I have a deep dive coming out on Proof of Stake and Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

Zero fees, instant settlement, Zero Chargebacks, Zero refunds! I’m not sure what a merchant wouldn’t love. 
The key is allowing merchants to accept crypto and settle in fiat. 
What banks are concerned with is AML, so if you can establish a “line in the sand” as a merchant service provider, and implement KYC checks to regulate the Wallets that merchants can accept from its a step in the right direction for regulation.

Should there also be flames coming off the top and smoke coming out of where the ears might be?
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:21:24
Thanks for being honest. What part of the article did you disagree with?
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:10:32
The problem is no bank will support the payment of fiat for purchases in crypto due to fear of AML (anti money laundering). Merchants could set up and instant conversion to USDT or other stable coin.

Don't give up.

Thank you for reading.

My first article on Reddit, really appreciate you taking the time to read, and enjoy. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:33:45
That's probably the best compliment I can receive. More to come in a couple days.
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:58:07
You are a tremendous resource, appreciate your time.
@_date: 2018-08-10 03:03:04
Means a lot. Spent a lot of time on the research for this one. It's a subject I am passionate about, and there wasn't one great resource to summarize the info. I hope this helps the community.

Definitely! Thanks for noticing.

Incredibly smart people in Romania. Amazon is opening a development office in Bucharest, employing about 2,000 Romanian developers. I manage the IT Dept for a FinTech company, and we have an office there as well.  Beautiful country, and women...

It went a little long, that's why I decided to just cover the problem and Proof of Work. Will get into Proof of Stake and Delegated Proof of Stake in upcoming articles.
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:57:26
Thank you, more to come. Praise means a lot from you. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:20:44
Don't worry about being cool yet, first learn to read. 
Baby steps boy.

It sounds like you maybe lost a little money on EOS, I can't understand why else you would knock that platform. Dan Larimer has only had successful dApp projects so far, and EOS is his best yet.
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:34:11
Ha! Good analogy... I guess.
@_date: 2018-08-10 03:25:46
Thank you.

I really think the only transaction that matters when you look at Anti Money Laundering is the 1st one. Where the fist is converted to crypto. If you offer a way to trace that as part of KYC checks, it will eliminate a majority of the risk.

Right next to the Moneygram location.

That’s not true! You can spend it at many places and the list is growing, and much larger outside the US (which is always late to the party). And card use is inherently unsafe. I understand your point, but part of the fun is the journey.  In 1994 Amazon was just a place you went to buy books. As the infrastructure and lexicon changes, so too will the times. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:53:13
Yes, it’s about a 10 minute read. Thanks for the support. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:33:56
Thank you.

Maybe it was just a 20 minute power nap...

Thank you, keep spreading the love.

Thank you, appreciate the comment.

Make sure it's Green Tea, think positive.
