If you cant use your own money to buy something what you want and/or you need permision from third part to use your money how you decided, than this system has failed and needs to be replaced with improved new version.

If im not wrong i think i read somewhere that buying Bitcoin in Macedonia is illegal so maybe thats the reason why your KYC is rejected.

Based on local laws and regulations from where i come from, when i receive fiat on my business bank account, i cant use them to buy Bitcoin just like that and if i want to do this in a legal way it would lead to 50% lose in value just to transfer fiat in Bitcoin. I know it sounds crazy, checked with several accountants to find a soulution or a hole in law but the only legal solution could be a payment system described above.

Nothing that was premined dont have a chance to become a currency or store of value.

All webcam sites have requirement from models to verify identity and age. This is something you are going to find on every legal webcam site. To complete age verification, broadcasters are required to upload two photos: photo of government issued ID as well as photo holding the ID next to face.  All the information given through record-keeping compliance form is being provided to comply with federal law.  Partners of this website have designated the custodian to be the keeper of original records described in 18 U.S.C. 2257. All this informations and other legal details can be found on our website.

Coinbase and BitPanda are safest entry level exchanges to enter in crypto world. You should also consider buying a hardware wallet after you catch some basics.

You will probably lose everything with daily or margin trading. Markets are manipulated by whales and exchanges and they will take your pants down if you start to play this game since they hold all the cards. Even if you are a TA expert which i doubt you are if you are 15, your chances to increase amounts of Bitcoin with trading are very low. Dollar cost average might be the best solution for you. Also, bitcoin is not just a store of value, start to use it to understand all benefits over conventional fiat payments.

I know coinpayments works other way around when people use Bitcoin as payment. I use them on lot of my sites and never had problems with them. They have option that convert customers bitcoin payments into fiat but unfortunately not the other way around. If you find a solution, would you please share it with me since i would also like to use it.

I talked with one friend two years ago about Bitcoin. His reaction was that Bitcoin is something like MLM scheme and it can never become currency. I said ok, time will show. Few weeks ago he asked me how can he start accepting Bitcoin as payment in his shop.

You cant make your own Bitcoin, you can only make your own shitcoin.

From users point of view, Bitcoin Cams site offer complete anonymity since users dont need to expose any personal details opposed to conventional credit card payments when they want to motivate or reward favorite performers. When we talk about models and broadcasters, age verification is something required to comply with federal laws to prevent illegal activities. They stream live so even without identification and age verification it would be impossible for them to remain anonymous when anyone from the world can watch their live stream. Models have option to block users from specific regions, countries or individual states using regional GEO blocking but if someone is going to stream live on adult webcam site in order to earn funds with this, expecting to remain 100% anonymous is unrealistic expectation and mission impossible from legal point of view.

I would say BitPay is takeing a shit in a plate from which they eat from.

Vechain, but since its a two token model i would not buy VET, better to buy VTHO.

Everyone who says Bitcoin is slow and fees are expensive is a liar or did never sent money through banks or using western union.
If you have a crypto debit card you can easily in less then half hour send your bitcoins from cold wallet, receive them and exchange for fiat and use it in all stores with POS devices or withdraw cash on every ATM in the world. Even in this early stage with middleman (debit cards) Bitcoin is already faster and cheaper and have many other advantages over traditional banking.

Educate yourself before you write something stupid like this. I advise you to look videos of Andreas Antonopoulos to understand what would 51% attack actualy mean. In short: Billions of dollars would need to be used to make one single double spend. ��

If this would happened price of Bitcoin would go up since lot of people would then hold worthless USDT and the fastest way to get out would be to buy BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-21 22:38:02
Agreed on this and i would rather see government stablecoins from tether.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:40:25
Bitcoin dominance around 90%, other 5% to all other usefull smart contract blockchain projects that are used in real life and adopted by real enterprises like Vechain supply chain for example. Remaining 5% for speculative investments in ETH, XRP, BNB, EOS, LTC and 3000 other useless coins since there will always be people who will not be enough educated not to invest in it same as like those ones who hunt PnD schemes until they dont get rekt.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:54:24
This is simply not true and I would say fiat has much higher percentage of transactions used for illegal activities from Bitcoin.
