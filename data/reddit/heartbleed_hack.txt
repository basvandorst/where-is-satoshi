We can help if you need it.  We just setup a bunch of custom crackers for multibit (6.000+ CPU cores and gpus)

Did you get help?

We are pretty involved in btcrecover behind the scenes, adding tweaks and optimizations and offering support.  That being said, its not the best for Multibit classic.
We setup a custom cluster and can guess many times faster without it.  Btcrecover is awesome (we use a custom version for core wallet recoveries), just much slower and cannot scale like this.
Someone below mentioned Dave, he is also a good guy, but this might be below his minimums.

Someone asked us for general guidance, here it is.
1) If you have a data loss every (bad HD, deleted file, whatever) you need to stop using the device.  We have successfully recovered private keys from a usb stick where it was deleted 5 years earlier simply because the stick was hidden away and never used.  There are also ways to search for password files if you ever stored it in plain text and you know part of the password.
2) Some wallets are easier than others, cracking boils down to simple math and economics.  You wouldn't spend 10k getting into a wallet with 5k.
3) When trying to recall your password a good place to start is in google chrome or other browsers that save your password automatically. You may find that the format you thought your pwd was in (ie Upper/Lowerx4/digitx3/special) actually might have 2 specials at the end when looking through old passwords.
4) Certain wallet versions have bugs where you can actually get the keys without cracking the password.
5) Old wallet backups vs new ones (with same addresses) are usually easier than new ones, because new ones tended to have better/hard encryption.  Core wallet for example re-encrypt the wallet (and make it harder to crack) each time you open it on a newer faster machine.

We might be able to help... see this post.

The other issue your missing is some of the big addresses are exchanges...
granted there are plenty of whales out there, but dont forget this
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:08:24
No, it puts an end to 1031 exchanges.  It modified 1035d, and adds and e and f
Search for "SEC. 3133. REPEAL OF LIKE-KIND EXCHANGES."  In   and then look for 1035.
As it stands now, a 1031 was prob the best bet to avoid taxes on exchanges (not a very high chanece, but better than 0)

In 2017 and you would have been right 87% of the time =)

We do recovery, but can also vouch for Dave at Wallet Recovery.
We tend to get smaller fish that do not hit his minimums.
To answer your specific question, there is a way to send "enough to crack it" but not enough for it to be stolen.  Because its based on partial info, it results in a potential pwd ~10b pwds or so.
So it depends on how big a keyspace you have (ie how many possible combos).  Generally this increases recovery costs if the keyspace is large because you have to run it and generate more possible (instead of stopping when it finds "the one").
It also increases our risk that you run away and don't pay, so some sort of payment system to act as a middle man is usually used (ie paypal etc).

There is also a mechanism for that 1035 exchanges (and others)...  it just depends on which crypto to crypto you would be going to, to see if it would qualify... uncharted waters but non taxable trades happen all the time.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:06:56
I didn't say it was probable, just possible. 
Yes finding a "like kind crypto" is hard given all the different choices/algos/"features" etc.
Additionally you comment below is incorrect.  Its 100% NOT currency in IRS eyes, its property.  1035 was not removed, 1031 was.  1035d was changed.

Sorry about your brother man.  I dont know what I would do if I was you and that happened to me.
Thinking outside the box, are you sure its encrypted?  We had a similar situation on a thumb drive (files were not encrypted, but were deleted) and wrote a scanner to check byte by byte on the drive for the keys.  Got quite a few back.  
Edit: We actually wrote 3 scanners that do it slightly different.
1) That checks for specific byte sequences that correspond to keys, and then computes either pub key or address
2) One that crunches every X bytes as if its a private key, to gen pub keys/addr
3) One that looks for bytes corresponding to a string (useful if maybe password/part of pwd was stored in plain text at one point on the drive)

If you sold coins to pay a fee (in usd for example) you could have a taxable transaction.  If as is usually the case, they just take some coins in the transaction, prob not taxable.

Additionally the futures clear in USD.  So when they settle it, its just an exchange of dollars to one party or the other. No btc involved.
