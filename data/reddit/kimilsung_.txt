Actual balances and trading are done in ints - see the multiplier fields

I will be sure to implement locks on the balances when the deposit/withdraw, ordebrook, and main web app all access the balances table

It looks like their Github has not been updated in nearly a year, and they seem to be some for profit organization now. This is completely free software, so this serves different people than they do

Thanks! Floats are not used in actual storage/trading for balances, and I am going to implement some more input verification to prevent people from getting bad data in the DB

change the first line in config.py
instruments = ["ltc_btc"] -&gt; instruments = ["ltc_btc", "doge_btc"]
save it and the pair shows up
EDIT: that does assume both currencies are already supported; Currency changes need (for now) to add another column to SQL, but that is only 1 additional line in models.py. There are one or two functions that need to be changes to be more adaptable though

That was for price, the price in the CompletedOrder DB is not used anywhere except for the history shown to users.
However, what I need to implement is some input verification like BTC-e to prevent people from messing up what is converted to ints - I can remove all usage of float completely then

The author mentions Fontas' famous pump and dumps

Didn't even address that - probably not. Though when you work in the financial industry, sometimes you can create money out of thin air...

Pay fees or taxes? What is he, poor?
