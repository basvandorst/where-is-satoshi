I would hope the node it uses would be configurable to give people an option if they don't want to store the whole blockchain. 
But how would it access the private keys? Would the wallet interface with Bitcoin Core or generate and store the keys itself?
I'd like to keep using the Core wallet but the more I think about it that seems unlikely unless someone is developing an implementation that sits on top of it somehow. It sounds like I'll be migrating to a new desktop wallet eventually.

Second question, not entirely related to the first.
I've heard it said that once Lightning Network useage crosses a certain threshold, people would not need to transact onchain at all. And that many people will only use LN. How would this work?
Would a payment processor run a LN node, you generate a Bitcoin address, then you request them to open a channel with you at the address you generated? The payment processor would be on the hook for the onchain fee in this case. 
Is there a scenario where people would place trust in the node without having a Bitcoin address? 
Example: I'm Bob and I have no money. I would like to receive income in BTC. Can my employer issue me a LN address? Or do I provide the employer with a self generated BTC address?

Not necessarily true. The payout queue is based on the age of shelved shares from miners and what their payouts are set to. Sometimes I get my payout pretty quickly and other times I keep getting bumped to the back of the line and it takes a day or two.

@_date: 2014-03-25 16:53:28
No, but I don't view that as any worse than what other people are doing by storing data in the blockchain in a way other than what it was originally intended for. As long as that is possible, it's going to be "abused" one way or another. Free speech is free speech in my book.

This graph pops up quite often here. I dont think price correlates to where we are, or will be, on this chart. The way I see it I'll be damn if BTC is still around $325\BTC once we hit that trough of disillusionment. I would imagine that being like peaking at $10,000\BTC, having a crash, and then people really losing their shirts on speculation. You think $1200 down to $350 is bad, imagine a $10,000 down to $2,500 scenario. (And then the long slow recovery back up). That's enough bloviating for now...

I find the statistic "Bitcoin Days Destroyed" to be an interesting metric for bitcoins that are dormant.
Like stated above, I think buy and replace is a great strategy to help boost bitcoin adoption and increase transaction volume.
Eventually merchants will have to do something with all the bitcoins they're holding. Personally, I would already take part of my salary in bitcoin if it were presented as an option.

I believe the benefit would be not having to download and sync the blockchain (several gigs of data) to your computer/device. 
Anyone who can corroborate or correct my statement is appreciated.

You do not appear to understand the implication of what the Fed is doing with it's "easy money" policy. Quantitative Easing is, essentially, the printing of money. And you ask yourself, "Then why hasn't inflation spiked?" and conclude the US dollar must be sound. The problem is, all those "printed" dollars are going to the big banks spreadsheets and they've been sitting on them all this time which is suppressing inflation. 
Eventually the chickens are going to come home to roost, and oh boy, when they do it's not gunna be pretty.

This is wrong. I am currently running several AntMiner S1's on Eligius without any issues.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:31:33
This is simply not true as far as I am aware. I follow the Eligius thread on bitcointalk.org where the operators post regularly and there has never been any mention of this.
Please post sources or stop spreading FUD. Thank you.

For those considering mining, you'd probably see a better return by just investing in your bitcoin holdings.
That said, I count this as good news as my projections were set at 25% increases so mining is still viable for me at this point.
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:43:27
I was unaware that Eligius had done this until now. Makes me kind of wary to continue using them as a pool. 
Especially since they recently halted NMC payouts due to some sort of backend abuse and the pool operator accidentally making a large NMC payout to an incorrect address.

What's your basis for thinking that bitcoin is going to perform poorly within the next 50 days, give or take?
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:20:41
My strategy is two-fold. 
First part is buy and hold. That wallet never gets touched.
Second part is buy and spend. Convert fiat to BTC, spend at online store.
Sometimes there is direct benefit from the second part, sometimes not. At any rate, you're putting more BTC into the ecosystem which is a good thing. Maybe the merchant will keep BTC or just convert right back to fiat but you have to start somewhere.

I think this is probably one of the best explanations. 3,600 coins per day mean roughly 1.6mil dollars at the current price have to enter the ecosystem to keep the price stable. My impression is that most of the money pouring into bitcoin is VC for new ideas and not coins themselves. I like to imagine the next halvening will create some upward pressure. HODL on my fellow bitcoiners!

You're not an idiot. You made BTC and spent it, I doubt too many people out there foresaw the price skyrocketing like it did.
Use a spend and replenish strategy when using BTC if avoid getting caught being empty handed on the next big upswing (if there is one). Spend BTC and go somewhere like Coinbase and buy that much BTC back at relatively the same price.
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:10:07
Speculators or people who are "mining against the future" as I like to put it. That's my best guess.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:43:45
Bitcoin isn't going to outright replace fiat any time soon, probably not in our lifetime if I had to guess. 
The way I read this is, the price of bitcoin compared to fiat would spike as people flock into bitcoin. Some sort of mass exodus event from fiat. As time goes on, and things level out a bit, the price of bitcoin/fiat will be stable compared to each other and both less volatile. Fiat currencies will reach a more "normal" value which is what bitcoin will represent, thus their values will become more inline with each other. That's my interpretation. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:15:30
I really like spend and replace and don't think it goes against what this article is saying.
You maintain your hoard and you cause someone else to start holding more bitcoin than they would have otherwise. Thus maybe creating another hoarder and, hopefully, increasing BTC value one millibit at a time.

Correct me if my understanding is wrong here, but doesn't running a full node just mean having the entire blockchain, some several gigs of data, hosted on your machine running bitcoind/wallet? Is this really an issue for some people with multiple terabytes sitting on their desktops or laptops?
I realize that syncing that whole blockchain takes a long time, but there are other solutions for that. Like initial torrents to seed the blockchain, etc. What other problems is this really presenting for people?

Coinbase has the option to do a 2 part deposit verification into your account. I did this because I, like you, had reservations about giving a third party my bank credentials even though I have other security measures in place.

I can see where bandwidth usage might be a problem. Especially with some of our crappy providers here in the US.
A trusted distributed source pool for chain data would be a really good idea to side step of that. And as the chain becomes ungodly huge in the future, I could almost see this as being necessary. Maybe having a GPG Web of Trust or Certificate Authority style system would work, with some incentive to run those systems. Like a metered rate per blocks served to connect to a host. Anyways, a dedicated P2P Linux distro is a great idea and a good step in the right direction I think.

How about every 8 years we have a "workening" event (like a halvening) where 3 variations of the hashing algorithm are voted on by miners/nodes during the last 2 week difficulty period and switch to that. The algos would be known but it would be difficult to produce the ASIC for it in advance. It's a silly idea but there you go.

If this is THE Goatpig, you da man! I had an old version (0.90) from before you picked up the project. I was worried about compatibility and moving the coins from the old version.

You could compare this to casinos today. You cash in your dollars for X amount of chips.
Then you gamble with those chips. You dont cash out and back in between every hand or slot that you play.
Once you're done gambling you go to the cashier and get your dollars back.
When you gamble using a casinos chips, you're putting just as much trust in that casino as you are an online gambling service. And you don't normally leave a casino with a pocket full of chips (I dont think, I dont do a lot of casino gambling). I wouldn't leave a balance of BTC sitting in SD after I was done playing. That's like leaving the casino and going back home with the chips.
But as some others have stated, Bitcoin should be able to handle this.
