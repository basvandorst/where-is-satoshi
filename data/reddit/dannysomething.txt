It was .008 btc ,$6.92 for the 6 pack. This place is awesome I buy meat there all the time.  They have the best cup of coffee around and kick ass breakfast tacos.  It's worth the drive out to Leander and very soon there's another little store that will be selling gasoline for btc.
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:18:50
The actual purchase was made on the laptop in the back ground.  According to coinmap this is the only grocery store in Texas so far accepting btc so it is very likely that yes this is the first 6 pack.

The transaction was confirmed in about 10 seconds as far as where in the blockchain it's an iPhone so all I can tell you is a bitpay transaction at 11:42 am jan 21 to 1HTg33XkMoM6SBnzEpNvgD86rAG9ygfgZx
If that helps.

Stay tuned Doug I didn't tell you everything I found on BitClub but I'm fixing to publish it with links to all of the previous scams from the head child porn freak.

IMO Bitcoin is nothing but the bait to lure in suckers for the affiliate pyramid. If you listen to some of the shit he says. He says they buy mining equipment with your money if you want the equipment they'll send it back to you. He also says they only pay $100 for any s7 if that's the case $3500 would buy 35 s7 why are you only getting 8 bucks a day.  All of the numbers he's throwing out are bullshit.
Stay tuned for the article I'm putting out on this shit.

WTF who's ripping off The Crypto Shows YouTube videos and posting them as their own without even mentioning us?
What kind of douche rocket does that?
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:57:35
This is not new it's just the YouTube video version of the earlier released audio.
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:07:11
And we followed up with this.

We like Roger true enough but he has never contributed to us nor have asked him too. As far as one sided yes it was but we followed up with our next show talking to Eric Lombrozo to the other side of the story.  Radio is not really great debate format because of commercial interruptions.  Here's the counter argument:

Check this interview 42 minutes in and you decide if it's fishy.

I apologize for not leaving the correct link when I posted this     
@_date: 2016-02-28 07:03:38
Here's the audio it starts at 42 minutes in. Keep in mind the .89 cents for the video goes to charity if you watch the WatchMyBit version. 60% to freeross 25% to FEE.  But definitely check out one or the other to get the word out.
@_date: 2016-02-28 07:37:25
Thank you for sharing our show and there was a ton more shit on this crap I never even got around to bringing up because I was being nice. It ain't pretty either.

It's not actually a fund at all we never asked for donations. We had some money left over from our Dash proposal and then we asked Roger Ver to pitch in a little with the intent to go down there and help out as many people as we could with that amount of funds. He did and then other people started sending money and we ended up with over $60,000 which we've spent less than half of so far to get things that people need directly in their hands. We actually snuck into NRG Center and gave towels and toiletries to people inside who were not getting it from the government scumbags running the shelter.
I'm not soliciting donations here I'm saying go out and do it yourself or find someone you trust and back them.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:23:56
I would be highly skeptical of this this is not typical of Habitat for Humanity and it looks like a phishing scam to me. We are doing a crypto Relief Fund for these efforts and as we've been out on the road we've seen nothing but government corruption when it comes to donations and I don't think Habitat for Humanity as far off from government. Take a little time and find someone to give it to directly we're not even asking you to donate to us just find the people that need it and screw these government operations. I say this from experience I've been inside these government-sponsored shelters and their b******* the majority of the donations are never reaching the people that need them. How is it that NRG Center is receiving truckloads of donations in the people inside only have a f****** clean towel?
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:05:50
Definitely will work on that thanks for the feedback

This is the Sunday interview just hours before the news broke. Cody Wilson is also in studio with us.
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:00:09
Lyn was in studio with us on sunday night Monday morning the news broke about the 2 FBI agents that ripped off the bitcoin from silkroad. This is the follow up interview from tonight April 1st. Also NSA whistle blower William Binney talks about content and meta data.
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:56:41
Chris will be back in a week or so to answer that very question so keep an eye out.
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:25:27
I told her in the Sunday interview that the greatest thing the silkroad ever created was an incredible rights activist (her) and that had it not been for her persistence not many people would have cared what happened to Ross.

I'm sure you can write some code that wll fix everything. I use btc everyday lately and the fees  are ridiculous. I've signed up dozens of businesses to accept it and most just dont take it anymore because it's a fuckin hassle.
CW is right make it work and make it work now.
Don't hold your breath on Cody kicking us out because that ain't happening. You highly underestimate our relationship.
Rest assured asshole we will be getting other opinions from the other side we always do. 
Did you even listen to the speech or was it just except from some article?
And as I always offer to you keyboard badasses I'm not hard to find if you'd like to kick my ass I'll gladly give you my address. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:01:43
Fair enough sorry to hear that and we appreciate your listening this far. We're not selling out to anything. I think it's doubtful that there was only one Satoshi anyway. Im sick of the bs debate make the shit work and stop raking me over the coals for fees. I don't give a shit if hes Satoshi he's right make it work for everyone not just a few geeks, users dont give a shit what's under the hood they just want it to work.
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:19:54
Hopefully  it will reach more than just your eyes and someone will be inspired to help Ross. That's why we did a radio remote at movie theater to try and help raise money for the legal fund regarding Ross' appeal. That being said I do know where you're coming from and agree to an extent but our goal is to help the Ulbricht's.
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:10:32
That's because it says that on our website. Chris is listed as Neandrathal too our feeble attempt at funny.
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:57:55
Yes we did. We have a differing opinion coming on this Sunday with Jameson Lopp.  Is he Satoshi probably not who cares. I still think he's right about doing something and doing something now and making it work for everybody not just a few.

I think you're right. I typically don't post on r/bitcoin very often unless I know it's going to piss everyone off and I was pretty sure this one would. Fraud or not in between expletives he made good points about at least doing something.
