I thought the lightning CEO gal said it's dumb to be using lighting right now on mainnet with real money. Yup she sure did.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:46:58
From the Lightning CEO herself @ 5m15s "So the way I envision Lightning is it can function as a checking account..."

Wouldn't the whole point t of a decentralized system allow them to implement segwit whenever they want... If at all. If all of Bitcoin ran the way you want it to, it wouldn't be very decentralized. It's well within their right to choose how to engage.
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:11:09
Lightning network also has a built in VPN.

I wouldn't take advice from a money guy who dismissed Bitcoin for a decade.

Lol woosh. The value is that the people in the stands (nodes) get to watch the race and verify the winner themselves (block solver).  With only one person running the race who's to say that they even will finish (bad actor). Maybe they will take a nap (miner problems) . or have a heart attack (facility fire). I enjoy blocks every 10 minutes.  
It's all a really cool check and balance. Kind of like folks liek me check incorrect information like you.
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:02:36
Man no kidding. And we should probably thank DARPA for pioneering the internet too. So bad ass. DARPA help create Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-06 07:05:10
This is simply not correct. I feel bad you don't seem to have the capacity to understand.
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:09:27
Is there a road map posted somewhere? I would love to read it
@_date: 2019-07-27 05:02:18
I like this answer

It is not waste. It is contributing something tangible into the network and that is where the Bitcoin blockchain gets its security. 100 people run a race. 1 wins. Were the other 99 wasted runners?
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:15:43
Good for you for not taking advice from someone who uses the word 'ain't' in their vocabulary. Such a wise 15 year old.
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:30:07
Like lightning riding on Bitcoin?

Uncomfortable truths. His grammar sucks.

Yeah let's take financial advice on 1m+ from a guy who doesn't know the difference between you're/your and loose/lose. Super idea.
@_date: 2019-08-19 03:30:56
Guys! We have a journalist here. He knows better than us. . . Yeah yeah maybe you are both right. The positive advancements are relative to the times.

Luckily there were only 2 sentences after that statement so you were able to read most of the article.

@_date: 2019-08-14 21:06:28
What if your tickets cost more than the max transaction size? I didn't know lightning was being used publicly like this yet.
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:59:55
This is an interesting comment from someone with such a mature username.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:30:07
The military looks to NIST now anyway. Everytime you see"military grade" it should really read NIST grade.  Yeah I'm looking at you Nord VPN.

Let me tell you a story about the 10 year logarithm chart. While nothing goes up forever, this chart is beautiful. After all the noise and shills and idiots, this chart keeps me interested in this space.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:48:47
Hi guys. I'm a little late to the party but your question has a pretty simple answer. There is no one stop shop for determining hash rate. So what we do instead is **estimate** the hash rate based on the number of blocks solved in a given amount of time. Because there is a random element and difficulty adjustments aren't realized immediately, the hash rate charts swing like this.
@_date: 2019-08-17 06:52:49
Very neat. Please link if you know how to do that.
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:32:47
You haven't been unplugged from teh matrix yet. Your whole post assumes crypto has to have a price. Money is the tip of the iceberg and there are several use cases that have nothing to do with price.
 I'm with Cryptogrip on this one and congrats on your 5th day on Reddit. Who's payroll are you on?
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:05:11
We have a winner!

You are getting backlash because these questions were ground to a pulp 1/2 a decade ago. Welcome to Bitcoin though.

Pro tip: If you want to determine why Coinbase won't sell to you, try asking their help desk instead of a bunch of Reddit keyboard warriors.

1. There are no tax implementations because the coins have not budged. 2. There is zero legal need to know his identity. 3. I also believe you don't know  how supoenas work. And why are you so stuck on if he did or did not use cash to purchase the domain? If he used PayPal, are you just going to call them and ask for company records? Supoena them on what basis?

Easy access to potable water wasn't always the norm. Beer was a solution to this problem. It didn't take hold in society because of it's taste.

Brainwashed in the sense that your Bitcoin might as well be called Bitcoin a peer to peer checking account. At least that's how the lightning CEO describes it. Edit. I guess we have BCash and BChecking
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:31:59
I guess you have run out of arguments then?
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:08:43
You are brainwashed or on someone's HR payroll.
