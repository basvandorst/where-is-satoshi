On a national radio you can and you should weight your words carefully. You can romanticize your ideas here on reddit as much as you want but when life on air you think one thing but say what people want to hear. Have you never watched politics or played a strategy game?

It'd be lovely to have a generic donate button not just a wordpress plugin where one could chose a shape, size, colors maybe and then copy and paste generated javascript code into a website. Having said that I really really like your button and how it works.

Please don't talk anymore about tax evasion, drugs, anonymity and all that as it'll only damage further already damaged picture of bitcoin miracle.
Talk to them about unjust charges than monopolies like credit cards, paypal and western union type services impose on the people.
Say it's already being regulated in the united states and this is an important and welcomed change among bitcoiners. Major companies like mtgox, bitpay, etc already abide by the rules.
There are two reasons in my opinion why businesses should choose bitcoin:
* cut off middleman (payment processor) and thus offer product much cheaper
* shopping online with bitcoins is a tier better experience than shopping with credit card

This is how one creates a very safe saving account:
* Download Electrum
* Disconnect from Internet
* Start Electrum
* Write down receiving address
* Memorize Electrum's recovery seed
* **Safely** remove Electrum (especially *wallet.dat* file) from the computer
That's all. Now start transferring some of your wealth to the written down address.

Yes it's a bit more expensive but if you're worried about a few dollars difference this is not for you. Bitcoin price goes up and down by big margins all the time, sometimes it crashes to almost nothing - bare that in your mind when you're contemplating 5 dollars difference when purchasing.
I don't know where you are but in europe to do online bank transfer takes 1 minute.

SatoshiDice is a visionary that is showing the world how internet payments should look like. Problem is some developers can't keep up with this miracle thus they come up with excuses, contracts, bans, politics.

My point is that what you're doing is not genuine and not fair on people who take you seriously. People you're selling bitoins to don't know that you're not interested in their services or products and that is fundamentally wrong. They are victims of your "mission".

I probably shouldn't have put 'technology' in my post. I'm more interested in bitcoins  as decentralized, p2p, deflationary concept of money instead.

How would higher transactions fees sort out the problem out of curiosity? Would they buy more hardware/bandwidth? If so I think miners need to realize they need to invest more (maybe even sell some coins) to do it. I believe this is not a good time to mess with people's perception of bitcoins possibilities.
Having said that I do run two full nodes on my servers for over 6 months now in order to help network.

But it would only be a short term ban as it was with gold and alcohol. I think the community is now big enough to argue successfully that if one wants to give imaginary, out of thin air bitcoins to anyone who's willing to take them that's their interplanetary unquestionable right to let them.
@_date: 2013-03-07 12:51:11
That's not really kumbaya for new adopters. Swan song for bitcoin I think yes. Unless I'm missing something.

Some of the people in that thread are just plain ridiculous!
*"because I don't want encourage some gambling website to fill up my hard drive with their bets"*
*"ban them from spamming the network and my harddrives"*
And I don't want the earth to be revolving around the sun - I want it to be otherwise! As a matter of fact there's many things I don't want but that's not the point devs!

I ofter think about governments intervention and always come to the same conclusion: it would be the biggest attack on free speech I can think off. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 22:52:50
Very skeptical man your are indeed. You see governments don't ban torrent technology - they can't - it's a matter of free speech. They bad mouth it, they ban individual copyright infringing websites etc. but they can't ban the technology.
Same with bitcoins - I can not see in a civilized world how can one tell me I can not accept see shells as a payment for a cake I just made. Wait.. I meant bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:46:20
The short answer is there's no answer why the price is what it is or the long answer is there is indefinite chain of answers why the price is what it is. You see every person has an opinion about it and every person is right and wrong at the same time. For your own peace of mind I'd recommend you stop trying figuring it out.
If you really want to know you will have to wait I'm afraid. Historians and book writers will come up with some nice stories about it that we will all agree on.

I concur... SatoshiDice is what really blew my mind as a customer and then 10 minutes later I had 10 ideas what can be done with this kind of technology. Further down the line I found out that SD solution is not the simplest one to implement. Then I found out that Gavin Andresen is working on making it easy for developers [
I think SD should be seen here as an example and driving force for the whole project not as a villain.
