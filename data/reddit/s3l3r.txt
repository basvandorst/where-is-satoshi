My dear friend I follow bitcoin futures from beginning (December 2017) and whole this situation was planned long time ago. Wait for 28th September CME is coming intresting same date like announcement abut ETF on CBOE

Thank you for information

I am not watching / reading news (I don't want to waste my time). If you look for solid proof check bitcoin price and bitcoin futures date 29th June (last bitcoin futures from December 2017) or first expired date on bitcoin futures in January. You will see price changes just before expiring date and rise after. I am not here to proof anyone I am right I am here to make you think. Like you already see whales don't have to wait for market rise to make gigantic profit.

I doesn't change anything. One day different 
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:21:15
It is separate tru. It doesn't mean that big players play on 2 markets and make profits in both ways 
@_date: 2018-09-21 06:51:36
Big manipulation starts in 2017 long before futures starts. If take close look at dates you will see. I dont watch/read news that is huge manipulation lol
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:00:00
Everywhere. You have rise voulune on shorts and price go down. Coincidence? I don't think so
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:05:43
I am following bitcoin futures from beginning. And if you don't see manipulation I cant help you 
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:45:43
Never it is it is not even one satochi. Remember if something like this happen bankers put their hands on bitcoin

My friend look at dates of futures My friend look at dates of futures and price of bitcoin and you will see correlation. Big players keep price of btc on right level and they earn a lot of money on futures. I start my YouTube channel when first long term futures expires it has a lot connections. However I respect your opinion.  YouTube channel when first long term futures expires it has a lot connections. However I respect your opinion.

Decision abut ETF is a tool now to manipulate market and price of btc
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:06:08
In easiest explain yes you are right but behind main stage strange things happen with price of bitcoin and futures dates
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:06:31
Well said ��

@_date: 2019-01-10 21:46:38
Ask your friends, parents what they know about Bitcoin besides price
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:45:15
At least whales play shorts to end of March check futures dates on CME
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:47:38
My bad copy paste from Instagram ��
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:56:16
Don't even try
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:55:25
You have right it is FUD bitcoin futures CME Group finish today �� It star at price 9k so if they play short, lower price means higher profit. I fallow bitcoin futures since they start and all of main information are realesed in same day or day before. I start making videos on YouTube when I realised we are in bull run in this half of year. Bitcoin futures from December finished in last month and now new long term starts which finished on December 28th this year from price 6,3k. Don't waste this opportunity next month bitcoin futures start price was 7,5k. In my opinion they play on bull run now. Remember it is only my opinion and those people are really powerful. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:15:54
No my friend. Starting day of futures show from which price people play short or long. The difference between prices that's their profit. So if they played short last half year they made huge amount of money and now I think they play long if you know volume on bitcoin futures raised a lot. I linked somewhere here link to dates couse someone ask about it. You can check when it starts and when it will finish. CME it is not only one bitcoin futures there however it is the biggest one. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:34:14
I forgot to add. 2nd July bitcoin futures start which expire 28th December. Start price was 6,3k$. If you think this market is not manipulated this post is not for you. Stay safe
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:45:25
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:49:28
Of course I said it is only my opinion. What is really interesting since Btc surge alts stay low.
I don't expect this will go viral couse people don't like hear about manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:22:15
Unfortunately I don't have link to full video, sorry 
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:43:57
For now I discovered every futures dates are tight related. I made videos about it on my YouTube channel s3l3r. It is bizarre how often it happened. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:19:55
Bitcoin futures expire today CME Group. This is last time when you see btc so low. Bitcoin futures from December last year expired last month on price 5,9k. 2nd this month bitcoin futures start on price 6,3k and they expire 28th December. We are in BULL run whatever they will say. I start making videos on YouTube just before I was sure big players play that game in that way.
