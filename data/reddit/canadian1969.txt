Unreal,  this guy is a total douchebag , first any legal action would be handled by the blood sucking lawyers, they would never advise a client to send an email like this, they would just execute the paperwork. The fact he starts with the statement about legal action starting tomorrow and then points out the costliness of such action, then closes with a 12 hour deadline for deal making..,well it's all laughable really.  
As for paycoin, well yet another centrally controlled decentralized cryptocurrency, the ideology is broken. Guess we'll find out Friday. The whole thing smells bad.

actually, ANY Detroit scrap yard with enough foresight to start accepting bitcoin will do huge. They already sell it all to China anyway, may as well accept it in a payment method that will likely appreciate.

I have a simple ticket still open from the beginning of May. Their interface sucks, charting sucks, coins suck. I have abandoned them at this point. They appear to be so entirely focused on the function and security of the system everything else is suffering. Mostly crapcoins anyway.
 The only thing Cryptsy has going for it is volume, and when thats gone they are cooked.
You could try harassing BigVern on Twitter.

When a company or group holds the majority of the hashing power and subsequently make 51% attacks a possibility. A big problem with POW algo (in my mind). The original idea was one cpu / one miner. Now we have huge environmentally unfriendly mining warehouses. Thanks to asics.

Actually I believe it was 1 cpu 1 'vote' under the POW section from the original paper published by Nakamoto.  I think Satoshi considered increasing computational power, but not asics. I have been wrong before though. My apologies I misspoke saying miners, but it is related. I do believe that he never intended what has developed. Hence PoS and asic resistant algos as an attempt to solve this mining centralization issue.
