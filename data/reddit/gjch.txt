This is an absolutely fantastic resource, thanks for creating it! I look forward to spreading it when people ask me questions about cryptocurrencies.
One thing that I think would be a great addition would be to explain the actual process of using something like Bitcoin, from creating a wallet and learning what private keys are, to how a transaction gets confirmed and the BTC becomes property of the receiver.

Blockchain is being a bit of an asshole with stuff like this lately, at least based on my experience.
I was trying to exchange BTC for ETH with them so that I could transfer my remaining account scraps to somewhere I can actually use it, and it said I needed at least X to do the exchange. This account was kind of dead to me, and I didn't really want to deposit more, but ok, if that's what I need to do in order to transfer it all away, I'll do it.
So I deposit enough so that I can withdraw, but then when I go actually do it, even though it says I have more than the required amount on my account for the exchange, all the form fields are greyed out and I still can't do anything. At this point I email support to find out what's going on.
Days later, still no response from support, I decide to try again, except when I go to the exchange page the minimum amount is now higher than I have in my account. Well that's pretty damn annoying. I figure maybe the form was all greyed out the first time because their minimums had changed but the site just hadn't fully updated yet. Ok, what the hell, I'll deposit some more so that I can hit that minimum threshold, and I can then finally move my money somewhere else. At this point I just want to get it all over with.
Well guess what? I deposit yet again, and the minimum amount required to do the exchange RISES AGAIN. What the actual fuck? It felt like I was getting punked, and they were just scamming me into depositing more and more money. So I finally said fuck this and I just paid the BTC fees to transfer the money elsewhere. Luckily it was at a time when the fees had dipped down quite a bit.
It's now been almost 2 weeks, and after numerous emails to support, I still haven't received a single response.

I gave it a try, but the very first token I added as a test had a drastically different price than the actual price, so my trust level plummeted. Unfortunately with an app/market like this, it's hard to get that back.
So you can troubleshoot, I added the REQ token, and the REQ/BTC numbers are as follows:
App - Current Price - 0.000016  
App - 24hr High - 0.000052  
App - 24hr Low - 0.000016
Binance - Current Price - 0.00003735  
Binance - 24hr High - 0.00003870  
Binance - 24hr Low -0.00003461

What you call "hopes" most people call "common sense and research". If you're actually serious here you really need to start paying more attention.

Is there a Reddit rule somewhere that says this needs to be posted at least once every 10 minutes?
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:16:13
Not sure if trolling, or just slow.

The Canadian government is already investigating this:

Per week, maybe.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:56:03
Yes, "possible" scam. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:49:33
Yeah, that's a scam.
