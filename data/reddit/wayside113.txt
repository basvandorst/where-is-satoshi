Interesting thought but i don't see any biological or empirical evidence to suggest that anyone should have any power over another non-violent person, in relation to Magna Carta.
We're all just people, 'rights' don't actually exist in the physical world and if people decide to abide by their arbitrary rules they should be universally applied to everyone. The manipulation of ethics (right and wrong) is the method of which we are enslaved.
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:31:07
When i say empirical evidence i was referring to the argument that the ends cannot justify the means in relation to the initiation of force, not the evidence of the vastly positive impact that common rights have given people. 
This initiation of force i am refering to being one person enforcing rules upon another (Axiomatically the person recieving the rule likewise must not have initiated agression).
I fully acknowledge the benefits and its potential for abuse that inalienable rights have. I don't think rights would be necessary if we understood universal ethics.

I'd say that 'feeling oppressed' is subjective.. It's either you're objectively oppressed or you're not. I'd agree that there should be societal rules, just not rulers.
I can't make a very strong case for Universally Preferable Behaviour and i don't expect to convince you, but I'd recommend you have a gander on youtube of a reading of it  or of the PDF. I love any liberty focused mind and I've enjoyed reading your post/comments.

Stop the FUD. The blocksize problem will be solved in time and it can be kicked down the road, just like debt ceilings. The amount of corruption, "leaky bucket" wealth loss through the current finanical system is insane. Not to mention THE CURRENCIES WHICH AREN'T EVEN MONEY ARE BACKED BY VIOLENCE.

White listing/blacklisting coins in regards to their history. E.g coins were used 5 years ago in a crime henceforth they are tainted and (presumably) worth less to individuals who believe in coin validation. It removes fungibility which is a core value that any good money should have.

I agree they are just following laws but these laws were written without bitcoin even being fathomable at the time. 
Bitcoin is a different type of asset/money where the current laws aren't current enough and lawmakers don't understand it. Applying GST in this case makes absolutely no sense since people will refuse to buy at such an inflated price and then in turn refuse to sell their coins at a 10% loss. 
People won't buy it and it will just force bitcoin exchanges overseas or underground. Selling bitcoin as a GST registered business will not be viable. Unless you're target demographic is businesses buying it with no option to buy overseas.

You're forgetting the biggest monopoly of them all, governments, the one thing that was meant to 'protect' us from monopolies yet they still exist is so many forms anyway. It is extremely hard to innovate because of excessive regulation in most countries.
Curious how almost every single government that has regulators influenced by monopolies that exist today such as banks has spoken out against bitcoin. Monopolies are ended by innovation, innovation comes naturally to the free market; anarchism is essentially a free market, to the extremities of the definition. If you don't like a service someone is providing, you're free to go with another. With a lot of services we have today that isn't an option as no alternatives exist. See Telstra in Australia.
Can i draw your attention to 'lyft' in America, a genius service which is essentially the ebay of taxi services that was heavily attacked by regulators for breaking laws when it essentially rendered a multi million dollar taxi union/s useless, outdated and saved the customer and the driver money through simplification. I understand your criticism but if you understood the real nature of monopolies you would understand.
When you see people attack capitalism for our problems, they are actually attacking crony-capitalism where those in power influence regulators to stifle anything new from taking their power. When you realise that it is better for these companies to invest into regulation and cutting the competition than actually innovating you'll begin to understand why our world is the way it is today.
Edit: Scratch that, following your posts i can see you're extremely biased and pro-government. No offense intended that is your opinion but it will stop you from considering a different point of view.

That is too broad a statement, for starters. Who is to say it is/isn't? You can't place trust in anyone, hence bitcoin is decentralised. Unless there is an efficient system without bias to distinguish between right and wrong there will always be vulnerabilities to the idea and the possibility of a 51% attack, even more so because not everyone will use the service. It HAS to be an all in or nothing tool.
These are two completely seperate examples of open source systems. Security for a system like Linux where malicious modifications of a distro are easy to spot as things are black and white (code is code) and consensuses are made from a multitude of people. You can't have everyone make a consensus on addresses in the same fashion without a jury to evaluate evidence which brings me to the trust issue. There is no simple way to manage trust by centralising decisions.
Your number of fallacies in your argument is disturbing...
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:19:30

Bitcoin doesn't need regulation to thrive, I'm begining to hate this Ehrsam guy and his dislike towards libertarians. It may very well receive it on the business end under government ~~force~~ oversight but when it comes down to it, they will never be able to stop us from trading person to person, tax, steal or modify the protocol bringing us back into a system that would require bitcoin. Before anyone argues for taxes I'm not against communities that support socialism to a degree if the money goes towards the local community, not wars, spying, removal of liberties and welfare that's a byproduct of the system itself.
Bitcoin is the ability for people to opt-out of the medieval systems of states, extortion and crony capitalism, IMHO, and it always will be. I feel like I'm the only one who sees the end of the status quo purely through the neutrality of money anymore.
@_date: 2014-08-12 06:23:44


I agree. It's about how you explain it that's most important, though. It's incredibly hard to convince someone of an ancap/libertarian point of view without a lot of practice/resources on hand.


I think you're misunderstanding me (or perhaps I'm misunderstanding you), I have no fear speaking the truth online and in person (My reddit account name is easily traceable back to me through bitcoin, i was a trader for a few years). I openly argue about the atrocities of the state rationally when i have the opportunity to do so providing evidence to my claims. I am a serious anarcho-capitalist and through my years i've learned to self criticize and remove any kind of fear through rational thought. I don't bother telling others unless they're clearly in a positive predisposition towards the idea or unless i can elaborate, which is what i believe you misunderstood.
If you say taxes are theft to people without elaborating, they usually switch off and not take you seriously as the media loves to portray anti statists, libertarians, freethinkers etc. as complete lunatics and shoving any 'crazy' belief in their faces that fits the criteria. 
I'm not afraid of being denied/ignored/ridiculed, I'm afraid of them keeping their malformed opinion and refusing to take another point of view into consideration.
Edit: While I do agree with your entire statement, i felt the need to rectify that it doesn't apply to me :)

That is a really bad example of anarchism, a true anarchist society would be based km the non aggression principle, no laws for victimless crimes and a mostly capitalist society where innovation is encouraged and monopolies don't exist in any form.

Thunderfoot does nothing but take his arguments out of context. The first 20 seconds say enough.
All of the critics of Stefan i have seen use strawman attacks just like thunderfoot and don't actually tackle his arguments on philosophy. He's open to criticism and openly states that if anyone has a cohesive argument to where he has made errors to call up his talk show and get bumped to the front of the queue. I don't believe thunderfoot has ever called, AFAIK. Anyone who calls FDR a cult without understanding what they stand for is insane.
Those who criticise him are just sophists who won't actually part by part deconstruct his entire argument until a logical error is found. The whole reason he comes to these conclusions that thunderfoot tries to make seem extreme is through nothing but rationality, empiricism and logic. If you were to use the scientific method to refute Stefan and prove him wrong, he would **have** to agree because that is the exact method he used to come to his conclusion. *Philosophy isn't about the conclusions, its about the method.* 
If you have a problem with Stefan, you have a problem with Socrates' philosophy on metaphysics.

The later you get in the later you'll receive your return, if at all. You're spot on, it is mathematically impossible provided the influx of new funds cease but the main deciding variable is how long it will go on and how many people jump on board. The longer it goes on the further and further behind the payouts begin to service unless the deposits start getting bigger (pyramid scheme).
As i previously stated this is a terrible idea if you're in it for the money, you will get hurt one way or another. Same for blowing $100 at the casino. I don't condone gambling in any form but I'll be watching this just to see how far it'll go.

That's an appeal to emotion designed to get the reader to self attack.
I don't understand your metaphor you just made. If you're talking about voluntarism then that isn't an argument either, there's no objective or rational criticisms of the ideology in there. Though I'd love to hear your critiques if you have some.
Edit: It sounds like you haven't heard the arguments from the other side which is fine because I, like you, never understood the fundamentals of non-aggression up until a few years ago. It's important to be rational and take the side that makes the most cohesive argument or if neither do, criticize them both. I'd sincerely enjoy to hear your thoughts on this short video below.

I had a similar conversation with my colleague the other day.
Pretend that lying is completely unfathomable: I could simply say to you that I'm giving you 100 bobs. This in it's essence is all i would need to do to transfer value from me to you, by simply communicating it to you.
Our ledger is the brain and if we were all incapable of lies that is likely all that our monetary system would require. Information about who owns what is all that the money would be based on. Who owns what bitcoin is simply information, likewise.
Freedom of money IS freedom of speech.
If someone wanted to force me not to use my imaginary bobs they would have to stop us from talking, in essence silencing the free flow of information.

Coin validation at its core is a bad idea and just taints coins removing the fungibility aspect which is mandatory for bitcoin and money systems in general. Furthermore its open source so anyone can taint coins without warrant, alas even closed source giving editing rights to companies to list stolen coins is a bad idea. I have a $5 note in my pocket that was stolen 10 years ago so henceforth i am a possible fraudster. No, just NO.

If problems arise with bitcoin, it is extremely likely that these altcoins will suffer from the same issue. If bitcoin is broken litecoin won't suddenly take over, only some alt coins like NXT or the like that offer genuine changes/advantages would apply in this case. 
If there are alt coins that offer alternatives/fixes bitcoin could theoretically adopt the changes. People do argue against this about the consensus/hardforking issues but really a hardfork won't be necessary if the solution is not a huge change to the protocol and there's no viable alternative.

About his wife getting in trouble? I looked it up and yeah the evidence remains so he may of very well lied. I agree its pretty suss. It's his character though which really is used in a way to attack the arguments he makes. Remove him from the equation and look at his arguments for the non aggression principle and property rights/voluntarism. It sounds like you might not fully understand what he believes in thanks to a lot of the misrepresentations made on the net, which is fine but when you use thunderfoot as an example... He really takes everything out of context (except for the shit about his wife which confuses me why Stefan would lie if so, not that I don't find it unbelievable). 
He encourages "de-fooing" with dysfunctional relationships, doesn't matter if they are family or not. However thunderfoot makes it seem like that's it, like there's no thought or conversation behind it, no rational arguments being made from him and the dialogue in the family/relationship. Most of the cases when He brings it up is in child abuse cases where their ACE (adverse childhood experiences) score is 7+/10. The ace being things like violence, rape and drug abuse. Never is this cut of connection suggested without prior connection and expression of thoughts and feelings between the victim and their parents etc. The only cases where that I've seen such bad callers that warranted that kind of thing have been with him asking if they have had therapy and sought the same thing with their parents. Some of those callers have pretty terrifying childhoods with parents/friends that are really deranged and won't communicate healthily, if at all.
The first video is about libertarianism, which is a good intro. The second is a reading from his book on relationships and the third is about philosophy and principles. All three make some very valid points and I'd genuinely love to hear your criticisms, one thinker to another. As a philosophical person I respect the criticism but thunderfoot is doing it all wrong. Sorry for the long comment and thanks for the correction.

$5.7 trillion (U.S Tax revenue for 2014) - 420bil (12x 35billion a month QE) means a 7-8% tax increase on all sources if the bond purchases had to come from tax revenue instead of pulling it out of thin air.

They covered volatility (I'm only 10 minutes in) early on which is one of the main downsides, not being a good short term store of value (long-term is debatable in the future however the past is evidence for the pro argument). 
However, if they don't mention the fact it's a brand new technology which could collapse should something unforseen come along and destroy it (just like our current monetary system) then that would indeed be too biased. Especially considering they mentioned the purpose of the doco was for the viewer to make their own conclusion at the start.
Edit: I guess it's a little naive to believe a film that could be made by pro bitcoiners won't be pro bitcoin, just as much as it's naive to believe that the government intwined media would talk about the negatives of our current monetary system in relation to bitcoin.

Tweeted. While the protocol is far from perfect the way bitcoin handles identities through decentralisation the solution would also have to be decentralised and just as unabusable.
Mainly just the potential of abuse outweighs the benefits, especially when a lot of people would love to see bitcoin die. It wouldn't stop other Cryptos taking it's place but they would ignore the coin validation anyway. I like many others are invested more than they should be and just like them I'd would be off the boat so fast if it was enforced.

The shitty exchange rate should be a small influence but i understand in your case its annoying. However you cant use your case as absolute proof 10% GST &lt; cost of sending funds overseas. As i said before flat fees = less % the more you send.
Send to a better exchange with locked in exchange rates and send over 1k to get the % down. It sounds like the argument you're making implies that those sending larger amounts will suffer from scaling fees (x% for 200 is x% for 2000), which is simply not the case.
Sounds like kraken and commiebank fucked you over, 17.6% is madness and you're one of the unlucky few who didn't do planning prior. Send to a better exchange that does less (scaling) fees and use a better bank.

Biased article. It basically makes the argument that, well. read this argument.


You've basically stated the facts and used emotional words. What is your argument exactly? What power dynamics? The entire article is full of this nonsense.
Now to address your argument:
Bitcoin is neither of these things. What would the slick clothes of silicon valley mean in changes to bitcoin? We hand over everyones private keys to some central party? Miners no longer exist or give 50% of their income to their respective government? A central party with the ability to manipulate transactions? It's not going to happen. 
What about the "rebellious existance"? Bitcoin is transparent, and if you use the black market there's easier ways to trade and alt-coins designed for you. That's all the so called rebels want. Anonymity. Everything else they want will come in time naturally or they'll ever reside in limbo hoping for the world to change. Bitcoin itself doesn't care.
Stop trying to pretend there's some decision to be made, action to be taken, change to come, because there isn't. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and it's going to stay that way for aslong as me and everyone else says it does. Money is freedom of speech and you cannot silence mouths through coercive ideologies anymore, the same ones that consumed societies since the dark ages through the abuse of the non-existance of freedom of information.

I'm not good at following taints especially when the coins leaving are the same coins re-entering, it's near impossible to tell if this is a scam or its the same user. The thing is mathematically the later you get on the worse the odds become of receiving a payout unless the person after you makes a higher deposit than you did (hence the term pyramid scheme) and provided you aren't the last one to deposit. This is an interesting experiment on human greed where the greediest will get hurt the most when it ends (if it does).
I won't be depositing and i don't recommend it for those out there who're curious.
Edit: After inspecting the source nothing on the website looks suspicious code wise, the chat logs use socket.io and look to be working fine on the user end and there aren't any scripts besides socket.io, bootstrap and some copy-pasted CSS.

I wouldn't say the solution to a mafia is to remove the mob and give new people the keys or attempt to dial back their power. Remove the state altogether.

Very true, its a mafter of opinion however it should still follow the non aggression principle and if then you still don't agree you're free to move away from that society into a one that suits you ;)
Quite a few problems we have today that are victimless crimes existing because of the environment itself, what people need to understand is that we are just products of our surroundings. If we had a society where you had no need to steal it wouldn't exist. There is a really good video about this:

To a degree, i agree - though would you call the forex rigging outright theft of your money? This still happens in forex markets and all other markets based upon fiat currency. Fiat, by its nature of existance is legalised theft because of the fact we're forced to use a currency that is consistently debased to no end. Bitcoin isn't. These are two different kinds of wealth loss, one is blatant theft the other is just a market with bad actors.
@_date: 2015-05-27 11:06:59

True, this I agree with but because its not enforced it punishes those who try to interact with those who are on the other side of the argument. For example if I Bought some bitcoins and then went to say overstock.com who was forced by governance to use a blacklist* I'd have a chance of being denied because the coins were tainted. This would be fine if I knew from the start the coins were bad but because of the fact its opt-in not enforced I'd be punished.

Ostracism is the most powerful form of non-violent punishment. It is essentially a sentence to death by gene isolation and is biologically and psychologically horrifying. 
Ideally ostracism from everyone who participates in the free trade society would occur, leading them to forgo almost every advantage we have from participating; power, food, work, society. There's many arguments you can make here like 'what if someone bends the rules and associates with them anyway' or 'they dont care and go ahead doing violence anyway' which can be countered by looking at the cost/benefits of somone to risk their reputation with other agencies/insurance companies of dealing with a person who's commited violence and also the fact it would be far cheaper to sit the violator down and negotiate than get more violence involved and increasing risks/costs to all parties. 
There is so much to argue here and to be honest; I don't know how it would work exactly, i don't think anyone does.
There's no possible way i can convince you 100% that a system of cost/benefits, supply and demand, dispute resolution organisations, insurance agencies and free trade would work. In the end none of this matters, we're not making a case for an alternative, we're making the case for that ignoring the principle of non aggression is immoral. It's not about the alternative, really. For want of a better analogy, If we can't prove a viable alternative to slave labor, that doesn't justify having slaves.

For starters you're straw manning my argument with 'go away and don't reproduce'. Again, as i said i cannot convince you each and every single theoretical scenario you continue to throw at me and call yourself the victor. All i can do is objectively prove to you that condoning the state is immoral. There's thousands of arguments to be made about its viability but that is not what i'm here to discuss.
Yet, because i cannot prove an alternative, that makes the pillaging and theft of states against their populace justified? I think i'm done here. It's a shame you can't be more rational.
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:54:00
Nope, it doesn't justify sticking with slaves. There's thousands of arguments by libertarian minded people in all kinds of literature that makes a case for a free society far better than i would.
"Your proposal is to kindly ask people to walk away when they're breaking our laws. Which obviously no one will do."
Another strawman. A good ethical theory justifies what we already instinctively feel. If someone is committing an uncontrollable mass rampage it would be universally preferable for them to be subdued or killed. It seems you're disagreeing with such a thing as universally preferable behaviour exists because i expect a response like 'who is going to give the order/make the rules then?'. You're fallaciously presuming secular/stateless ethics is not possible.

"Seriously. Please answer me: what happens when the ostracisee wants to rejoin society? How do you prevent him or her from rejoining society? A wall? Well how did you get them over the wall willingly? Violence? Coercion? And who decides who gets ostracized? And for what crimes?"
A blacklist between insurance companies/Dispute resolution organisations to not deal with said party. You can make the point that this opens the ability for abuse but now you're not seeing the benefits of competition and the massive disincentive an insurance company has to be dishonest and bend its own rules at risk of losing its reputation.
AGAIN, i cannot refute each theoretical scenario you come up with and i accept that i cannot make a solid case for a theoretical society. The ends does not justify the means however, if you don't understand that there is no debate to be had here.
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:12:09
It's about the principle of non-aggression which bearjewpacabra isn't making an argument for. 
If you've violated it or commited assult in the first place, to any sane person its not ok and would be universally preferable to have them ostracized at the least. A good ethical theory naturally validates what we already feel as instinctively right, Libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism is exactly this - an expansion of principles. Don't be as sophistic as him and call it 'hyper libertarian shit'. This is the only ideology which refuses to force arbitrary rules on other people. We don't give a shit what you do as long as you don't use violence.

Its controversial because it allows people to have complete control over their own wealth.

You mean people who invest heavily in bitcoin knowing well the risk they're taking, which in case is because of his love of liberty and hatred of the long history of theft by the connection of money and state? Or is it because he could possibly be a whale looking to make a profit in which case you're saying speculation is terrible for bitcoin? Hardly a thought out argument if I've ever seen one.
@_date: 2015-03-29 14:55:51


For starters this isn't what i 'believe', I accept that bitcoin is a far more efficient system than what we have today.
Bitcoin costs a lot less than the current financial system in running costs. Look up the cost of the entire financial system in the U.S year over year and look at bitcoin. It's not centralised so minting profits are distributed fairly to those running the network as opposed to giving it to the owners while it is also deflationary in the way the money supply becomes more scarce over time, so mathematically or 'on paper' it would store value much better than fiat (doesn't mean it will because of supply and demand but that is a given). There's many other reasons but I'll leave it here.




If it's not immoral and not amoral you're saying it's moral? You just said doesnt involve morality, nor does it not involve morality. I don't think you know what amoral is.
Now for my rebuttal presuming you meant immoral/moral: So you're saying "Things are not free, henceforth, taxes are mandatory" That isn't a very well thought out argument.
As for morality, it is completely immoral, it goes against the principle of non agression - it is the unprovoked initiation of force against someone not wanting to be aggressed against. The end does not justify the means. I cannot steal $100 from you and give $50 to charity and say its moral.


Your point being? My point is that efficiency doesn't drive societal change nearly as well as morality. Or alternatively put, inefficiency people can live with. People cannot reasonably live with being immoral, they must classify their immoral actions as moral because any sane person stutters when faced with outright contradiction.




Most of your paragraph isn't an argument at all, just a bunch of emotional words forming an ad-hominem attacking me instead of my argument. Sounds like you've got an emotional attachment to your beliefs about statism. Now, the only statement i can see is that 'The world wars weren't fought for profit or brainwashing'.
I never mentioned profit being a motive for war and as for the brainwashing, look at isis, religious crusades, ukranian rebels/military, U.S army or every other party in every war in the past; Both sides believe they are hold the moral authority to enact violence and that they are acting in good faith of their values. I made an analogy on how morality is manipulated or people are 'brainwashed' into false morality, not violent brainwashing though drugs or intense trauma. If you grew up in a society where in school/church you were taught human sacrifices are excellent and brings positive change, I'd call you brainwashed. If you were fighting for ISIS i'd call you brainwashed. I should of elaborated here but i thought it was easily understood.


Yes the fundamentals of logic do apply to me. I reasoned my way to where i am today, not blindly accepting what is.


Did i hit a nerve? Nothing to say here except you're making yourself look really, really stupid. My morality has nothing to do with my arguments, neither is anything you just said related to morality. If it is moral to do community service then it is immoral not to do so. So you're saying a guy in a coma is immoral because he is not currently enacting community service? I don't think you understand ethics very well, the coma test is pretty well known.

I'd like to refute your clearly retarded ability to think rationally:
1. He's posting publicly on his own account and anyone familiar with bitcoin knows he holds a lot. Anyone who isn't wouldn't be paying attention to his username in which case if it was his intention to fool newcomers/pump the price he could easily create a new account and post to avoid being singled out. His reputation here ads nothing to his statement. Your use of emotionally manipulative words, like saying how he 'conveniently forgets to disclose his holding' adds nothing to your argument, too but further shows your inability to make an non-fallacious argument.
2. If that is the case, I also stand to make 'tens of millions' or significant gains by voicing my opinion on and so does anyone who holds any amount of bitcoin since one bitcoin could be worth a billion dollars one day for all we know.
3. Because he's invested heavily in bitcoin somehow that means you should take 'every single thing' he says with a grain of salt, completely disregarding his personal opinions or valid arguments on economics, ethics and the state. Nice Strawman.
4. If we're all here to dribble shit, i'd like to point out to those new to bitcoin that you frequent (Troll/parody of spreading FUD and fallacious/humorous arguments) and i'll also quote your previous comment saying "In other words, we all have a vested interest in the demise of bitcoin. Why else do you think we pump out so many FUD spreading hit pieces in major news publications?" Clearly we should take your opinion with a grain of salt since you're heavily invested in bitcoins failure, if your rule about taking vested interests with a grain of salt is universal. If it is not than your argument falls flat on its face.

Bitcoin is a far more efficient system than the status quo, yet nothing changes. It's immoral to tax and debase a currency people are forced to use, yet nothing changes. Efficiency people can live without, morality on the other hand has defined history over and over because people fought for a cause that they believe is just, usually through being manipulated and brainwashed. People don't see the immorality in the current system and unfortunately you can not be reasoned out of a belief you didn't reason yourself into.

I highly doubt you would be ostracized or punished, especially considering your circumstances; The majority of people would be sympathetic - it would be much cheaper for people to help you than to throw you out of society. Violence is much more expensive than sitting someone down and coming to an agreement.
The trick is here isn't to look at the immediate benefits of an idea but the hidden costs e.g the benefits of welfare and the opportunity cost of taking money from people who are the most effective at generating wealth en masse and giving it to a mixed bag of people who leech the system and also those who are in genuine need - mostly because of the system itself. It's inneficient and a 0 sum game.
I know I cant have a solution to every problem but the ends still don't justify the means. We cannot steal $100 from one person, give $80 to a poor person and call it moral.

Nowhere doesn't have taxes. Moving into the middle of the wilderness and giving up all technology isn't 'free', even as extremely difficult that would be to live off as. You're still living in a country, you are still forced to pay taxes and will be punished if you were caught trading without giving the state a cut of your income.
If something is in your best interest it doesn't need to be forced upon you.

That it is. Though not having a license in this case would be deemed not trivial by most. So it being a license issue is unlikely since it doesn't meet the 'trivial but hard to fix' requirement IMHO.

This holy fucking shit. Durr the high of the year was $50 and the lowest is $5 so thats a 90% loss in value.

I have one too. Its basically a prepaid debit card that you can instantly top up with bitcoin from your coinjar balance ($500 per day tfer limit, no knowledge on daily spending limits on the card). 
Handy to cash out and spend bitcoin anytime within a few confirmations on a btc deposit or instant if your funds are already on your coinjar account. A good tool nontheless but not exactly what we were hoping for in terms of withdrawing back into btc on a whim or holding your card balance in BTC.

Can you explain this a little better? Was the amount large? Were they high profile, did they trade into Aud frequently? Was the person/s who he cashed out from reliable?
LB.com AU F/T trader here, I'd love to get more info. I deal with all banks but NAB but i heard they are generally one of the best to deal with in regards to bitcoin trading.
@_date: 2013-10-25 08:03:37
Ah well there you go. Usually if funds are held up for whatever reason its someone on the other end fucking you over. If you ever need to cash out reliably make sure you know your trading partner. I strongly recommend making circles of trust or using locabitcoins (AUD: look for rakka, r3365 or lastly, myself). I don't quite believe that standalone businesses operating in bitcoin (bitpiggy, btcoz, btradeaustralia) are completely immune to compliance, are as privacy centric and as responsible ( I distinctly remember an aussie exchange vanishing earlier this year..) like individual entities are. Peace.

Exactly what i thought! My other letter says they're refering to 4.3 out of the T&amp;C which actually says they can do as they like and close your account with no explanation. Seriously, go check it.
It was a personal account which does make sense in terms of the closure, but i have contacted them on MANY occasions through different avenues asking whether i should open a business account, it seems to me that it wouldn't matter. I'm declaring tax and the only difference is $10 a month in fees so surely that cannot be it. Whether or not i opened a business account doesn't "seem" to matter according to the lady from the closures team. I quote her reply to me asking about that fact "It seems like they would rather you move to another banking institution altogether"
I would be over the moon if they at the very least gave me a reason why. It seems like I'm pulling this shit out of my ass with the old "clearly i'm correct in this debate, can't you see how nonsensical they're being?" but I'm not, Not a single answer was given to me.
EDIT: There was never any debt on my account, maybe $5 from an overdrawn purchase, if that.

ANZ's 4.3: "4.3 Closing your ANZ account"
"We may close your account if we think that you have
not used it appropriately or for any other reason we
consider appropriate. If we intend to close your account
under this condition, we will send written notice to the
address shown on our records along with a cheque for
the balance of the account (if it is in credit)." 
That's their excuse. Because we can

I do a moderate amount of volume but nothing to be alarmed at, having a movement of 10k in an online transfer is rare and normally face to face meet ups are more suited to large amounts. Regardless they knew what i was doing as i intentionally toldbut have chosen to not want the risk for the most part.

Get on a personal level with all the people you trade with, it's relatively easy to tell when someones lying and work on your methods from there. Building trust is a major part of it.

As i said in my post i hardly had any fraud get through, you get the occasional buyer but you almost immediately know if they're bullshiting you. I'm very thorough in dealing with people and straight up about everything. I think the fact they gave me so much time to get with another bank ( 2 months) was because of the such little fraud that got past me, this combined with the former leads me to believe that there were other motivations.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:05:41
Been a few cases on here and on LB where i've heard of accounts even remotely associated with bitcoin being closed. I'm sure you could find a few threads on it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:15:33
I hope you're right. Yeah, I think i made a mistake not taking action and doing it myself giving them one less reason to close me down. Maybe i could of gotten an answer if i had of done from the FOI. Honestly, by the impressions I'm getting from ANZ, it wouldn't of mattered. I hope i have more success with NAB.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:50:01
It sure looks like it, i remember only a few days ago in the news that ANZ's business satisfaction is up. Hardly call myself satisfied.
Probably am going with NAB, the reason I'm so alerted to this versus the other dozen time's I've read stories is that i did everything correct, abiding to laws and following proper fraud procedures; on the flipside i saw other users with less experience with closed accounts, i rolled my eyes. Now I'm genuinely concerned about the state of Bitcoin in australia.

I can relate to that article very well. Especially the part about being open about my operations in person and on the phone to the banks.
