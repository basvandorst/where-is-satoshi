How about replying about stealing my coins, even coins I personally deposited
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:15:44
So are you still just going to ignore me even though you can clearly see I never committed any type of malicious behavior
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:16:44
Account email and password was changed. Amounts5x larger than my Norma buys with unused methods get done. I get text alerts. I take control of account through support by getting email changed back to registered email. Lbc freezes act. I send bitcoin from other offline wallet to other lbc account and lbc freezes that wallet
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:49:27
So ignoring all facts and proof that someone other than me was doing whatever and I should be punished Is right?
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:10:52
State the malicious activity please. You keep making that statement but do nothing else
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:21:42
Why up vote this guy when I can provide all proof it wasn't me on the account. I am already ID verified for long time. I seen conversations you had with the hacker in my account and he couldnt provide you any of the info you asked. You can face time me and I can prove anything. You can calll me on the number I first signed up on 1&amp; when and I'll talk to you
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:01:09
Ignoring me now?
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:04:39
You're obviously lying which Is why you won't reply to any messages or show any examples of malicious activity
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:22:48
Still waiting for an answer on the malicious behavior. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:40:10
Over 100 trades in over a year 97% positive feedback (can't please everyone) and when my account is obviously taken over with email password changes and obviously logins from IP address never logged into before I somehow get blamed for that behavior
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:51:51
Provided id me holding id I can provide anything
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:35:36
How is it possible that I am linked with malicious behavior when my account is over a year old with constant activity and never any issues
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:03:36
I provided pics they said it will stay frozen
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:29:42
You are obviously ignoring all signs that I was not in control of the account for days consideijg email passwords new ads of methods I have never used and different ip addresses were being used
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:04:26
The compromised account was 15+ months over 100 trades all real name verification. No issues except when I report it compromised because I am getting crazy test messages from about buying hundreds of dollars of coin from methods I've never used. I get back control of account after talking to support and there Is now 1.7 btc in my account because email and . I never had that many btc in the time I've been on there. Then because account is frozen I deposited coins to another account because I needed cash and they frozen that. Then I buy coins on bros account he provide all ID and they frozen my coins there and won't reply. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 03:00:56
It's been days of me messaging them
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:15:43
I didn't have2fa unfortunately. I do now but it didn't really matter since I can't use my wallet Support Is basically ignoring me
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:34:33
That is not true at all. Look at IP addresses. Look at my feedback. I've never had done any malicious behavior period. That is a complete lie. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:35:22
The thing Is I have no issues in all my time there. I buy 5-60 all from same ip and same area Ip. They won't even reply
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:03:13
I dont exactly know how but my email and pw were changed
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:21:08
They refuse to reply about ip addresses logged in from which have to be 100% different from any I logged in to from in15+ months of use with no issues. They won't say anything about email changed or payment methods ever used.  They won't reply period
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:15:54
Care to explain how you can steal coins deposited to accounts
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:42:54
I can't even ss my ever time I log in it immediately logs me and out. I reported my account being compromised so they frozen it . I needed to sell coins opened an account deposited and they frozen it and won't reply. Bought .1 again on my bros account and they frozen that. I had over a year 100+ trades never a problem then one week a login from different device changed email and password and I'm screwed and coins stolen
