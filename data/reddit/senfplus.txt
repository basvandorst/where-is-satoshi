Well I cannot help with your US citizenship problem, but if you therefore need an US exchange check kraken.com. Kraken accepts Sepa deposit and provides Sepa withdrawal both in EUR. In fact all this is processed via an account of German Fidor (Fidor.de) Bank.

It is not Bitcoin Core who is entitled to define what Bitcoin is! We will see how this ends. There has been an agreement, it is time to follow this. Everyone has to give in to some degree. Not being able to do so is just meaning behaving like a dictator. Who likes to follow a dictator?

Does it really? Or is it not the case that it give the impression of such a security. An impression which is not fullfilled by reality of such a seal.
There are kind of seals in ledger very probably, but these are electronic signatures inside the device and not glued sticker. Ledger uses a two  chip design whereby one chip is a tamper proof security evaluated chip hardware out of the smartcard industrie. This is much more than a sticker on box or housing.
I very much like the interview with head of ledger here: 
He also speaks about this in last 20 minutes of the interview.

What purpose should this seal have?

There are two different risks to take care of:
a) Someone gets access to your wallet (seed, keys) and steals your coins.
b) You lose access to your waller (seed, keys), so your money is lost as well
Unfortunately solutions to both problems contradicts each other. Ledger is a perfect solution for problem a). So if it is just about a) you would not keep a i.e. paper copy of your seed. But again then b) may happen. So for b) you need your own solution. I.e. you may split the seed and store each part in different location. ... Note you may also want someone to be able to recover your wallet if you die. ..

The majority of miners signal support for seqwit2x. So they will mine it. Seqwit1x chain will got stuck without mining power. Before it can be adjusted, seqwit2x will be accepted as Bitcoin. With regard to that the effect on BTC price will be small. But BTC means seqwit2x (and not 1x).

GPG is GnuPrivacyGuard. An open source implementation of PGP. It is normaly be used to encrypt and decrypt emails. At that time very probably using RSA. Typically you have two key rings. One with your private key and one with all public keys you know.
In general it is not related to Bitcoin, but it might have been used to encrypt a Bitcoin wallet. Typically files encrypted have an extension .gpg or .asc
Homepage of gpg is 
You might find a current version (for windows) here

PS for Bitcoin search for a folder with name ".bitcoin". I think this is the name of the folder on Linux and might be the name on MAC as well.
