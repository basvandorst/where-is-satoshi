"But seriously please quell my FUD."
No reason to be afraid, today is an average day. BTC is some $1,000 less than yesterday but it is $1,000 higher than tomorrow.

You will see a relief on Monday when it becomes easier for many people to send new cash to exchanges.

The best Bitcoin to buy is the short Bitcoin futures position at CME because the price of BTC will drop by at least 99% in a month.

IRS is performing probe at Coinbase and looking for customers who haven't paid their taxes from capital gains. Search the Internet e.g. for
"Coinbase Likely to Lose Fight to Block IRS Customer Probe"
If your outgoing payments are blocked, you have been found guilty of tax evasion and you're gonna be arrested, approximately for 5 years.

Yes, lots of people did. Search for recent tweets with Coinbase at Twitter.
IRS is searching for people who failed to pay some taxes from the Bitcoin, and Coinbase failed to stop this search. Look for:
"Coinbase Likely to Lose Fight to Block IRS Customer Probe"
on the Internet. FBI is likely to arrest you soon if your outgoing payments were disabled. You have good reasons to escape from the U.S. if you're still there.

9 times out of 10, no problem. What happens on the tenth time? A problem...

It will be even better time on Sunday evening, perhaps early Monday. People at exchanges can't transfer cash from the banks during the weekend, and lots of people who wanted to buy new cheap BTC have already spent their cash. So over the weekend, the selling should dominate, and it may get reversed once the people have their first new dollars from the banks available on the fastest exchanges.

Satoshi Nakamoto needs to sell his BTC 1 million because he's getting old and needs to enjoy the money. Please buy it from him and don't allow the price to drop below $3,000 per Bitcoin, otherwise his plans will be threatened.

Basically all the commenters at
complain that they have been robbed of their money in one way or another.

If you can't really afford to sacrifice virtually everything by Sunday, you have to sell it - or you have to sell to have as much real money as you actually need.
A much deeper fall by Monday can't be excluded because people can't refill their accounts on exchanges with cash easily during the weekend.
If someone were telling or suggesting to you that BTC can't drop 50% or that it is always guaranteed to get above your initial price, he was lying to you.

Someone *has to* determine which coin is the Bitcoin (it's implicitly assumed that only coins that were designed to be self-evident successors of the coin described in Nakomoto's paper and his first programs will "complete" to get the name "Bitcoin"). It's pure labeling, a fight for a brand - nothing changes about the substance.
It's the whole point of Satoshi Nakamoto's paper that all these matters are decided democratically with the weight - power of the vote - given by the GPU power one holds. Proof or work, PoW.
So this approach of the exchanges is totally sensible and in agreement with the founding logic of the Bitcoin. A priori, BTC, BTG, BCH, B2X have exactly the same "moral right" to be called "the original Bitcoin". They came from splits where the two parts could have been considered equally legitimate successors. So which of them gets the "brand" of the "main Bitcoin" is decided in some way derived from the miners.
Miners really have the power over everything at the end. The developers are their "employees", the holders of the coins are just "clients of financial institutions", and people painting themselves as cultists and screaming on Internet forums such as this one are just irrelevant trolls - the miners are the financial institutions who dictate the rules of the game. If you haven't understood these basic things, you have understood nothing about the the basic logic of cryptocurrencies.

No, you're misunderstanding what an attack is. An attack isn't what the nut jobs on this subreddit say - a fork they don't like. An attack is something that selectively steals or double spends some coins so that particular addresses benefit. One is always at threat of those when someone controls 51% of the hash rate.

They were solving different issues now. Someone who was born in Taiwan gave an emotional talk how great it was to move to the mainland China etc.
You may try to Google search and Google News search for 
比特币 中國共產黨
The first three characters mean "Bitcoin" and the latter five are the "Communist Party of China". Use Google Translate to turn it to English.
