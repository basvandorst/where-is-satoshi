For starters, I am assuming that you know about Mining.
Now, we at BitcoinGrowthFund (BGF) have launched the MCAP token. Some key points about our token are:
* MCAP is the best option for an average user.
Instead of investing in various cryptocurrencies and hoping for their price to increase, the users can invest in our MCAP tokens.
Factors which would affect the price of MCAP tokens:
-Cryptocurrencies are seeing an increase in their daily trading volumes and are seeing a gradual increase in their popularity.
-With the increase in the number of transactions daily, the need for people to verify those transactions and upload the data to the Blockchain has also increased.
MCAP is essentially a mining and ICO token where the funds raised from the token sale will be invested in mining projects and the ICOs launched by other start-ups. We at BGF see mining a lucrative investment and have invested in world class mining equipment to maximize our profits.
Since there are a lot of ICOs taking place in the market, it is difficult for investors to identify which ICO would offer a better return on their investments. Our dedicated team of analysts at BitcoinGrowthFund continuously analyse the various ICOs based on more than thirty parameters such as background of the team, viability and scope of the product idea so that our investors never need to worry about their investments.
* MCAP offers high returns on investments to the users.
We at BitcoinGrowthFund have realised the potential profits which can be generated from mining and have developed an algorithm to calculate which AltCoin would be most profitable to mine at any given moment based on its difficulty level, trading volume and the profit it would generate.
* MCAP enables the average user to help fund start-ups they see profitable.
Instead of relying on a select few VCs for raising funds, start-ups can raise funds through crowd sales. For example, investors who participated in funding of ventures such as Facebook, Uber and Alibaba at an early stage have earned returns in multiples of thousands on their investments.
Access to such investments was always limited to a few select large investors. With BGF, we enable regular investors to act as VCs in the process of funding start ups and profit from the success of such ventures.
* Price predictions
European Hedge Fund Managers and Crypto Analysts have predicted that once launched to trading platforms, the supply and demand will determine the price of the tokens and the price of MCAP tokens can easily touch the $100 mark by the end of November this year.
* $5 m raised
We have raised a little over $5 million in ten days through the sale of our MCAP tokens. Raising such a huge amount shows the increased trust placed in BGF and MCAP by the public. There’s an air of excitement in the cryptocurrency world about the progress of our tokens as people are enthusiastically participating in our token sale.
A side note-
BitcoinGrowthFund has planned to release a total of 100 million tokens and has only released 20% of the MCAP tokens as of now. The remaining 80% will eventually be released in the coming months.
BGF is also offering discounts on the MCAP tokens for a short period of time
