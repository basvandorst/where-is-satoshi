What is your best guess/tech analysis (preferred) at where this rally will end up?

 Bulltrap 1: early on I saw a spike in the ETH BTC price I think about 0,079, It then dropped and I bought at the 0,078 -0,077 level. Thinking ETH was strong and going to strengthen. Than the BTC bull run started and instead of selling my ETH for a small loss, I held on and held on and finally bought back into BTC at the 0,0574-0,0573 level for a 27% loss :-( Thinkning BTC was still climbing and ETH price was not moving.

My stop triggered at $7277 so I am waiting for the price to drop slightly to trade back in...not fun waiting,

Mining Gold results in people dying and being injured...how do you justify that...you can't. Think about going to work 4kms underground or rather in a big warehouse.

What about your insurance premiums?
If you need to spend $1000 of your investments, would you melt a piece off with a blow torch?
Would you turn your kitchen into a vault in order to protect it, definitely do not tell anyone you own one?
BTC is virtually negligible to protect, if you know what you are doing; you can spend any % of it whenever you like.

Drogba is from Ivory coast. Potentially with high political or corruption or inflation issues as in many African countries. Thus crypto a potential door out for the population...

BTC price prediction difficult to predict: sometimes it is a apple, no its a banana, no its actually an orange, actually its a steak, no it is a chair .... somehow, some people seem to know exactly what it is, but for me it keeps changing. 
You may say it will correct ... or you may say it will keep climbing in a bull market. Personally I hope there is a small correction before the next increase, so I can re-buy back in?
Let me know your comments, how you make sense of price predictions?

I had a trailing stop order running, incase the price dropped to say 6500. But instead it just dropped enough to just activate my stop order and sprung back to 7400. So the stop sold at 7277. Eventually I bought back in at 7550, as I thought the price was going to jump. All in all I lossed about 275/BTC. My error...buying and selling BTC is complicating, as the market is volatile and effected by many things, Satoshi Nakamoto designed it that way, I think.

The price is currently $8200 and rose from $5800 in only 1 month. Thats a 41% price increase. As of today the price might decline, might stay the same or might increase. Unfortunately there is no sure way of telling the direction.
It may stay at the current price for a day or two, then one can expect a decline or increase.

Authorities are doing alot to prevent this type of thing. Very good that you bring it up though, the more awareness the better. 
I do not think Apple uses unethical suppliers.

Bitstamp, 0,25% per trading transaction
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:16:05
In that case there will be a correction?

Making all kinds of trades
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:13:55
Normally there is a correction, except when I trade to gain from it. As in this case:-(
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:45:50
Makes sense. My stop loss triggered at 7277$ so Ill try catch a local low back in. Thanks

Buy the dip sell the peak. You just missed the dip/bottom $5800, but the bullrun has only just started. So it is still a good time to buy and HODL
Sounds a lot is hinging on the EFT decision, which is delayed and thus we are currently in a momentary delay of the bullrun. \[Not financial advice\]
