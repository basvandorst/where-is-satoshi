@_date: 2018-01-24 13:15:47
Good time
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:04:14
I think you can buy from gdax and there is no mark up you buy the bitcoin at spot. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:02
Lol let’s see what happens 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:42:40
I was looking into setting up a non profit charity for my community this involve helping the kids and homeless. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:51:59
I’m not worried the main guys are holding the vast amount of bitcoin and will continue to hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:27:54
He he maybe the futures guy are all on a short and soon we will be going to the moon ahah
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:53:55
It’s fine where it is! Was only supposed to hit 5k by year end! We are ahead of schedule. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:46
Lol I agree! This is the time to buy but I believe it’s going to go a little lower
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:45:13
It’s more like a store of value to me it doesn’t need to be lightning fast but hey if in the future it speeds great 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:18:19
Anyway I still say 20k by New Years 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:05:46
Where does he move it to get the fork coins? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:07
Lol I meant to reply to the other guy... anyway it will go lower and the veterans will buy up some more btc on sale 
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:30:02
I would reach out to the bank as well 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:12:10
I have lambo payments but all make is kraft dinner money fml
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:04:55
Just as Real is the money are your debit card! Who are you kidding lol
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:55:24
Stocks are a Ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:29:29
Let me know how this goes I also have quadriga and am wondering how long of a wait is expected. Thx 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:20:33
That’s huge for a market that barely budges 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:10:43
Nice in 6 months I’m still up 10x after this huge correction. Go figure eh.. you let the bank and wall street let you believe 5% a year is a good investment when inflation is 3% you’re really only 2% on an outdated currency good luck 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:59:32
It’s 8.5% by the way
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:25:22
I think you mean BitTorrent 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:46:28
Just the next leg in the war against bitcoin... yawnnnn
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:35:04
The banksters won’t get my precious coins I’m holding on forever haha 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:49:59
I think the stock guys are but hurt because there precious stocks are tumbling. Oh and they said they will open even lower this morning. I hope you sold your 401 k old timer 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:10:22
It’s okay once the sheep see past this we will only go higher 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:53:35
Fuck I can’t wait till visa and MasterCard are gone! Ripping us off with 20% interest 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:21:02
Uh have seen the media lately? If you don’t think there is a war against bitcoin you must have worn the dunce cap quite a few times growing up
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:28:01
Eth is awesome but will never hold the title and bitcoin is the market most everything goes through btc and unless that changes it is the safest hold. I have about 15 coins but I realize that btc drops everything drops. So this is why I shill btc because i am invested in crypto and I do believe it will work and help solve a lot of problems 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:08:33
Oh my god an extra 2 o’s I’m glad I can make someone laugh because I’ll I have been doing is crying
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:02:27
And it 8.5% in 6days but don’t worry we will print some more money and fix it up shortly ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:06:26
It’s bullshit the dot com bubble was 10 trillion in the 90’s it’s safe to say we can easily hit that number
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:44:46
Lol no bitcoin at 20 k 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:41:45
I keep buying :) we saw the future so pick up some coins cheap boys
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:02:28
The figure is now 4 trillion wow that’s a big chunk of change.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:47:16
Lol that slide just began last week and on Monday they lost 1.6 trillion and crypto we lost 80 billion so who is the biggest loser? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:51:01
Okay we will see which one bounces back quicker. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:53:13
No but I think all that red in the stocks you see right... yea most of that is in gold but I bet some of that money is waiting for the next btc bull run
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:17:30
Yea then I may as well use what is in the bank 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:08:16
Ha I can tell you guys are in here spreading lies because you’re  afraid... you probably see just how powerful the technology is and you have a short window before mainstream adoption good luck fuck heads. Let the disruption take over I’ll sit back with my coins and popcorn. Oh by the way mark my words you will hold some coins one day.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:05:17
If that were the case they wouldn’t be trying to stop us from using our credit cards. Don’t you guys see they are trying to hold on as hard as they can but this will be all be for nothing when we make mainstream adoption. They will inevitably accept us or lose to us... they can pick 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:59:54
It’s going to take you more than a year to make that 2.5% drop in the stocks and we will still be here
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:19:30
It’s a joke... calm down haha I hope your stocks shit the bed and you find refuge in crypto my friend. Just make sure don’t wait to long
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:42:15
Or what if he destroyed the wallet already because he has thought of this... hmm
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:08:18
Embrace the flip my friend. They can’t regulate it by the way try as they may and keep scaring people like you!
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:00:19
When the fear is at its highest ! You BUY
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:31:03
I know what your trying to do silly 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:39:19
Better get a gas mask lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:36:55
Lol what if 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:17:23
I swear you guys have no clue! Bitcoin will hit 2 trillion market cap and once it does it will be extremely hard to sway the price. Now if the media stops attacking bitcoin we could get there sooner and see less volatility.
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:41:26
What if satoshi nakamoto lost his private keys lol 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:13:29
Do yourself a little bit of research and you will understand how valuable and disruptive this technology truly is. Don’t be left behind bitcoin will never hit 0. The media, Wall Street, government and the banks can try as the may!!! But bitcoin is here to stay my friend!
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:21:08
Yes I am holding until mainstream adoption then I’ll think about spending some hard earned coinage. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:10:04
Canadian bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:58:56
Nah I am deluded to the fact this technology will scale and become a dominant player in finance. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:19:58
Haha I just want to watch it go up and down 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:43:44
Yes I’m glad you’re out of the market please stay away from anything has to do with it now 
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:46:00
They lost close to 2 trillion usd we lost 400 billion over 2 months. It’s a big difference
