If you were the one in charged of that bank, living in Russia and under the authority of the Russia government, and received a "harsh warning", would you continue to do business? seriously?

Honestly using a credit card is way more simpler than Bitcoins 
@_date: 2014-05-24 17:37:56
I really want to know who the hacker is and if he got arrested.

323/btc wtf? is that real?
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:23:42
But that would involve a centralized authority correct? To handle punishment when a person cannot pay his debt. What's the stop the person running away if there is not centralized authority ?

so you're using it to get high, stupid....

Okay, then answer me this. Are you seriously using Marijuana for medical purposes or other legitimate uses? Or are you going to use it just to get high?
Society has enough problems to deal with with alcohol, now you're going to make one more substance easily available to the public for more people to abuse? Who are you doing this for? the good of the public or you?
Unless you're willing to accept bitcoins only, not converting to fiat, then it's possibly. Bitpay/Coinbase isn't going to help you because selling Marijuana is still ILLEGAL on the federal level and they can be charged for money laundering and illegal activity. Bitcoins is still in the gray area and you're asking them to take even more risk, no idiot is going to do that.

Again, that would involve going through a bank and having regulations that will protect the investor in the worse case scenario.

that's what i'm trying to figure out
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:07:58
after i resetted the blockchain, it disappeared... is this a bug?
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:05:11
I don't think so, I checked multiple times before sending because I know transaction can't be reversed with bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:05:48
how do i find my account public address?
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:04:20
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:42:45
this is the address. It says I should have a final balance of 5.8, yet i only have 1.7 left in my account... (4 btc that disappeared and .001 that i tried sending). help?
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:04:05
This is bad news... They're selling credit cards for Bitcoins because its untraceable. It means that Bitcoins is used for illegal activities again....
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:32:40
i have no idea...
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:45:29
No it doesn't... They're using bitcoins because they don't want to be traced. It has nothing to do with superiority 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:27:48
yea, i had to uninstall multibit and then import the private key to another wallet. Definitely a weird bug

@_date: 2013-12-11 05:38:36
that's thing though. I checked blockchain and it says transaction not found. That never happened before. Also, 4 btc disappeared from my wallet and i never sent those and I don't know where they went!
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:07:33
tools &gt; reset blockchain and transaction. I read on the multibit website that you should do that. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:43:11

@_date: 2013-12-11 05:56:29
This is the address that I sent to.
Blockchain said there's no record for the transaction though and i thought it would be confirmed almost immediately. I did pay the 0.001 fee.
I also resetted the blockchain and transaction, that's how I lost the 4btc coins.... right after i resetted, I noticed that 4 btc was gone from my account....
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:05:35
unless he paid in btc then he's never going to make ROI
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:56:12
Thanks op
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:06:55
At first, the transaction was only on multibit. There was a pentagon next to the transaction, so I waited like 3 hours and nothing changed. the account definitely went down. That's when i decided to reset the blockchain and then, I suddenly lose 4 btc....
