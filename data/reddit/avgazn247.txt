Ask your parents to cosign at 18. It improves your credit since u will have a much higher credit limit and u will be less likely to use more than 30% of your credit line. Assuming u pay all your credit cards off on time, u will have a good score of 700-800 by 25 allowing u get much cheaper rates for cars, appt, and houses

Govt should but  police shouldn’t. Why?conflict of interest. Plenty of people have been screwed over for unreasonable civil forfeiture . Cops are a lot more likely to abuse a system if they gain from it

options in certain cases are actually much safer than stocks such as covered calls and selling puts but weeklies are gambling.

Lol no

No only if you sold the house for gain. Also u still have to pay property tax. Do report your btc gains. Btc is very trackable and the irs can nail u up to three years after a trade

More like most money is printed by the banks by fractional reserves

It’s most likely lower because of “lost coins” like that exchange that went under Caz the owner died and no one had a password for his cold wallets

They have nothing as a result. It’s super short sighted. When u make things free or too cheap, there no incentives to make it efficient. But Venezuela is a failed state and this is just one problem
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:45:28
Lol no. Venezuela has huge issues that no silver bullet will fix.

Caz hyper inflation and anyone with a brain is trying to dump the Bolívar asap. Crypto is an easy safe way compared to carrying around cash and trying to spend it without getting mugged

Hindsight too good, if I was told the lottery number a week ago. I be rich

U get the money in 2018 vs 2019. How long you hold only matters for gains not losses
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:49:10
Actually yes especially if he has a loss great than 3k because u can only deduct 3k per year. If he is down 12k it takes 4 years for that deduct. Best start now than a year later 
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:50:38
If it can reduce your tax bracket why not? Wash doesn’t apply to cypyto so u can buy record the loss and rebuy. U can deduct up to 3k a year
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:02:49
U fucked up. If u were gona do that, u had to do it last year or yesterday . That’s called loss harvesting. Now u can’t claim it till end of 2019
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:10:17
U can still claim it for 2019 but if u claimed it for 2018, u could have gotten a larger tax deduction this tear vs next
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:42:29
Depends. If u switch to a stable reserve currency like the dollar, u can end hyper inflation because the govt can’t print more money. However that wouldn’t solve the insane debt issue Venezuela has and the fact they import everything 
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:01:52
They actually easier to manipulate since the SEC won’t go for your ass unlike if u pump and dump a stock
