Wouldn't this have tax consequences for the large holder? i.e. create a taxable event?

What you are missing is the following: let's say the price of bitcoin drops to $90, and the hashrate halves, like OP says. You decide to continue mining. Your hashrate is the same as before, but now your fraction of the overall hashrate has doubled. So your rewards (measured in BTC) double.
Whereas before the price drop, you were getting say 0.1 btc/day, now you are getting 0.2 btc/day. Depending on the exact numbers involved, the USD amounts you earn before and after the drop might be about the same.
Get it?

May I draw the attentive reader to Mike Hearn's idea of a "polite and professional community": 


You aren't fooling those of us who are paying attention, Mike.

Even if somebody "attracts lightning", it does not make it "polite and professional" to call them a "horrible personality".
My point is merely that Mike is on the one hand calling for "polite and professional" while on the other hand, not exhibiting it himself. I don't know about you, but I find it difficult to trust somebody who publicly calls for civility whilst personally doling out the opposite.
