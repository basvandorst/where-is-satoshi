Well, India has had some issues getting Smart Phones to the people suffering from the vestiges of the Caste System. Mostly in the Rural and sub-rural areas. Even in the slums of the cities. 
&amp;nbsp; 
It also doesn't help that India's "Face" is **ONLY** Priminister Modi at this time. So when India's Finance Minister made his very, very, eloquent and reasonable statement about Bitcoin. The world took it as "ER MER GERD! INDIA'S AH BAAN'N DA BTC!" 
&amp;nbsp; 
Myself included admittedly until I took Google Translate to the page...Then Took Google Translate to the Page into Russian...then Russian to English...and Read that they were not banning it at this time, they simply wished to look into several dozen ICO's, Make sure other Exchanges were Safe and that they didn't recognize BTC as money...
&amp;nbsp; 
All perfectly rational, but meaningless until Modi's reforms can be enforced locally.

JP Morgan doesn't charge jack for wires O.o 
At least not on my account. I've been with them since they changed all their "Everywhere" branches to Chase.
What kind of Murderous bank do you have that charges $30?

Education based on behavioral data going forward mostly. A Good example is the Q1 Annual Dip, with the exception I think of 2016 was It?, As the user base grew more aware/understanding of the Q1 behavior it's impact became either less severe or lengthy as a result in respect to the FUD's affect on it.
A major, MAJOR, outlier in this early Q1 cycle that needs to be factored in. That this was the first Q4/Q1 that BTC was a major Part of the public Id (hope I am using Id correctly) people took out loans, mortgages, etc to buy in late...on money they didn't have.
This caused FUD in people who otherwise would have likely been "Woo! Q1? 10k here we come!" To go "Q4? 15k? What in Satoshi's Ghost?" I know I sold a chunk back around 17k as a saftey net.
Then came the downtick, slowly going to 10k-&gt;11k. Alright, people paying off those loans, mortgages, Xmas Debt, avoiding their Mother in Law. This would be ok...if it happened in the normal obscurity that Crypto, still in adolescence (Not immature), is used to. It happened with the world looking at it with less than Solomonanic glasses.
That gives us a second double sided FUD panic, one from the "Oh god my house" and two from " Oh god you idiots mortgaged your house." Add this to the perfect storm of the Dow Stock Market slide, which alot of lay-people take as "It's the financial Alpacalypse"
 (The Financial Apocalypse is caused by the NASDAQ, we get Alpachas from the Dow)
That value will return rather rapidly, once the "users" get over the FUD effect. Since the run away growth and decline, that's been my focus. FUD vs. Volume = FUD Effect. Granted, it's a highly subjective task to assign a weight to any FUD event. As anyone with a suit, tie and can get on ye-old-media label can do great harm or good.
 It's almost impossible to counter FUD once it starts to cascade across the Mass Stupidity Communication Systems:(
TL;DR; lots of elements, lots of other people smarter than me on both sides of the fence. I'm just running my own numbers and enjoying not being someone who mortgaged their house!

Say what you will about John, he's not a stupid man. He's eccentric &amp; drug-fueled, but we're still talking about the man who can be argued to be the father(s) of the modern Cyber Security industry and he helped build MGTCI.
&amp;nbsp; 
MGTCI or MGT Capital Investments, the MGT is short for the original name "McAfee Global Technologies" is likely the United States most profitable Cryptocurrency Farming Operation since they moved away from CyberSec.
&amp;nbsp; 
Now John "Exited" the company last month, took his shares and went on. No, he didn't do this before the crash. He did it after it started on the 26th, when BTC was around 11k. (I know that doesn't mean he didn't cash out on Shares/Coins/etc earlier, he likely did.) 
&amp;nbsp; 
The point I am trying to make is that when John made his $500,000 Statement, then later doubled down, halving it to $250,000 when observing Eth's relational behavior? That's not the action of a braggart. That's the action of a man who has 5,000 S9's running 24/7, A army of Crypto-analysts studying every ounce of data he can get, followed by Big Data Scientists following that. 
&amp;nbsp; 
If you start poking around, you'll find other bullish people like John. Not as...colorfully bullish mind you. Yet Bullish in the extent that they list numbers above what the Old Media, Old Mindset FUD predicts. They are all unified by a large Datascience department or background thereof... paying for operational Data! A perfect example, I very, very recently started a small farm, I was offered subsidized power by a local investment firm in exchange for them to collect logs on my S9's performance.
&amp;nbsp; 
But back to the big guys. Their logic is often restricted (For GREAT reason IMO, see above, their own data) to their own use, but the result they share freely and may even give a high-level lecture on if asked. Unless locked behind an NDA as I suspect John is behind. 
&amp;nbsp; 
So when John says $500,000 by 2020. He doesn't mean: "Weeeeeeeeee! up we go!" He likely has looked at a pack of models, simulations, and projections thicker than a Calculus Textbook, discussed it with his team...Snorted enough cocaine off it to kill an elephant, then went on National Television in that order.

I'd agree with you on India. They are desperately trying to move away from cash, especially with Modi's move last year that ditched that one Rupee denomination and another coming this year...The issue is the remnants of their Caste system in access to mobile devices IMHO.
&amp;nbsp; 
China I would have agreed with you had they not stripped Crypto-mining of special protection in the SEZ's and forced Provincial governments to draft plans to have the farms shuttered. 
&amp;nbsp; 
Now, if you want to look at a country that is making great strides into a cashless economy it's Japan. They were the first to adopt BTC as a viable means to pay for criticals like Utilities, Taxes, etc.

Personally? As of 1241-20180302, CST I'm bullish of BTC hitting $397,371.42 by 0000-20200101, CST.  That's been going back up since the FUD idiots have been leaving the sandbox or putting their head in the sand in panic. 
TBH. what I would like to hope, but I know is false, is that people are educating themselves into the Crypto Recovery.
