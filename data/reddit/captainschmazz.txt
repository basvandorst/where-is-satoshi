I know some folks like Delta, but I really like CoinCap:

Whales push the price towards 12k and then sell, pushing it back down towards 10k to buy back in. Rinse and repeat. Just a theory — been ping-ponging between 10 and 12 for awhile now.

The market cap being $549 does NOT indicate that this is the amount of money that has been invested in crypto. Market cap for each coin is circulating supply multiplied by current price. Most buyers did not pay the current price or anywhere close to it.
I read a convincing estimate recently that the amount of money actually pumped into cryptos is probably around $10 billion.

I used to be scared of this happening too.
This thread might help alleviate some of your anxiety:

Somebody hodl me.

He's your friend, so wouldn't you have more insight into the potential benefit for him for saying that?

Seriously. Selling this as "Microsoft and Starbucks will accept bitcoin" is incredibly reductive and missing most of the big picture. And, man, that big picture is huge.

I don't think people are getting how huge this is for Bitcoin and crypto. Maybe the Fortune article explains it better:

The report also clearly states the reasons for this.

Some of those "losers" are using TA to help them make money in a bear market while many HODL'ers have simply watched the value of their portfolios drop considerably from their ATHs or initial investment (or both!). TA isn't a crystal ball, it doesn't tell you with certainty what will happen, but it does help some traders manage risk and reward and make some damn good money in both bull and bear markets. That said, I firmly believe HODL'ers will have their day too if they tough out these rough patches (I'm in this group, mostly, so I may be biased).

Well, you can do a hell of a lot with less than $1k in a bull market even if you don't know what you're doing.
In a bear market, you can still trade your way up to good money, but you gotta have mad skills. Otherwise, yeah, invest and forget it about for a few years.
So, the answers is... it depends.

Daytrading only makes better profits than holding if you're good at it... which 99% of people aren't. Most people are better off holding.

It's all your fault! Dangit, man, give us a heads up next time.

CNBC tryin’ to bring back the FOMO after weeks of spreadin’ the FUD.
In other words, they bought the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:09:09
Nice try, IRS.
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:48:50
Sunday dip? Denied!

Scam scam scam.
They have nothing on you. They send this to millions of email addresses and hope they reel in a few fish.

I think this is honestly the only thing OP can do at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:00:31
What does this mean? Explain it like I’m an idiot.
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:14:20
Or is this a bear trap?

Correction: Gilfoyle is mining bitcoin, not trading, and he uses Napalm Death's 1.316-second song "You Suffer" as an alert to notify him when bitcoin dips below a certain value, making it no longer efficient to mine. This is so that he knows when to remotely toggle his rig at home, much to Richard's chagrin.

The irony of this article being published today.
