Yeah but he said he was staying near fisherman's wharf.

Until the NSA just demands the encryption key with a warrant they are not allowed to talk about or argue.
Seriously if I had typed that sentence a year ago I'd be that paranoid conspiracy nut. But that's literally exactly what happened to Lavabit.

Some jerk drew a penis on a $20 bill. Ban penises!

But wait, if you don't get their CC information, how can you secretly charge an unadvertised monthly fee that you can only cancel by calling between the hours of 10am and 2pm on Wednesday?

So taking away a persons freedom to choose what substance they wish to consume somehow liberates them?
Well you going around spouting your wild opinions may restrict the freedom of people who hear it and are influenced by it. Clearly in order to promote greater 'freedom' we should remove your ^(~~right to free speech~~) divisive propaganda... /s
You're really stretching.

OK, I get that everyone is ticked at the NSA because they're evil and all that. 
But isn't the whole point of TOR that it can protect you from corrupt and evil governments snooping.
I don't know how to remain truly anonymous, but the solution is definitely not to just hope that the government never chooses to look at you.

Beg pardon? What's stopping me from trading for a car with boring old monochromatic Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-10-03 00:38:45
I made at minimum 5 accounts. I'm not even slightly concerned. 
I'm just upset I was at work and missed the chance to buy bitcoin at $80

That one's true right?

I'm new to this. Not because I'm new to it, I've been using bitcoin for years, but I just don't pay much attention.
Why would anyone use an online wallet service instead of just using the standard bitcoin program on your own computer?

Waiting for a confirmation is like using one of those markers on a $20 bill to make sure it's not counterfeit. It's a small inconvenience that demonstrates a lack of trust. It's mildly offensive but understandable. It could easily be dispensed with for small transactions or for regular customers.
Waiting for 6 confirmations is like handing that $20 bill to your security guard so he can take it to the lab and have it analyzed under a microscope while you call the treasury department to confirm the serial number on the bill.

I agree with some of this.
I don't like a lot of people, but I interact with customers daily. I'm good at faking it though. 
As long as you give the customer the illusion of caring, that's all that matters.

He didn't say it was a negative thing. He said it was a thing.
And it's not necessarily negative unless the person with this new power decides to use it for negative purposes.
One might argue that something that creates the possibility of a negative, where there it would otherwise be impossible, is in-and-of-itself a negative.

It's now illegal for businesses to accept any currency other than the legally recognized currency in their or their customers country.

Honestly I don't think it matters how easy the tutorial is. I know how to use bitcoin, but if I was on a machine that didn't have it set up and lost all my accounts, I wouldn't be willing to download the client, wait for the blockchain, set up an account at MtGox or whatever, link my bank account, and wait 3 days for the $3 deposit.

Simple solution, carwash owner decides to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-29 23:20:20
I get that. Thank you. 
So if I had a golden Bitcoin that was worth a single gold bar, it's price would fluctuate with the price of gold not the price of bitcoin. Because somewhere in the world there is a gold bar that belongs to ME.
So I wonder what happens if you own a car with a colored bitcoin and lose your wallet keys?
