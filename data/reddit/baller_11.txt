So is Bitcoin mining distributed rather than decentralized?
There's less than 9 giant data centers that account for 95% of the blocks.. currently. 
I'll just accept an answer of yes by your own logic.. 
Good to have the BCT elite finally agreeing to what some of us have been warning to for awhile.
Perhaps Andreas should ease off on using Tor as an example as to how decentralization "works" in his future speeches with TED?

Bull whales who keep putting up huge walls.. (that mysteriously disappear whenever someone starts dipping into them..heh) are basically "stabilizing" the price right now. that should tell you how confident you should be in the price.. right now.
But I would be shocked to ever see double digits. would have to be something catastrophic. or Satoshi moving his coins.

Guys if you don't know what KNC has been doing for the past 3-6 months.. you really need to do some research, besides completely lying to their customers and having the gall to create and use against us customers, a "customer fairness promise" not "selling" any equipment for Q1, good, so instead they've been manufacturing and mining equipment for themselves this whole time...  Why is this not right? Or why should we care in a free market?
They’re essentially killing the Bitcoin network by having created one of the biggest centralized Hash Data centers with computers all the original buyers helped to "fund".. They were mining with pools for awhile which took away any fear of 51% (not that there is much fear) but now they pretty much solo mine, while continually driving the Difficulty up..  
Why is this a problem?  Well every once in a while these giant hash powers go down.  Who knows why? Power glitches, upgrades, etc..  The point is the damn difficulty they created stays high (at least 2016 blocks..long time) while the petahash drops dramatically, leaving the network blocks sometimes taking 30-40 min. it's a BIG problem that everyone seems to be ignoring.  
On top of that, they have huge elec. bills they need to pay for I'm sure.. Guess what price they sell all these Bitcoins they mine at? Market value everyday I'm sure.. The whale's (who are constantly driving the market down) dream. (as the OP suggests)
I would say, Don't let KNC do to Scrypt what they did to Bitcoin.  But we can’t stop that train.  I know it would be harder with Scrypt but it can eventually in the long run have the same ramifications...
Just be aware, and it’s proven with history, these 2000 units you are pre-ordering, for 10k each, will pay for their 12000 units they’re building for themselves, to mine for themselves while they “deliver” the units you paid for at an (un)predictable rate.  
Constant centralization of power, getting bigger and bigger, higher and higher difficulty, and rife for detriment to the network with a simple power outage.

On the surface, I think they can see how this could fight and release us/the world from the clutches of centralized banking.. (they're also masking their Conservative hate for the Fed by liking anything potentially anti-Fed)
..they understand very little which I think reflects what about 90% of the people who have heard the word Bitcoin would say/think..
My guess is his "friends" will hate Bitcoin, Beck has the distinction of being a right winger who just happens to *really* hate the fed and what it is.  I say distinction because as much as you would think the Modern Conservatives would hate the Fed, in practice all politicians bow to them.

Wow.. I almost forgot about this guy. the amazing thing is, when I first learned about Bitcoin, very late to the game, this was one of the first vids I came across that was "against" Bitcoin, so I of course watched it, and realized this guy didn't have an idea about what the hell he was talking about, (his unconditional reverence for the $ for example) and this was coming from a person (me) who didn't fully understand what the Bitcoin protocol.. invention was.. at that point.  He just doesn't understand fundamental economics, but condescends as if he does..  Honestly, I should thank him, but for not the reasons he would like... lol
The saddest or funniest (depending how you look at it) aspect is his video has been comment disabled, downvoted to death for its shear stupidity.. and he of course will stand by it, because of the amount of views it gets... that's ignorance at its finest.  Why listen to reason or good judgment?

They were mining at Eligius for awhile.. Oct. to Jan. 2014. And suspected to be mining at BTCguild as well, sometimes their known addresses at Eligius would drop and not surprisingly the Petahash matching would then jump up at BTCguild within moments.. 
Took them a few months to figure out their solo mining it seems..
They've been mostly solo mining since the end of Jan. 2014.  See "unknown" pie slug. That's mostly them now. It hovered around 10-12% for forever, then jumped up to about 30% when they stopped mining at Eligius.
It should be noted KNC who has ties with US companies like Chicago Sun times, etc. Has outright lied many times about their business practices, including a written promise to never mine more than 5% of the network, something they've greatly surpassed as early as Dec. of last year.. THEY should be coming under the same, if not more scrutiny by the Bitcoin community.  But mostly falls on deaf ears.

Ah finally someone speaking truthfully. 
The way a lot of people rolled over for regulations of Bitcoin. Is frankly amazing...
..Until you realize people are grasping at anything to try and "officially end the bear market" as you put.. Even spinning regulations of a protocol that wasn't designed to be regulated, as being a "gentleman thing".  Where do you think the acceptance of bitLicense leads? CSBS is on deck, Fed is next..
"Current Bear market", Gox, continuing hacks, BCI, US Tax code.... Let me know if these are getting better because of BitLicense..?
The centralization of mining (distributed mining) which has allowed big data centers to sell off massive amounts of coins whenever they need to pay bills..  Some of what has kept the price on a downward tangent in this discovery market.
We've been in a bear market for awhile, without pumping and speculation.   See the latest attempts, Changetip bonanza, Russia "buying" Bitcoin, All this good news why price down?.. these merchants accepting Bitcoin (Actually accepting Fiat through Bitpay or Coinbase).
The question any fair minded person should ask themselves is, are you actually just a short-sighted bull, or a bear in disguise hoping people buy into this, "we're NOW in a bull market... again" line.. you know to sell coin.? heh.

I agree, but,
I call this a Mining Paradox.  This idea that mining middle-weight companies closing and difficulty dipping as good for decentralization, is just a fallacy, and one that will repeat itself if you believe Bitcoin is to succeed.
Greed and centralized mining will be a poisoning of the idea of decentralization every time the price goes up.  
Perhaps major advances in Computer CPUs could juggle the top centralized mining powers, but one would assume their "headstart" of infrastructure, access, R&amp;D, energy vs. cost, etc. will always keep those giant Data Centers at the top.
What does that mean? 
Centrally located fail points of Distributed Mining for Bitcoin, that will centralize further because of competition, until something major happens, quantum computers quietly advancing in some 3rd world country maybe.. 20 years from now? (highly unlikely)

I think my statement was pretty clear. 
They're claiming to be fully functional but no one has confirmed their fiat withdrawals are working.  
Which of course would be difficult to know for certain, (even if they claimed it) seeing as they "opened up for business" Friday after business/banking hours.  So no, they're not in order as of today because I still can't withdrawal my money.
  
(After locking fiat and BTC for days...and a day where the CEO is giving out BTC for funny jokes)
Now when Monday comes that might (hopefully) change but as for today.. (and pretty much entire last week)  it is not... 
I can reply to you here for two more days of this, if you need me to?..  And then you can reply me to on Monday about how everything is all in order...  
But my advice to anyone who is running a 50+ million dollar (which we'll know when they prove all reserves) exchange.. is to never assume your house is in order, to always task those around you how it's imperative that all stay in order, and then perhaps you won't be hacked and then won't have to give out BTC for funny jokes...
But hopefully the point is made.

I really don't see how it gets approved.  
I don't know how often and ETF gets approved that has potential to go horribly wrong, approved with the potential of being revoked?  
I don't see how you ever regulate price. 
You could set rules and regulate an exchange.  
But how long will customers stay after a huge China dump or pump and NY doesn't budge or at smaller %. 
Exchanges are manipulating hard right now, and having a rules and regulated player in a global system that is being manipulated is not gonna work.  
And will most likely leave a lot of customers unhappy and crying foul or running to the SEC.

do you trade or? Do not follow any of this advice.. 
If it spikes to say..220 you could sell. buy back at 200 etc. over and over but the chances you stay on the right side of that candlestick are slim.  It's called averaging to try to minimize loss... if you're really threatened by the downward trend..  
it could easily see 250 again, but it could see 100 too. it's very volatile.
but really look at the 1d view on bitcoinwisdom. you really should know it could still escalate downward. the true value of bitcoin won't be known for awhile. 
if ever with all the manipulation..
whether you should hold or not is up to what you can bear..
For example you bought at 240. that was like a couple days ago.?  there's people holding since last year at like 5x that amount.   They're looking at it long term.

One buyer bought over 100k worth of LTC on BTCe alone before this last pump..  
BTC price jumped much higher than Bitstamp.. Which tells you people who just sold a bunch of LTC for more than double what it was yesterday were then using that cash for BTC.  
Either to hoDL or to offload with a payment processor all of which usually take BTC.
What kind of chasing happened after that is a guess. I think people buying after dumping their Paycoin had an effect too.

Stamp was basically a major exchange which closed up for a week and held everyone's funds and BTC. Yes for security reasons, but this can't be good in Lawsky's eyes.
I'm expecting some amendments are being made.

Or are they keeping what they found under wraps for security purposes, while other places could still be vulnerable to a similar hack.. ?

VCs and investors are clearly interested in bitcoin... it's everyone else *we* should be worried about.  
VCs all want to be the next Steve Jobs.  Hell they wouldn't mind being Dr. Dre.  
Bragging rights in a little sector of interest that becomes huge in popularity.. attracts VCs and Angels.
10 entities throwing 50 million at something over the past year is really nothing in the grand scheme of things.
throwing 10 mil at something that sounds great in theory but horrible in application, seems to commonplace amongst VCs as well....  
ie. that company that just got tons of VC money for trying to "stabilize" bitcoin's price. which basically can't happen in a global unregulated crypto.  It sounds like a great solution but doesn't take a soothsayer to realize even if implemented would never work.

BTC has been doomed for centralization since ASICs... just stop already. "ideals of decentralization"... A lot of us have been warning you all about this for about 2 years. 
ASICS sold to customers were a great "notion" of decentralization... unfortunately the present is a reflection of what history has proven.... 
most if not all makers realized more money was made by just lying to people and mining for themselves.. lets count the culprits..
In every aspect BTC has become more and more centralized.. but none more blatantly obvious than with Mining.

Lets not forget Sam Cole's infamous quote 
"There’s still going to be $2 billion, at today’s price, mined in the next few years.”
That's from selling coins. a lot of them.  makes $116mil investment for a piece of that feasible, along with the fact they were always a mining start-up and cloud mining service business for a year plus, now they're a stealthy company doing unprecedented things..

I agree with this. but with this one example, any argument as to Bitcoin's fungibility could be squashed severely..
.. until decentralized exchanges exist (if feasible).
The bigger scarier question, and why fungibility is so important, what if one exchange dumps because evo's tainted coins weren't caught etc. 
other exchanges, traders will follow.  But BTCe will still be "holding" their tainted coins supposedly. This has the makings of a sticky situation.  The market will be riddled with "oh you sold bad coins, stolen coins, they didn't."

I wouldn't say the idea of investing in hundreds of Bitcoin companies rather than a tried and true company with a track record like Apple or Disney is a "safer" investment.. 
as a side note.. remember what *types* of companies make-up those "thousands" of Bitcoin companies..
I've been trading on Scottrade for over 5 years. have never had money stolen from me from hacking.  And if I had, it would be insured.
I've had money stolen or held from me 3-4 times using BTC second party "services".. And before you say "oh those crap exchanges blah blah.. " 
ask yourself what no insurance, reputation only, trustless parties offer to change this ongoing problem...? 
and then when you answer with centralized fail points like "Coinbase and Circle".. ask yourself how they're different than banks or Paypal, and what can they promise to not be corrupt like banks.?
My guess is they become insured and regulated soon, and then all the libertarian positives and talks of a "Push System" are pretty much squashed.

I've been saying that Bitfinex is using bots internally.  It works both on run-ups and sell-offs. It's a reactionary bot that allows skimming of fiat at the top, and skimming BTC at the bottom.
I call it Potter's Cut.  
This was further solidified as plausible when their CSO Potter admitted he "trades" on his own exchange. (One he has unlimited access to)  And then when pressed tried to say he only "invests" on his exchange..
When I get more evidence I will present it.
I only mention it because you said "Bots deactivated" Which is funny because my observations which aren't hard to follow, aren't always evident. But I would say are 95% of the time true.  
Which makes me believe Finex turns off their bots periodically to not be obvious as to what they're doing..

Having watched the push for the Argentina effect, and the Russia effect on this board over the last couple years, almost always failing to cause a run, based on people being more astute as to what is happening in the market.
..I've wondered how much of the Cyprus effect was actually real.
Andreas had talked about Cypriots buying Bitcoin a lot during their crisis, in his speeches in 2013-14.. 
And in proposal of utility works, but in actuality is much more difficult to believe as practical.  
Think about what type of work and trust one person would have to go into just to transfer their worth from Cyprus bank issued bills.... to BTC..
Anytime one whale buys BTC with rubles, you'll see three new posts about "Russia is running to Bitcoin!".. 
And yet you can see the ruble to BTC pretty much follows the BTC/USD trend, if not worse, and a much lower volume.
For example, this basically didn't happen, just a small spike and dive.
And that's CNBC..  Look at the volume and see it's a few hundred total volume for the week.  
You start to question these posts and the source.
If bitcoin adoption is increasing it will be at a much smaller rate than any of these "runs on the bank" propose. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 10:57:41
If you take this into account. 
China Pools alone (that we know of) are around 44% of the mining power.. 
KNC by itself is probably a lot of unknown. 
As they were once around 15% and have only gotten larger.
They mine on other Pools too. like Eligius.

Cuz Bitpay instantly transacting BTC to fiat for M$ in this capacity isn't really "news".
It's just more of M$ accepting Bitpay's business model.  Lets not forget,  until companies of this size accept BTC directly, companies using BTC to instantly transact fiat (void of any other movement) would actually drive the price down, theoretically. 
Unless Bitpay is holding BTC. waiting for opportune moments to sell.. 
A very dangerous option for them in my opinion.

"Malicious application was found" sounds like a vulnerability found within Coinbase's servers?

hence the word *most*.  


I knew someone would bring up the Goxxing starting well b4 2014. those others are pretty much all within one year though.
Otherwise agreed that greed leads to rigging, esp. seen in FOREX..

But Harvard Review didn't say "Bitcoin isn't dead; it's "one of the most powerful innovations in finance in 500 years".
WSJ *columnists* did. 
I say columnists lightly. those particular WSJ writers are clearly invested in Bitcoin and are probably not impartial to it..  because of their investment.

I find it a bit odd you're posting this and so concerned about everyone's losses with Gox..
Yet your a Gox apologist.  
When you claim Gox's Willy Bot "never had an effect" on bitcoin, you're effectively defending his criminal acts.
And worse, injecting a free pass mentality to those future criminals running exchanges to commit similar deeds.. (Cough, Potter/Finex)
When there's apologists defending them, what's the turn-off not to continue to run internal bots?  Morality? 
I understand you helped to identify it, but feel you have some weird defense mechanism as to the effect it had, almost as if you wish you never discovered it?  It's a bit Stockholm Syndrome-ish.
Gox being the captor of your Bitcoin, and you being the Hostage.
