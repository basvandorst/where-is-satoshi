It's not a monopoly over distribution of computer programs. It's not even a monopoly over distribution of mobile apps. But it's still a monopoly that directly controls access to tens of millions of users.

Actual Bitcoin transfers make the most sense for large, relatively infrequent transactions. For small or frequent transactions, Bitcoin fees are kind of high and confirmation is kind of slow.
Consider very small and fast transactions, like paying for individual blocks in a Bittorrent-like swarm. Maybe you want to pay $0.0001 per block and are planning to download 50,000 blocks from 10,000 different people in 10 minutes.

40% is already too big.
10% is too big.
Consider what happens if the pool operator decides to cheat on a game like Satoshi Dice. If they're reliably minining 10% of the blocks, that'll let them unspend 10% of their losses. That's basically a hard break of the whole Bitcoin scheme.

Regulation is a tool used by the wealthy to manipulate the game in their favor. Wall St wouldn't be against bitcoin regulation, they'd actively push regulations that made it more difficult for it to be used in any way that didn't benefit them. I mean, they'll do that anyway, but their investment in it won't change that basic principle.

Censorship isn't something you can just have a little bit of, or that you can direct only at content you personally want to suppress. If the mechanisms are available, they'll be used to suppress anything and everything that *anyone* doesn't want to see published.

Hitting over 50% is "oh shit, we know it's broken *now*", hence the drop.
As long as any three pools control over 50% we still have a serious problem, just not an immediate crisis.
As long as there *any number* of non-p2p pools that control more than 50% we have a problem that should be fixed.
Mining centralization isn't a new problem, but having a pool hit 50% is a pretty serious reminder. Hopefully it'll push people to fix it.

Unlike "fascist", "monopoly" has a simple definition and a simple test. If you can, in practice, enter the market and compete then there's no monopoly. You can't enter the iOS app distribution market and compete with Apple.
In contrast, you'd have to use some other term to describe Google and the Android app distribution market. "Near-monopoly" might work, and is nicely fuzzy for you.

Not at all.
The system is basically completely broken if anyone has 50.1%. Right now that just requires two existing pool operators to collude.
There are reliable double-spending attacks on the system at far lower percentages. 
First, if *anyone* is accepting unconfirmed transactions for anything, you can reverse those with a reliability equal to your share of miners. 
Second, you can reverse *confirmed* transactions with a probability equal to (s)^(n+1), where s is your share of miners and n is the number of confirmations you want to reverse. With 40% of miners, someone can reverse a 6-confirmed transaction with a 0.16% chance of success. Doesn't sound like a big deal, but margins like that routinely make people millions on FOREX.
I guess we can fix this by requiring like 12 confirmations for all transactions, but that takes Bitcoin from being a decently fast payment scheme to taking two hours to confirm.

The thing to compare to is Dwolla, at a flat $0.25 for transactions over $10.

Bitcoin is bad for this application due to high transaction costs and minimum transactions.

Bitcoin as it exists is 100% dependent on ECC. Without small signatures, the bandwidth and storage costs would make it impractical.
It *could* have been built with RSA. It probably will need to be rebuilt with Lamport signatures at some point. But the availability of a good, free, EC signature algorithm was a huge enabler for Bitcoin.


Interestingly, the early engine patents had largely expired before cars took off. I'd claim that patents either have no effect because the technology isn't well placed to be adopted, or they retard progress. In every case.

Patent laws delay innovation.
Innovation occurs in small steps, each building off the previous. Each patent prevents further innovation along that path for 20 years.
In the Bitcoin context, just look at public key crypto. People were using DH for everything for 20 years waiting for the RSA and ECC patents to expire. Bitcoin didn't happen until someone improved ECC algorithms and then *didn't* patent it.

Hopefully this will force Dwolla to really deal with the chargeback issue more effectively. Chargebacks are a hard problem, and it may be the case that you can't have both fast from-bank deposits and chargeback-free transfers at the same time. If you claim you have both and it's not true, you deserve to be sued over it. I'm a big fan of Dwolla as a credit card / paypal replacement, but if they're dealing with money they have to actually be reliable.

I wouldn't assume that any modern crypto will ever become "more crackable". It's designed to be impossible to crack ever and that will be how it goes unless there are math breakthroughs that may never happen.
@_date: 2012-09-06 17:42:22
Bitcoin's security is based on a digital signature scheme called ECDSA with 256 bit keys. Without a mathematical breakthrough, it would take 2^128 trial signatures to crack this scheme and recover a private key.
A modern GPU has around 2048 (2^11) shader units and runs at around 1 GHz (2^30). If it could test 1 key per clock per shader, it would take around 2^87 seconds to recover one key. Thats 10^18 years, or billions of times the expected lifespan of the universe.
If every person on the planet had a GPU like that, all working on cracking the same key, then it would only take about the expected lifespan of the universe.
If Moore's Law continues at its current rate and we get twice as many shaders every 18 months, then a GPU for each person on the planet would be able to crack one bitcoin key in one year in about 100 years. One GPU would be able to do it in a year sometime around 2150. Due to some reasonably hard physical limits (e.g. making a transistor smaller than one atom is unlikely), Moore's Law should stop working well before 2050.
If we jumped one step up to ECDSA-512, we could start making claims like "given our current understanding of physics we can't brute force it using a computer built of matter with all the remaining energy that will be ever be emitted by the sun".
In conclusion, brute force can't beat modern crypto.

Freedom is the ability to choose your actions.
And economic actions are pretty significant. Freedom of movement would be pretty constrained if you couldn't buy, rent, or lease a car. Freedom of speech would be pretty limited if you couldn't buy internet or phone service. One of the best US anti-communist propaganda points from the 50's was the claim that in the USSR people couldn't choose their own occupation - that's a pretty draconian restriction on personal freedom.
Things that could be classed as "economic freedom" are a pretty significant portion of freedom in general.
Now, the question of whether it's fair that rich people have more freedom than poor people (because they have more choices available) is really interesting. But in society as it is today if you eliminate choices among economic actions there's not much freedom left.

For small to medium amounts of money, you can use a checking account.
For larger amounts of money, you can buy low risk bond funds. Boring companies (like Nestle in Europe or Coca Cola in the US) are still borrowing money at ~3% interest and are pretty likely to pay it back. By using a bond fund, you can maintain basic liquidity at the cost of a small administration fee and small transaction fees.

The way the blockchain currently works is a design problem.
Keeping the record of every transaction forever isn't necessary or even especially useful. There are a bunch of ways the protocol could be changed so it doesn't do this and my full node wouldn't require 50 gigs of disk space and a 50-gig redownload every time I lose the block data.
One of three things will happen:
 * The protocol will be changed to fix this.
 * Transaction costs will go *way* up, to properly cover the cost of storing the data in perpetuity replicated thousands of times, thus preventing 50 gigs from ever becoming 50 TB. (The block size will not increase significantly.)
 * Independent full nodes will disappear, transforming Bitcoin into a clunky centralized system. (The block size will be effectively uncapped.)
Serious protocol changes are not being discussed. The current debate is between the last two bad options. If Bitcoin doesn't fix this, it will be replaced by something that does.
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:53:41


Which is the same order of magnitude as, say, Dwolla.
A decentralized system should be able to do better than that.
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:57:03
The problem is that the low block size is papering over the more serious problems with the bitcoin protocol: storage and bandwidth.
Increasing the block size is probably a good idea because it will make dealing with these issues unavoidable. But it's important to keep in mind that that's what a block size increase means: It's forcing these other issues, not really solving the system's problems.
And if those issues can't be solved once the block size increases, Bitcoin will die a horrible death of vanishing miners and full nodes.
