"I understand that in China you have a dollar buy limit of 50k Yuans per year."
Actually it's $50K, equal to about 300K yuan.

It's difficult to sold it for about $80. because now iphone is not as popular as it was before.
But iphone is still my first choice.  Hopefully they will help to promote bitcoin.

That's a story worth reading for Mark Karpeles. He will know he can't get away as easy as Zhou tong.

You should not "donate" others' money to charities for you.
That's not things a good man should do.

I registered on coinbase with my .edu email and no bonus received.
It seems students of little universities can enjoy this offer.

I am scared that so many people said "no" there.

I just contacted the official China Merchants Bank about this issue via the same method, and they told me that they don't know whether it's true or false.
I just contacted btcchina.com online support, and they refuse to say whether 工行、建行、中行 accounts got closed.
So I doubt the credibility of that "screenshot".
But, who knows the truth?

No relation to Bitcoin.

If a "new" coin was founded for founders' self financial considering, instead of being for the sake of improve "digital currencies", then it's just a joke, if not being said as a fraud.
According what you said, your coin has no advantage&amp;potential from the beginning. You never intend to contribute any value to the "digital currency world". You saw others created new coin and got many money easily, so you want to creat another one coin to get those "easy" money for "charities". However, it's not honest behaviour.
Man, my words are very rigorous, but out of kindness. Please forgive my offence.

it's terrible. You know how the thief got the email address via their system?
