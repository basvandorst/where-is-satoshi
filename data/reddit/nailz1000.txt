If they catered to people who demanded nothing but perfection, no they wouldn't. They'd go out of business in a month. No business is flawless all the time. 
Smart businesses reward loyalty. Smart customers stick with a company who provides constant solid service and forgives the occasional blunder. 
You know those stories you hear of insane women screaming at a minimum wage worker about calling corporate because Dairy Queen won't make her a goat cheese and maple leaf blizzard? That's OP. OP is the insane customer.

"Paypal" - PayPal allows users to buy with bitcoin at merchants.

I like hypotheticals. They're the best.

Establish trust with your customers by not running a business website off of tumbler

Paypal is fine to use person to person if you fund from a bank account. If you send money with a CC, then your recipient is going to get hit with the CC transaction fee that all businesses are hit with for every CC purchase. 
The fact that no one understands this is hilarious to me. I've been using paypal since they started and, since I'm not a merchant, I've never had anything but positive experiences.

People who use PayPal to sell items are fucking fools. People who use it to buy shit are geniuses. Also the PayPal to pay through the phone is great.

I think Uphoria is actually OP on a different account.

Bridge or no bridge, they're enabling the transactions to happen through a trusted merchant.

And also post about it, publicly shaming a company without attempting to resolve the issue amicably first. He wants to leave coinbase? Fine. I don't give a shit. He wants to call them out for something that was very obviously an error? That's the kind of cuntpickle move that shouldn't be tolerated.

The counter point was that there's no one to arrest at the bank. Who's going to get arrested? Everyone?

That would be perfect, as i am now in SF. :P
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:43:12
Wait. 2 years with no problem and then one probably accidental fuck up makes you want to bail because you're treated poorly? Man if I was a business owner I'd tell you to go right and fuck yourself for being a self entitled little cuntbag.

From what I've seen, I think bitcoin is here to stay. However, I think the price is too unstable to make a strong power play for a very widely used currency. I don't see it gaining traction in anything but large, technologically driven cities like SF, Seoul, possibly NYC. Maybe larger online vendors like Amazon. 
I'm sorry, as a consumer, I just don't see the value when we have instant pay things like Paypal and Google Wallet. If the strongest argument for bitcoin for the average person is to remove the need to carry around a wallet, that market is already starting to be dominated by other means.

How exactly is this hypocritical? They're saying their product is superior.

I'm sorry, "micro donations"? am I giving someone tiny pennies?
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:36:39


Yes, that's kind of my point. However, there's no certain future for bitcoin and nothing in the adoption rate that yet convinces me that it's going to latch on enough to take a big enough market share to be an economic .. not powerhouse... but just a legit player.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:09:04
Those are shitty customers. Dependable service over time should allow for the occasional fuck up. I bet OP would be screaming if he got fired after bumbling something minor after 2 years at a company. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:54:14
Yah, I get it. Still, calling them micro donations is silly. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:33:35
If you stop calling it a currency they can't make laws regarding it as a currency. 
Bitcoin is a bartering tool. A virtual product. Its like MMORPG gold. People place financial worth on it in terms of USD (or whatever currency you use) .. Just like any product. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:38:23


Looks a lot like your claiming that Bitcoin is not only inevitable, but also already gripping a strong enough market share that it's a necessity for businesses to accept it, rather than just starting to sort of take roots as having a possible bartering value.
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:37:10
I like that you think bitcoin has such a strong market hold that retailers have no choice but to accept it. 
No company is actually holding on to this currency and when they accept it. They're not paying employees in bitcoin and the value is so unbelievably unstable that it would be corporate suicide to do so. 
They're accepting and then selling this stuff immediately turning it into real cash. Paypal allows merchants to accept bitcoin, sure. That's great. However expecting any company to "adapt or die" at this stage is bordering on fanaticism.

It's not his job to police how people use legal products that he sells them. You are correct. This is a pretty hilarious charge. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 13:36:38

If I had to cancel a credit card whenever I was forced to call to unlock my account for suspicious activity it would be more hassle than not. And its only happened about 5 times. I've had a CC for nearly 15 years.
