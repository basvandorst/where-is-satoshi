I don't understand it. It requires an avatar name, do i have to play a game to exchange through VirWoX?
@_date: 2012-08-23 08:56:50
ok thanks, I always thought of second life as a game. Now I am again left clueless :)
@_date: 2011-09-06 08:39:48
I think that this is the price of freedom.
@_date: 2011-10-27 10:52:27
so true
@_date: 2011-10-05 12:18:37
Not quite true, yes Greeks avoid taxes when possible but I consider this to be quite sensible since the state does not offer anything back to the citizens, other than low quality education and a health care system in ruins where doctors must be tipped generously in order to try to help you. And the taxes are so high, about 40% income tax (without considering the end-of-the year tax that you have to return money depending on your income) plus sales taxes, property taxes, local taxes, and extra taxes every year. I believe every Greek citizen that respects his life, should avoid paying any tax he can. The crisis is not due to avoiding taxes, politicians always could push forward any policy they wanted since they could always find the money with currency devaluation or loans, and now in the era of the euro by selling worthless bonds to the ECB, which will always buy them since it's a matter of the project euro staying alive.

No, I never intended to. I am in it because of the idea and its potential, not for profit. Plus, I like using coins to buy stuff :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:59:11
Let me add to these points!
1. Highest liquidity is a symptom of people using it more than others.
2. Now that I've tried another exchange, mtgox seems easy on the surface but quite obscure - and it is not that easy. You understand that when you trade elsewhere.
3. That's just silly. I find other APIs quite useful as well.
4. In the exchange that I now trade, there is no verification needed. This means, you can instantly start trading.
5. You shouldn't have to trust that much. Just don't keep funds in it when you are done trading.

And you probably have tolerance issues, plus you use too much drama.

Red letters read: "winged gold".
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:47:17
Really? Ok thanks! I am inspired now, I'll be using bitcointip to reward others :)
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:43:37
Quite true. So, innocent until proven guilty.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:16:36
I thought I would do one for once. Been waiting for that moment for a long time. Then I saw about 10 other similar posts. Well.. nevermind :) Three digits look nicer than two.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:47:42
Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most likely nothing like that is true. But to bankers and politicians (hell.. they all look the same to me), all that matters is public perception. It does not need to shut down, just maintain a grip on the majority of traders and fluctuate the market so that trust is shaken.
I repeat, I don't wanna go into conspiracy theories, I just want to emphasize the need to balance the exchanges. Mt Gox has repeatedly proven themselves to be really not able to handle the responsibility that now lies upon them.
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:26:41
Terrible idea.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:38:37
Am I too late??
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:10:22
Is it possible that Mt Gox has an incentive to bring itself down? Or maybe talking to some people that bring that incentive, such as politicians or bankers? I've been witnessing a lot of drama since yesterday, on reddit, blogs etc. Posts that promote a sell out, that use fear tactics. Keeping in mind that most people that trade are merely automatons responding to outside influences, one can see that it is all about manipulation.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:14:41
With all these negative posts, I thought I'd try some positive thinking :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:37:05
@_date: 2013-05-13 08:53:42
You are right, but it's also a challenge that can make the relationship stronger or break it apart. Provided that you gained the "lesson", that is new understanding, and being sincere about it, I believe everything will work out. Some things need time, and at this point you have to be understanding that she deserves to be watchful of you and project some doubts. Just remember, it is not what you may say, but what you may do that will build trust again. I hope everything turns out ok!
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:30:11
It remained alive throughout the dark hours, but of course we can't know how it will behave if more people start using it. But still, I find the interface to be a lot better and more responsive than mtgox's, and it does what I tell it to do. I can't count how many times I encountered trouble in mtgox when putting/canceling orders.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:41:50
Every lesson that is truly learned, costs something.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:42:26
That can only be shown by time. Bitcoin is sound money, and there has been no problem with its operation. To me that simply means that all we see with the price, is irrelevant. A short-term game, for the shake of redistribution at the expense of inexperienced traders. If you can't understand that, then you will not understand why I don't care.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:36:27
Thank you for this post. It covers so many things I wanted to say.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:44:29
If we go about 3 months back, when the price was at $15, noone could know what would happen. It's just the same now. So, it's never late or early. It is what it is.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:35:14
Can't this be a set-up so that he looks ugly?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:38:07
Still, this graph is no more wrong (yet) than the one that got totally upvoted! Plus, it does not affect me since I counted my bitcoins as bitcoins and not as dollars, and - guess what - I've got the same number ;) We've got a long way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:32:26
I'd like to think so too. I just thought I'd put it out there, to make the point that if we can't rule that out, we must balance the use of exchanges so that competition will bring the best out of them.
Mt Gox could have such an incentive if they didn't believe in the long term success of bitcoin, and were promised cash that surpasses the total bitcoin worth of the market, something quite negligible for bankers.
@_date: 2013-05-12 10:04:23
Look at it this way: you learned a valuable lesson in a crash course costing 2000 euros. If you have really learned the lesson, then the price should seem like a bargain.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:18:03
Did you notice that the article totally misses, purposely as it seems, the fact that it's still higher than it was 3 days ago? While it emphasises the catastrophe of being "30 percent off its intraday high of $266"?
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:03:53
There are fees in deposits and withdrawals.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:33:48
Provided that it falls. However I can't help but notice YOUR determination to scare people. What's in it for you? Don't tell me you are a kind-hearted seer with the single purpose to help the others.
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:33:01
No, it's no problem. It just gives incentive for saving money. Try not to confuse the monstrosity we have for a monetary system around the world with sound money, like bitcoin. Of course if it weren't for fiat money, we wouldn't have so much credit going around, but we wouldn't have all that collapses every now and then, caused by malinvestment, which is caused by wrong signals that interest rates and prices give.
In a few words, what something like bitcoin is likely to cause, is more quality* in our economic endeavors.
Edit: * for example, things will be made to last more, ecological footprint will be less, economic decisions will be based on real signals providing what the market really needs, and so on.
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:42:24
It is open source, but there is a lot more to it that make it totally different to our familiar fiat money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:54:55
I moved to bitcoin-24, and I have to say that I am very happy with it. Everything seems to work, and there are no fees for trading. I'll never go back. I now see mtgox as very harmful to the bitcoin economy. Guys, just get out of there.
