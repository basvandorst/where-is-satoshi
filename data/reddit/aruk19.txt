Just don't use shops that process funds with BitPay, vote with your feets.

So this means that the routing problem is solved ?! /s

Very cool project !  
Do you intend to put a limit of locking time for the vote to be accepted as legit ?  
e.g. locking a small amount for a very long duration (equivalent as burning them) would biase the vote virtually for free.

Great action from the Canadian Bitcoin Embassy, we need more statements like this !
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:31:05
Yes! I cannot find them here : [

It's capped at 100$ for now (source :

I have to say, he did the same for me too
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:30:48
I created this app you might like :  Naira volume is in there ;)
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:21:23
Yes I am aware and working on resolving those issues. Which browser were you using ?
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:23:20
So you are telling me that you can extrapolate ? :D

The ATH for India was last week, this week is not so strong.  
The volume is also quite low for such a big country (&lt;500 btc per week).  
I would look for Nigeria as the next big thing, see  , exponential increase and much bigger volumes.

Same name as Apache Spark ?

It should be everyone's concern as a bitcoin user to do as much as one can to make sure the UASF goes through. Also consider running a node with the UASF uacomment !
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:05:44
Except that this is a false argument. The energy spent is the security, not the hashrate in absolute value.
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:32:57
let's do this :D
@_date: 2017-04-11 19:48:46
Abra CEO shared this too 
@_date: 2017-04-23 10:09:35
Could we have the remaining ones make a statement on if they support segwit or not ?
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:02:11
please join this chanel to coordinate 
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:11:49
Can we please stop talking about BU ?
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:59:19
We would need the script to be adapted for that location then.

Don't fight germany, expand around it

There is no IOU, a lightning network channel is a bitcoin transaction waiting to be settled at any point in time by either party.
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:08:23
You seem really confused, you understand that throwing around random terms don't constitute an actual argument..  Maybe a good start would be to read the wikipedia page of those terms.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:36:16
Who cares about shitpay
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:48:51
Who owes what to who ?  
At any time, each party has full control of his part of the funds.
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:51:06
I think it can be done, we might need to repost this as a separate post for visibility
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:55:46
C'mon Mike you're better than this.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:56:15
I expect them to make withdrawal available. This would otherwise indeed not make much sense..
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:17:17
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:56:05
Indeed nothing new under the sun

A domain name, who resolve toward the current ip. I didn't test yet but I think this could be a way forward for changing ip addresses
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:06:22
Who cares ?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:45:46
Very cool !

Any idea where to purchase one in Europe for a reasonable price ?
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:17:05
Really great to have those rotating technical infos being pinned here :)
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:29:52
There is the raspberry pi guide also : 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:43:14
You can also point a web dsn to your (dynamic) ip and script it to be updated every times it changes. It would allow you to connect to your node from a light wallet  
edit : something like this : 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:35:22
Awesome !
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:14:41
There need to be some debt involved for it to be an IOU ( - I owe you)  You are not lending your fund to anyone or anything..
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:24:31
Those pinned posts are awesome. Great way to help technical infos being integrated!
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:02:00
No it's not
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:18:28
Get an Odroid HC-2 and validate it by yourself, it will take a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:06:50
Been following this project since quite a while. Very interesting indeed and one of the most promising projects out there !
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:17:17
Don't use bitpay, they overcharge network fees
@_date: 2016-10-08 12:20:14
You can actually aggregate the transactions on the fly before beeing included in a block If I understand correctly
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:50:07
It's actually 50,000 shares.
