I'm talking about other people. Us early adopters are definitely savy enough to not get charged by banks (usually). But most people in the world DO get charged a SHIT ton by banks from fees. And finance companys making payments is littered with fees. I know this because I worked for both a Bank and a Auto Finance company! They set monthly goals for collecting fees.

Did anyone read the article? Did everyone look at the pretty chart? Its fucking colorful. The chart is a load of fucking hypothetical arbitrarily created shit. Transaction byte sizes, real world transaction's per secound(TPS), you know the core fucking data which allows you to forecast for the future shit is all made up...
AS far as solutions because noone likes a debby downer, I am looking at the transaction byte sizes and wondering/researching why they are so big for each transaction
Heres a quote from the article so you don't have to read it


[the average Bitcoin transaction is about 250 bytes big according to google from 2014 sayeth some guy named Gavin Andresen:](

I think there is plenty of room for optimization with my first guess.
Google says:




So why don't we figure out why some transactions are bigger and make that happen less? Are we adding unnecessary features? Whats the deal?

I do like this idea! Smart contracts in general seem to not be utilized much from googling around a bit and they do offer a lot of potential with Bitcoin.

Yes, thats how a 75% upgrade works. If a miner does not want the new software they will not run it. If a miner does want the new software, they will run it and be READY for the change when its scheduled to be implemented, not AFTER. 
What if there were 3 sides pushing for changes? You require them all to download a certain software and run it before a certain time, not push a change and then force them to switch after. 
Change is either pushed or it isn't

Bitcoin can only be stopped if morons like this Coinbase CEO corrupt it and eventually break it by putting shitty solutions rather than working for PERFECT solutions. The world markets being what they are and how they are already reaching negative inflation means Bitcoin adoption for saving the value of your hard work is inevitable.

You mean the core team who are driving the innovation, improving the Bitcoin Protocol, and doing more for Bitcoin than your stupid negative shit spewing ass? And you got some stupid ass concerns? Well I got some concerns.
I believe this Coinbase guy is stupid. But people don't get into positions of power like that by being stupid. Thus I have a new conspiracy theory. This motherfucker is purposely trying to ensure Bitcoin can't scale by increasing the blocksize, so that people have to use Coinbase and send transactions Coinbase to Coinbase.
I am also concerned your stupid incompetent ass is the CEO of a company that makes users far too comfortable with not having the private keys to their funds. Your stupid ass is bound to fuck shit up with your inability to engineer a perfect solution. Bitcoin is a perfect solution, motherfucker.

For most DDoS attacks they will only continue if the attacker sees they are having an effect on services. Or else it quickly becomes apparent you are not doing much but showing how much you can hit them with, a chance for them to report on how they handled the attack.
In anycase... money fights DDoS very well.
Banks don't even flinch when they get DDoS'ed... they have datacenters in multiple states capable of handling huge bursts of traffic without a hitch. I am sure its the same for those company's with huge amounts of funding.

He is COMPLETELY WRONG. This coinbase CEO idiot guy is really starting to make me believe there is some massive conspiracy to take away development from competent motherfuckers at bitcoin core for god knows what reason. Anyone who has done independent research into what is going on can come to the same conclusion regarding the importance of maintaining decentralization with small blocks, and SEGWIT COMPRESSING TRANSACTIONS helps to do that.
And the Segwit work has already been fucking done for the NBitcoin Library, I am sure it is done elsewhere. Its amazingly easy to implement at this very fucking moment. Fucking Coinbase Idiot CEO get a fucking clue. The Bitcoin Core people are saints for somehow not pissing this guy off more with their "high IQ'S".

I have worked in both finance and a big bank environment. These executive type people are douchebag-awful-fucking leeches to society who absolutely love to steal money from people.

Bitcoin is truly an amazing innovation, and the disruption it creates can not be stopped.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:12:19
Yea unfortunately a lot of these concepts people need to have broken down.
This coinbase guy suggested an idea thats not a bad idea and could find use. Because hes the CEO of a big company, he has the power to see if it will find use. Hes talking about creating a fork of the bitcoin core, with this fork developed by a company (say coinbase).
Its not free to everyone, if you are a business and want to use it- you must pay coin base. If you are an individual it is free. 
It might be easier to understand if you look at it like the Microsoft approach for a lot of their products. Visual Studio - free for non enterprise use. It worked for Microsoft as a business to gain more market share, and consumers get good useful software out of the deal.

Banks once existed as a safe place to store money and to borrow money. And then they became consolidated and focused on generating profit, taking advantage of their customers. Now they have an amazing amount of power over peoples finances as eCommerce took off and debit/credit cards became widespread. 
With inflation and banks having the ability to freeze your funds or charge fees - especially fees on the un-banked and the under banked. The rich get richer, the poor get charged with fees and fucked in the ass by the financial system. Not to mention age limits and other limitations they place on people they choose.
Bitcoin liberates people like nothing else through the technological innovation it brings. You are your own bank.
Bitcoin is not easier to steal than cash. People don't travel with cash as much anymore, they have their debit cards etc and are not a target for thiefs. Banks solved that use-case, we have digital money, but as I mentioned they created a whole host of other problems.
The be your own bank aspect of Bitcoin and the global power it gives to consumers instead of middlemen is what I really feel is the ultimate reason bitcoin will make banks obsolete... Or at least limit their huge overreaching power a bit.

I agree 2MB blocks are no problem to implement. However- It doesn't solve the scaling problem in any significant way. The transactions per second is still insanely low. The only true way to scale to VISA level rather than Applepay level, is in the manner Blockstream is doing - with side chains. 
Rather than let the fucking bankers take the reigns of blockchain technology with private blockchains, which they can scale of course as it is just centralized bullshit, sidechains appears to me to be the way to compete and introduce true scalability to Bitcoin. If we don't scale - Bankers will win by default. Thus Blockstream is fighting the good fight for us vs the Banker scumbags, as we all agree we need a way to scale.
Also, If the blockchain investors find a way to make money out of open source software, good for them. 
But I think the only money Blockstream will be making is in providing services to people who have no idea how to implement it or take the time to learn how. Just like many, many, consulting companies in the modern world make money off their Linux knowledge.

If a serious attack is made on bitcoin the little guys would be wiped the fuck out, as seen with BitcoinXT and how it's nodes were attacked.
 But internet megoliths like Azure and amazon web services would love to report on how they smashed x,y,and z attack's with an army of Indian Security Gurkha Engineers Outsourced and Insourced H-1B's so that they get more customers. Its nice to have their infrastructure.

fantastic analogy.
Some might say its unfortunate for banks with their very large infrastructure, and the people who run the infrastructure and the jobs they created and the innovation they brought. All of that work that has got us to this point
I would say that Banks have proven they have become a plague on society. It would be dangerous for the status quo for banking to continue. It could lead to the next financial crisis or worse.
Banks in a world without Bitcoin... holy shit its scary to think how much control they have.
From diabolic plots with negative interests through the future cashless society, the mass loans and printing press of money, the unnecessary fees, the control over money - judgments fair or unfair can lock you away from any sense of control you might ever have.
I look forward to watching the Banks lose their control, slowly but surely.

Yep I can see a bit more how it is a very bleeding edge innovation - very cool.
 
I agree it does solve problems in allowing new people to offer their services, and would make international transactions much more possible than ever before. Probably not going to be used much soon, but it is just another theoretical greatness that awaits adoption.

I was going to ask, as I could think of none
What use cases does this have?


I mean this doesn't solve any real world problem that I can see. If a seller in the real world doesn't reveal or do whatever the buyer wants, he will have lost something called "trust" and noone will ever buy from him again. Sellers who consistently do sell, and sell well, get more business. Its self correcting... no problem is being solved, so why go through all the trouble to have a zero knowledge payment?
The only case I could think and its a stretch would be as a feature for those hacks like the one that targeted the LA hospital. A hacker could maybe add that as a feature.
But again even in THAT use case, the number one selling point for the hackers who do the crime is that their past hacks have TRUSTED them to fix the lock. Noone will pay up if hackers start not unlocking shit, it will kill their business.
If we can trust even hackers.. then why is this zero knowledge thing necessary?
