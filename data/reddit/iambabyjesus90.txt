I came here for this reason

Sorry for my comment. I thought u we’re making fun of a 10 year old.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:24:50
Daihard, get Eth then buy wbtc on Kyber exact same value as btc and has liquidity. Redeem the wbtc for btc if you want.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:19:36
Hahahaha. I have no idea what you’re talking about but I do love me some Eth. Yah barely any practical use.. MakerDao, Chainlink, Bat, Auger. Omg, Countless stable tokens and that’s not even including the tech that’s being developed on top of Eth. You are clearly very uneducated. Got lucky with the 100 btc clearly....if that’s even true.

Are you that dense? Completely different use cases and objectives.. If you aren’t paying attention to Defi you probably should.
@_date: 2019-07-18 04:18:49
You do realize it’s quicker than bitcoin right?  Not a maximalists in any way but this comment is idiotic
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:38:49
If you think Bitcoin will have every niche built on top of it I feel bad for you. It’s a snail and for good reason, it’s meant to be a store of value. It won’t change its tech for many of years. Mean while Ethereum’s ecosystem is developing constantly. Think whatever you want. You’re just saying you don’t like Ethereum or any other blockchain for that matter just because your bitcoin will trump all maximalist attitude with zero knowledge of what’s being built on top of Ethereum such as Defi, insurance, smart wallets. The list goes on with thousands of developers. Bitcoin has lightning, which they are all in on. Mimble Wimble won’t come for decades If ever at all.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:01:59
Hahahahah but it’ll pump! Won’t it?

Edit: they list “Bitebtc” too they are just as bad lol.
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:39:42
They only can track it to where you send it. Please send me proof of them selling it. I’m sure they do, it’s a bold statement if you don’t have proof to back it up though.
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:35:06
Are you seriously comparing one function of coinbase to Facebook? Last time I checked coinbase wasn’t free. You got free bitcoin for me? I’ll give you all my data if so.

I was being sarcastic lol. Londy IMO is a guys name. Either way you put it I wouldn’t want that name as a boy or girl. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:41:06

This is definitely false. Have you ever heard of CSGO? Well there’s billions of dollars worth of skins (digital clothing and guns) no one owns the rights to those items other than Steam (the platform) they have banned accounts for very small reasons such as bot use, hacks (I don’t agree with hackers)  but they have banned “hackers” that are just good at the game, s1mple is a pro player who has been VAC banned 3 times!!! from overwatch which is ran by the community and judged if the member believes he hacks or not. Long story short you can get banned for hacking without actually hacking. All of these things result in losing thousands of dollars worth of skins if you own some. With blockchain it would give you the rights to the skins you have potentially spent thousands on. Also if there was a smart contract to trade them outside of the platform for actual dollars without having to trust a 3rd party would be huge! Just one of many awesome use cases for blockchain and video games.

Yah and I just remembered you cant have 2 Siamese fighting fish or one will die.
@_date: 2019-04-18 01:57:06
Honestly anyone who invested in BchSV deserves this fate for following such a delusional con artist (they will learn a lesson that is more valuable than their holdings).. Why should his coin be on any exchange ? I think more projects need to be delisted as they are led by cons.

The golden cross is a candlestick pattern that is a bullish signal in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. ... As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes. This has only happened once before in crypto. The 2014-2015 bear market which had huge gains.
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:11:31
You realize they are both centralized right and also securities? Saying one is a lot more scalable is to say Eth is not scalable which far from correct.
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:38:44
Thank you sir! Much appreciated

@_date: 2019-04-08 23:40:59
Lmao how has it faded?? It corrected to 4800 then bounced back to 5000 and we have been steadily staying above 5200. Which happened at 4200 before breaking through. IMO the market hasn’t look this good in a long time!

I bought a bitcoin at 740 Canadian.  Saw it rise to over  1000 USD then Mt.Gox happened.. Ofc it nose dived, to 200 USD and for about 2 years did nothing. Then it started to go off again and it hit around 1000 USD again.. I decided I would sell out of .7 of it to buy CSGO skins hahaha (digital goods) this was early 2017. I had to watch bitcoin rise to 20k thinking what have I done!! I held this thing for years!! Don’t make the same mistake I did. Our previous ATH will be crushed just like every past one.

Im buying enough to sell a little as it goes up and saving the rest until BTC is spent instead of fiat

Lololol because trusting some random exchange with  10 btc is a good idea for 5000 dollars.
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:34:34
If you’re going to do this you’ll need to realize it could possibly drop. Expect it to drop to 1000-2000 but be happy when it doesn’t. People take out loans all the time for stupid shit they don’t need like a flashy car when all they need is a reliable one and others need to get over that. Just be aware of the risk. Don’t take out more than you can pay back though!!
@_date: 2019-04-17 06:42:36

Both Tron and EOS came from Ethereum. They were originally an ERC20 token. Every coin will need to scale including BTC. Quantum resistance is essential in the years to come or a select few will rob wallets left, right and centre.
I hold both Btc and Eth as I see both of them excelling.

Dude get those crypto off of the exchange NOW! Even if btc drops 50% tomorrow that’s better than losing 100% of it. Don’t be stupid.
Edit : take a stable coin if possible if not buy btc then put it on Binance or coinbase and transfer it into stable coins then withdraw it slowly over time due to withdrawal limits.

That’s sooo fucked! I actually got into an argument with an employee at the bank (RBC) the other day for not allowing crypto purchases. 
“There’s a reason we don’t allow it”  I “laughed” then she “if you couldn’t tell, it’s already dead” then I went on to explain that the inflated price does not matter and to look at the bottom price each year and that it’s 3X from 2017 and each year excluding a couple, it has steadily gone up! She never responded to me!! I wanted to continue to roast her ass but I decided I’ll go back to that bank in 5 years or how ever long it takes me to become wealthy enough to close my bank account for good with them and I will give her bitch ass one satoshi and tell her she shouldn’t be blinded by central banks.

I look at it more like, get out of shit stocks and into something that has greater potential. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:33:32
Don’t forget to add that Monero was a mistake and that he doesn’t think crypto is where it needs to be for the mass of people especially because they target the younger generation gamers.

Mostly BTC if you want to be the safest. I personally would split it with Ethereum with a few alts like MakerDao, Stellar, and a privacy coin. Monero or zcash.
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:03:42

I believe he’s in it for the long haul. His main goal is to ultimately have as much BTC as possible. He may try alts or do margin trading but at the end of the day he wants mainly BTC. Also he gives away a ledger S every Monday! He wants to promote keeping your own keys 
Edit: it’s just my personal preference to take a bit of profits around 9700 and hope for a dip to buy back some. I’m not 100% sure yet.

“There’s no way to know” ummm it’s pretty clear, we’ve known it for years.

Lolol. I miss pet rats. My wife won’t let me have one unless our future kids ask without my influence. Totally gunna influence them.

Who the fuck buys 6k btc in a bear market for Xmas gifts ?
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:08:00
The start of a bubble?
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:13:16
Why? I can’t stand how so many people are scared of being robbed. Don’t be stupid and keep it on hard wallet
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:35:09
Fuck, I want to go there rn!
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:07:36
I do love Bitcoin... Here’s an upvote
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:10:28
So the date is still December 31st 2021 even if we hit 100k before? Say we hit 100k at the end of 2020.
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:03:13
He’s got GREAT form!
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:49:40
Super stoked! Where do we find it?
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:02:04
Are funds able to be withdrawn ?  You could make a decent chunk if you sold into a stablecoin
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:14:41
Just because it did it in 2015 doesn’t mean it’ll happen. Also just because every YouTube TA say it’s going to happen doesn’t mean it’ll happen.
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:56:53
Should I buy a full btc or 32 eth for staking purposes ?
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:56:52
Fuck fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:28:27
Ewww etc?
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:08:40
You have to go sign up for TD bank I use to bank with RBC but they stopped all crypto purchases. TD bank is legendary.
@_date: 2018-12-22 06:48:14
Fuck, I want a gyro now.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:56:20
Haha thanks. Anyone’s point of view helps. I’ve learnt you have to keep an open mind :)
@_date: 2018-12-22 03:09:08
I wouldn’t mind winning btc! I would like to deposit fiat though 
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:05:33
Dude it was only 24hrs long... Noob.

If you do the opposite of CNBC you’ll be 95% right in crypto. I’m not even kidding. Someone did a report on it. This is a huge buy signal
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:47:21
Don’t forget to date it!!
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:42:50
You should leave a link in a comment. People like easy. Don’t want to lose a sale!

Slimy people do slimy things. You belong with Ver you animal.

Hmmm “physically” seems legit.

Hahahaha. He got what he deserved. Don’t short Bitcoin. Best lessons are learnt the hardest way.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:06:48
Where the fuck have you been? We’ve been stuck 7300-8200 mostly between 7900-8150.
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:31:58
I even upvoted the post so people could see your glorious comment 
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:37:45
Crypto Zombie called it. He’s called quite a few pumps and I’ve done well off of it
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:41:29
Does debt count ?
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:15:41
Fuck I’m having a hard enough time getting to full btc.  Jelllllly, I’ll take some satoshis
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:01:34
35% off lol that’s decent
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:28:50
By him telling you a rule. I can assume he has Bitcoin!!! Attack him! Get the 5 dollar wretches!
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:35:48
He makes his videos in the AM so I’ll have to see tomorrow. He even said he wouldn’t be surprised to see a big pump tonight. That was this morning after the small drop off from the previous day. It’s not like he’s trying to make predictions it’s just his thoughts from analyzing  the charts.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:40:55
Can I have her tampon?
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:37:14
Just like 1000-1500 Btc was suppose to happen? It never happens the exact way people think it will.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:54:59
Lmao how can you if no one knows where it is? You could torture him but you could also torture a rich person into wiring an off shore bank account. You sir are the one that lacks brain power.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:26:32
I think we already “understand bitcoin” like really if you don’t already you need to GTFO.
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:25:15
Seen* Thank god you own Btc.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:44:58
You’re an idiot. It was stagnant for the past couple weeks. And he called it on Sunday too.
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:25:17
Hahaha that’s awesome
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:05:30
It means the amount mined every 10 minutes will be cut in half. Thus supply and demand is dramatically affected. Driving up the price.
@_date: 2019-05-05 21:12:58
I’ve done the whole lottery crypto thing... Doesn’t pan out unless you sell while the hype is strong. This coming bull run could be different than the previous. I personally do think having a bit of a privacy coin is a good idea.  I personally own a handful of zcash. I like the fact it’s more regulation friendly.. As shitty as it is.. it’s important to the US
@_date: 2019-05-10 04:21:48
Feelin’ great.
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:52:50
Will I rise above my peers if I invest in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:50:08
You don’t think you could rob someone rich? Like wealth is wealth. Learn to protect yourself
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:34:49
Thanks! Highly appreciated
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:16:17
Bank wires to international counties aren’t a thing anymore? You can’t kidnap someone and force them into whatever you want? There are so many variables to robbing someone... BItcoin isn’t the first choice.  Jewellery, gold fuck there’s tons of things rich people hold that aren’t fiat or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:27:34
DCA more than the amount you’re currently. Buy a large amounts whenever it dips by 10%+ if it dips 5+% just buy a small amount.
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:21:24
Like you have never wasted money before ?
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:16:54
Why hasn’t anyone commented yet? I don’t want to read the whole thing! 
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:37:30
Idiotic statement
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:17:45
I’ll support it even though I don’t use eBay, I’ll be buying the crypto instantly back though
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:22:58
Split it between Btc and Eth. Outside of my mortgage. Everything is in crypto. I rather fail trying then to not have tried at all.  Actually I own quite a few nfl signatures including a Tom Brady signed proline helmet which is around 2000. And old school video games n64 and GameCube which i have a big collection.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:09:14
Do whatever you fucking want. Fuck this guy.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:58:16
You should have bought at 3200 when it halved then dollar cost averaged. I’d personally wait to see if we dip this weekend then jump on then
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:41:27
He’s been calling 100k bitcoin since 1 dollar. Who’s the crazy one, you or him?
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:31:02
Why do you think it’ll drop below 100?
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:07:53
So you’re saying you would buy btc instead ?
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:36:14
Thanks!
