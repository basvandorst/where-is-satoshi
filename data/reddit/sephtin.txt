 Primarily using the EEE method: Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.  They used their position in the OS market to destroy (our buy and destroy) pretty much any sense of competition in any/all areas of competition.  


NO.  To have said that, you either haven't used it enough, or you haven't used competing products.  
Credit where it's due, he's a genius, but spare me your opinion their crappy tablet (&amp; OS).

While the world would likely be a better place if no one ran Windows.. some people must run Windows... and it IS the most common OS.  
So, better approach than "Stop using windows!":
Start taking extra steps to remain secure, I recommend this regardless of whether you run Bitcoin software or not!  
--Keep your OS secure.  Make sure you're up to date on the latest patches/versions/updates of your OS, Anti-Virus, malware, firewall, etc.  
--Secure your browsing habits.  Ad-blocking software is a good idea.  The site you're browsing on might be fine, but if it has a malicious ad, you're still screwed.  Something like "No-Script" browser plugin can be a lot of work to keep you secure, but could save you from what you're going through now!  
--If you can't secure your browser, try using a more secure browser.  Hint:  Internet Exploder = terrible security.  You're much more likely to get something from IE than other browsers.  Chrome/Firefox should be ok, but for the ultra paranoid, there are browsers coming out in the very near future with security being the primary focus of development, such as aviator:  
  
  
Even if you've done all of the above, and you still were infected, then it's almost certainly self inflicted (downloaded and ran something you shouldn't have, bypassing scanner(s)).

There have been several incidents in the recent past.  
The most serious that comes to mind..., when Java components were out of date on OSX, with no updates, for months... while exploits for it existed in the wild.  This was a year or two back, though there are others...  Very few exploits exist for this long in the major Linux dists.

Seriously.  There are still apps that people use (and in a few cases actually do need) that can't be run on Linux...  yet.  
I've been on Deb., Ubuntu,  and/or LM for over ten years, and there are still reasons I keep a M$Win box around.  (A VM is great, but not practical for everything)...  
Yes, taking the time to learn Linux is a great recommendation, but it's not always an option.

Lot of new ASIC holders, and/or big ASIC farms cashing out here and there.  Once more ASICs are out, and the minted bitcoins are more spread out, I expect it will stabilize a bit. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 19:35:41
Sorry, can you explain that again?  
Tell me again how if you spent 10 for something and it only made 8 back... you can call it a gain, no matter the value of Bitcoin?  
  
  
Can we at least agree that no matter what the price of BTC is in USD.. that 10BTC will always be worth more than 8BTC?
@_date: 2013-09-05 00:42:17
No worries!   
My recommendation to anyone considering buying mining hardware, is to instead to buy bitcoin and hold.  
Especially after the recent drop!

Just displaying a QR code, or a cell phone (etc.) is probably sufficient for a small shop, but for someplace that might have additional requirements (receipts, etc.(?)), something that handles this separately would be much more lucrative to any brick &amp; mortar store.
Ideally, an account with the provider (bitpay, etc.), where they can see all of the transactions, possible per POS device/location for accounting, etc.  I can't think that something like this would be that difficult.. or am I mistaken?
I guess what I had in mind was a hardware solution, something more like this:
Or possibly (with some more polish):
*Edit: clarification
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:18:20
To aid adoption for brick and mortar stores... it would be amazing if a payment processor like Level-Up, Square, or Google Wallet would accept Bitcoin...
Edit: Also, would really like to see Dreamhost added to the list...
Also, might be helpful to list countries they do business in, maybe a new column? Some are going to be global, but there will be those that are specific to a country or state, etc.

If the cost of the hardware in BTC cannot be made... then it's a bad investment.     
Very few (if any) ASIC devices have any chance of making back their cost in BTC, so you'd be much better off holding bitcoin, than buying a miner right now. 
Bitcoin price has nothing to do with it.

Absolutely love this app, thanks for the update!  (Buying the ad-free version to help support continued development! )
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:07:07
Great story, but to which are you referring as the viper?  
--Payment processor who handles the money for the sale, but won't process a reversal?  
--Umphjunk who spends money on a known "Pre-order", where one of the seller's terms was that they will no longer offer refunds once they start shipping the product, but Umphjunk trying to reverse payment anyway?    
OH.... I get it now.. the viper is BFL!  Makes more sense now!

I keep hearing about people trying to bring attention to bitcoin by putting up scraps of paper with bitcoins (priv. keys that someone can import to receive bitcoins).
I thought it would be a good idea to put out a template, or app where someone could send some amount of bitcoin to the site, and it would split them up as per the user's requirements, and "generate" certificates/vouchers/coupons/whatever you want to call them, that could then be sent out via email, or printed out.
It should include a link/url to an intro site that explains bitcoin, and how to create a wallet and import the coins... etc. 
As an added advantage, the output could have an expiration, and if after 30 (or however many) days if the coins have not been claimed, the site could automatically return them...
My initial thought was to accept donations for it, but I suppose it's possible to accept a small fee.
Nothing that anyone is going to get rich from, but I don't know of another site like this.
The major issue I see with this, would be trust.  Users would have to accept that the site-owner would do what they say they're going to do (as in, not clain the bitcoins themselves, and to truthfully return the coins, etc.)...  
It would mostly be as a convenience for helping to increase interest to bitcoin... 
If anyone is ever interested in flushing this out, I'm happy to provide hosting and pick up the domains...
Edit:  Example of exactly the type of issue that this might solve:

If you still have access at all to the data from the old phone?  
If you do, and it's android, you're probably in luck...    
If you can get a titanium backup of GoogleAuthenticator on the old phone, you can just restore it to the new one.  
If no chance of backup, but you can still get at the data, there's a manual way described here (note: I've not tried it, but it should work):  
  
On an android device, having titanium backup configured to take weekly backups, and (if you pay for premium), having it store a copy "in the cloud", such as Google Drive, etc., suddenly becomes worth having.  
Good luck!

Bleh, Realized that listing a few for you would likely be outdated fairly quickly...
Here's a wiki resource that will hopefully be more helpful:
Some exchanges (similar to MTGOX) will take cash deposits, and you can buy bitcoins and x-fer them out to wherever you want for little to no fees.
I've seen a ton of "getting started" guides, and ended up taking the plunge with Bitme.com, deposited to chase, bought in at a good price, and have made a few purchases with BTC.

When taking the rise in difficulty into account, I don't believe they have ever had an ROI.  Interested in where you were getting your 180  day calculations... ?

Nah, only a few USB block erupters.

I would post a review to reseller ratings 
If anyone was scammed, I also recommend reporting to BBB (if they're US).  
Hit them where it counts of you can.  I always try to check out any new online store before I buy something from them... as everyone should.

With Papa John's, at least for every 125$ of pizza ordered you'll get a free large (25 points), right? 
I like to see projects like this get something for their effort... doesn't get much better than bitcoin and pizza!

All of the hardware they're selling, is being sold for more BTC than it is capable of earning back with the rise in difficulty.  Anyone who spent BTC (myself included) on AM hardware will never mine as much BTC as they spent for it.

I'm certain them shipping will halt your refund request.  
  
I only wonder what would happen if everyone put through a refund request at the same time...   
Perhaps they'd work nights/weekends to actually keep their latest promise (even though there appears to be no realistic way it could possibly happen):  
"The goal is still to get through ~April orders by the end of September."  --Source BFL Shoutbox, as reported on   twitter  
  
  
When I ordered in Jan., i was told by phone that my order would ship April, May at the latest.
