China exchanges have better liquidity and are the market makers. They also have futures, margin, and lower fees. For better or for worse that is how it is.

To everyone who talks shit about btc-e. They have had an impeccable tracks record. Have never stolen any coins, and run a great service. They have for years without issue. I'm sure this will get resolved within the day. I barely trade there any more (only do the few times I buy ltc) but have never had a single issue with the site in over two years of trading. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:07:20
How about the fact that you openly accepted deposits throughout the month of February, knowing that your site was going down and people were never going to get the money they deposited back. How about the blatant manipulation and assumed arbitrage you attempted to perform to make up for the fractional reserve you were running? You deserve to be in jail unless you have a legitimate excuse for this. Which I find incredibly hard to believe that you do. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 02:41:58

@_date: 2014-08-15 19:13:18
At this point it should be obvious that retailers accepting btc as payment does not make the price go up. Adoption by individuals and more people buying than selling makes it go up. 
Retailers dump their btc for fiat instantly so if anything this puts a negative pressure on the price.  If retailers horded the btc that would be one thing but very few do this.

This is the bear trend that we have been in since the all time high a year ago. As you can see thus far we have only bounced off the line (look in the high 600s from this summer). We touched it last night. If we break it, this signals the start of a bull market (up trend).
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:40:56
Yeah.  They also filled a order for me of LTC that they confirmed I cancelled three days after cancelling it.... You guys can probably see how well that went for me given current pricing. Fucking God awful exchange 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:40:34
All of this BTC-e bashing pisses me off. Seriously.
If you are going to use them, that is fine. Know the risks. It is the individuals responsibility to weigh out the pros and cons and make their own decision.
Remember when BTC used to be "anonymous". Some people still like that. This market is what BTC-e caters too. If you are going to use them regularly, then you should know the risks and not put more than you can afford to loose on their exchange.
FWIW I have used them hundreds of times for over a year with zero issues. However I never store funds on their exchange for more than a day or two. When I have funds on their I knowingly take the risk that they could all be gone in a heartbeat.

@_date: 2014-03-02 05:41:43
By sending it out of the exchange to your personal wallet (software wallet, paper wallet, whatever). You just click on withdraw bitcoin and paste your personal Waller address in and then the coins get sent there.. Where only you have control. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 10:42:15
I love how you get down voted on r/bitcoin for providing accurate stats 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:14:30
Agreed... people used Gox and Stamp for that reason... the (now apparently "false") sense of security that keeping coins on big name exchanges like these offered.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:50:21
No it doesnt. 115 was after it dropped to 65 and recovered. This has just dropped and dropped from the ATH and we have never had a even mild bull trend since bitstamp hit close to $1k in early january... ever since then it has been a big pump and then back to going down
@_date: 2014-06-04 01:10:40
From the USA coinbase would be the easiest. Stamp would be the cheapest.

@_date: 2014-03-19 01:53:05
Where is the outage? No one else seems to be experiencing it. As I stated I did several trades there within the last few hours and had zero issues. The few times BTC-e have gone down (I can remember a time in October they were ddosed pretty bad) they were back up within a few hours.
I dont see the community flipping a shit cause blockchain.info has been down the last day and a half. Everyone here points fingers at BTC-e when they have not done a single thing wrong ever.

Wow thanks for the tip looks like a great buy man! 
@_date: 2014-09-11 09:10:57
Yeah i mean in the USA it is by far the easiest ways to enter and exit the market. Nothing else at this point (unless you have a circle invite) even comes close. You are obviously sacrificing anonymity this way but for most people it doesn't matter

So can you buy BTC with this and then withdraw to a external wallet? Or is circle just for making payments for goods online? 
In the video it shows that you can send fiat back to your credit card but I did not see any option of withdrawing to a BTC address .
Also, how are they dealing with the potential of chargebacks on credit cards? 
@_date: 2014-01-15 01:48:34

Bro you are using a closed source samsung touchwiz rom and the google play store which I assume is linked to your personal email address. Not to mention, coinbase already knows everything about you, at least your bank account information. Im not saying its right or wrong, but if you are so privacy conscious, you wouldn't be using coinbase in the first place... you would use otc or local btc and you would have a open sourced phone.

Bitmex and Okex have tons of volume too fwiw. The big difference is in the pysically delivered coins. Having physically delivered coins versus cash gives a overlying bullish incentive to the price because even if you are short you get paid out in BTC not in USD... so if the price goes down you end up loosing money.

Coinbase pro......

Was wondering why more people hadn't posted this 
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:30:15
This is actually the least percentage wise that the bubble has deflated for those of us that have been here a while
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:25:04
Most people who bought at 15k had no idea what they were buying and just wanted to make a quick dollar 
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:18:28
Tons of people sold what are you talking about
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:42:25
Most people in here did. As did most people on crypto Twitter. So you didn't buy the top. Good for you. If you bought at $100 and didn't sell above 10k I can't imagine you are too happy with that. 
At the very minimum you could have tripled your BTC stash if you did

The prices are not accurate. First and foremost just to start 2013 opened at $13 or so
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:01:52
Man. Darkcoin. Such a better name than dash
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:57:10
Most of the people here have been here since December 2017 and don't know what any of these are
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:23:11
Sure. That is my perspective. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:37:46
I'm sure everyone here would be more than happy if these people decided to buy BTC to alleviate their bags. Let's not kid ourselves
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:43:39
Thanks bro!
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:27:28
Not totally accurate... 2014 was a pretty shitty year for btc 
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:46:48
This post is going to make the price go up. I can feel it

Insider trading in crypto. Lol. You guys want a free market and then when things dont go your way you preach the same regulations that traditional markets have which you claim to despise. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:55:13
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:23:57
How much are these guys bag holding my god 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:19:25
Free market. They can do whatever they want 
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:37:08
Disappointing. Just adds to the divide in the community. Please someone tell me one legitimate reason not to increase the block size by 1mb?
@_date: 2018-07-28 10:05:19
Bitcoin celebrates the free market. This is part of it.

Unless it was shown that the US government forced gox to keep deposits and trade open all of February, coded willy bot, crashed the market intentionally in April 2013 (and countless other goxxings), straight up lied about a transaction malleability flaw in btc, then in my mind he will never be innocent. What a fat p.o.s. criminal.. How he is not in jail currently is beyond me. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:34:57
Cyprus 1 was mt gox willy bot buying coins with fake usd...
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:55:55
Ha. Nothing like watching a 30k BTC order getting put up on bitstamp in real time
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:25:50
Cant believe that not a single person in this thread has said it yet. Just make a coinbase.com account and use them.
Yeah you can use electrum, paper wallets, hardware wallets etc which are all secure and such, but coinbase is more than enough for most people, and the company is not going to be shutting down or pulling a mt gox anytime soon. 
make a coinbase account, send your btc to them and forget about it. or you can easily cash it out to your bank account if you want. they also have a vault feature (which i myself am not too familiar with) which is supposed to be more secure than their standard wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:20:57
Just wanted to post here to tell you that you were wrong

Posts like this is what is wrong with crypto.

We unfortunately probably have a better chance of seeing this number before 1000
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:03:45
This is a pretty good sell signal if there ever was one
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:26:00
Guys Karpeles is not the good guy all of a sudden. Do you guys not forget how he kept deposits open all throughout February last year? Willy bot?
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:47:48
What does fe'ing stand for I've seen it used a hundred times over the last two days and have no idea what it stands for. Sorry noob

OKCoin doesn't work with USA banks. Stamp does IIRC
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:19:33
What about:
1) Mark Karpeles
2) Danny Brewster
3) Alex Green / Ryan Kennedy
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:02:34
50x long it on 796 or bitmex.

I have had an awful experience with circle. I signed up months ago and still they have not verified my bank account. I am unable to buy btc from them. I get some message saying it's taking time to verify. I have a standard BOA account. 
Meanwhile coinbase instant buy works great for me. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:40:54
So you don't know how to trade and you are getting pissed off at people who are better at trading than you.

His price Target was 15k for 2018. Even in November. Guy is dumb as bricks
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:27:26
I am pretty sure he sent all of his profits to gox and didnt make a dime. Not joking. He bet that the exchange was solvent and lost everything if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:52:26
I'll give you a hug man. It's cool

If you use the Bitcoin liquid price index on trading view you can see the entire price history of BTC not just bitstamp.

We are still going down further until all of these lambo people sell the bottom

No. They won't

I sold 2 btc a week ago and it is still pending. I bought 2 btc this weekend (instant purchase I am level 2) and while I got the btc my bank hasn't been charged yet..... A little scared about what is gonna happen.  If this doesn't get resolved I am done using them forever.
