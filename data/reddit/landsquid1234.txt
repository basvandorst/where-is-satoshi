That’s convincing.

Then cycle restarts. Tell them all bubble is death so they stay away when opportunity actually arises.

*shrug* Stay in the dark. 
What’s that saying? 
You can lead a horse to water but you can’t force it to drink? 
Have you ever looked into it? How it works? Or did you just watch a YouTube click bait on how it doesn’t work and blindly trust it?

Yes, those silly lines. That’s a falling wedge. On that time frame it would indeed signify a downward trend.

Okay, we agree TA has its place. Yes, very good. Have up-doot sir. 
You’re right in that sense. Reddit meme line TA is rampant. I see your reasoning for judging it so harshly.

Hopefully this mentality of buy rumor/sell news gets stomped into the ground. Like yeah it’s great, profit wise but it’s just kinda off putting. As if no one cares. I mean I participate in it. I have to but I would not mind at all if sentiment changed.

There is no risk. They’ve just locked out foreign withdrawals. You know. So people can’t sit and literally double their money back and fourth. That exchange is for Zimbabwe. Go to their site and read the support threads it’s hilarious. People actually sent their crypto into that exchange without checking for a proper fiat withdrawal and now their asking support to help them get it to their accounts. 
The only way your pulling this off is if you know someone in Zimbabwe, your from Zimbabwe and now live here, or your a well connected banker.
