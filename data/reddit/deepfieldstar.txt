Maybe it’s just me but I’m more relaxed @ 6k than I was @ 10k. 
I’m playing with house money at this point but all in all I kinda like this insanity. Really don’t give a fuck. Let it drop to $4000 I’ll buy another few coins. Dump for all I care. Still bullish as fuck.

So because it hasn’t gone under 6k yet that means it won’t? 
I don’t think you know how this works. 
People at 10k said they would never see 7k again.... and yet.....
Oh and I don’t spread FUD. I’m just realistic. A return to 5800 or lower is very possible after a quadruple bottom

You’re talking about a different subject. 
I’m not saying that paying $5000 for 0.363637BTC is the most attractive way to list Bitcoin to somebody (5k for a fraction of something can sound ugly) 
I’m saying that the math of an investment which matters is the percentage returned. If I buy 0.001 of something that goes up 300% in 2 years I’ve done much better than somebody who bought 200 of something that gained them 40%. 
Percentage matters. Nothing else. But these trolls who try to spread fud cant even grasp basic math and it’s fucking hilarious. 
And my snarky attitude only came in response to the above poster claiming I lost money. He brought up my investments. Not me. Go read the posts. 
I’m sorry, but if you’re going to claim somebody you don’t know has lost money - don’t get salty when they hit you with some reality. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:35:02
It seems you lack fundamental investment knowledge.
Price per BTC is irrelevant. Percentage is all that matters in terms of ANY investment. 
Also $200 to $18,000 wasn’t instant. It took years. And as always, price per BTC is irrelevant; percentage returned on your investment is all that matters. 
Go back to school before you try to sound like you know what you’re talking about lol.

Did you even read the article?
"In most cases of civil asset forfeiture, individuals voluntarily give up funds confiscated by local police because the structure of the policy has made it intentionally difficult for the defendants to win against prosecutors in court. Moreover, being taken to court, which requires lawyer fees, to prove that the funds are not connected to criminal activities often cost more than the confiscated funds, rendering the entire process of challenging the decision of local police pointless."
Even if that money was legal, the system is rigged against the defendant. This is robbery. Fuck anybody who thinks this is ok. "LAND OF THE FREE" lol
This is the same bullshit that goes on in the legal system where innocent people are squeezed into taking a plea because they know that they cannot realistically afford to fight the case in court and prove their innocence. You think that's okay? You're only innocent if you have the money to prove it? If not you're guilty?
Please. Don't get me started.

There are many savings accounts that will pay out between 1.5 - 2% a year. The caveat is that they're sort of like term deposits where you're paid 0.7% monthly and then if you don't touch your cash for a 365 day period you're paid the remaining % in one lump sum at the end of the term.

Haven’t lost a dime. Bought in 2014 and sold 80% of my stack in early December - and have been daytrading it all the way down since then. Who’s lost money here? 
Also price is calculated and listed by unit - but percentages lost or gained are what matter in terms of an investment. You really need to learn the basics here it blows my mind that some people can not grasp this. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:08:52
Watch Alessio Rastani’s videos where he explains how a market can generally withstand a triple bottom (which we’ve had but not a quadruple bottom. 
Maybe BTC is different but his predictions have been spot on so far. If this hits 6k expect to see 4K levels soon after.

It's barely adopted as it is - and the price is $7000USD per coin. 
Bitcoin can't "die". The price can rise and fall but the tech cannot die or be erased or stopped - this alone gives it immense value.

@_date: 2018-08-07 18:59:02
I'm not worried because I understand this tech. I've been around since 2013 and have heard and seen it all.
Bitcoin can never become a failed ICO because it is not an ICO. I think you should do some research and try to understand the fundamental differences between an ICO and a decentralized technology.  
I just SAID in my previous post that is wasn't widely adopted yet. Nobody said it was. And that's a totally different issue. 
Your problem is you don't understand what makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from scams like Bitconnect and ICOs that never took off. 
Bitcoin could be worth $0.50 tomorrow and by definition is still hasn't failed and is only stronger than it ever was. Hell, it could be worth NOTHING and the tech would still have far reaching value. Price is not indicative of a failure in the tech. If you want to discuss price and markets I'm happy to do so, but that's a whole other topic. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:42:08
I know it’s hard for you to grasp - but percentage returned or lost is what counts in an investment - not price per unit. 
Like I said - go to school or learn about this on your own accord. But if you’re this lost you have no business giving anybody advice on anything financial.

You said a lot of words and kind of went on a tangent near the end but nothing there negates what I said lol.
You’re talking about the marketing aspect of it. The lustre of how an expensive coin SOUNDS. Then you go on to touch on the ability of a deflationary market to be manipulated.... both which WERENT the topic!
I’m (and was) talking about math. A $20,000 bitcoin might sound more enticing - but again that’s NOT the topic I was discussing with op. I was discussing how the price is irrelevant in terms of an investment - only percentage returned or lost is. 
Plus Bitcoin is VERY divisible. We may call it A hundred million Satoshis instead of 1BTC at some point. 
You’re over complicating a very simple fact in an attempt to disprove me and failing at it. 
Also - you must be quite new to this. Because I’m 2014 when BTC touched over $1000 the exact same sentiment was present where people thought the price was LUDICROUS and would never touch 1k again after falling 80%. 
In 5 years if (but most likely when) BTC touches $100,000+ - then crashes back to $20,000 people will say the saaaaaame thing as they have for years now. Failed project. It’s dead. Bla bla bla. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:44:09
The fact that you think somebody should have to prove they've legally obtained cash they're carrying and if they can't they're assumed guilty on the spot with no due process and have their money stolen - is one of the reasons I love crypto. 
You could theoretically carry millions of dollars around in nothing but a brainwallet that's untouchable by anybody but you regardless of the circumstances.

They may not be able to ban bitcoin but they can make it ruinously difficult to turn that Bitcoin into actual money. I don't believe this will happen, but I'm just saying the way it would be "banned" would be less an attack on the protocol itself and more a flat out assault on any institution that acts as an offramp - which is very much in their scope of power if they really wanted to do so. 
But I don't believe that will happen ever. Just playing devils advocate here.
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:04:26


It's also gone from $0 to $300 - back down to $100. Not a good look there either, Bitcoin is dead!
It's also gone from $1200 back down to $200 - an even worse look! Bitcoin is surely dead this time!
Now it's gone from $20,000 back down to $3500 - another terrible look! This HAS to be the end!!!
All these corrections - and yet it rises to new highs every time. You cannot prove a future event that hasn't taken place - but if you were using history as any indication, the odds are looking very very very good for Bitcoin.


Well you're wrong and that's fine if you choose to reside in your ignorance. As I said, if you don't believe in crypto then it's not worth one penny now or ever to you and you shouldn't spend a dime on any of it. 
But if you understand it then the question of what gives the BTC network value has already been answered countless times. 


Just like FIAT currencies. Paper has no intrinsic value either. Bitcoin is actually rare. Paper bills aren't. Your understanding of money seems to be corrupt as well.

Name calling makes you weak. Don't do that this isn't 4th grade. 
Burden of proof applies to something that can be proven or disproven - not something that may or may not happen. Bitcoin has the potential to reach higher values because of how scarce, trusted, immutable and resistant to attack the network is. 
It's the ONLY cryptocurrency that has a track record of all these with no hiccups. If you believe in crypto at all then the value is obvious. I never stated it would ever reach $1 million, but to think that it can't is silly seeing as how it's already gone from $0 to $20,000
The Pog and Beanie Baby analogy is weak and flawed because these are toys that have no intrinsic value. Bitcoin is immutable decentralized math that is the very core of what a cryptocurrency needs to be. 
If you don't believe in crypto, then you shouldn't pay one penny for any of it. But if you do understand it, then this is a foregone conclusion.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:46:19
You're right in essence, but the chance of it being 2k in a month is about 1000x higher than $8000 in a month. 
We might not see $8000 for another couple of years, realistically. 
edit: you can downvote all you like. I'm unbothered. I've been a perma bull since 2014 and still am - but if you think that this is going to spring up to 8k in a month after blowing through 6k, 5k and flirting with breaking below 4k support levels - all within 24 hours - then you're either very new here or haven't been paying attention. 
The sentiment is destroyed. It will take a good 2-3 years to revisit the ATH with very positive sentiment and lots of retail money. We have neither right now and are trending downwards with a vengeance. Do the math. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:46:47
Except that you are. 
You said nobody would pay $1 million for 1 BTC. But if the market price of BTC were to reach $1 million then that's exactly what people are buying that much Bitcoin for. 
You're caught in a logical fallacy. Let me help you out. What you mean to say is: "I don't think Bitcoin will ever trade for that much money"
Now you can support this statement with something relevant that backs it up or you can recoil with just another bearish opinion backed up by nothing. What's it going to be?
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:49:17


That's what you said. 
Why won't it reach $1 million?
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:36:14
Says who?
People used to say nobody would pay $10 for 1 BTC. 
Then they said Nobody would pay $1000 for 1 BTC.
Then people were paying $20,000 for 1 BTC
The challenge of Bitcoin isn't from going to 20k to 100k or 500k or whatever arbitrary price you pick out of thin air - the challenge was from going to worthless to being worth anything at all. 
You're fixating on $1 million because this is a lot of money to you, but when you take the emotion and spectacle out of it, it's no more special an amount than $5000 or $10,000. 
It's hard for people like you with little to zero market experience to understand but there's really nothing special about whatever number you choose to focus on. 
You don't think it will ever reach that amount? Cool. But you really have no grounds to argue it other than your opinion which is one of many and not particularly relevant here. 
edit: For context I'll explain this in terms of gold. 
You can buy a 12 Kg bar of gold for roughly $500,000.
But WHO IS GOING TO PAY $500,000 for ONE lump of gold?!?!?! The answer - very few people. But many people are willing to pay for 1kg bars, and 10 oz. bars, and 1 oz. bars..... those sell just fine. Why?
Now assume 1 BTC is equivalent to a 12Kg. bar of gold. Yes with high market prices fewer and fewer people are buying lumps that large - but since Bitcoin is divisible like gold (even more so and easier) the market price is irrelevant in terms of lump sums. 
You're getting caught up on the whole unit of 1 BTC. Look it it from the perspective of mBtc, satoshis etc. And it's not very hard to imagine at all.

That's not the point.
This is about who their main target market and customer base is, not if there are exceptions to the rule here and there.
I didn't say people with money HAVE to spend it - just that the people who buy Rolls Royce's fall into the category of those who aren't generally concerned about saving a measly $20k. That's what a target market is - it's a blanket demographic of who is most likely to be purchasing a certain product. 
Go visit a Rolls Royce dealership and ask them about who their purchasers are - and see if the majority of these people are concerned about saving a few bucks.
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:36:15

Never made any statement to that effect. 
Simply telling you that the majority of Rolls Royce owners are not the type of person you claim to know. It's strange to drive a Rolls if you're the type of person who doesn't like attention. 
The typical Rolls Royce customer has 5 homes on average, net worth in the mid 8-figure range and around 10 other luxury vehicles. 
Could they shop at WalMart? Yeah sure. Is this what the average WalMart customer demographic looks like? Not even close.
If your friend exists, they are the exception. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:41:15
Theres a level of wealth - generally that of Rolls Royce owners and the like - where the thought of "saving $20k" isn't even something on their radar. These people don't have to worry about staying rich. It's a level of wealth that's hard to grasp.
If you can afford to purchase and spec out a brand new phantom - options that can run you $200,000+ in addition to the $400k cost of the car - you're not going to turn around and try to save a few grand on tires. That is not the demographic that generally purchases a Rolls Royce. It's not impossible, just highly improbable.
The ultra wealthy who live the type of sensible/frugal life you're talking about drive a Toyota Camry or a Cadillac and stay low key.

I can promise you from first had experience that a good chunk of Rolls Royce owners do not buy their clothes at WalMart. If you know one that does - they’re the exception to the majority. Trust me.

I do see your point and normally I’d agree with you if we were talking about an S-class or a 5/7 series BMW - but a Rolls has a much different target market. People with Rolls Royce money generally are not looking to purchase second hand cars. A big part of purchasing a Rolls Royce is the midboggling amount of bespoke options available. You want that car built for you. If you have the money to buy a Phantom chances are very high that you belong to the class of people with true fuck-off money. 
Yeah sure I guess you can have money and buy one second hand but to me that’s cutting out a big chunk of the experience. 
It’s like people who finance expensive watches. The point of an expensive watch is to reward yourself for earning it - not to go into debt just so people might think you’re rich.

That's all good. 
Nothing wrong with saving money. But the target market of a Rolls Royce owner is not that of a penny pinching bargain hunting consumer. It just isn't. 
I think some of you are out of touch with just how much wealth is out there and how truly disposable money is to some people. 
Also the wealthy who like to live low key frugal lives - as there definitely are some - would not be purchasing a Rolls Royce in the first place because it's the polar opposite of low key or frugal.

You underestimate how powerful the ego is. 
He could be worth tripple - it will still sting when his dinosaur words ring hollow in his dinosaur ears. It’s the same as those who scoffed at email and the internet. How credible and relevant are they now?

Don’t think it’s possible from the particular wallet I used

Anyone else having extreme difficulties getting transactions confirmed?

This is mildly irritating....

My fee was about 9 cents for a 192 byte tx. Wallet chose for me. It’s been 15 hours and still 0 confirmations. How fucked am I?
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:45:02
How long before the tx is rejected by the mempool and returned to my wallet?
