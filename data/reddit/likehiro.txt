I was thinking in buying some hardware to start mining some altoins but I was not sure if I must do because of the problems here in Argentina importing anything from other countries, here is when CEX.io has not limits for us :) I'll definitely start using it instead of trying to find overvalued hardware in my country because at this moment it seems to be the better option.

Hi! I'm the graphic designer who did this brochure and the reason to use that style of design is to catch the interest of the the gastronomic workers using a graphic scheme similar to a classical menu. You have to think that if you are a hairdresser (for example) and a customer gives you a brochure with a technological design (nothing related with your work), your normal reaction will be to throw the brochure to the trash or just ignore it, BUT if a customer gives you something with a fashion style according to a hairdressing magazine, it will be a lot more effective and if the content of the brochure is not interesting for you, at least the design will catch your eye and you will choose to open it and take a look. I hope to be clear, my English is not the best haha.

It's okay, I'll PM you explaining the image if you could not get it, don't worry!
(Seriously, why are you hating? It's some humor, original, not stolen, and with some work behind it... if you don't like it I don't get the point in calling shitty bitcoin-related drawings; you are not paying for it, I'm not sure why you are sandy without any reason)
