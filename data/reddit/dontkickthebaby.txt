You need private key for it. If you don't have that, seed (12 words) could do. If you don't have that, then you need wallet.dat file in which your bitcoin are at (but is probably password protected you set many many years ago). If you have address, you can check your balance here:

Waiting for the dip like...
Seriously, I sold it at 3800 and now I'm nervous. I would love the dip to 3300. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:22:50
Yes, and the price is pumping hard. It will reaching $1000 soon. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:19:00
This bitcoin is torturing me man. I spent whole day looking at the charts. I took a nice profit and I'm happy to buy back in when it corrects. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:02:11
So, I can send out BTC now? I'm not sure what's the situation cause they didn't mine a single block. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:53:03
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:20:28
I dare you to go to r/btc and post "You are all sons of BCHs". Do it man!
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:24:55
Nice 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:14:55
Yup, I agree. BTC dropped $400 already. This will trigger huge panick selling. I converted to LTC already :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:15:46
Oh, nice! Thank you :D 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:39:57
Maybe he's one of those guys who short, then tell everyone in the world so he can maybe, just maybe help the price fall and he profits. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:45:01
Hahahaha crash he says 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:29:57
Hahaha, what a happy coincidence. I also went to shower because I didn't think it will trigger selling, and missed a few extra bucks. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:32:26
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:39:03
Perfect haha 10/10
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:10:46
Fucking finally!
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:01:15
So much dumping. The hell?!
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:15:04
You mean support. You also have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:50:27
It's not just with ETH, it's with every alt. It's because of BTCALT pairs. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:07:18
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:18:30
Me too, but not too high. I care only for this bitcoin, and wouldn't like it to lose value because some other fakes exist. 
Haha thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:00:31
Yup. I was waiting for this comment to say this is my intention too. Free BTC if you ask me (if we assume BCC will be worth anything)
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:14:51
Oh take a chill pill and relax 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:08:59
If you're gonna wait more you're gonna be more than 4 dollars off. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:26:13
Do you know how to use google? Do you see there are 20 same threads about same thing every day? It's been explained at least 1 milion times. 
Oh man I can't wait for August 1st to pass so there will be no questions about August 1st ever again. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:38:08
Those are only payment addresses. If I sell something on the spot I can just show this. There is no private keys in there.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:04:34
He probably shorted and is now panicking the price isn't going down. I've seen people making youtube videos trying to manipulate price so they can fulfill their trade positions
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:35:11
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:36:41
"...the price seems stable.." lolz
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:32:38
I have the same problems. I would like to dump BCH asap, but don't know where as I don't have accounts on any exchanges that support BTC/BCH. If you find a way tell me/us here. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:33:11
I know about this metal ones: 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:16:10
But we're still at 2800... I expected $3970 at least
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:17:41
It's dropping...what
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:49:04
Ahem - ShapeShift isn't charging any fees and provides lock-in trades so market volatility can't modify your trade in process. So, we have a clear winner. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:50:39
What will happen when it locks in?
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:37:43
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:00:11
2 more blocks in next 17
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:18:33
Use any wallet that allows you control over seed/private keys. Electrum for bitcoin is fine for that. 
Look at this for details: 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:15:14
But seriously, did you know BIP91 locked in?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:12:20
Nobody is sleeping tonight. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:01:18
Oh, I only have Proton wallet
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:33:03
You know you control your keys if your wallet can show them. In electrum you can export private keys anytime and they can be generated offline so you know you are the only one who have it in possession. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:15:31
I closed PornHub for this man
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:38:49
Me too, but that was a mistake I think?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:47:44
That's why I closed it!
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:27:35
I just find out about a new site called CoinSwitch.co. If you are writing articles, maybe you could cover this one too :)
