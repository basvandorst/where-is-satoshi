so bitcoin will recover in 2021?
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:12:00
july is historically low for bitcoin btw
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:17:24
btw, there are ways to get 10x without bitcoin tho. Hexx did a x10, GPU did a x10, AU (a complete scamcoin btw) did an x10, and a couple of others as well, why not check out some coins with hidden potential compared to solely relying on bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:29:32
under 6k watch that bitcoin fly!
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:37:36
i'm fairly young and not in poverty tho, even though I held some crypto through the crash that's dropped ~90%
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:07:32
ssshhhhhhhh don't give them hope! i'm still filling mah altcoin bags D:
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:25:09
good morning guys :). I just woke up to BTC being 5.8k wow
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:52:21
ye, an ETF is an Exchange-traded fund, it's an investment tool. I mean it seems like it could be good on paper, but i just dunno lol
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:31:58
wow, never knew that thanks for the response haha
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:33:44
the sad part is, the bitcoin i sold at 8k+ can easily buy back in with lol

nty, rather just keep w/e i dont need in a "safe" coin and not tell the government what amount i cash out and dodge taxes instead
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:58:47
if it's any consolation, people sold their homes to buy bitcoin at 20k, so if you have food to eat and shelter, then you should be happy!
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:13:55
nah, never could invest that much since that's insane risk
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:44:55
Rule  : Never invest more than you can afford to lose
Rule  : Never hate yourself for taking profits

2 girls 1 cup is too scatological and it's not hot enough for anyone who likes porn, I recommend something else in the pornoleech category. Pornohub accepts other crypto now too.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:12:51
there's not enough people in bitcoin subreddit using anime, bitcoin or anime-bitcoin avatars. we need more of these to entice the bulls to come to us.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:05:22
nope, if it isn't 3D H-Anime by Mantis-X, it's not good enough. Mantis-X animations beats out bitcoin by 120% ;)

need moons not hopium plz
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:14:30
i do, my neighbors are f**cking crazy lol. When a neighbor lets their dog off the leash chasing children trying to bite them and animal control shoots the dog in the head and the guy goes insane and threatens everyone in the neighborhood, then you know something's wrong
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:07:27
nooo, it's not available anymore, can you post a screenie?
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:09:21
Go bulls! we can do iitttttt!! get that bart! get itttttttt!!
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:52:14
if the 1day chart pattern holds, we might see 5.5k in the upcoming months, blah
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:18:29
it's still 6.1k tho instead of 8k-20k
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:49:45
yep, rather dodge taxes instead of paying them haha
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:35:32
well this is going to correct something fierce lol
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:33:34
Check the one day chart guys, if the "long" red turns to a long-green soon, that should signal a clear reversal, not TA but you can observe the pattern happening everytime futures are near / during certain periods
the length of each massive movement seems to be about 2 weeks roughly since the fall from near 10k "reversal"
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:35:27
No. I'm too lazy to vote :(.
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:43:11
i dunno really...ETFs might be toxic for bitcoin. Remember last year when everyone was yelling that futures was going to make bitcoin sore to 100k+? What sounds like a good idea isn't always a good idea
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:10:35
wat's a "fauxmosexual"?
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:14:01
if it hits 500 again, ill stock up even more than before and ill get on my knees and worship you as a god.

nope, im an anime lover and (was) a crypto trader. Been too busy with life drama to trade so I just hold my coins for the most part now. I use an anime avatar because I love anime, hence the name "animetrader"...i'm an otaku too ;)
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:01:19
i have too many altcoins, but I also hold bitcoin so...um, yeah lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:28:30
lol if you find the number, ask them why isn't bitcoin mooning yet and tell them that bitcoin needs to focus less on becoming a stock and work towards being a medium for the common man
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:47:36
@_date: 2018-07-04 23:27:19
