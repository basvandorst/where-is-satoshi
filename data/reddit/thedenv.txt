This meme was probably Brexit dependant.

IKR? Even though BTC at this time of year ALWAYS goes down...people are still surprised. Even told everyone I know not to buy bitcoin until mid November to early December, This was 6 weeks ago.

It's like the "Eve-Online is dead" meme.

Get brass plates and hammer your seed code onto it. Bury it in your garden...then do the same for your 25 passphrase only bury it so where else in your back garden (parents garden). If you forget your code/s, you will not be a happy chap.

Make that chest EMP proof. Various Youtube tutorials on it, basically layered with aluminium and mesh with a smaller wooden box inside that (like a Russian doll). Help protect the electronics.

Yeah I've always thought it was Christmas.

One time (the wildest time), once...out of ten years did that happen. I only said I told my friends basically to wait because out of ten December's only once did it go that high and if you look at every single other year and compare the overall price, mid November to early December is almost always the best time to buy btc.

You are speaking of December 17th 2017? That's in the 3rd week of December. I said early December, as in the start...Not 3rd week.

I too yesterday, got my first BitCoin and opened up an account first with Coinbase, then I opened up an account with Binance (I am in the UK). I got 0.0029 BTC (£200). Coinbase charged me over £7 for buying the bitcoin. What I want to do is day trade with no fees, is this possible? I also downloaded Electrum. I am really stuck as what to do now lol. I play a game called Eve-Online and the Day Trading seems to be very like the economic markets on Eve, I am good in that game; trying to see if I can do it in real life. Any advice? If I trade on Coinbase I will lose all my money due to fees because I didnt buy a billion dollars worth of btc.

Sounds like your "news" company is bought and paid for by someone who dislikes cryptocurrency.

Why do you run your own node and why did you download the blockchain? I thought all you need to do is transfer it to a hardware wallet and thats it?

This a great comment. Hold onto that coin. Personally I just got into the game two weeks ago. Oddly enough I bought 0.025 an hour before it increased (as we just seen), perfect timing for me (and for you). I don't own a full bitcoin, I own around 0.05. Before I invest any more money I have learned that I need to purchase a hardware wallet and to be extra safe, brass or steel plates with my password and keys hammered into them (house fire backup).
I am refusing to sell, I am only buying. In the future I might sell a little to get back my original investment, it all depends. Also, never reply to anyone on reddit chat or DMs. I made a few comments in here last week and four people tried to contact me, just decline the conversation; they are scammers. Also, don't listen to the negative people, assume they are either stupid or have an agenda. Crypto is the future of the human race as we move into an age of robots, A.I. and space exploration.

Love you guys!

Wow thank you very much for explaining it to me and giving me reading material on it. I'm still quite new to all this and this information is very welcoming. Thanks again!

Hmm..almost like test subjects to certain medication and its side effects.
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:45:28
Yeah I worked in a doctors clinic around 2005 and we had what was called a "Benzo Review", which was basically created to get people off Benzodiazepine based medication. Doctors where given a number to cut and if they didnt meet that number, they didnt get the funds they wanted the following year.

Even if you uninstall Twitter, its still there collecting all your stuff. Same for Facebook apps. Yeah I stopped looking at BTC price every 5 mins now, I was fearing I would miss that one special day where it goes up for 12 hours and back down again; looking to short so I could buy more BTC when it goes low again. I wont be selling bitcoin, I wont be looking everyday...but if December 2017 happens again and I miss it...REEEEEEE!

Naw bro, we are all in pain from something and the honest ones amongst us just dont give a flying fuck anymore. ccwthrowaway11, I got your back on this one man...headaches, backaches, toothaches and muscle pain every day and the doctors tell me "go and buy paracetamol or ibrufen, even though its obvious Im in pain from a back injury I had 20 years ago, never prescribed anything stronger than paracetamol, now they want me to buy it even though its meant to be free in the UK. Doctors are no more, they dont care or know...that is why I smoke weed.
