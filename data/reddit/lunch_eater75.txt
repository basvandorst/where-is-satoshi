Maybe it has something to do with experts like Draper making claims of it hitting $5k+ regularly every year since 2014 and it not coming even close to reality.
And here we have the belief that a single big name investor can never be wrong or make outrageous claims.
So individuals like Draper are 100% correct all the time right? Many of these same individuals that bet on the housing bubble not bursting or proclaiming bitcoin dead not to long ago. 
Since Draper is never wrong Theranos, a company he continues to back strongly hasn't crashed from a worth of $9 billion to only $800 million. While suffering a variety of sanctions, regulatory issues and lawsuits. Theranos has laid off hundreds of employees and sold off its headquarters in Palo Alto. And recently  failed a second major inspection at its only active lab.
Or how about when 50 "experts" predicted what it would be trading for in 2015? Most estimated anywhere from $2000-10,000. What did it *actually* trade for? $200-500. 1/10th what the experts predicted. 
So no
ITT: amateurs doubting the likelihood of a single prediction from an "expert" after watching the exports be dead wrong 95% of the time over the past 3 years. 
Obviously we should just blindly accept their expertise and ignore the numerous incorrect predictions and history. 
I want bitcoin to succeed as much as you (all of us here do) but I'm not going to blindly swallow predictions simply because it came from Tim Draper, especially after years and years of such predictions being wrong over and over.

I also remember predictions in 2014 about how it would be at $2,500-10,000 within a year or so. 
No one has been able to predict it with any reasonable accuracy thus far.

again you are completely missing the point. you are acting as if the only possible worth an apple has is monetary. You are wrong. If an apple was "worth" $0.00 it still is food, it is still a source of calories. That is still value, it still has worth. You need to realize at my times there is value outside of a basic monetary amount.
If there was an infinite amount of apple available to everyone yes they would be worth  $0.00...but they would still be food.
In the end this comic does a shit job by comparing apples to bitcoin, it makes no sense to compare the 2.

that was anything but trite or patronizing. It was a very middle of the road objective answer with reasonable rationale. I don't partic7larly believe it but that doesn't make it patronizing.

That is TERRIBLE rationale. 
1. Just because people dislike it doesn't make it not the best option. I've yet to meet anyone happy about taxes, but that isn't a valid reason to abolish them. There are thousands of examples where people dislike something yet it is still the best/most prudent option. 
2. People constantly get mad over stuff only to realize later that their anger was misplaced or simply wrong. 
3. People also get worked up over things they have little to no understanding of. Have you not seen the last 2 years? People freaking out over things that have been twisted or a blatantly untrue.
Protesting makes some people mad...so no protesting then? What about gay marriage? Plenty are mad about that. Since if it makes people mad it shouldn't be done in a democracy.
There are plenty of real rationale reasons you could use but "if it makes people mad it should not be done" is not one of them.

Actually yes. A college student back in 2013 did something similar and ended up with ~23 bitcoin totaling over $24,000 at the time.
