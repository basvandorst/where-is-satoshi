Correct, you win the therapy trophy of the day.
Stay more hydrated.
"At this revelation, he realized the therapist wouldn't be able to help him. The drinking had gotten bad since his wife passed, and was only getting worse. He would continue to put that bottle to his lips and pull the trigger. He would slowly drink her memory away. He would try to drink the water to ease the pain."

where i live in texas, a lot of vendors and stores have these little machines they run 20 dollar bills through. so i guess the last few months there has been an influx of counterfeit 20's. its a pain in the dick to sit there while the cashier runs all your cash for a purchase through that damn machine but i get it. id do it too.
people will come in and buy a stick of gum, just to pass em. most people just say they dont have change for large bills, not print a sign, but good for them, lets the perps know they are aware, and maybe other business' too.

i wonder how the guy feels that bought my bitcoin for 18k. i wonder if hes held it this long or if he jumped ship long ago.
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:05:55
ahh makes my heart melt. i was part of the 250 to 18k club. sold it all and have never looked back. 
seeing it at 6 again brings back memories of fucking fomo yolo freaking out hodling while everyone was going crazy.
