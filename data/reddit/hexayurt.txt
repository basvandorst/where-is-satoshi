Wow, thank you very much indeed Tirapon. And thanks for the spur to start using changetip - it's really cool.
If you want the whole hexayurt thing in a nutshell, watch the "One Network, One World" video on the home page. That's pretty much the best starting point on the big picture stuff. If you're more interested in the build details, appropedia.org/hexayurt
Thanks again!

I'm the guy in the video - I'll be around to answer questions if anybody has any.
slides are at callfist.com/talk_draft.pdf if you want them

I'm the bloke interviewed. Would you care to expand your point a little?
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:26:05
Hi guys, I'm the chap in the video - let me know if you have questions / requests for clarification.
@_date: 2015-07-28 09:44:44
Hi guys! I'm Scottish, but I did live in Ireland for a year in 2011.
I'm glad you're liking the documentary it's one of my favorite things. Tomer did great work!

It's clear, right now, that the government hasn't brought out the big guns against bitcoin. Or, for that matter, against WikiLeaks etc.
I'm not sure why that is.
* Assange's insurance file?
* Nobody cares because WL etc. are irrelevant?
* Other, harder to guess reasons?
I don't know.

Hi guys, post questions and I'll do a sweep this evening around 11pm London time to answer them. If you want to understand more about my perspective, try 
 or the London Real interview on  
See you later.

As I understand it, bitcoin uses common crypto algorithms as recommended by NIST.
NIST is politically suspect due to over-involvement of the NSA in the standards process:
 at the light end, and
 at the dark end.
What can you trust?
How do you know that you can trust it?
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:56:58
Maybe against WL, but **Snowden** is The Return of the Jedi. Overwhelming global mass mobilization of fear, uncertainty and doubt - nobody with their head up trusts their computer any more, and the pervasive mistrust of governments is at an All Time High. I think in the long run Snowden marks the end of an era - when the doctors, lawyers and accountants realize they have no meaningful professional privilege to protect them from surveillance (as in, say, doctor-patient privilege) I think we're going to see a whole new side of political activism, never mind a lot of second tier countries who've almost certainly moved real intelligence work to **paper**.

Nice theory. Any evidence it works that way in practice? Even historical / from other cultures? Is it that way?

The kind of person that spent 14 years as a formal student of Hinduism, and was deep in teacher training when 9/11 changed the path of his life towards more mundane affairs.
Next question.

This sounds like experimental testing of a moral calculus: utilitarianism on steroids?
Not saying it's a bad idea, but there are Implications in the age of Big Data

Unless you're Indian, you don't really get an opinion about how I use the term. Period. It's from my language and my culture, and your opinion is irrelevant on this matter.

== it is obvious that Jesus, the Holy Spirit and God the Father are One.
I understand you are defining things. I am not sure those definitions are accurate, no matter how obvious they seem to you. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:40:50
That's a good argument. I don't know what would happen in that scenario - life would get, at the very least, *complicated* - think Snowden levels of complicated for (say) core developers.
It's a good scenario to think through, that's for sure.
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:17:58
This dude is right here. What do you mean by "workable analysis" - one that confirms what you already believe to be true?
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:47:20
At the time I did that interview, I did not know that Proof of Stake existed - I'd riffed my way to governing bitcoin with a "one coin one vote" approach for anything that required popular buy-in (i.e. protocol updates.) 
But this is before I'd even heard of ethereum!
I'm not sure that Wall Street believes that bailouts are its only profitable business model. Do you have a link that might convince me?

See also Glenn Greenwald sitting on the vast majority of the Snowden material - and yet, look at what's been leaked too.
My guess is that they're being permitted to leak stuff that is common knowledge among foreign intelligence services, but under pain of death/jail/etc. if they leak material the Chinese don't already have, or something like that.
But I can't really make sense of it, that's a very weak hypothesis.

hahahahah I believe everybody should live at 1.0 planets of consumption, or less.
cardboard hut optional: you design your own lifestyle.
what's your alternative?
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:25:50
Sorry, running late, will be on in about an hour. 
Bitcoin expo talk I did last year might also be of interest  on bitcoin's ability to adapt (or not) to a changing world. 
Back later 
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:34:51
I think Snowden's fairly clearly a product of the WikiLeaks story, no?
@_date: 2015-02-09 10:51:46
I've heard explanations of Stalinism that were at least that convincing. I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're asking for a near-religious leap of faith.

Discovery. We are constantly learning in many areas, and ethics is one of them. I do not believe any currently discovered ethical system is without flaw - we must continue to experiment and learn.
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:44:23
This *entirely* depends on how property is defined. For example, here's a though experiment which would (if you follow the property rights are human rights doctrine to the end of the road) simply legitimize taxation as the State's right to rent land to you on its own terms.
Likewise, there's valid debate about limited liability, copyright, patent etc. as Libertarian-compatible forms of property (say some) or utterly unacceptable government subsidies (say others.) 
I'm agnostic about these issues, for the most part - interesting thought experiments, but until people are having these discussion with some reasonable chance of implementing their ideas, it's all a bit lame.
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:01:26
Gandhi's approach is simple: it's all experiment. So we lump ethics alongside engineering, and use approaches like repeatable experiment.
The other approach is to start with an axiom like "all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration—that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves" and then we try to work out from there.
I think the rules of inference turn out to be culturally determined, however, so even if we all agree on the axioms (which we don't) how to proceed from them then diverges wildly. I think we're better off with a somewhat more trial-and-error based approach, generally speaking.

Don't be an idiot. Gupta believes no such thing.
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:38:49
 the thread that started that particular conversation: somebody throws shit at a technical idea of mine, and I respond with reasoned explanations of why it's a reasonable idea.
The get butthurt. It happens.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:35:35
Hm. I could define those words differently: I'd also be making no claims about reality that need to be verified. 
How does that help either of us?
