The first five paragraphs is amazing foreplay, given the piece only has two points:
* "Will the person receiving digital currency in a rural village in the Philippines be able to use it?"
Yes, many of the developing world's rich -- the Philippines included -- wish to immigrate, travel or hide their wealth, and enjoy the international  and holding nature of bitcoin. These are the very same people facing hefty transaction/conversion fees from Western Union.
They provide a ready Cash-&gt;Bitcoin demand to allow exchanges in these kinds of places to cashout Bitcoin remittances.
(This is low quality FUD, I expect better from Western Union's CEO)
* Furthermore, the transfer of funds is an emotional transaction... if there is significant consumer adoption of digital currencies, I think it is likely to occur first in the developed world as a business payments vehicle.
This would be funny if it the present state of affairs weren't so ludicrous. The nature of the existing money transfer business is to exact higher fees the poorer the country you are sending money to. Remittance fees with Western Union can go as high as 20-30%; the emotion felt by someone having to pay those fees is obvious to everyone but Western Union.
If I had stock in WU -- and read interviews with their CEO like this, showing their unwillingness to innovate when faced with the very real threat of Bitcoin based competition -- I would get it out. Fast.

* Upper class Filipinos are rarely using Western Union for one. They have bank accounts and are capable of making the standard bank wires etc.
Given around 3 quarters of the Philippines is unbanked; that taxation in this economy runs as high as 35%, that bank secrecy laws facilitating international transfers have changed -- yes, the era of secret Swiss bank accounts is coming to an end:  -- AND that Snowden revealed all international SWIFT money transfers are now being regulated/recorded ...
The key question here should no longer be IF rich immigrating/travelling/wealth-hiding Filipinos have bank accounts, but  WHY they would prefer them when they (together with their counterparts throughout the developing world) enjoy easy access to Bitcoin in global remittances at their local exchange.
* Its the lower class, the ones that have sent family out to other cities/countries to earn money to send back, that are using Western Union.
Unfortunately for Western Union, this is the same population most attracted to the much lower fees of Bitcoin based exchanges. These are cash strapped individuals who will be forced away from Western Union's high fees / high convenience model.

False analogy: Tesla motors' cars are a product, bitcoin is a currency service. Also, volume requirements don't hold because bitcoin can be divided into smaller units. Finally, wealth distribution varies even in traditional currencies like gold and dollars.
The correct comparison for valuation of bitcoin vs. traditional dollars is akin to valuation of Tesla motors' cars vs. traditional motor vehicles: innovation is not required to have to be perfect to be welcomed investments; value is created so long as the new product/service is superior to existing competitors' or targets a larger market.

I'm just wondering what Bitcoin will be worth on April 16.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:08:27
Careful, this is a real threat and should not be dismissed so quickly.
Remember, a currency's intrinsic worth (if not coupled to an asset like gold) is what its ecosystem supports. Can you imagine dollars being worth anything if no one accepted it?
A stronger ecosystem inspires trust in a currency, and threatens the US dollar. Directly because merchants will accept it together with US dollars and thereby diminish the need to convert bitcoin-&gt;usd, and indirectly because the US dollar retains its stability only so long as other countries tag their exchange rates to it. Imagine the consequences if the dollar's power to control international trade balances diminish.
This is similar to China's yuan becoming the world standard, which could very well happen if China based the value of the yuan on its domestic economy and subsequently allowed it to appreciate. In fact, that's already happening. In the longterm, both are bigger threats to the dollar's value than exorbitant market prices for bitcoin (and cannot be controlled simply by requiring euro&lt;-&gt;btc).
Simplified explanation available at 
@_date: 2014-03-29 09:50:21


* If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.
How does Mt. Gox provide an exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied?
* Probably by declaring a holiday at 23:59 and 'trading' bitcoin at $0 on tax day. 
* Or claiming it lost all its coins. Later, at 00:01 AFTER tax day: Coins found!

Does knowing banks have mismanaged previous trust enable meaningful regulation given that the same banks are too big too fail? No.
Does a person owning a trillion bitcoins have great incentives to maintain bitcoin's value, in order to increase her purchasing power? Yes.
How does this person increase it's purchasing power? Because bitcoin has a limited supply (again, unlike centralized banks which could dole trillions upon trillions) purchasing power is increased by encouraging the growth of startups and bitcoin's underlying infrastructure, and also subjecting this same infrasture/startups to global competitiveness standards.

On a  serious note, probably nothing much -- there are lots of other ways to transmit information other than through QR codes. Bluetooth, NFC and Adhoc Wifi hotspots are commonplace and there is no reason not to use them to transmit trivially short text messages like Bitcoin addresses; in fact this ban could even be a good thing by creating real pressure for innovative android developers to evolve existing wallet technology away from single points of failure like QR codes.
I think smartphones should make use of the fact that they are mobile computers, and not mere credit cards. Bitcoin wallets should be able to search for nearby merchants, cameralessly request addresses, then send/provide proof of payment without QR codes in the vicinity of any store.
Bitcoin is a disruptive technology, it has proven difficult to block and resistant to disabling legislation. This will continue as long as it remains decentralized and open-source.

@_date: 2014-03-24 15:19:20
You think I'm being sarcastic? I was trying to be sincere. Aha.
Bitcoin offers a solution to two big problems in finance. 
Remember, there is nothing preventing a ruthless central bank from minting trillions to preserve its wealth even while devaluing the savings of everyone else. This would be impossible if the world ran on Bitcoin.
Also someone with a trillion in bitcoin would have it in her interest to preserve its value in the interest of maintaining her own wealth because exchanges are volatile and market capitalization is weak. Anyone with a trillion in fiat currency would have enormous incentive to convert it into real assets and thereby devalue it quickly. This alone makes bitcoin superior as a store of value when trusting said someone with trillions. In Zimbabwe, where central banks were entrusted with this power, a $5 coffee goes for 100 trillion. Go figure.
In the same theme, the lack of bailouts in the bitcoin economy ensures competition and innovation. In the fiat banking world, the incentive isn't to improve service for customers, but to merge existing inefficient banks into something 'too big to fail', reap profits off hidden/hedged leveraged bets then receive bailouts when things go south.
So no, I don't see anything amiss in entrusting its creator, and those who supported it since the get go, from being entrusted with the largest shares in it.

How was the current number set to 40 bytes, was it the result of careful consideration or was it something arbitrary like the default transaction fee? If it is arbitrary, I disagree with them both: it should be 42 bytes. If bitcoin won't do this, dogecoin will.     
Would restricting hashsizes to 40 bytes increase the ease of finding collisions, and forging third party messages?
Assuming the network runs at current maximum specification of 10txns/second, 6000 transactions per block, one block every 10 minutes, adding the 40 additional bytes will cost the blockchain 12GB/year. 
Any links to how they balanced the trade-offs behind this decision welcome. If you post it, I'll read it and attach the summary here.

* Unfortunately, lots of people sign lots of keys for lots of other reasons. This makes identity verification beyond 1 trusted person unwise.

Banks are as poorly regulated as before. For the record, the only regulatory change after the bailout was a requirement for banks to have a 'sales and break-up of assets plan' for when they collapse again; what this means is that other banks will buy them up when the fail, and in so doing will themselves grow towards coveted 'too big to fail' status.
The US Dollar is more popular than gold because the government confiscated gold, made its export illegal, then decoupled the dollar from it at gunpoint. This was a great idea for foreign trade, unfortunately China has accumulated enough treasury notes to threaten us with the devalued currency version of bankruptcy. This is dangerous.
Assets like gold will always be better longterm bets than fiat currency,  that the fact that those holding it are hoarding it is what creates much of its value is a feature, not a bug.

Great video, looks like Bitcoin is future ready. Although it needs BitPay/Coinbase to become integral within network, or something like litecoin for smaller transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:36:52
This cannot happen with bitcoin, the network is designed to be DDoS-resistant. It does this by processing higher transaction fee transactions first.
Although it is very likely that micropayments would be priced out of the priority queue (by design, due to the 1MB blocks, the bitcoin network can only handle ~10 transactions each second at max). This would create demand for a separate micropayment handler (something like Coinbase that aggregates transactions off the blockchain and commits them only when they reach significant value; or onto a complement cryptocurrency like Litecoin) that would likely get rich in the process.
Currency issues aside, his first claim that insolvent banks lead to fire sales in bonds and equity is a lie. When bailouts become imminent, real assets rise in value. Also, the future is likely to rely on crowdsourced funding instead of institutional investment if, as with today's economy, &gt;70% of it are small or medium enterprises. Consequently, bailout situations less likely and the failure of centralized institutions will be less costly even when they occur.

Well value, as a concept, is separate from the technologies invented to appraise it: such as money and markets.
Ideal money would be scarce, fungible, uniform, transportable, having a high value-to-weight ratio, being easily identifiable, being highly durable, and having a supply that is relatively steady and predictable.
Bitcoin, like gold, derives its main value as a money technology because it has these properties that make it useful as an alternative non-fiat currency. For example, Gold only used to be worth &lt;$35/ounce back when it wasn't used to hoard wealth (intrinsically, gold isn't worth much)... ie: before the USD decoupled itself from gold to go for a wild devaluation ride. Today Gold is worth &gt;$1000/ounce.
Though non-fiat currencies value does bounce around, gold for one has gone &gt;$2000/ounce in the last 5 years. Like gold, its value is intrinsically backed by three things: its usefulness, recognition and scarcity.

if the NSA did invent bitcoin then they have half a trillion worth of it at current market rates. Which is enough to flood the exchanges. Which means they would be able to completely devalue your wallet without stealing any keys.

Nothing is stopping existing fiat systems from printing trillion dollar notes then awarding it to themselves.
Developing world example: 
And if you think it is different, here at home:
Same goes with Litecoin: there is nothing stopping someone with billions in Bitcoin from converting it to billions in Litecoin (except for the fact that litecoin isn't worth much).
Attacks on Bitcoin wealth inequality stem are attempts to prop up systems which are, at best, no better and even often much worse.

“My silence is for a very valid and personal reason, all the rumors that are flying about are false and couldn’t be further from the truth.

Bitcoin is alive and well, the technology is impossible to regulate except at endpoints such as exchanges. These will become better regulated and more mainstream as time passes worldwide.
The conversion rate is a red herring, the only reason it tracks Bitcoin adoption thus far is because many of those hoarding it on the supply side are currently convinced to hold it long-term. But Bitcoin as a technology will grow even if everyone dumped it tomorrow because it would still be possible to convert dollars to it and back again via the exchange and coinbase in order to make purchases.
The only way to kill bitcoin would be to go after payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase. That would end the party very quickly.

I find your FUD's quality disturbing.
If this is a technical piece on trust paths, everyone should know the web of trust works by checking if someone you trust trusts someone else who trusts someone else... who trusts the owner of Multibit/Electrum's signing key. If you haven't marked anyone as trusted, then the trust path is 0 because there is no path of trust to the signing key. This does not mean there is a security breach, this means OP does not understand web of trust.
But if this is a false-flag operation to obtain personal background information of bitcoin client developers for further targeting, OP is doing a pretty good job.
* EDIT: WOT only verifies identity when everyone in the trust path are not malicious agents, and only sign keys whose authors are verified responsibly.
* Unfortunately, lots of people sign lots of keys for lots of other reasons. This makes identity verification beyond 1 trusted person unwise (**eg: God-&gt;Your Lawyer-&gt; His Fixer-&gt;Savvy Hooker, You-&gt;Your Lawyer does not mean you can trust the hooker even though the hooker is linked along God's WOT**) . Also, people frequently sign keys before themselves conducting extensive background checks 'hi we're both at the same conference! lets sign each others' keys!', and only later regret doing so (eg: God-&gt;Satan or, alternatively, the hooker turns out to be a Mossad agent). **This means you cannot use WOT for identity verification over an extended trust path, as OP suggests.**

* No they don't. Most people in the Philippines have never even heard of bitcoin.
See 
* Expect better... what precisely? 
There is no reason why Western Union cannot offer both simplicity and lower rates by running on Bitcoin's infrastructure. Riding on Bitcoin's infrastructure would be implemented practically and quickly, the problem is that Western Union's CEO is giving plenty of startup exchanges a head-start by failing to recognize / fully exploit this. He is putting his company, and his shareholders, in a future where Western Union has lost its established first-mover position in the money transfer business and has no choice other than to play catch-up with the start-ups.
* If you are one of the Philippine's unbanked, turning to bitcoin may be a viable option in the future. Right now, that isn't the case. You cannot live on $1 USD per day and put it into a market where 50% of its value can vaporize overnight. If and when that happens, you'd literally starve to death.
The poor in the Philippines receiving remittances will cash it out through Bitcoin exchanges. These same exchanges are driven by the Cash-&gt;Bitcoin demand of wealthy Filipinos who can better tolerate volatility vs the threat (at worse) of confiscation and (at best) 35% taxation.
Did you even read my post? Western Union's CEO didn't look like he had it together in the interview, and if you were a shrill for Western Union I'd also expect better quality FUD from you, too.

Because I like you, I'll paste the takeaway here -- only because you're you:
"ComScore, the global leader in internet analytics, has announced MetroDeal as the most popular online retail website in the Philippines (source: Media Metrix 2012). MetroDeal features more than 300 deals every day."
* and your conclusion is that therefore, most Americans use bitcoin. Which is wrong.
First, this article is a reference to your post
* Most people in the Philippines have never even heard of bitcoin.
Changing this statement to 'most Americans use bitcoin' is a good red-herring, but claiming this was my conclusion is very lousy false-flagging. You need to work on that.

(1) Regarding your Save-the-Environment strawman argument
In hardware terms, Bitcoin is amenable to ASIC components that are far more energy efficient than scrypt based processors (virtually all other competing cryptocurrencies rely on scrypt technology).
Litecoin/Dogecoin/Auroracoin would be more wasteful than bitcoin if they were popular enough to be hashing at the same rates (transacting in the same volume).
On the software side, Bitcoin's carbon footprint is not hard-coded, it depends on network-difficulty that is higher than the alternative currencies only because it is more popular than its competitors.
This just in: Paper money requires electricity AND cutting down trees. 
(2) Bitcoins vs. Altcoins in terms of intrinsic value as a currency &lt;--- scarce supply not vulnerable to double-spending
Essentially, altcoins are copies off of bitcoin's codebase with a smaller userbase and lower liquidity. The most popular altcoin, Litecoin, doesn't add significant intrinsic value because the risk of double-spending in small ticket transactions is too negligible to require confirmation-at-point-of-sale; while transaction fees on the order of 10c guarantee essentially immediate priority for big-ticket items &lt;400M in value. (The present amount of money you'd have to spend on hardware capable of 'cheating the system' and double-spending. This value is much lower for what are therefore less reliable altcoins).
(3) Why the hate?
VISA/MasterCard survive on high fee, high processing time, low merchant protection business models.
Plus: Bitcoin as a currency threatens virtually every commercial bank, because they are restricted by governments from accepting and dealing in anything other than dollars.
