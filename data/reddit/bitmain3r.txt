such a confusing way to try and explain something so simple. 
then i love how they end with “That said, PlanB’s analysis could be totally erroneous.”

true but there is already a question on your tax return that you have to answer whether or not you have any foreign bank accounts fbar. which is typically flagged if you have reported any interest income. if you dont disclose a foreign bank account they can get you for the same thing they got paul manafort for.
the questions formulation sounds similar from my interpretation.

if their LLC has no history of buying and holding realestate as revenue generating business the banks or lenders will make them personally liable for the note/loan. 
holding real estate in an LLC is beneficial for tax purposes. should limit their tax liability. but you also have to be careful with that as well bc the IRS has specifics about that. for example if your a passive owner that uses a management company to deal with the tenants and use a real estate agent to find tenants there is a threshold of the expenses you can expense on your tax return. More specifically you might have to have a real estate licenses to not be considered a passive owner. is that something OP is willing to invest their time in?

Some of his existing machines are people who work in “government”. So some type of bribery I guess. 
But im certain there is no electrical cost. 
If this works out over the next few months Im hoping to be able to invest more as new higher performing machines should soon be available. But the premium price for the machines hurts...

you dont know anything about inheritance taxes if you believe his cost basis is zero...
up to 11.4m usd and his basis starts at market value the day homeboy died or he received the coin. 
first no gain has be actualized to have any tax liability since he hasnt sold any. second if this happened two weeks ago when btc was trading at $9,500+ he has a considerable loss to write off.
lets say he sold 125 btc today and home slice died on the 24th. at the time of death market value was $9,500 - $8,125 today. which is a $1,375 loss per coin times 125 coins. $171,875 loss.
lets say btc ends at $10,000 per coin at the end of the year. and our newly acquired btc holder blew threw the sold btc already. and he needed some more cash to live his new lavish lifestyle he could sell roughly 17 more btc for $170,000 and pay no taxes for the year...

if one filed that doesnt make them compliant. you fail to address “may” have improperly filed which MAY result in a criminal investigation. meaning if YOU or anyone MAY have made a “mistake” when filing, the IRS will most definitely make you PAY. once you file you or anyone has opened oneself up to be put on this list as the IRS has already admitted to have putting people who have filed on this list. the IRS are telling the public that they reviewing the returns for accuracy because it it a new tax preference item. the regulations are still coming into legislation. this is why even if you do report, you or anyone subject yourself to potential audits (as they have admitted) due to the uncertainty of the entire domain. my belief is that these dubious companies you claim to be the hand������������of the IRS are not reporting transactions and are actively being  put on list. im not going to name names on where one should and shouldn’t make transactions, thats not the point of this conversation. its like when your a child in grammar school and the teacher or your parents tell you if you admit the truth nothing will happen, but in actuality if you are not a rat, no one will never know the difference of your naughty little deed. the MAIN fact is the IRS has already acknowledged they are looking into all 10,000+ filed returns regarding crypto. thus by reporting you are subjecting oneself to their scrutiny. it is much more cost effective for the IRS to go after the people on this list then some imaginary task force that hunts down crypto bandits that you seem to be suggesting. I also guess my title wouldnt make the top 1,000 wildest speculations on this sub. and  to address your claim of why would the IRS spend time and resources on people who file? They do it everyday. why would people who file and report crypto income be exempt? its much easier...

did you read the last paragraph? if you didnt report anything they didnt include you in their new  list of 10,000 people who possibly filed incorrectly and are potentially not compliant and are open to criminal investigations per the IRS verbiage that i pulled from their own website. Those people are now on some list which may or may not lead to some “random” audits. what I am leading to is the IRS has  “projects” from time to time. i believe in 2016 their project was looking into s-corps to make sure the shareholders or officers were getting paid “fair wages” as most people use them as pass throughs anyways and dont take any wages. but thats a different story. for what ever its worth I heard earlier this year that their next project was gonna be crypto. so based off my title if the IRS is having a crypto project my guess is those 10,000 or so people is where they are going to start (i would). take what ever i am trying to say with a grain of salt. i dont think they are rounding up crypto investors or doing so in anyway fast, its the “government” which others have noted the IRS is a non govt entity, but no one in any of these agencies moves in any kind of expedited fashion. Im not giving any advise but I wouldn’t report any gains...

im sorry but how the fuck does a real estate agent help with IRS reporting?
@_date: 2019-12-07 14:49:27
i am not lost. maybe just confused that inthought i was talking to a competent person.
first if you choose a reputable title company and pay them to insure that a property’s title is free and clear, that is exactly what you are paying them for. so in the event you purchased a property that had encumbrances they will be liable for any loses to the buyer. that is exactly what they insure and have insurance for. 
i dont know of any title insurance scamming companies but if you do by all means feel free to use them.
there are so many reasons to use escrow company when purchasing a house and it makes a lot of sense. what doesnt make sense is me continuing to attempt to explain to you any further why bc you seam to dense to comprehend. 
“just give the money to the seller” thats a great idea! and if doesnt work “for some reason, then you dont get the property” 
but guess what since you gave the money to the seller they can disappear with that money you gave them since you were too cheap to pay title and escrow a few hundo to insure that from happening.
it isn’t complicated at all, its simple just like you.
@_date: 2019-12-07 17:30:09

im not sure how it works in AZ but in CA you would want to use a title company to confirm and insure the sale. especially if you are the buyer. its a marginal cost. id also want an escrow co.
not interested. just saying.

@_date: 2019-12-06 16:05:36
but the benefit of using a title company is an iq 80 who doesnt care makes a mistake the purchase is insured. so for even a 250k property paying a few hundred dollars to insure against fraud id say is worth it. dont be penny wise dollar foolish.
