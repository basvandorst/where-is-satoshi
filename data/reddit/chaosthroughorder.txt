Free, or cheap? Can you name a bunch of them?
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:04:42
Not true. "Free" is another word for PoW instead of fee. Attacking the network will cost a lot still.

Try and use the network and you'll see what I mean. It took me like 24hours to get my transaction through.

The tangle is a mess.

It sounds nothing like a scamcoin, I suggest you read the whitepaper. Instant transactions, zero fees, scalable to thousands of tps, block lattice technology. This is the cutting edge of cryptocurrency evolution, and if you aren't taking part in this you're missing out.

That's not even close to accurate.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:20:32
Probably amazingly.

I don't think we need to kiss-ass, if the miners aren't going to behave like respectable humans then Bitcoin will change consensus algorithms and destroy their investments. They only hold power in the short-term.

No, I'm saying be respectable, put the well being of the network and the technology above your own greed. There's no such thing as "right", that's subjective.

It's clearly not organic growth, whatever it is. Whether it's an attack or not is another question, but it's likely.

The community is already divided, that is the problem. Wake up.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:31:55
That's more like Decred than it is Bitcoin.
