True. Could also crash hard just as quickly. I do hope it really carries on its path though.

Nope... Cant withdraw from gbp wallet to bank. US users can. Not uk.
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:51:04
Nope. Coinmama i think. I have coinbase now though. Not used it but set it up for when I want to sell. What would you use to buy?

Ok good sir. You win. I like thid post now, have an upvote! I genuibely just thought it was 100% appraising the price. But a bit of that mixed with the others. Sounds good to me! Im clearly not witty, sarcastic or smart enough to understand 90% of redditors, posts and why they're successful.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:19:33
Would you advise buying using that too (if it can) or buying elsewhere and transferring?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:44:41
Why is this post successful when its not as high as it was nearly a week ago? So its up for the day but down over multiple days... does this play just reward an increase no matter the relation to how it was not that long ago?

Is there a recommended combination of where to buy and store your first bitcoins? Something easy enough for anyone to do but cheap enough in fees that if the price keeps going up that we wont lose too much profit to buying/selling and transfer fees.

Thanks for some great gebuine responses. This is what I hoped for but actually expected maybe more fanboys of bitcoin to dismiss me straight away.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:59:43
Have to pay to set it up. Doesnt say anything about the money being returned.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:55:01
I'm in the UK :/
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:08:23
So for a noob like me saying fiat and kraken means nothing. Explanation?
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:20:54
Didnt know guessing id have to transfer the currencies
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:55:36
Same man. Hurts.

Like me at mr $4300 -_- Levelled out the second I bought out basically. Was looking into it when it was $1000 last year as well and it seemed like too much hassle. God damn my luck. I'll hold. Couple months and I'll get my money back. I'm confident. (Taking into account I need it to raise nearly 20% to get my money back because of fees) I only bought £52 worth but cost me Just over £60. Also I dont even know how to sell bitcoin yet. I'm hoping theres not fees on that too.

Uk users cant withdraw using debit cards... This is my problem. Coinbase is terrible wish i knew before hand. So now im looking for an alternate solution.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:49:55
It seems to have stopped its sky rocketing the minute I bought. I have faith by the end of the year though. Im holding on!
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:18:08
How do you withdraw to your bank/paypal?! UK user here and don't know where to do it.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:48:56
I cant say I disagree.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:46:09
Feel lile you come across as asking for a downvote but what you say 100% deserved an upvote.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:54:21
I have already bought bitcoin before... Its after telling a friend they found etoro and I wanted to figure out why that it wasnt beneficial. But thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:34:48
But what would the difference be?
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:08:04
But like I said in the original question. If you have £50 on bitcoin on etoro then bitcoin rases in value by 100% will I have got the money up to £100
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:30:05
I didnt know there was a margin.
