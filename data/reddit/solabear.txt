Don't be nervous man, I've been in your position before and it gets better. Just be patient and let it go. Do your reading and research and stay on top of it. If you believe in the tech like millions of others. There's nothing to be worried about. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:33:47
Wow thanks for educating us about the real issue in all of this. Makes much more sense thinking about it that way.

You ordered bitcoin? How did you go about doing this? Where did you order it? Typically you buy it from an exchange like coinbase etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:48:46
Oh i see, my apologies, I don't use Coinbase so i didn't know that's how it works.

Have you tried switching banks to one that allows you to use your funds however way you like?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:30:49
Yeah I agree, it seems like an easy fix and it is a pain in the ass. But, be thankful they are being a pain in the ass. Be thankful that they are taking massive measures to make that the person who is making an account is actually you and not some random guy somewhere in the world trying to steal your identity. This is predominately why they make signing up difficult at times. I hope it gets fixed soon for you though!

Electrum is pretty good. But I highly recommend getting a hardware wallet when you can. Something like a Ledger Nano S or Trezor, they're great investments and they typically support forks once the source code is available to them. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:04:04
Yes, Electrum is perfect until you have the ability to purchase a hardware wallet. But for now, it will do just fine, plus it has Segwit integration! Which is always good!

Sorry mate, can you please rephrase your question. Not sure I'm understanding. 
If you want to transfer from one wallet to the next, just send your bitcoin to the receive address of your new wallet using the send function of your old wallet.

A release date hasn't come out as of yet. It is being anticipated a 2018 release at this point, just not too sure when in 2018.

Every time you put money into bitcoin or any crypto for that matter you need to ask yourself, is this money i can afford to lose? It is very important to ask that of yourself because this space is very volatile and you need to make sure you can still live safely and securely without the funds.

I use Exodus. Really good wallet. Holds Litecoin, etherum and bitcoin and others. Watch their videos on their site to learn more. Very reliable wallet from my experience with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:07:44
Yeah not much you can do about that. 
However, if you ever want to switch wallets say move everything from your exodus wallet to your hardware wallet. You can export your private keys form Exodus and transfer your crypto free of charge. However, I recommend watching some tutorials on youtube before you try it by yourself. It can be quite complicated.

No the amount of bitcoin in the wallet will always stay the same. Its worth in fiat however, will change depending on what the price is at per bitcoin. So for example if you have 0.5 bitcoin, that will never change, but what that 0.5 bitcoin will be actually worth in fiat currency will change as time goes. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:24:07
Thats it boyssss!

This video is amazing. Its a bit long but it explains everything perfectly and very simply. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:36:14
Just for future if you like you can use blockchain.info's wallet as a middle man to transfer funds and make the fees whatever you like them to be. Give it a go! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:11:50
I recommend watching this video: 
if you would like to learn what segwit2x is. Don't just disregard it. It's important to understand why its happening. I am not saying this because I am fan of segwit2x, I'm definitely not a fan. I will always be with the original chain. But furthering your knowledge in this cryptocurrency as it progresses through time is crucial so you can make calculated decisions. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:54:26
Easiest way to buy would be coinbase. 
Wallet I recommend highly for starters is Exodus. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:22:29
Great article! Read this OP. DCA is a good strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:44:36
That depends on you man. You can start either way. Set up a limit for yourself. Every week or every month or every fortnight. Say for example, you can set aside 5% of your salary every fortnight to crypto. And buy on a specific day. It all depends on your financials though. But I personally bought a lump sump in the beginning and then bought over time, every couple of weeks. 
Edit: Grammar 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:37
No typically it isn't. If you dont have access to your private keys, the coins aren't technically yours yet. I highly recommend software wallet like Exodus. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:21:05
Its hard to predict. If you want to buy. Just buy. Don't waste time predicting. All you can do is analysis and studying of the market and make an educated decision from there. Of course i say all this with experience. The number of times I waited to see if the price went down and it didn't. So I learnt and just bought at whatever price it was at. The last time I bought was at 7250AUD and was at its highest of all time at that point. But I did it because I believe in Bitcoin and its future. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:59:56
I use Exodus. It's a pretty good, versatile wallet and allows access to your private keys. Which is the most important part. I highly recommend it. 
*Edit: Restructured sentence.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:03:58
Why don't you get someone who is over 18 to buy it for you and send it to your wallet. That way you are doing it through someone you know and its right in front of you when you do it. Maybe ask your mum or dad? Send them money and have them buy it. Done! :) 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:02:14
You cant really call it a bubble. Not enough people have bought into it. We're still at the early stages of its adoption and we have a long way to go before it becomes mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:43:46
Yeah thats okay man. Everyone starts somewhere, at least you got a seat in the rocket ship to the moon. Enjoy! :) 
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:18:38
I'm surprised. I don't know if any Australian would agree with me. But in terms of technology, I always thought Australia was lagging behind any other developed nation. Take the shit show that's the NBN as an example and how the current internet speeds here are the same speed as what most of Europe had 10-15 years ago. But this interesting and I hope Australia continues forward with implementing bitcoin in its economy. We need to continue innovating and inspiring an economy that thrives on technology, not throw all our eggs in the basket of coal mining... here's to a more prospourous Australia. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:50:08
That's so cool man! May I ask how exactly you sent the bitcoin? Did you use an app? I live in Melbourne too by the way!
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:13:53
Yes definitely!!! Do NOT keep BTC or any coin for that matter on any website. It depends what hardware wallet you want. I have the ledger nano s and I love it. I feel very secure with it. But theres others like the Trezor. I recommend watching some youtube videos comparing hardware wallets and making a decision from there. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:41:22
This is amazing, soon more and more stores will be doing this allowing for bitcoin to go up and up in adoption and be used more extensively as a legitimate currency. I'll definitely be sure to buy something just for the hell of it. Keep going Australia, I love it. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:57:50
Yes of course, if you couldn't do that it would defeat the whole purpose of having wallet. Right? :) 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:21:10
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:50:17
Can you please tell me what app this is?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:07:31
Immediately move it to a wallet. Never leave your private keys on an exchange or website. That makes it 'their' private keys. I use Exodus, its a pretty good wallet that allows for many different cryptocurrencies. But there are lots of wallets out there, just make sure you do your research. 
Once you've made a profit with bitcoin, you can go to an online stores like allthingsdecentral.com and buy a hardware wallet. I'd buy using bitcoin so you push the use of it as a legitimate currency. Hardware wallets are more secure than software wallets and if you're buying 100 I would highly recommend getting a hardware wallet first, but for the time being while you wait for it to be sent to you, you can leave your private keys in your software wallet.

Thanks man!
