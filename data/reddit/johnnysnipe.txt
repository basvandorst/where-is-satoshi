There is no argument you freak. Just a fact. And that is that you're totally fucking paranoid and that anyone reading your posts can see it. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:10:05


Based on nothing but hopium and unicorns. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:33:45
Only in the bitcoin world people need to make warning posts that doubling your money won't work. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:22:23
And this sub it's not a cult, right?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:21:53
I asked you something. What is my strong and loud opinion on bch?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:59:01
Can you answer me please?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:26:42
This thread is crazy on so many levels. 
A paranoid bitcoiner posts a paranoid thread about other paranoid bitcoiners and when i mention people here are also paranoid everyone gets paranoid and starts attacking me. 
The self-awareness of many here is non-existant. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:24:28
How do you know?
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:06:33
You can say this about literally anything. 
Posts like this always make me realize that the average bitcoiner is just a broke teenager dreaming of becoming rich by doing nothing. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:53:20
He'll soon learn to be an asshole to fellow noobs who raise the price of your coins by buying in. Thanks to entitled neckbeards like you. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:56:57
Amazing how you can't post 1 valid argument why your method is the best yet you still attack me like i'm doing something wrong. 
I don't claim to know how to invest in the best way. You did. Remember. 
You can't show me why and then get upset. 
Really odd behavior. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:51:13
Please stop with this shit. At this point it's just annoying. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:47:24
Yes. -10. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:06:05
Why exactly? Because i gave you a correct answer you didn't want to hear?  Do you always downvote people who say things you don't want to hear?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:16:52
I sold at 4100 and bought back at 3850. The signs were so clear. Just like the last 10 times. Stop pretending the childish "hodl" meme is the only right thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:36:43
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:01:21
These posts are getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:44:54
So it's simply a shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:41:24
How the hell can anybody answer this? Every country is different and every situation is different. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:05:16
Half this sub every time we go down a few 100?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:55:33
Which isn't allowed, right?
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:08:42
How was i being a dick??
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:59:15
Translates to: i'm shitting my pants and want others to buy because i sure ain't buying shit at these ridiculous prices!
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:28:14
What the hell does the price have to do with that?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:19:05
And when it goes down?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:17:52
Blah blah blah. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:21:51
Yeah because people in this sub aren't paranoid whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:17:46
The same question gets asked every 10 minutes. 
Even if you are new it is common knowledge that we can't look into the future. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:11:41
Wth are you talking about? You wanted to know how it was high risk. I answered you. 
Instead of thanking me you post this as a reply??
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:15:25
It has trouble staying over 4000. I expect a big 1000 coin dump soon but as always no one knows. We could be at 5000 tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:32:28
What FUD bot exactly?
You sound like a bat shit crazy conspiracy nutter. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:21:04
No you didn't. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:37:49
Last time i'm giving you advice. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:56:38
What part don't you understand?
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:40:50
Yes. We can see that. No need to post it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:19:23
I never said any of that. Please just stop. You're making yourself look like a clown. You have the discussion skills of a mentally challenged 10 year old. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:52:15
It's lose. 
Also your comment is ridiculous. A ridiculous bitcoiner myth. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:24:43
Nobody can predict the price. Stop listening to that bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:54:40
The thing is every other post is a meme thumbnail. 
I just want to read Bitcoin news and discuss it. This sub seems to be filled with teenagers who want to get rich while posting memes. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:48:48


Uh no it isn't. I pay roughly 3.50 per transaction and often i still end up waiting many hours. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:00:25
It's also hilarious how you are convincing yourself i only made a few dollars. Because anyone who isn't a "hodler" like you can't be making any real money. 
You must be foaming from your mouth right now. Haha poor kid. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:55:00
So much frustration. Calm down. It's ok. Keep "hodling". 
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:13:22
Your reply does not make any sense whatsoever. I'll let you figure out yourself why. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:58:59
Told me what you dumbass? My post is still totally correct. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:38:41
Can you show ONE poster here that is on some kind of payroll?
If not then i'm just gonna assume that you are paranoid as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:47:47
I'm on the phone with Bitcoin CEO right now!
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:04:36
Excuse me?
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:49:13
No they don't. Stop with this bs. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:42:57
Riiiight. And what kind of messages would that be in my case? Other than calling you paranoid as hell of course. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:14:33
Jesus man! You are paranoid as fuck! Completely fucking paranoid! Do i need to "present an argument" for that?
All people need to do is read your batshit crazy posts and accusations!
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:35:10
Someone sold their coins at 200. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:03:40


Yeah ridiculous. Thank god bitcoiners are not like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:11:07
Yup, this will fail. Guaranteed. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:29:11
You sure are one of the biggest lunatics here. People like you scare me. You could be standing next to me in the supermarket. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:28:27
Shit post. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:21:18
I asked you something. A sockpuppet for what or who?
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:04:21
Nobody is gonna send you a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:56:57


Stop making up such ridiculous claims. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:51:05
Slow news day eh?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:58:00
Uh what?
Calm down and think before you post. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:32:42
You're paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:15:56
Bye. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:58:10
You know what would make things slightly easier? Instead of downvoting me why don't you tell us what company you are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:45:16
I think i called exactly 2 people paranoid. You and some other very paranoid weirdo. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:30:54
Clear up what? Someone pulled a number out of his ass. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:43:43
Nobody knows. Seriously, how should we know? Who here can look into the future you'd think?
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:13:14
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:13:42
Stop pretending everyone here totally "enjoys the dip" and loads up on all these "cheap coins". Childish meme. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:00:05
Thanks. I didn't notice the 10 topics before you with the same message. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:54:13
Obviously. You know me well. 
You on the other hand will be a millionaire neckbeard with a bunch of feeeemales sipping cocktails on your private island a few years from now. Correct?
I take it you don't even work? You just sit in your boxer shorts behind your computer eating doritos because you know you will be rich soon? I mean what could possibly go wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:52:56
And 30 before you. Just today. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:49:03
People pumping it. What else. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:08:01
It's just odd that you assume i don't own Bitcoin and am actually against it. 
I notice that a lot here. If you are not 100% euphoric about Bitcoin or are not 100% against banks and fiat then you just have to be a troll or an undercover banksters who hates Bitcoin. 
I own more coins than many here but as the same time i am still realistic about things. Yup, that really is possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:27:16
Why? There is nothing wrong with it but why would it be the best way?
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:17:42
How the hell should we know? Do you think anyone here has a crystal ball?
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:10:26
Why is it a great time?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:55:01
That's it? That's seriously it?
This can't be real. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:11:53
Ok, just completely ignore what i just said because you know you were wrong. That will get you far in life. Respect. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:38:45
One of us 2 seems to be foaming from the mouth and it certainly isn't me. 
Anyway, you went through my post history because you are not paranoid, right?
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:02:43


Only about 98%. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:35:10
5 years??
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:48:26
I stopped reading after the first sentence. 
How is holding dollars insanely high risk? Please enlighten me. 
I assume you totally avoid holding Bitcoin as well? Actually i'm sure you do or your post wouldn't make any sense whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:11:51
Damn, that made me cringe hard. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:28:55
Just someone pulling random price predictions out of his ass. Worthless topic. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:34:44
Jesus Christ. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:14:37
Oh yeah, admitting it was 3 instead of 2 was one of the worst things i had to do in my life. I'll cry myself to sleep tonight. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:32:04
So i assume that you are buying like crazy?
Oh wait, i get it, all you do i post a retarded meme that suggests that others buy expensive coins so that yours will become worth more. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:00:33
The 13 in your name is your age?
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:10:49
Insane how you are ready to spend 50k based on "advise" from anonymous 20 year olds who obviously can't predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:02:39
It could go crash to 100 dollars overnight?
Let me know if i also need to explain that. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:41:12
You sound awfully paranoid. 
Anyway, what is my very strong and loud opinion on bch exactly?
Please tell me. I'm waiting. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:39:00
How the hell should we know exactly? Do you think someone on Reddit can somehow predict the future?
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:14:15
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:18:46
Nobody fucking knows! Stop asking the same thing every 10 minutes! We can't predict the future!
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:42:17
I'll take it if you pay me 10 dollars for the transfer. As it's not even worth that. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:45:34
Piss off. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:46:45
Man, flip a coin and you get the same result. Bitcoin could drop to 100 or go to 10k. Nobody fucking knows. Anyone who claims anything else is lying. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:36:18
Wrong sub? Actually more like wrong site?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:56:05


The country where pretty much no one uses Bitcoin? Why should we ask them?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:32:12
Here we go again. Brainwashed by what or who to think what exactly?
Please answer me, i seriously can't wait to see what you will come up with!
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:31:23
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:50:32
Oh ok. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:04:04
Ok, i'm not even gonna answer this. That's how stupid this is. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:19:23
People buying. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:51:01
Why don't you explain it then? What was my very hostile post?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:26:48
You're like the leftists nowadays. If you don't agree with them you must be a nazi. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:00:39
Between 1 and 3400. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:38:04
What? Sockpuppet? No sorry, i only use one account. A sockpuppet for what or who exactly? Tell me, what goes on in your paranoid fantasy world exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:07:20
I see you're getting more and more upset. You're a bad loser. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:01:19


Why? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:03:21
Nothing wrong with holding. Telling everyone to "hodl" is. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:45:15
Then you use the search and find the same question has been asked 5 times a day for the last few years. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:22:16
Yeah, completely delusional. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:11:47
Please stop posting this every time we go up 50 dollars. Please. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:57:21
It could go up to 5k. Nobody knows. He could lose even more money listening to people like you who pretend to know the future. 
There is so much ridiculously bad advice in this thread. Anybody who makes financial decisions based on advice by random bitcoiners will be guaranteed to lose his money. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:28:05
How does that make any sense? As if by magic as long as you hold the price will go up? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:49:27
It's hilarious that you think everyone here is "buying the dip" every time we go down. 
It's part of the pump. To get new people to buy in. The majority here isn't buying anything at these prices. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:52:01
What part about my post don't you understand exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:12:58
Ok. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:59:42
Who said i have good advice exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:42:34
Seriously, these "please predict the future for me" posts are getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:13:11
Here, i found 2 more paranoid loonies. 
But it's just me right? Nobody in this sub is paranoid. I'm making things up. 
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:54:03


Huh? How the hell do you know?? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:35:11
Stop fucking asking! Nobody knows!
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:58:36
People from other countries, including me, use the name IRS when talking to Americans about their local tax authority. 
Will you remember that or do i need to remind you next week. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:59:48
What Korean sell off?
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:09:34
A bitcoiner predicted we would go up. 
Wow, that's amazing. Surely worth a dedicated thread. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:42:51
Bitcoin was cents back then. You needed a loan?
Anyway, you truly don't understand why they didn't give you the loan??
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:17:56
It's a cult thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:21:55
Nobody knows. Stop asking ffs. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:43:22
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:46:40
You must be crazy if you think i'm gonna read that adderall fueled nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:01:43
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:31:15


Isn't this the case if you spend it? It always goes to a new wallet?
You only need to own the old wallet to get the forked coins, no?
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:08:34
You will lose your money trading. 
Edit: thanks for all the downvotes i guess? Wtf?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:32:59
How much did you buy @_date: 2017-08-13 14:47:45
Well it certainly isn't sudden mass adoption. I think it's safe to say at least 90% just want to get rich. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:48:10
It could go up or down or do nothing. 
It's affect by the way. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:02:45
Edgy as hell. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:34:21
Who here is supposed to answer this? Serious question. Every 10 minutes someone posts the same question asking if we can see into the future. 
Why do you think people can answer this?
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:11:21
You mean like banks do all the time?
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:01:12
If we could predict the market we would all be millionaires. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:59:08
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:51:32
And that's why everyone is here. To get rich by not using Bitcoin. Can we at least admit it now?
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:37:49
You know, some people own more than the 0.5 coins you do. Yes, crazy. I know. 
I love how upset you kids get when people trade and make money. I can feel your frustration through my screen. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:43:27
He, as you are fully aware, is talking about the 100's of people here who were celebrating that we would "go to the moon" after Segwit. 
It's funny to see sarcastic comments like yours now being upvoted as if this never happened. 
Half this sub had the champagne and Ferrari's ready to order. So that is what he is talking about. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:42:43
No it's not you tard. 
Seriously, how old are you. You are so clueless about things. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:16:31
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:38:51
For the 100th time: nobody knows! We can't predict the future. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. 
Stop asking!
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:18:24


God, you're crazy. 
And surprise...paranoid as fuck. 
You cultists are insane. 
Can you show me one line from that guy i am "parroting"?
Just one. C'mon man, i'm waiting. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:23:19
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:26:52
He can't. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:02:49
What is the unfounded claim exactly???
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:46:18
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:14:23
By then people will learn to use the search. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:26:18
You are asking a sub where everyone is invested in Bitcoin if they expect the price to go up? Seriously? This is what you future investments depend on?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:27:35
How the hell should we know?
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:02:07


@_date: 2017-08-13 19:29:20
Do yourself a favor and stop making a clown of yourself. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:08:57
Nobody knows. We can't predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:56:20
With not too much risk? You're delusional. 
It's extremely high risk. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:04:35
I'm happy for you. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:16:42
I pulled at both ends till they stretched out. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:56:30
How much do you own? How much does he own?
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:35:31
You have no clue if it is. Just like the rest of us. Stop pretending you know more than others. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:06:33
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:19:44
Your posts are filled with paranoia. Fyi. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:10:32
Paypal won't support this. You are completely clueless. Save yourself the time and money. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:46:26
That's odd. For some reason i thought Bitcoin was supposed to have a use case? No? Correct me if wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:09:17
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:26:49
Dickish non-productive? Because i corrected a very important mistake you made? Seriously?
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:56:43
There is no price rise guarantee whatsoever. Anyone who says otherwise is delusional. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:19:00
Indeed. He seems quite paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:26:02
This is good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:11:32
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:09:05
What part about selling before the dip don't you understand? If you sell you then have money. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:08:21
Sorry, 3 in total. Yeah, i called 3 clearly paranoid people paranoid. Get over it. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:55:45
And of course the deal was too good to be true and you thought you'd make some quick money. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:54:02
You will lose your money. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:32:22
Most likely never. And if it will then how the hell should we know?
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:54:25
Nothing to discuss. 
Bitcoiners "hodl" yet they somehow expect "others" to spend so it will go mainstream. 
Without traders and darknet buyers there would be near 0 circulation. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:13:41
Oh ok. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:12:30
Holding is just as risky as selling. As no one here has any idea where the price will go. Stop pretending you do. 
Downvoted because? Where am i wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:09:44
Mental gymnastics. 
When i buy something with my cc i'll get my purchase right away. You are fully aware of that. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:02:12
I never acted like i was better or cool. You started attacking me because you got upset someone made money by not "hodling". Go read back your comments and calm down. You are wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:53:58
Glad i'm a hodler! Everyone here was saying dump that shit at $200. 
Downvoted why??
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:58:29
But can you "lose" though?
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:09:56
People can predict anything. It means shit. There is no "bitcoin expert" who knows more than you or i. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:58:18
It's not an opinion. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:02:45
But even though some work way better than Bitcoin they are still shitcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:56:22
Look, if you think bitcoin will be a success then no need to dollar cost average. You just go all in. If you are worried about price movements then you cost average. So exactly the opposite of your explanation. 
Why people are downvoting me is beyond me. 
You also somehow feel attacked. Why? You still didn't make any sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:40:48
I can feel your frustration. I really can. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:25:24
You look really upset now. Maybe take a quick walk outside. This is not healthy. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:56:30
Haha what??
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:28:52
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:32:11
Bullshit. This happens all the damn time. This sub's slogan is "hodl" ffs!
Anybody who doesn't "hodl" gets shit on. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:41:22
Jesus christ! Can you people stop asking financial advice from anonymous 20 year olds on Reddit!!
Nobody here can predict the future! Stop asking!
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:56:10
Man, stop acting as if bitcoin only can go up and up. Anything could happen and we could be at 200 dollars by tomorrow. Likely? No. Very possible? Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:35:32
Congrats. Your own shit meme post. You are a true bitcoiner now. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:12:32
Wrong thread?
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:51:27
Trolly troll. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:42:58
You got it right. That's simply it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:28:22
You seem quite paranoid. Did you report me to the mods already for being a shill as you just claimed?
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:42:03
Troll. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:44:18
Which unfounded claims? That people here are paranoid as well?
Your self-awareness truly is non-existing, is it?
This shit is getting beyond crazy. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:12:44
No, it's not very possible. Stop making up ridiculous claim. Jezus, you people. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:54:52
Some of these coins work better than Bitcoin. So what would you call Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:39:34
How do you know??
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:06:10
Right. In the meantime the most used word by bitcoiners is "hodl". 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:09:52
I think i visited that sub twice since it was created. I have no idea what goes on there nor do i care. 
You must be paranoid as fuck. I almost feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:21:45
Where the hell do you live? In general 95% wouldn't know what bitcoin is and probably 0.001% will own some. 
In the last 5 years i haven't met a single random person who owns coins. 
Your 10% is completely ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:36:06
The guy you responded to. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:23:22
Do you realize many others think EXACTLY the same thing about this sub? And they are right. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:36:34
What am i supporting exactly? This is your third claim that goes unanswered. 
According to you i support something, am a shill and am brainwashed. I keep asking to explain yourself but somehow you won't. So again, can you tell me how i am a brainwashed shill and what i am supporting exactly?
If you can't then it's safe to assume you're a paranoid lunatic. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:35:54
Why? How does that make sense? What will there be 3 years from now exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:52:07
Why don't you start by using the search so you can find out this has been answered literally 100's of times. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:03:59
Play some more word games instead of admitting you were wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:33:37
Effective at what? What are you trying to say?
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:13:53
Why does it frustrate you so much that i don't "hodl" but trade and make money? You act like a frustrated 12 year old who didn't get as much candy as his buddy. Grow up. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:45:56
Serious question. Is there a serious Bitcoin sub? So not a meme sub like this one?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:23:59
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:49:26
It is. As it's the only correct answer. 
Thanks for the downvote. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:59:36
Oooh ok. Well case closed then. Bitcoin will just go up forever. How much more evidence do we need!
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:28:12
Wtf does that mean? Just because i respond to the guy there are other options than just "hodl"?
Are you upset i made money while you didn't perhaps?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:24:50


Huh no?
Damn, you are paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:40:52
And history somehow guarantees something?
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:29:51
 Between 0.001 and 0.2
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:08:14
Ok sorry, must've been someone else. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:30:22
20 times a day the same damn questions and 20 times the same damn reply: we don't know. We really do not now because we don't have a fucking crystal ball! Stop asking!
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:04:04
You're asking anonymous 16-25 year olds with no financial background nor a crystal ball what to do with 200 bitcoin worth of altcoins. 
You're gonna lose those as well. 
But as you wanted advise: sell and put the money in your bank account because you can't manage finances. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:00:55
Prostitution and drug dealing. Pick one. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:33:16
You can't. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:00:30
Actually his whole post is bullshit except for that one line. 
If you think otherwise you are kinda delusional. Especially on a sub where the un-official slogan is "hodl". 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:39:35
Where did you get these numbers from? Nostradamus?
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:28:24
Most here sold their "shitcoin" at 200 because it would drop to 1 dollar in a few days. 
So i expect a lot of butt hurt. 
Edit: one downvote = one butt hurt. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:20:05
Where do you people keep finding these things?
Every single day someone comes here to complain that some weirdly named company i never heard of is a scam. Yes, of course it is a scam. 
Seriously, where do you find these things?
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:31:00
Who should answer this according to you?
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:33:50
Right. Because it will keep doing that. Forever. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:50:16
Is this your first day on the internet?
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:16:31
I have no idea why you keep asking me this stuff. What are you implying?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:39:59
Stop lying. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:44:38
Look, i'm invested in Bitcoin just like you but basing future perfomance on the past is just really silly. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:02:12
No you did not. 
Anyway, i have one more question. 
Do you consider yourself paranoid? Just a yes or no will do. I want to know how far detached from reality you are. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:05:30
How the hell should we know if it just "keeps getting higher and shit"? Guess what. We can't predict the future. It might keep getting lower and shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:17:18
Anyway, in your little paranoid fantasy world, what exactly would i be shilling for?
Please answer me. I can't wait!
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:29:23
You are as bad as them. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:40:29
Why exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:23:27
 But literally none of these points make your statement true?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:00:57
Huh? No i didn't. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:52:26
Dumbest advice possible. Bitcoin could crash to 5 dollars and he won't be able to get out. 
People like you are exactly the reason why one should never come here for financial advice. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:41:25
Correct. People like are why others call it a ponzi scheme. Yet when they mention it OP will be the first to lose his shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:01:08
How would we know? Ask your bank. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:18:45
Alts going up? This is good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:18:57
Shitpost. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:38:39
So AGAIN no answer? Seriously? 
And what was the very hostile post? Calling you paranoid???
Well, i have some bad news for you...
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:31:59
 Because every 10 minutes someone asks us to predict the future! Use some common sense. Nobody on the planet can predict the price!
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:55:24
Thanks. I'll check it out. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:38:49
Grow some fucking balls. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:19:33
Oh right. Well, then it's safe to invest. All in!
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:37:36
Huh? Where did i claim such a thing. You sound paranoid as hell. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:47:05
Happens all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:41:43
I asked you something. Where am i parroting Roger Ver his lines. Answer me. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:24:36


We noticed. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:55:37
How the hell should anybody here know??
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:08:37
Glad i hodled the other coin instead of dumping it at 200 while calling it total shit. 
Right guys?
What's with all the downvotes? People are upset i didn't sell or something? Seriously? Looks like some people have anger issues. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:48:19
Affect. 
Jesus. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:16:44
You mean smart, rich and handsome?
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:12:22
I bought my first coins 5 years ago. I paid as little as 20 (the majority) and never more than 200. And you?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:21:44
I'm not supporting anything. 
You people are paranoid as hell. I've seen crazy cults that are less paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:22:46
My god, this is insane. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:44:00
You didn't answer my question. How will it be fine? How do you know?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:57:56
Can a mod start banning these kids who post that image with every 50 dollar price? Pretty please.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:11:08


@_date: 2017-08-12 05:10:47
And guess what. He has no cllue what the price will be in 3 years. It could be 10.000 it could be 10. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:11:06


To which you reply


Holy shit. The irony is so thick you couldn't make it up. 
Too bad you most likely don't have enough self-awareness to understand why. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:10:34
Ah ok. Then i take that back. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:10:19


You are wrong. You should always assume that as it won't go up indefinitely. Any day could be the top. Today or 100 years from now. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:10:24
God, this meme is retarded. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:57:03
Yeah indeed. Yet no one can point out what i would be shilling for. It's crazy. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:56:43
It was born from teens posting memes?
