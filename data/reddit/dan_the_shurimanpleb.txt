It’s not a guarantee, but it’s something to learn from.

Do you know of anything else that has ever in the history of stocks gone up this quickly and kept going?

Appreciate your input and time !
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:12:16
Correct but investing in it has some similarities does it not?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:18:32
What then would you consider similar to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:58:24
I own bitcoin only

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:01:18
Weak hands
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:45
For what?
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:28:16
Got to start somewhere.

Thanks for this

I mean bitcoin is old tech in terms of technology. Some people advise me litecoin is faster or something. Can’t bitcoin adapt or is it too late?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:52:39
Which then leads to my first question.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:49:05
Well I just find it fishy that right when BTC starts taking off, he bails and takes 1,000,000 for himself.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:49:47
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:59:31
Which is why I asked “if” what if. I’m not saying he will in his right mind, I’m asking what if.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:53:22
Thank you! The one answer I was looking for
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:27:52
I mean they must have been right, because I got two added deposits from coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:50:30
I was reading an article about the creator, just cause all of this is interesting to me and it stated he took off with 1,000,000 BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:54:57
I mean I’ll admit I’m a cynic. I’m just picturing some guy who had a great vision for the future of currency and then when the 0’s start to add up, he takes a “fair” share and bounces.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:57:37
Besides the fact that he created it and also mined the first few. That is enough evidence to make some assumptions.
