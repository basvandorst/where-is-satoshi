Bakkt offers 3 times leverage. 
If people want awesome amounts of leverage in the U.S., then they just need to borrow the money from somewhere, anywhere. Go to Bakkt. Mortgage your house/get home equity loan for 3500, paying ridiculously low rates. Put up $3500. Make lots of money. Close position. Pay off loan.

Mom and Dad.
It is not that hard.

Yeah. Headlines are commercially driven at all publications. Think clickbait. In the case of the quadriga story, that was probably mostly poor editing. I didn't even notice it probably because my eye hit on Quadriga and not on "Bitcoin's founder."

The people who write headlines are often - in fact, very often - not the ones who write the articles.
