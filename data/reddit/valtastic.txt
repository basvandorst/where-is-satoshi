I think a simple "Pay with Bitcoins" button / link would be a good start. No real shopping cart system needed as I don't really handle commerce through that site; it's more of a portfolio. I thought I saw a page full of code to inject into your site if you wanted to make that happen... I'm just at a loss for where I found it as I've read so much in the past few weeks.
But, ideally, if there was a way to do so through those other two sites, that'd be great. The above "button" on valtastic would really only benefit me in terms of commissioned work.

Okay! That solves that example.
Now, say, I want to be able to make a post to my Facebook fans about Bitcoins. (To raise awareness and promote it a little bit.) An eager fan wants to donate a few bit cents to me, without getting in touch with me. 
I suppose this is what you mean "without personal interaction" -- Care to point in the right direction? I don't need hand-holding, but there are always many solutions and generally only a few of them are highly regarded, so saving myself that 'consumer research' might be helpful.

Got anything specific in mind?
I figured a script is what I'd need. Maybe it'd help if I could describe what I wanna do:
Someone emails me for a job. I quote them $500. I mention accepting bitcoins and they're keen on the idea. I say, "On the homepage of my site is a bitcoin button, submit your payment through that." A few hours later I recieve the $500 USD at whatever rate that works out to in BTC, confirmed in my wallet. (Or at least a wallet I can use to transfer to my main wallet.)
That's really all I'm looking to do at this point.

I'll check out Etsy! Thanks! Good advice about switching addresses.
