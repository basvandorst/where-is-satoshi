I'll see if I can find the cyber crime taskforce, Thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:43:46
* Edit 15: Contacted the FBI - they basically shrugged it off and sent me to the website.  Unlikely /anything/ will come from this but it was worth a shot.

This is actually hilarious.  While my gamer tag is "Ozniak" backwards - I am not Steve Wozniak.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:31:07
Thanks again for all the kind words.  I feel mixed about this - we were able to successfully shut down 7 phishing websites but I am nowhere nearer to getting my 7.2+ BTC returned.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:24:40
Why is this site even still up? Why isnt anyone doing anything about this shit?
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:26:51
Cross posted over there, thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:45:07
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:29:41
I didnt post my gains.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:55:19
I sent it back to exodus and accidentally didnt select the new address. This was MY fault. I realize that. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:26:22
Appreciate this.  I dont have any insurance but a tax write off could be a possibility.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:57:11
Yep, no one's donated anything, nor do I expect them to.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:03:10
After searching "BTCP Wallet" the reddit post came up &gt;  The user  posted about it that it "was already available", I realize this was my fault for not fact checking this.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:36:48
Looks like they are...
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:23:27
I think I've been pretty straight forward to owning up to this. Thanks though!
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:10:22
I was handling a fork airdrop.  Had I made a move a ledger wouldn't have stopped this.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:44:49
I wholesomely agree that a singular fuck up has taught me a very very hard life lesson.  This isnt the last you'll hear of me or see me, I can assure you that.  When I lose, I usually come back twice as strong.  
I lost 20K in Oct due to BCH.  I threw in 50K into BTC at $20K in January.  I take a few steps forward to take a step or two back.
Will just take a little longer to recoup this time.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:45:24
I'll send them an email as well.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:18:21
Edit 13: Someone compiled a list of all the accounts used by the scammer - these should be hunted down by Reddit and others to be removed so others dont fall prey to this scheme.
The following accounts are all used by the scammer. You can tell because they all comment on the fake websites.               
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:59:36
No one sent me 83, thats my LTC I moved around after losing BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:45:22
I went ahead and did file a report to the SEC.  I dont think anything is going to happen over this
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:48:15
I'm actually fairly certain it was a reddit link I clicked on in the ZCL fork (that came from a google search).  I was trusting, I didnt verify, I paid for that.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:27:55
If only... should have done that instead of trying to pick up a few BTCP coins...
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:22:00
It was x8, now closer to x1.5
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:06:44
I did send them an email.  Not sure what will come of it.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:19:17
BREAKING - Electrumbtcp.com is down - maybe what we did worked?
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:15:06
I sent my funds BACK to Exodus - immediately everything was stolen, I had thought WRONGLY that Exodus had created a new address when my wallet was ZERO.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:18:05
Sorry, I dont read websites that refer to  "Bitcoin" as "bitcoin core" shite.
Disgusting bcash shillers.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:06:16
No one sent me 80 LTC.  After being scammed, I created a new wallet and sent all my ETH and LTC to it.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:16:47
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:00:30
I started down this path, its all whois guarded but heres the info...
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:44:54
No, I transferred all my funds to a new wallet because I was scared my comp was compromised.  I only hold ETH, ARK and LTC now.  I lost 40% of my portfolio due to this phishing scam.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:48:21
I managed to get through the french crime website with google translate, but I dobut anything will come of it =/
Thank you
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:03:57


@_date: 2018-03-09 15:32:53
It wont take me 10 years to accumulate 70K.  This is a lot for me but its not the end. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:44:06
Thanks for this, I'm trying to manage the hurt right now, im only thankful that i didnt lose everything
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:10:10
Is this even worth contacting the FBI authorities about, I havent heard of anyone actually getting anything back and I dont want them down my throat to be honest.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:46:08
Doing that now, thank you. I dont speak french =/
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:55:38
Please read the main post.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:32:19
Baller of you.  I cant sleep :( 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:24:40
I completely agree.  I've been in the "game" for a long time and was just slightly careless with creating a new BTC address when I was sending it back.  
While I realize I'm the only one to blame, it was FAR too easy to do. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:03:18
Thanks for this - I'll post it on the op.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:40:34
All of this is super interesting.. I may need to talk to an accountant about how to proceed and maybe cut off someone of my taxes as losses.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:31:38
It looks like user (jhkansen1) here on Reddit ( is alerting everyone to navigate to the scam website.  Can I get in contact to find his IP / authoriities?  - it looks like its the same user that scammed people out of BCH and BTG - the same websites that are using the "electrum X . org/com" variables.  These scammers seem to be pretty big and unconfronted, which doesnt make me feel good about where things are in the crypto realm.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:06:44
I'm not sure any of this will help - I looked it over though
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:00:52
I'm more in shock than anything, I dont know what to do, I still have more in my accounts but this was literally all of my BTC
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:29:51
Still alive. Went on vacation to Colorado. Thanks you guys for the views, feedback and help getting the scam sites taken down.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:27:24
I appreciate that.  I'm not flushed out, it was just a large portion of my holdings that I gained through a lot of work and smart trades.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:17:10
Thank you for this. I'll update this in the first post.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:56:20
Its a redirect.
