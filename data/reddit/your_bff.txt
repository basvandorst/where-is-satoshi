You can use Colu or Coinprism to create colored coins, then you send them to anyone who has a color aware bitcoin wallet the same as you would uncolored BTC. The problem is, using colored coins becomes more expensive as the value of Bitcoin increases. You need to pay dust to broadcast the transaction to the blockchain, plus the usual transaction fee to a miner. So you always have to hold BTC in your colored coin wallet. Services like Rootstock and Counterparty are similar to colored coins, and they have markets where the coins you create can be traded. However, sending the tokens you create costs XCP or RSK, the same way colored coins cost BTC to send.
@_date: 2016-08-02 03:30:35
I don't know for sure, but I'd guess that there were actually more miners a year ago. Bitcoin mining has become less profitable for small operations, especially since the halving. As for the idea of "less advanced hardware", you could say that about any year that Bitcoin has existed. Technology is constantly improving. I don't see how either of these things have anything to do with the current price of BTC.

I don't know that much about the unplugged card. I know it uses NFC to make transactions. I'm sure it is secure, but I don't like the idea of carrying all of my btc with me on a device that communicates with any other NFC device in the area. I really don't like the idea of carrying my whole stash of btc around with me, period. Something to keep at home and something to carry for spending seems safest to me. Kind of like having a separate savings and checking account.

Ledger nano with their OTG plug is awesome. Very easy to use. I set mine up with their "ledger starter", which is an extremely simple way to air gap your laptop and securely create your wallet. I feel like my coins are safe. Maybe get a nano to store the bulk of your coins and use the unplugged card for spending.

But if the coins are used by startups to do something like fill atms, making btc more available to consumers, it could drive the price up. I think the next big price jump will happen when the btc infrastructure improves. More people need to adopt btc to make it appealing for merchants to integrate payment systems into their businesses. I just feel like coins leaving these big wallets and entering circulation will ultimately be a good thing.

Early users of bitcoin know that these "coffee transactions" were never optimal, because of the ~10min confirmation time for on chain transactions. LN solves this problem. It also addresses the issue of having to pay fees for every single micropayment of a few cents or less. How can micropayments ever work if you're paying fees for every single on chain transaction? We need a second layer, some people are just slow.

I don't own enough hardware to care either way, I'm just trying to understand... I always thought that BTC owned the cryptocurrency space because it had the most powerful computing network. Is the hashrate expected to quickly rebound because everyone will want to mine valuable BTC while the hashrate is low? If difficulty doesn't adjust, and blocks aren't being discovered, and transactions aren't being processed, is it even possible for the BTC/USD value to change dramatically?

I only have a very basic understanding of how any of this works so just ignore me if this does not make sense, but....

Not trying to offend you, but I doubt the core devs really care enough about your small business problems to offer you a stop gap solution while we wait for segwit to activate. They have put an incredible amount of time and effort into SegWit coding and testing over the past year+... As a business builder, you'll have to research and think outside of the box to find a solution that suits your needs if you really and truly just cannot wait. The fees really aren't that unreasonable for the censorship-resistant, borderless transactions that you're asking for. Have you looked into Counterparty assets, sidechains, or Rootstock? Otherwise you could settle for fiat solutions like Western Union, but I'm sure you'll find their fee structure far less appealing than the ~$0.20 fees you're stressing and posting about here.

Coinbase complies with AML/KYC, so they need to ask a lot about your identity. If you don't care about your ID being tied to your purchase, then Coinbase is a good option. I bought some of mine through Coinbase. You shouldn't store them on Coinbase though, or any other exchange for that matter. Ledger and Trezor are solid, easy options for safe storage. If you're somewhat technically inclined, making a paper wallet for storage is also a good (and free) option.

I'm not sure. I don't know the average volume for the exchanges, but Bitfinex is around 15k 24hr volume today, whereas Kraken is only sitting around 2k. There is also about a $70 spread between Bitfinex and Kraken. I'd guess it wouldn't have too much of an impact because of how many exchanges exist today. Something similar happened a few years ago on Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, and that was crazy because it was basically the only exchange that existed at the time.

[Mycelium Gear]( and [Bitpay]( have good features for businesses. If you're just looking for a wallet to store  BTC you should go with some form of cold storage. Just display the public QR code to accept payments. I recommend [Ledger Wallet]( which works with Mycelium.

I was playing around with microcontrollers and stumbled on something called "bitswitch". First I found an old reddit post (  ). Continued onto Google and found an abandoned startJOIN (  ). Then kept going and found this site, which has been updating a lot lately (  ) and this (  ). I think this idea would be so huge for bitcoin. Just put some bitcoin on your phone and never have to search for quarters to do laundry again! I could even monetize the water faucets or electric outlets on the outside of my house... I hate to think of a world where water faucets or hand dryers in restaurant bathrooms are controlled with micropayments, but something like bitswitch could easily make this happen... Then I read this article (  ) on cnn, and the part about the streetlights being protected from hackers by using "bank level encryption" caught my attention. I feel like this could definitely be done using something like a bitswitch and colored coins or sidechains. I hope this is what 21inc is all about! It's like the Internet is bleeding into the physical world.

Their support is replying quickly, but I've had some headaches since getting mine. It took over a week to arrive. I used the "ledger starter" to make my wallet, which worked fine. Then I tried to access the wallet on the chrome app and I was immediately prompted to update the firmware, which wiped the wallet I had just created. So I follow the prompts to update the firmware, giving out some info that I thought was supposed to remain private. Then I restored the wallet using the "ledger starter" again, not sure if that was necessary. Restarted the Chrome app, finally got it working, and now all I can think is that I did something wrong along the way and my coins are safer where they are.

I've put a lot of thought into this in the past, and I think one good solution that I came up with is using a "piper wallet". It's a raspberry pi with a thermal printer connected to it. You press one button and it generates and prints a public/private key pair paper wallet. Cut the paper wallet in half, staple the public key QR code to the regular receipt (hold onto the private key qr). When the guest sends money to the public address you can see the payment and sweep the private key into your restaurant's wallet. Avoids having your waiters/waitresses fumbling around with an electronic device while interacting with guests.

I like the explanation from PGPfan from 2011, pre scaling political debate drama, on what Bitcoin is. The 'anonymity identical to cash' part is debatable, but his ending is strong...
"If we MUST get into debate on it, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (meaning that there is no 'controlling entity charging fees, etc.) online payment system (think a replacement for PayPal) that offers annonymity identical to that of cash that is NOT tied to any govenmental currency. Perhaps it is/will become that 'StarTrek economy' where no body/agency/government has control over it's value. It's a marvelous cryptographic solution to a problem thought unsolvable (which if you notice my screen name, is a passion of mine anyway)."

Yeah I've looked at it a little. I need to do more research, but it looks pretty expensive for the mining power it offers. Kind of looks to me like you're paying for all of the software and pre-setup that it offers more than just the mining. I'm worried that it wouldn't be powerful enough to get the supply of coins that I need. I was looking at the antminer s3 maybe. I just can't find reliable info on how many btc/day or week that I'd be able to generate

I need a steady supply of dust payments in order to use colored coins. I'd need to make a colored coin transaction every ~15min for 15hrs per day. So ~420 transactions per week at .000016btc per transaction, times ~14 individual accounts
