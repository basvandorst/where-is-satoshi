No I wrote them down during the setup process, yea that would suck lol - but my question is, with those 24 words, I don't need the ledger itself in case I lose it?

What about a ledger nano s?

I have the card with the twenty or so words it came with - should I keep a copy of that somewhere else safe?  Right now that card is with my Ledger
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:21:33
What do you mean by that?  Sorry if I'm a noob but I have some stored on my ledger - is there a way to keep it backed up?

No, you get a rusty 50 year old survival knife from grandpa's military days.  And a stick to bite down on.

This man has done more for human rights than anyone I can think of.  Extradite to US, then have Trump pardon him.  Full immunity and a Nobel Peace prize sound about right.

Well since I think NSA spying on US citizens in violation of the 4th ammendment is tyrannical I'd have to say I am glad he did what he did.  Anyone who exposes violations of the US constitution is a Patriot.
