Deprecated. It's not in the GUI. If you really want to know, the command is: getnewaddress "account". Explained under 
    getnewaddress ( "account" )
    Returns a new Bitcoin address for receiving payments.
    If 'account' is specified (DEPRECATED), it is added to the address book 
    so payments received with the address will be credited to 'account'.
    Arguments:
    1. "account" (string, optional) DEPRECATED. The account name for the address to be linked to. 
    If not provided, the default account "" is used. It can also be set to the empty string "" to represent 
    the default account. The account does not need to exist, it will be created if there is no account by the given name.
    Result:
    "bitcoinaddress" (string) The new bitcoin address
    Examples:
    &gt; bitcoin-cli getnewaddress 
    &gt; curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getnewaddress", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;'

That transaction is using unconfirmed coins. Until the coins you are trying to send are not confirmed, your transaction can not confirm.
Unconfirmed coins are originating from this transaction (with very low fee), then there is a chain of unconfirmed transaction ending with yours:

Bootstrap is not faster for new versions (aplicable to v0.9.3 and BEFORE). 
Initial sync is very CPU bound. The most helpul things are fast CPU, much RAM and fast disk. If he has 4 GB RAM or more, he can increase the dbcache parameter to 2000 MB or more. This will reduce the IO operations to disk and speed up validation the most.

The network does not reject valid transactions. If transaction is not confirmed for the long time, your wallet can give you the option to spend the same coins again. You must not depend that the first transaction is rejected from the network - some node/miner can still keep it in mempool.

Initial dl is very CPU intensive in validating all downloaded blocks. For this you need a fast cpu and ram for database cache. Default database cache is 100MB and is too low. If you have 4GB ram, set the dbcache option to 2500MB, or more if you have more ram. I did initial synch in about a day on 10mbps. You can also try to disable port forwarding during this initial synch, so the only job your client is doing is synchronization.

Transaction will be confirmed, or not. There is no third option in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:34:31
Classic will only rise the block size limit to 2MB. Mining stays the same. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:01:10
And Maxwell repeating this like as Luke is doing  a favor to Classic, to cut of all its supporting miners...

Even more upset, I see. Bye.
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:14:44
Your limiting factor is not the dl speed. My initial sync took about a day on 10mbps. You need to increase the database cache option and restart the client. On 4GB I used 2500MB for dbcache option. Default is 100MB and this is way too low.
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:45:08
I was going to upgrade to avast, but after this - it's norton!
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:27:10
Yes. Here is a link to the other thread and comment: ' just a personal opinion of the HaoBTC COO, who seems to be fairly biased and uninformed on several issues' 
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:01:33
He is not.
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:20:32
I don't have that impression. Why you do?
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:32:48
True, but defrauding, even on zero-conf is still crime.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:43:21
Why? Is there something wrong with pulling segwit from the Core? It's all open-source.
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:46:29
Then try the 'Something went wrong?' procedure in the wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:13:58
^ that's the most important part
@_date: 2016-01-21 09:49:23
You can't, directly. Only addresses with unspent coins (accounts pane, show unspent), or used addresses (transactions pane, show details on transaction, be careful finding YOUR address, not the addresses you sent to).
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:42:15
How can the receiver of a push transaction say 'no'?
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:21:14
You are not telling the truth and I think you are doing this on purpose. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:54:05
Both answers are yes.
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:36:39
When a customer accepts an order, it's a legal agreement between him and merchant. Defrauding on this is crime. No difference what payment protocol used.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:47:38
houston we have a problem! 
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:34:53
Just calm down. Or you might forget your brain wallet! ;)
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:22:52
What do you mean 'never tested'?
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:55:56
Sorry, wrongnwording on my comment. I meant - if you want to use segwit transaction, you have to use a wallet with support for it. I didn't mean that ALL must upgrade, before we can use it.
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:37:29
Where were you yesterday? Core have a code patch to hard fork core chain to different mining algo in case Classic forks.
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:25:52
Our law is from 2015. Cover online sales, and digital.
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:49:14
What's your download speed? Initial blockchain synch is very CPU bound. You need fast CPU and RAM for database cache. I don't think bootstrap will help you.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:32:26
After every transaction you send in Breadwallet, it generates a new address.
@_date: 2016-01-28 10:16:25
To send 1 cent you need to pay 5 for fees. How will you send me that 1 cent back then?
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:28:47
Resistance to Core implementing segwit in hurry.
If Classic forks, there will be more time to prepare for segwit.

Defrauding is still crime.

@_date: 2016-01-18 18:35:53
Slow propagation.
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:26:49
Defrauding is still crime, even with zero-conf.
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:32:59
Validation takes time on a slow CPU. You can try to do the initial blockchain synchronization on a powerful desktop PC or laptop, and then move the blockchain data directory to rpi. I keep the data dir on external USB drive, and can switch it fast on any other PC. Also, you need to alter the dbcache option, default value of 100MB is way too low. On a 4GB I set it to 2500MB.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:42:37
Phishing site!!!
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:47:44
You're fast, man.
@_date: 2016-01-15 10:30:10
It's not the download speed, it's the CPU speed, and database cache(s) in RAM, that matters in initial blockchain synch.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:24:56
I have 4GB RAM, and dbcache=2500. With 8GB, you can set it higher.

In SEPA zone it's 0.38€, domestic and international. Takes two hours on average.

Why do you think that banks will allow someone from 'outside' to connect to their private, controlled, bankchain?
@_date: 2015-11-18 09:40:53
All addresses belong to exchange. Users accounts hold no bitcoin. It's just an entry in internal database there, how much they owe you.
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:48:00
Still in the talking phase, but nobody wants to really hear what others have to say. It may take more than a year to get something done, seems to me.
@_date: 2015-11-20 11:20:01
Try Kraken. For up to $2000 a day, they only need a name, that must match the name on money transfer order when funding the account. And hurry up, before EU clamps this down!
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:39:01
My take on this:
* cheaper for us users: no
* faster: no (transfers in SEPA zone now are average 2-3 hours)
* KYC: stronger
* ultimate access for banks: yes, banks won't give up on this
