What stops someone making a 3rd party app that does the same, but for Bitcoin?

Can someone please explain why they need people who are creditors need to tell Mt.Gox that they owe them "X" amount, when they already have it on record?

I really dont see how this works, isn't that the same as saying that if OP buys a gold bar from D, then D uses the money to go buy drugs, then its the OP's fault. Seems pretty wrong to me, (then again American Law is pretty messed up).

Fair enough, thanks.

The **rate of growth** of the bitcoin network hash rate will just begin to decrease and have less resemblance of an exponential function and will plateau. (The **rate of growth** of the network increase will still be positive, it will just grow at a slower rate). 
Regarding your worry of the bitcoin network disappearing over night; you have to remember that there are a lot of people that have access to very cheap or free electricity. Also as others have said, many miners will just keep hold of their coins and wait for the inevitable price increase.
Dispute what people are saying about Moore's Law, the relationship does not necessarily hold true (very strongly) with Bitcoin ASIC's as there are many ASIC's with much thick die wafers that produce higher or similar Hash rates to much thinner ones. However it does appear to be true that ASIC's with thinner die's are much more efficient. This is mainly due to the fact that the there is not a lot of research done into Bitcoin ASIC's compared CPU's and GPU's by huge companies.
There is definitely a relationship between network difficulty and price of a cryptocurrency, however that is a very long and difficult theory to explain, with various situational specific exceptions.

I think this is a tip off that the price of DOGE is going to rise :)

Better than dual booting you can even run some versions of Linux in parallel (such as Kali) and switch between them by pressing a combination of buttons. Pretty neat :)
