Anyone figure out how to change the Request Payment or Send Money aspect from BTC to USD?
I wanted to send a buddy of mine $10 today for food as he picked up lunch, but I had to keep trying various .00xxx amounts of BTC in order to get it at $10 USD value.
This would be nice to have in a future update if possible.
Other than that, like the simplicity of the app.

If you want to simply purchase something with bitcoin for the value of the experience itself; I would just spend another 5 or 10 euro on bitcoin and then make the purchase for the item worth 97.
In the future, if you want to purchase something with bitcoin and plan on using Circle or Coinbase to acquire some immediate coin, best to get the coin and make the purchase within 10-15 minutes so that the price doesn't change much. Get a euro or two more than the value of the item just to be safe.
Beyond that, bitcoin has a steep learning curve but once the basic terminology and concepts 'click', everything starts falling into place really fast and you'll be amazed at how quick the remaining tidbits make sense.

I think he's referring to the lack of trust in making decisions. Imagine if she consulted you everytime she bought a new snack or food from the store... can we agree he can eat this brand of chips, this brand of soup... can we agree he can wear these sneakers, this color jacket? it would be mind-numbingly irritating if neither one of you could make executive decisions on what to do.
Bitcoin is a technology. You both don't have the time/energy to wrap your heads around every new thing that comes out. Your wife  (for example's sake) might be well read on exercise and diet, therefore you might trust her more to handle those decisions. You might be more technological inclined and be able to carry out those decisions. Avoiding bitcoin is a lot like avoiding a new technology. Even if bitcoin doesn't succeed in the future, the knowledge/experience one might gain from studying the technology and learning a bit about economics is priceless. It's easy already to see the gap between kids that 'know' about computers and those that don't... the latter tend to struggle a bit more in the modern world. I have a sibling who to this day struggles with email/cell phones and she is in her early thirties. My parents never nudged her towards learning anything about computers while she was in High School or college.

Store of value, but not in the sense of it's value relative to USD, another currency or crypto-commodity of sorts, but instead as bitcoin itself.
If I control 1.34758 bitcoin today and take proper security measures, I still have that 1.34758 bitcoin ten years from now, or even thirty years from now. What that 1.34758 bitcoin can do for me will change throughout time, but the amount itself will not change by even 1 satoshi.
If I store USD in a bank, they will slowly chip away at it with fees and whatnot. It's also not in my control and if I don't access it in a certain amount of time, the bank or government could take it away from me and force me to jump through hurdles to get it back. The same applies to any paper form of ownership with a stock or commodity.
I could store USD or Gold/Silver in physical form and that would work insofar as having the same amount now as I would in thirty years time. And similar to bitcoin, what it could do for me over the course of time would change. But this is much harder for me to secure and properly safeguard over time.

Also, in an approach like this, the majority of the work would be in the post realm for editing, graphics, and music.
I would budget 60-70% to post and 30-40% to production. You don't need a big crew at all to travel to a few cities and sit down with people for a day. You could shoot on 5Ds or BlackMagic cameras and rent small kino kits in whatever city you're at.

The money is never traveling in and out of the country. That's a little bit of an illusion. The bitcoin blockchain exists all around the world and anyone with internet access can connect with it and communicate with the digital ledger. If you've got the proper keys, you can send or sweep, effectively updating the chain.
When a person is physically traveling in and out of a country, those bitcoins are never physically traveling with them. Even if I had a thumbdrive with a private bitcoin key on it, or a piece of paper with a hand-written private bitcoin key; that doesn't equate to having bitcoins. All that thumbdrive or piece of paper can do is allow me to make a future modification to the blockchain if I chose. If I have that private key written down or stored securely at other places (bank, home safe, friends safe); access to that bitcoin exists simultaneously in multiple points across the globe. It's access/ability to execute change, not so much ownership in a physical sense.
If people can bring cell phones and their computers into other countries, there is no possible way to restrict people from being able to communicate with the blockchain. This would be as silly as someone trying to prevent you from accessing your email in another country.
Brain wallets make it even harder. Imagine you had a brain wallet for backup purposes, a combination of a few personal details and a passage from the bible. Ten years from now, you're in a completely different country and need to access that value. All you need is connection to the internet and you'll be able to sweep that old key into a fresh wallet.
The point being, you're never sending money in and out of the country while using the blockchain. You're editing/updating the blockchain in a global, consensual manner.
Person A (USA) performs an update/edit/change on the blockchain which benefits Person B (UK); as an address they have access/control over now shows a larger balance. If Person B now uses an exchange to sell/convert that bitcoin to euros, we're now dealing with a company which will have some regulation in order to interface with the existing monetary system.
I think there is difficulty in legal defining where the money/bits/transaction came from in the above scenario. 
What if Person A is using a VPN and from a digital perspective, the update/edit/change on the blockchain was triggered from an ISP in Norway or South Africa? 
The BTC which Person A had access to never existed anywhere but the blockchain, and the blockchain is an ubiquitous mesh that exists everywhere.
What if Person A was onboard an airplane somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean and used the onboard wifi to trigger the update/edit/change to the blockchain which resulted in Person B's benefit?
What if Person B (UK) was traveling as well and was in NYC at the time Person A communicated with the blockchain and triggered the update/edit/change?
What if Person B didn't log into his bitcoin wallet until he was back home in the UK? Even though the transaction technically occurred while he was in NYC. Does it matter where he technically was on the planet even though the bitcoin is not physically tied to him; it's only that he can technically access/modify the holdings of an address?
And what if I couldn't remember my private key while in NYC? Does that count as a defense in case someone made an update/edit/change to the blockchain which benefited me while I was in NYC? Perhaps when I return home to another state or country, I find a backup piece of a paper and remember the key.
I don't think the government or anyone for that matter is going to be able to regulate/prevent the way bitcoin integrates itself into our global culture.

I think it's 3,600 new bitcoins a day are created by the miners. Assuming a somewhat consistent degree of behavior on their behalf in regards to selling, the influx of an additional 500 or 1000 coins a day being dumped on the market (by the thief or thieves) would have a significant impact on the price.
I've seen a variety of different numbers out there, but 750k comes to mind as one of them... if that's true, dumping roughly 1k a day would still take two years to clean out.

How does security work in the event that someone steals your Trezor?
If they connected the device on their own computer, their own IP address, would they only need to gain access to your PIN in order to access the accounts?
How many characters can the PIN be?
I also wonder if it would be possible to create multiple accounts on one trezor device. Imagine if someone physically coerced or blackmailed you into handing over your trezor. And what if you gave them a PIN that gave them access to a secondary account where you didn't keep as much bitcoin as your primary account. 
Basically, you've got two master seeds with two PINs and no way for anyone to know if your Trezor has multiple seed/PIN.

Stylistically, I would love to see something along the lines of 'Collapse', Michael Rupperts film.
You have three or four people talking about specific aspects of bitcoin and it's mixed with a lot of good documentary footage, graphical presentations, etc.
It'd be cool to cover both the technical workings of bitcoin and it's societal impacts. Delivering a clean, fresh understanding of how modern fiat money operates today (with all of it's flaws) would also be critical IMO. One of the major reasons bitcoin has emerged is because our current monetary system is so terrible. I think it's key for people to wrap their heads around how bad the current system is in order to get excited for what bitcoin can offer.
Production wise, it'd mean filming in perhaps a few different cities in order to get the right people in an interview setting and presenting their information. It's not scripted, but not free wheeling thought either; I'd have different people focus on certain issues. If I recall correctly, I think they had 8 or 10 hours of Michael Ruppert talking in order to cut it down to the 2 hr film. If you had four people talking in this bitcoin documentary, you could probably get great content with a similar ratio; 2.5 hours per person, edited down to about 30 minutes per person throughout final film.
The rest of the film would then be a major post process with editing, graphics and music.
I work in production and have a ton of gear in Los Angeles and Chicago; so I'm willing to work on this if we get a good producer on board to pull everything together.

I agree, I don't think they are all selling, I think moreso their selling patterns or behavior are likely to have some consistency over time. It's the influx of a large, unexpected variable, such as 500k or 750k coins that someone is hoping to liquidate, which would certainly contribute to a price drop.
Similarly, if the Winklevoss twins decided to exit the market and liquidate their holdings on a variety of exchanges over a one or two year period, we'd see a significant drop in price.

My theory on this is that clever or highly-intelligent people tend to be best when focusing their attention with laser-like accuracy onto a subject. Or perhaps a scientist observing something through a microscope or telescope; they're high-functioning, often impressive under these conditions, but they can be terrible at assessing broad or macro sized concepts.
Most of the brightest people I know fall into this area; great with micro matters but clumsy when dealing with macro concepts.
Bitcoin, IMO, requires a little bit of both the micro and macro understanding. At the micro level, the technology can easily be appreciated and impress most people with technological backgrounds; but the broader implications of bitcoin require a strong capability to think in macro terms. 
What I find interesting is that most people I know (in person) who are excited about bitcoin are the types of people who know a little bit about a lot of things; more jack-of-all-trades types. They're self-taught types with an interest in a wide-range of topics. When you meet up with these types of people, you're often surprised where you find the conversation flowing. Lastly, they tend to be creative, open-minded types that aren't locked to any particular belief or ideology.
I would describe the most anti-bitcoin friends of mine as highly intelligent people, but very 'locked' in their patterns of thinking. They're difficult to communicate with because entertaining a concept such as bitcoin requires them to loosen the anchors on many of their entrenched positions of thought.

This is just for fun and I'm using generalized figures. The two factors being avg daily buying pressure vs creation of new bitcoin through mining and ignoring all other variables (which would certainly be needed).
So if 3,600 new bitcoins are added to the system everyday and the price is hovering around $250, that means we've got 900,000 USD of avg daily upward buying pressure to keep the price at that range.
If the avg upward daily buying pressure were to remain *constant* at 900k for the next 10-12 years...
• 2012 - 3600 BTC daily - $250
• 2016 - 1800 BTC daily - $500
• 2020 - 900 BTC daily - $1,000
• 2024 - 450 BTC daily - $2,000
• 2028 - 225 BTC daily - $4,000
If avg daily buy pressure doubles, then the resulting value per BTC would also double based on this simple model.
If by 2024, avg daily buy pressure is 1.8M instead of 900k, then BTC would respectively be 4k, not 2k.
If bitcoin continues to grow, I think it's clear that the avg daily buy pressure will increase and not remain constant. Again, all fun, but this is where you start to see some more startling figures. For instance, if avg daily buy pressure increases by 5x (4.5M) by 2028, we'd be looking at 225 new coins per day with 1 BTC at 20k.
However, I feel this simplifies the system immensely and is only useful for fun speculation. There is an average daily buy pressure due to creation of new coins, but it's difficult to have solid figures on how many of those new coins end up on market. If we're in downtrend or uptrend, that'll effect how many new coins are dumped on market. In a big uptrend, miners might be more likely to hold and buyers more likely to buy. And this is all interwoven with traditional market forces on the existing supply of coins.

I think one of the strongest things to do is look for ways to exchange bitcoin for labor.
The next time I need some work done at my house, I'll make some effort to find a contractor in my city that accepts bitcoin. I can already purchase lots of products for bitcoin on the net, but to make the entire ecosystem of Bitcoin grow, I think the labor pool is the next big step. 
Even if I restricted my affairs to this community of 150k, I'm certain I could find just about anything I can imagine; be it programmers, lawyers, carpenters, doctors, cooks, designers, electricians, etc. Granted, geography is a big hurdle, but making that effort to find local people who accept bitcoin is a long-term, worthwhile effort to apply.
I've not had the fortune to labor for bitcoin yet, but as a freelance graphics/vfx artist, I look forward to it. I imagine there'll be a time in the future where my yearly bitcoin earnings exceed my USD earnings. I look forward to a day when I can start declining work if they're not paying in bitcoin.

Certainly, and with a company like Coinbase for instance, I figure that they'll make it easy to access your mobile wallet (from your laptop/PC) and swap those coins back to a savings wallet or something. I think they already have features that make it easy to have multiple wallets (accounts) and if one could restrict the mobile device to only have access to a mobile account you create, that'd be great.
On my own, I'm not concerned with losing access to my coins via a future software update as I wouldn't play around with a wallet which didn't offer the security features I want. But I am concerned for new users unfamiliar with how bitcoin works, who will not back up their keys and will be more likely to utilize whatever wallet they stumble upon.
Either way, the more tools the merrier IMO. Would be great to have strong app wallets and strong HTML5 wallets.

Perhaps look at it like this; the centralized fiat system of banking is one 'network of roads/highways' and the Bitcoin 'network of roads/highway' is another. For many people, the only way to get onto the Bitcoin highway is to transfer over from the fiat one, so credit cards become that junction that facilities a transfer from one to the other. Your typical use of a credit card has you using roads wrapped inside the fiat system, whereas now the credit card becomes the tool that allows you to exit that network of roads and merge onto an entirely new system of roads/highways that were previously inaccessible.
The other two ways you could get onto this new system of roads would be to work on it (start mining and securing the Bitcoin network) or to start accepting bitcoin in exchange for goods/services which you offer.


In the most simple terms, it's nothing more than a very large, long ledger of all transactions that occur within the Bitcoin network. It's a giant spreadsheet which is constantly updated with the latest distribution of all the bitcoin on the network. What makes it unique is that this giant ledger is spread across thousands of computers leaving no one in charge of it. The best videos to watch (IMO) for understanding this are [James D'Angelo videos] (
Lastly, a wallet... similar to how you've got an email inbox that handles, sorts, and tracks all of your email, making it much easier to use... a bitcoin wallet is similar. There are different wallets, some are great, some not so much, but their purpose is to assist in the control of your bitcoin. Some make it easy to spend on the fly, whereas other wallets are moreso used for high-level security. A lot of people use two wallets, one on their phone for daily use and another (such as a trezor) for storing safely. No bank, person or government can get ahold of your wallet without some assistance from you. They would need to either physically force you or gain access to your computer/phone and hack into it. So it's not bullet-proof in the sense of security, you can still get hacked or lose your bitcoin if you're not careful. But compared to centralized banking systems of today, the state is in a tough spot of enforcing or controlling the Bitcoin network. The resources required for the state to try to enforce something on the Bitcoin network would far exceed whatever return they hoped for in regards to any single person.
Just some thoughts. I'm no expert, but hope some of this helps. Definitely check out James' videos!

Disagree on this. This would be akin to someone having trouble with email back in 1999 and still to this day, refusing to have an email address because a few emails were lost or never made it to the recipient. I can't imagine anyone today not using email because of 'an experience' they had with the tech ten years ago.
If we keep the long-term perspective in mind and consider the benefits the technology offers (decentralized, trustless record keeping and open, secure ledger), it's safe to say it'll have a role to play in the digital infrastructure of the future.
Price is certainly important, but I look at it like this... if Bitcoin were a human female, price is her level of physical attractiveness... she's still developing and right now she's learning about the world, developing intellectual and social skills, figuring out her creative talents... some of us can already see how beautiful and smart she is, but that's because we've taken an active interest in getting to know her. As she get's older, more people are going to notice she's attractive and start showing more interest in her, but for now, she's not on their radar. For those watching her grow up, we already know she's going to be a heart breaker, and thankfully there are tons of bright minds making sure she'll have the brains to match.

The word that bothers me here is 'give'. With cash I'm clearly giving something tangible, and with a credit card, they're receiving a promise to pay from a third-party agent acting on my behalf; but with bitcoin, I'm not giving anything to anyone.
I'm executing a change to a public ledger and directing a new set of values to a given 'slot' on that ledger. I don't know with any certainty if the other person has access to that slot. They are displaying a QR code, but I cannot prove they can access it unless they choose to demonstrate that point to me. And even then, they are proving 'access'.
The equivalent in cash scenario could be something like this: I go into a coffee shop and order a coffee, the cashier shows me a live web cam of a mailbox in some public spot of the city. I run out there and drop cash in this mailbox. I come back and get my coffee. I didn't give the cashier anything, he's giving me a coffee based on my 'actions' outside of the shop itself.
Another scenario I'm thinking of: Imagine I had a coffee shop and I was also charitable. I'm displaying different QR codes on a daily basis based on organizations or even individual people I'm learning about or supporting. One day it's a youth facility in New York, the next day it's a crowdfunding campaign for a filmmakers short film. Nobody is giving 'me' anything... I can see the public ledger being updated, I can see that a customer has updated the ledger and transferred some value towards the 'cause of the day' and in return for their good will, I'm giving them a coffee, latte, whatever.
I think the legislation that the state is attempting to initiate lacks legal grounds if you consider the language and terminology. I don't think this would stop them from enforcement and trampling over businesses, consumers, etc, but hopefully their own eventual understanding of the technology will one day allow them to serve a more useful purpose.

I think it's relevant to remember that this is a social response, one of considerable numbers. If people are ripping a small number of people off (like a mugging), you're not going to get much pressure to track them. In this instance, a large number of people got a somewhat vast amount stolen from them by the same individual. Be it bitcoin or US dollars, this is like a wide-scale bank robbery and there is of course, significant interest in tracking them down.
No one cares about who did what on a singular level because the resources required to find out 'who is who' and what they did is insane to think about. It's only when an event of a certain order of magnitude takes place, and then it's a social response to find those responsible.
What would happen if it became really dangerous for people in the future to rip off people like this because a global effort would track you down? It won't stop small-level crime but large, enterprise level theft might become more rare.
*Additionally, I do think there is a demand/need for anonymous cryptocurrencies. But I think more people overall (from a mass user perspective) will appreciate the transparency of something like Bitcoin and the ability to track down culprits in a large heist such as we've seen here.

We ought to change the language we're using here. Price manipulation is something that is generally seen with fiat and commodities. Due to the centralized nature of the market, entities, institutions or governments can manipulate the supply/demand and in effect jerk the price around.
With bitcoin we're dealing with an asset, similar to a commodity but different because the ledger of this particular commodity cannot be tampered with. With a typical commodity or asset such as gold, we still have to trust a centralized institution that their coffers are sitting at X value or quantity.
The only way one could manipulate the price of bitcoin in a non-free market manner (dumping 10k bitcoins on an exchange doesn't qualify as price manipulation) would be for an exchange to effectively operate as a ponzi scheme and through the internal actions of the exchange, sell off a ton of bitcoins which don't exist to buyers. This might temporarily manipulate the price of bitcoin in the downward direction, but as these new buyers vacated the exchange platform and tried to move their coins to personal control, the scheme would end and the exchange would go bust. The fake coins or additional value the exchange crafted wouldn't make it out.
It would have a short-term impact, IMO, and the market would soon return to a state of normalcy (from the attempted price manipulation).

Definitely relevant... which is why if I had a life-altering sum of money, I would use a complex cipher (series of numbers/letters related to various books) and put that written down code inside one or two banks. I'd have to physically go there which would cause some delay in efficiency in regards to a robbery.
They could always put a gun to a family members head... hold them hostage... and this is still something you can do today to just about anyone who has money. If you're visibly rich (and in Mexico City for example), it's almost a requirement to have armed security.
For small amounts of BTC though... I would just give it up the same as I would if someone mugged me on the street for cash. I could definitely see a future event in which someone uses their phone to settle up at a bar (with BTC) and they are followed outside... someone threatens them... and holds up a QR code to send the money from their phone wallet to that address. Very likely to happen at some point IMO. Another reason I would caution to not carry much BTC in a mobile wallet.

One day those private keys are going to leak... too many incompetent people sharing that info within the agency... those coins are temporarily in the care of numerous individuals; it's not a matter of if someone will slip up or knowingly provide the information to a friend or family member, it's when.
Maybe it's too risky now, but what about when it's a more widely accepted form of currency? As the value rises, the temptation will get stronger. And it's relatively easy for them to get away with it.

If you want to get back in the game, just make the purchase.
I did some charts a few days ago because I was emotionally hung up a little on not purchasing more coins when it was at $200. I ended up purchasing a second round at 300 and was bummed that I didn't just get it all at once at $200...
In my head, I was doing the math wrong and thinking I really cost myself a good chunk of change by doing that when really it was nothing.
In my scenario... let's say I buy 10 coins at $200 for an investment of $2000. And this second round I buy 3 coins at $300 for another $900... **total investment is $2900 and I now have 13 coins.**
If the price rises to 10K (USD) a coin in the future, I'll now have $130,000 USD in BTC value. My profit would be $127,100.
Had I purchased those other three coins at $200 instead of at $300... **my profit would be $127,400.**
*The profit difference doesn't exceed the initial difference in price...*
Even if you bought at $20.... your investment (at 13 coins) would be $260 dollars... **your profit would be $129,740 if the value rises to 10k a coin.**
**Do you see how little the difference is between these numbers?** The big change occurs in the ROI percentage... but the profit difference is minimal.
So if you believe in bitcoin... stop fussing about a few hundred emotional dollars and jump back in. Screw ROI and just worry about helping the bitcoin economy grow. Invest in BTC, spend in BTC, and spread awareness to others about the benefits of BTC.

What bothers me about this is that these coins will never be used to build/grow or create anything... if you think about it, one way in which value is added to bitcoin is that as the money is moved around; it's creating new assets and therefore adding additional value to the overall base.
Imagine a town with 100 people, each a bitcoin each... these 100 bitcoins at the beginning represent the total wealth/value of their entire town. Now as these people work, trade, build new homes, have children, etc; these new assets (be it products, homes, farms) that they are creating need to be reflective of the bitcoin value. The value of the units will increase over time as more and more wealth/assets are created through their exchange for labor/products.
To think that 1 or 2 million BTC are sitting there, not flowing, not leaving a wake of new startups, artwork, music, movies, products, and innovation is frustrating. It's one thing if people are sitting on it; hopefully it'll start to flow one day and start generating new wealth. But to imagine it's never going to do anything... ugh...

I think they have a secure, deeply established operation using fiat and private accounts... (Caymans, Swiss Banks, HSBC, etc). They've been doing this for the last hundred years with our modern banking systems.
I think the media hype and political propaganda about money laundering concerns, illicit activity and bitcoin are focused on small and medium sized offenders. The big players (politicians, drug cartels, criminal organizations) are and have been comfortably set up with their methods for a long time.
It's the small fries that are going to look for innovation in bitcoin; large criminal regimes don't need it IMO.
I think it's actually going to get a lot more difficult for large organizations to move their money around. Take the HSBC/Mexican drug cartel operation.... when you have that kind of money moving around and it's publicly visible to the entire block chain, it's a little bit easier for people to notice these things and start investigating. I think it's one of the many fears those in power have because behind those *'loving family-centric'* Chase Bank ads, many of these banks have been committing massive financial crimes against the middle class for decades.

What does this mean? Google Hangout tutorial?
I'm personally interested in putting together some animated tutorials that show how to do all these things...  I've spent many hours over the last few weeks getting up to speed on Bitcoin and would love to help out others.
I'm a professional graphic artist and could definitely handle the visual side of things but would love to partner with some people to craft the 'copy' and flow of the tutorial.
I love the short 'what is bitcoin' video that is up on bitcoin.org. I send that to everyone who shows remote interest in it after talking and I feel it's quite helpful in illustrating the core concepts. I'd like to follow a similar style with the speed and density of info, but get into the more complex issues of bitcoin and hopefully make them more clear and less complex to everyday people.
Anyhoo, if you need any graphics done for this google hangout thing, let me know and I can throw some time in!

My point is that the ETF (IMO) doesn't do anywhere near as much good as starting something like bitpay or coinkite. My argument/point is that I wish people in their position (1% ownership of all coins) would do something more constructive with it!
*Where is my ETF?* I don't own 1% of all bitcoins... do you understand why I'm critical of their actions? It's their position/holdings... Like it or not, their decisions affect the protocol/community at large... my microscopic holdings of BTC do jack shit to the market.... whether I start a crappy little ETF of my own (which would fail so miserably!) or start knitting sweaters for bitcoin; I'm not in a position to affect the market. But they certainly are considering their holdings. Do you agree to that and at least see my point there?
*Olympians* - I don't think they are strangers to hard work in the gym or while training... but in terms of building a business or accruing wealth... I don't think they are the types that work hard. I think they are the types of businessmen who are great at getting in on other people's hard work and making money from those peoples creativity/sweat and productivity.

*Value your money...*

Throw it at a local coffee spot with ample space. This way there's no pressure and people can get whatever they want.

I agree with you if one is purchasing in the manner where they are committed to spending X amount of USD on BTC. And yep, still wish I had been better informed earlier when prices where under $50 per coin.
But I've commonly seen people saying things such as "...if it drops back to $200 or $250, then I'll buy..." or such as this poster above who wants to get back in the game, but isn't for some emotional reason.
In that respect, maybe it's better to ignore the reality that yes, were the price lower, you could *afford to purchase more bitcoin*, but for now, get back in the game and focus on acquiring a few coins and making bitcoin a part of your everyday practice in life. Not just sitting on it, but actively using it and trying to exchange your own personal service/work/product whatever for bitcoin.

I do anticipate bitcoin growing massively and believe that growth will be triggered by the poor/middle and even upper class adopting and using it as their primary currency in the future. Of course the transactions, both in amount and velocity, will dramatically increase as the adoption process continues; but it'll be easier to study/analyze that data and figure out how and where the economic energy is flowing. Without getting technical, I all around feel it'll be easier for small operations to launder money but more difficult for the large cartels that have been operating in secrecy for decades.
I've also spent a considerable amount of time reading about things that most people would peg as 'conspiracy theory'. I think the dismissive attitude is most common with people who have superficially studied history and never really spent anytime reading or listening to supposed 'controversial material'. Which in turns leads these types of people to 'group everything' into an easy to dismiss notion of 'conspiracy theory'.
It's equivalent to seeing people talk about how bitcoin is 'mostly' used for drugs and illicit activity since they've done very little homework on the topic and aren't focused enough to spend quality time studying it.

You know what would be crazy and awesome... if someone internally within the FBI leaked the private key to the address(es).
What would happen if hundreds of people worldwide were trying to grab that btc near simultaneously within a short few minutes? How would the block handle that? Any ideas?
EDIT: Another thing to consider... people within the FBI could easily give the private key to a trusted friend... have that trusted friend wait six months or a year and then dip in and transfer out whatever they wanted to another account. If even a small group of agents know the private key, it'd be incredibly tough to lock down who did it. Furthermore, if the agent is really smart and trusts the family member or friend involved, they'll both live out relatively normal lives and no one would know they are sitting on millions.

Intelligent enough... they were informed about it while 'partying' (their own words). And they were in a financial position to capitalize on it... and now their plan is to SIT on it, not DO any real work, but sit on it while everyone else toils to propagate the bitcoin protocol throughout the world. 
One of the biggest issues (IMO) with our current financial system is that not enough energy is invested in physical things; money sloshing back and forth between giant banks, gambling on derivatives/securities and producing nothing through this exchange while gutting the middle-class... Lo and behold, the Winklevoss twins don't want to do any REAL work, they want to establishing an ETF... 
The best thing the Winklevoss twins could ever possibly do for bitcoin would be to give it away to real businessmen who are going to create something; say Elon Musk. That's the kind of person I'd get excited for if they had a 200k+ bitcoins...
The Winklevosses come from money... they've never had to work hard for anything so how can we expect them to know anything about building a real business and creating value. They only know how to capitalize on other peoples work and slurp up the value those people are capable of creating.

Do you think taking rowing lessons equates to working hard for their wealth?
Something being hard or tough is relative of course, but I wasn't trying to suggest they ride motorized carts through the grocery store and don't do anything but sit in recliners while women in white gloves feed and bathe them...
I don't have the skills, nor requisite financial backing to bring anything to Wall Street. I also don't own 1% of all bitcoins... which is why I see this as problematic.
Back to the issue of 'working hard'... it's relative and subjective, but consider their wealth compared to the average, middle-class American... they took a $11 million dollar risk, sure, but to someone making 40k a year, it may be more risky/scary for them to take a 10k risk. All relative of course... so we can't factor their (Winklevoss) risk through quantity (thinking in terms of their character). 
In money terms, their risk is a larger number, but how does that risk affect them? Did they lose sleep over it? Would their whole world come crashing down if it didn't work? How 'hard' was that choice to make? I feel it's tougher for someone on a low, fixed income to take the chance on bitcoin than it is for the Winklevoss twins. If they lost the 11 Mil, I'm willing to bet they're not homeless and it won't affect whether or not their family is able to eat the month after.
But I'm sure that rowing was some tough shit for them! Thanks for reminding us all.

One thing that bothers me is that they'll likely have some lower-level (but more intelligent) technicians in charge of securing the assets since they'll be able to understand these concepts.

- add a prosthetic/rubber nose that is slightly off color from your original skin tone
- act super sketchy and paranoid
- occasionally stop mid sentence and whisper in a low voice "magic internet money". Continue speaking as if it never happened.
- occasionally mime that you have a laptop in front of you and do invisible work on it
- occasionally get up and pretend to dig in the corner of his/her office and tell them you're busy mining and need five minutes to hash it out
Come back a few weeks after your money has been deposited and observe their behavior... see if any of them occasionally close their doors and start to mime dig in the corner of their offices.

In the short term, I agree you would have more coins on the market, more sellers... lower price...
But long-term (in a probabilistic scenario) where these coins are active versus inactive... I think mass adoption would occur more quickly paired with a more healthy distribution of coins amongst the population. And perhaps the creative force (2 mil coins leaving behind a slew of products/businesses/industries) would lead to an ultimately more valuable coin as well.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:23:15
I think the  condition will be wide-spread distribution... if you have small groups or individuals controlling .1% or .05% of the supply; they will be able to shake the value around and create (controllable flux) in which they can capitalize on to increase their holdings.
The wider the distribution, the more healthy the flow will be and things will settle in a more stable norm.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:54:12
*"We need competition — the whole point of Bitcoin's protocol is that it's distributed through many people around the world."*
To me, this is the most important step... what will ensure bitcoin success is wide dispersion.  If too many coins (or hash power) end up in too few hands, centralization will occur in some manner, and everyone will jump ship and go to something else.
A small part of me is jealous of those who are sitting on 100k + coins, but I'm more concerned that small groups of people controlling 1% of the money supply are going to stifle the innovation and dispersion of bitcoin around the world. If they go 'richard branson' on us and create 300+ businesses that pay employees in btc and sell products/services in btc, awesome! But if they sit on it and dribble out the bitcoin in small amounts, doing their best to increase their control from 1% to 2% or 3%... it's going to do more harm than good to the overall health of bitcoin.

I would start a company of some sorts that sells product or offers service for BTC. We need more options within the BTC community to help it continue to grow.
For instance, maybe getting a bunch of artists and craftspeople from sites such as Etsy and starting up a small online site that only deals in BTC.
Or take time to talk to some local food stores in your area and see if you can setup a way for these stores to accept BTC for their food product. I've been thinking of a way to do this in LA where we have a lot of small food stores (Rainbow Acres anyone!) and seeing if they'd be willing to start accepting BTC. As a service, my thoughts are to help them manage and run the merchant services.
I'm simply throwing ideas out there, but my overall mindset is focused on how to expand the community and make it easier for people to live on BTC without the need to dabble in fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:30:13
Perhaps it's a matter of responsibility...
When money is in the bank, people tend to feel it's the responsibility of the bank to provide security. The safety factor lies in the feeling that 'they' are taking care of things.
With bitcoin, that safety net is removed. There is infinitely more potential for wealth, but this additional freedom/potential is tied to greater responsibility. I think many of us are going through similar ordeals. It's manifesting in a variety of forms on an individual level, but simply put, we're all becoming personally responsibility for the security of our wealth. We're ditching the training wheels, foam pads and cutting the restrictive chain at the same time.
I've been spending a lot of time lately studying security, cryptography and re-reading/watching various saved links to get a more solid grasp on everything. Keep reading/studying up and new things will click. Understanding bitcoin fully will likely allow you the peace of mind/security you're looking for and in time, grant that feeling of safety as well.

Sure, if one person did it and kept it all in one account. It'd be easy to put pressure on that individual and try to prevent them from using it. What if they transfer it to 1,000 addresses and then splinter it again 1,000 times?
What I'd do is take a small portion of it and then everyday for maybe 50 or 100 days, post a bunch of private keys online each with 100 or 200 dollars in btc so tons of other people can start spreading it around and pushing it back into the regular btc supply. I'd make it incredibly time consuming and expensive for them to try and recover it.
