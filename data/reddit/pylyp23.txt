At first I laughed at this answer, but then I processed it. Joking or not you are on the right track. If it truly does become a world currency then who knows how many people will one day own an amount.

I agree with you 100%. This is the 5th day at the same level. I think we are in for something though because volatility is increasing therefore volume is increasing and we all know what happens when our volume gets going. I just wish I was super confident in which direction we are going to go. It has been creeping up slightly so I am hoping that people see that, see the volume, and fomo us up to 12k. But I could see it going the opposite way too since the last couple weeks has seemed to lack the strong sentiment and focus from major news outlets. I also watch the stock market and believe that there is a correlation between the market and the crypto world. Confidence is returning after our little stock market dip and if the DOW and S&amp;P have a confident day tomorrow I think that will bleed into the bitcoin world also.

The 14th to the 17th had strong growth but since the 17th we have been almost entirely sideways.

If you are panicking right now just switch your view to the 1 day chart.

For real. It's all sideways. I'll admit though that 15 minute chart makes my heart skip a beat. haha

Why not take the profit, buy back cheaper, help the price go higher, take more profit, rinse, and repeat?

A hacker with the level of skill required to infiltrate an exchange would be better off using the skills to focus on softer targets with more complete sets of identity such as Target, the local DMV, state and federal health and welfare offices, Yahoo etc. These places have much more complete identity profiles and are much easier to infiltrate. exchanges are generally much more aware of the risks associated with an online environment and tend to have much better security practices. if an exchange is targeted the hackers most likely would be looking to steal coin not identities as, like I previously said, it would be much easier to steal many more identities from other, easier targets. If they were to infiltrate an exchange to steal coin and could get your identity along with it I'm sure they would but we would know this is happening due to the fact that our coin will all be gone.  
In general I believe we should all assume that at least a portion of our identity is currently stolen. I recommend creating an account with a site such as credit karma to keep an eye on your credit report and also check your accounts daily or multiple times daily in order to catch weird activity if your identity is being used for criminal purposes. I personally do not believe that giving our information to these exchanges carries any more risk than using a debit card with a pin at a big chain store or using any sales services through places such as Amazon PayPal etc.
