There is need for insults. If you support bernie, you have no understanding of philosophy or econ.

Our banking system isn't capitalist, you idiot. The Federal Reserve, monopoly privilege, etc = Not capitalism.
God, you're an idiot. Bitcoin = capitalism

It's the entire philosophy. He wants big gov, and less freedom
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:04:41
Bernie is pro-regulation and anti-uber.
He stand against us

Bitcoin = freedom, liberty, free markets
Socialism = state mandate, theft of means of production, taxation
Youre dumb and wrong

Not true. There can be private contract enforcers, idiot. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:48:52
Not a rebuttal 
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:32:34
He said the government shouldnt fund it.. That's the libertarian position. There's no constitutional authority for the Gov to fund it. More so, theres no moral authority for forcing people to pay fro something they think is murder.

How's he racist?
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:04:18
Because Bernie is the opposite of liberty. fool.
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:05:34
Is that a joke? Trump is the most anti-libertarian candidate out there. He wants to "close up" certain parts of the internet.
