My understanding is that hash lists are normally implemented with a root hash, which is formed by concatenating the list of hashes and hashing the result? What would be the drawback of this compared to a tree?

Ok I get that, thanks. I guess the actual txns could be deleted in either case right? Just keeping the hashes of the txns. So the space saving only applies to the hashes? How big is a transaction compared to a hash? I would think a txn is a lot bigger, but if it is then surely theres not much additional space saving benefit in deleting hashes?

Sorry, you don't get one of those unless you carry out drone strikes against innocent civilians.

Every developed country I know of has flood insurance for homes.
I have decided, along with the majority of my countrymen that I don't like people who don't buy said insurance. They will have to buy it if they want to stay. Otherwise they are free to leave. I want that to be how our country works, and most of the people here agree. If you disagree, then it's **you** who is trying to force your insane ideas on the rest of us, not the other way around.
Never mind the fact that some homes are not in danger of flooding, no no. EVERYONE MUST BUY INSURANCE!! or else GTFO. Look how righteous and fair I am

Technically you should ask them if they *own* bitcoin.

Exactly, it contributed. So tired of hearing people say "omgz the Cyprus story was bullshit and had nothing to do with the price rise". These people must be seriously high on something. It's as if they think that *not a single person* invested because of Cyprus. I mean, really? Earth to moron?

Sort of. Don't forget that the decimal number system is logarithmic to start with. It's like someone saying "we should have a tally chart instead of quoting things in decimal numbers, cause it looks skewed only having one more digit when its actually 10 times bigger". It's the same thing, the only difference is that you're used to normal (tally) graph scales and not to logarithmic (decimal) graph scales.

forget overrated, it's pure evil bullshit if you ask me. Why should I feel that I owe something to, or feel solidarity with, the people within some arbitrarily defined area on a map? Or to a corrupt self serving government? Why not identify with your town instead, or your state, or your nearest 2 states plus a few hundred square miles outside? 
At least some other forms of groupthink (political or ideological affiliation/ family/ friends) have some sense to them, as you have something *real* in common with those people.

You have that with Electrum already. There's no way you can protect people against *everything*, including forgetting a passphrase. There has to be some sort of key (password) which allows only the legit owner to retrieve the coins after a disaster. No way around this. I don't see how you can really do better than Electrum for what you said.

Really excellent article. I didn't know about Airbnb before this, which is a massive find for me. Thanks OP!
