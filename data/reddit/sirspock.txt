I just "switched" to an Android (running KitKat) after having a few iPhones. Technically I still have the iPhone around too but the SIM has been spending most of the time in the new phone. FYI I started developing an Android app (no, not bitcoin related), so I needed to get a better sense for the day-to-day feel and perform hands on testing.
So far, I am enjoying it, but I could just be tricked by the larger screen, slightly newer hardware over my aging iPhone and the "ohh look, a new toy" effect. Some things in the OS I think I like better, but others (like unpolished details, the cartoonish icons and some UX quirks) still kind of bug me.

I'm not sure if that was sarcastic or not, but since other people might wonder I should probably state that I am in no way affiliated with them. 
They were the first company I thought to look up (based on a bus bench near my place) and it was really nice to see they accepted bitcoin ... especially since bitcoin isn't very popular yet in my neck of the woods, other than at one trendy "chai bar" chain in the city. Soon enough I hope the novelty of being surprised will wear off!

What would be interesting is a hybrid: a "bitcoin-backed" national paper currency. In the way most bills were once backed backed by gold. Once deposited, institutions would keep the balance in actual bitcoin for audit purposes, etc.

From the article:




If it did sell for BTC, I feel like CAD$950,000 going through the [Virtex]( exchange might be hard to liquidate given it only had $10 million in total volume the last 30 days. Then again, they could liquidate through a USD or other CAD-based market.

Hi r/bitcoin! I'm a long time reader/commenter with no excuse to post here before now. Anyway, I jumped online to get some move-out quotes from home cleaning companies tonight and the first one I hit (familiar from their local bus-bench ads) just happened to take bitcoin!
I wasn't expecting/seeking a Bitcoin accepting maid service at all, but they just got some serious consideration as a result of putting that banner up on their site. It is nice to continue seeing bitcoin pop up in such unexpected places :)
edit: I will of course show my support for their choice by paying in XBT if the other logistics work out and they're able to take the job. I'm also curious what online index they might best be "reported" to... since they're not a physical shop but none-the-less local to a few Canadian markets from the look of their website.

Considering you can simply **encrypt** your bitcoin private keys and store them in multiple places around the world means you:
* can still access them, even if your house burns down or is washed away in a flood
* can still access them, even if you relocate across the world
* can still access them, even if you find yourself in the middle of an unexpected national/regional "situation" (note: if the internet is down, it is unlikely the banks and ATMS are open and/or even can know your balance.)
* secure them through obscurity: is the thief going to know what that SD card has on it? Will they even find it hidden within that random book on your shelf/in your attic/in the basement? Even if they do take it, they would still need to crack the password. Or perhaps it is stored printed in a wall safe, encrypted on a QR code. Luckily, if lost, you have a copy in a safety deposit box/ under your grandmother's mattress/ behind a brick somewhere/ in your brain/ in the cloud...
* or, instead of keeping it all in once place, perhaps you only keep 1-10 BTC per wallet, again, distributed and encrypted for safe keeping. If *somehow* one wallet was compromised, the others would not be.
* monitoring: in the event of some failure of the above, watch services can let you know if something moves in your offline coins, allowing you to reconsider your others (allowing you to transfer if needed.)
More specifically, let's say we're conduction a "street transaction".
* I show you the cash, allowing you to check that it is legit, count the amount, etc.
* You hit send from your wallet app to my address
* Within a few seconds I get an alert on my phone saying "you just got bitcoin of X amount!"
* Seeing that, I hand you back the cash.
* The amount of bitcoin the seller is carrying in their "hot" wallet planning to be used to buy some national-currency is just enough for the transaction conducted. If one other party steals the phone at the moment the bitcoin seller unlocks their wallet, they can't steal more than the value that can be stolen back in cash
* To receive of bitcoins, one doesn't even need a fancy smartphone or mobile data. A "wallet watching" service could SMS when it detects a new transaction.
* Services like localbitcoins sit in the middle to prove the BTC exist and facilitate escrow, but hold the coin only for a short time (unlike exchanges.)

Any thoughts from on this (very) valid complaint? I would like to think "this deal must have come together quickly, so obviously they just threw together a placeholder site on a short timeline ... with plans to better utilize it in the future." ... But I am also an optimist.
This domain offers a good opportunity to educate the public using a kick-ass domain in terms of "SEO" potential, while also allowing some hooks / marketing which can benefit Blockchain.info's growing range of services and bring in new users/customers.
I would have no problem saying "Oh ya, just visit bitcoin.com, they offer some great overviews of how the technology works" because it would be so easy for the person on the other end of the conversation to find. (And I'd suggest this fully knowing they'll probably be directed to Blockchain.info to create a web-wallet.)

Sure. Except I wasn't just referring to the private buy/sell scenario:
1) I deposit Bitcoin, advertised at a certain price (or % of the market price.) 
2) Buyer(s) accept(s) my rate, inserts national currency.
3) I get an SMS/email saying my sale is complete.
4) Later, I come by to pick up my national currency from what has sold at that one machine.
This works, with no issue, as described in the article. But if there were a network of 20 of these machines, my first thought was "it would be cool if I could deposit bitcoin at a location in Times Square (NYC) and have somebody in SoHo (NYC) accept the offer and buy them there."
Now this looks like.
1) Owner stocks up cash, Times Square / Another owner stocks up cash, SoHo
2) I deposit bitcoins for private sale in Times Square
3) User in SoHo accepts the asking price (full or partial), puts cash in to the machine, gets my bitcoin. (USD$300)
4) I get an SMS/email saying my sale is complete.
5) I return to Times Square, pick up my cash (as SoHo might be too far away.)
6) The owner of Times Square is now out the (USD$300), has to reload the float sooner to keep her own machine liquid for other bitcoin sales (her market rate, or additional peer-to-peer sales)
7) The owner of SoHo now is sitting on USD$300 which doesn't belong to him, so he needs to deposit/wire an end-of-period reconciliation to either a centralized party or directly to the SoHo owner to balance it out.
Sure, if they were all owned/operated by one organization, pulling from a float could work. But the challenge now becomes reconciling the cash distributed from a deposit at one machine from a sale in another, especially in a owner-operated/franchise/alliance/network scenario. Suddenly we're getting in to the need for bank transfers or fiat deliveries to pay owner-A from a sale made on owner-B's machine.
In my first scenario I arguably did skip the part about the single machine maintaing a float, but it is much easier to do so if it is just your own market-rate sales you are worrying about, without the need to reconcile with other locations.
This is, of course, all doable, but the extra logistics will require higher cuts of the transactions by the operators to make up for the additional complexity and time of it all.

How long are you living on the continent? For me, in a similar situation, I opened a local account and can do instant transfers between my bank which has branches worldwide. $7 CAD fee for this but not so bad if doing a large transfer each month or so, plus a an acceptable rate. Then everything after are just purchased on my Euro based card or cash out of an ATM (of that local account).
I am impressed though if you've found your CC rate to work out to a better rate of than CAD based bank ATM withdrawals. We avoid using out CAD cards as we get dinged too much on it. I heard there were some good US based options but never found a worthwhile option in Canada prior to the move. Even without  an explicit markup or txt fee many cards seem to just rip you off on the rate itself.
Last thought: interchangefinancial.com has kick as rates if doing transfers from your Canadian account to Euros. My partner has used them a few times for larger transfers since her bank is only in Canada.
edit: real last thought, having a local account also makes SEPA transfers to/from Kraken a breeze. Usually 1 business day, sometimes the same day if early enough. I also have Canadian accounts linked on the other end, though their generally higher fees discourage me from making it worthwhile to do "international transfers" this way.

There's wiggle room on that. For example, if you're a still very small regional / niche brand without a lot of brand exposure, go ahead and change it before going big. It'll be your last chance before you're everywhere ... if you succeed.
You can also get away with this if you're huge (and lucky.) Most "successful" logo redesigns though borrow on old elements and either simplify or reimagine the logo in a contemporary and refreshed way.
Keep in mind for the average consumer that they still haven't seen a "Bitcoin accepted here" sign on an actual storefront and most articles/TV reports they've been exposed to use a pile of coins or some other silly stock imagery when discussing the technology, not the actual logo.
For fun I just ran "Bitcoin" through Google image search. While the orange circle/slanted B with grey words is the most common, there is a lot of creative license taken, colour variation and still way too many of those physical coins.
I'd say he new symbol can work if still in an orange circle with a grey-worded "bitcoin" beside it, perhaps utilizing a slightly different typeface. Not a revolutionary change, but instead an evolutionary one.
(FYI no preference on the symbol used. See pros and cons to both.)

I'll +1 Kraken (I am also in France.)
A quick SEPA transfer from your bank makes it easy to transfer money in and about a business day later you can buy coins at the current market rate. On the deposit Euros page Kraken is pretty clear on their bank account details to enter on your online banking. They also provide a personal reference number you include in the SEPA transfer comments in order to help link it with your account. One you see the balance, you can proceed to buy either X number of bitcoin (say 0.15 BTC), or generally easier, Y Euro's worth of bitcoin (50€)
Once you have a bitcoin balance on Kraken move it sooner than later to a wallet you own and trust. Unless you're planning to purchase hundreds or thousands of €'s worth of bitcoin to start, I'd suggest just registering for a simple web wallet (blockchain.info), a desktop application like Electrum, or even Mycelcium if you have an Android.
My suggestion: initially transfer an amount you're comfortable with, say 20-50€, buy some bitcoin in that amount (or even a proportion of that amount) then transfer that to your new wallet address. Heck, setup a few wallets, and send some bitcoin between them, feeling free to "consolidate" the balance back at the end. This is a good way to learn, and, just like keeping hard-cash in your physical wallet, it isn't an amount that would be crushed to lose if you left your wallet on the counter at a shop.
If you're in Paris direct message me if you'd like some in-person help. I could even sell you some "pocket change" at the market price. There's also a, just opened, "House of Bitcoin" -  - in the city where they have an ATM to buy from as well.
The security, backup and long-term storage stuff become more important to learn the longer you plan to hold bitcoin and the higher the value you store. But in realty, to learn, don't over think it. If you understand tech be sure to turn on some good security options in the wallet you chose (two-factor authentication, requiring PIN-to-spend/unlock, etc.) and just have some fun experimenting.
Hope this helps!
Editing to add this: I've also sold bitcoin through Kraken a few times to free up some Euros. It is just as easy and I usually have had the transfer arrive in my French account within a business day, sometimes even on the same day.

I should note that for me the promise of leveraging the technology for other ownership proof and transfers is pretty cool too. There's a lot of potential for the technology to change the world we live in and make a lot of things more convenient, while also making them self-sufficient and difficult to influence.
Here's a recent tale of the convoluted steps I had to complete recently to authorize a bank payment for a company while traveling:
I had to fax (via voip) documents that I had printed and signed (read: loaded the PDF in my iPad -- after putting it in Dropbox to actually get it there -- then use a drawing app to fill it out and sign with what looked like ink) AND "attach" a void cheque (read: scanned with camera phone, overlayed on top of one of the fake-print) -- then return to Dropbox so I could use the voip faxing web portal. To make it worse, they originally sent me the wrong form, so I had to do some of this twice.
Still seemed faster than finding somewhere to print and then scan it.
Anyway: a quick direct bitcoin payment would gave be great, there would be no need for me to sign half of what needed to be signed, and I could use some crypto "magic" to sign a simple text message to verify anything else they might need. Much less admin overhead for them and for me.

I had way several places to spend BTC in person in my moderately sized home city in Canada before moving to one of the largest urban areas (population wise) in Europe.
Here: I can order delivery from a ton of restaurants (takeaway.com) but not really buy anything in person -- there is one restaurant and bar, but neither is all that close to me. No ATMs.
There: a number of local shops/cafes were already taking bitcoin and the city has multiple ATMs. Previous to that there were places to buy in person, by gift card, etc.
Here: kraken + SEPA is speedy and inexpensive at least
There: VoS or Cavirtex, slower more expensive transfers, higher fees.
In my head an urban centre with 10x more people should at least be showing 5-10x more opportunities to use bitcoin, but alas, I've only used it for one food delivery since the move.

For convenient pocket change I use the Mycelcium app on Android. I also use Electrum (on my OS X laptop), with a wallet stored within an encrypted disk image locally (via [truecrypt]( ... for longer holds on larger amounts. I've never bothered with a paper wallet, but I feel otherwise secure with my processes (for the amounts of BTC that I've kept on one wallet at any one time.)
I've also have web wallets accounts with blockchain.info, coinkite, etc.
There is no need to maintain a balance. My blockchain.info wallet, for example, has a 0 balance right now. My coinkite one probably has a balance of 0.0002 (200 bits) or something fairly low like that (left over from a purchase perhaps.)
My Electrum and Mycelcium wallets balances have all hit zero (or so) as I've shuffled things around. At that point I have two options: start fresh, with a new "seed" (collection of wallet addresses) or re-use the existing for convenience. I've usually opted for the later since Electrum uses new addresses all of the time anyway to keep your history more obscure. (Mycelcium always uses the same addresses, but I am okay with that, since it is for mostly for buying little things.)
TL;DR if you're balance hits zero, you can throw the wallet away. For paper wallets people often do this after "sweeping them" to spend some, sending the change to a new, un-spent paper wallet address after. I sometimes don't, because I don't really want to go through the secure backup/seed creation processes again for a hot waller.

SEPA transfers are amazing (having moved from North America where banking is slow and expensive.) However ... it might be a stretch to call them "borders" in this sense, seeing as the EU is a region of free flowing people and goods.

An update: they were very prompt to call this morning to followup my contact form inquiry. I ended up booking with them but got put on hold for 5 minutes at the end after asking if I could pay the required deposit in bitcoin, hehe :)
In the end, I just gave a credit card deposit and was promised to be contacted by a manager later to discuss paying the balance with bitcoin. 
Between this and my usual "chai tea" place which takes bitcoin, I've had a few minor hiccups now due to staff being unfamiliar. In these cases I am patient and understanding, but I could see somebody less familiar with the infancy of the ecosystem to be frustrated if making one of their first purchases. Hopefully those hiccups are smoothed out over time (perhaps with an emphasis on better training or just simple wide exposure.)

Heads up: this article isn't directly related to Bitcoin, but I think it is important to discuss real opportunities for the use of the currency to reduce costs of money transfer over time. Obviously remittance fees aren't a new topic here, but this article does try to put a number to it.




Edit: the important thing here, for me, isn't that it in any way increases/decreases the market price of Bitcoin, or whether or not it opens the opportunity for new business, but the fact that a measurable amount of money could be injected in the African economy to improve the quality of life for many people (that is otherwise lost to fees.)

I technically didn't even disagree, I just pointed out a fallacy in the (common around here) argument that it is somehow wrong to reuse a currency symbol. Personally, I don't have a strong preference either way, but I am enjoying the discussion around it.
For the record I think it is 100% okay you simply don't like it as a personal preference, or don't want the community to compromise on a symbol just because it conveniently already available to hijack.

Really a 0.2% fee after transferring an the exchange for free via SEPA in order to perform a currency exchange. Like to see a bank beat that on a foreign currency conversion. Their rates are sometimes 2 or 3%! Keep in mind these little ATMs are more like currency kiosks you'd see in an airport. Their rate is like 5% off the market.
Remember negligible fees only ever applied to transactions happening within a bitcoin economy. The on and off ramps will have fees, just like buying euros for dollars. If I am staying in the Eurozone my cash transactions also have no overhead... But if I travel suddenly everything I am sending came at a cost to convert first.

Chrome plugins like this often inject javascript in to the page you're viewing to be able to enhance them. I assume that's the case here, as it needs to parse the page's DOM to look for bitcoin addresses. What's stopping it from [keylogging]( your blockchain.info or other web wallet, [etc](

The frustrations of this "everyday user" suggests that the bitcoin community (and really, the businesses building off the currency) could perhaps gain with some good content (read: SEO) targeted at the bitcoin-curious out there.
"How to use bitcoin" resources could perhaps be organized wizard like:
I would like to... [BUY] / [SPEND] some bitcoin -&gt; [BUY]: What country are you in? - &gt; [..Canada..] -&gt; 
- Buy with Interac Online
- Buy through an Exchange (i: what is an exchange?)
- Purchase a gift card
- Buy at an ATM
- Buy through a private sale
- Buy through a retail location
(This list could include pros/cons of each, with additional instructions for each step with links to vendors)
-&gt; [After selecting] -&gt; Do you need a wallet? ... etc.
Obviously top questions should be covered, such as to this article's author query of "How to redeem a Bitcoin wallet."
The comments below the article were also an interesting read. 90% of them are from bitcoin-skeptics who seem to have a bad impression of the currency (which fits the general tone of the author's complaints.)
Until a) 3rd party solutions start abstracting the bitcoins away (Neo &amp; Bee style, Coinkite cards) or b) the ecosystem becomes much easier to onboard with, these complaints and user frustrations will continue to pop up.

My first thought was: "So, basically what we need is to have a network of ATMs talking to eachother regionwide/worldwide allowing a decentralized exchange" until I realized the money actually needs to be physically there for the seller to receive it.
That said, it could be interesting for them to still talk/broadcast to help share metrics on volume and regional market prices (bids/asks/close.)
The machine acting as an escrow is an interesting idea though... but I wonder why somebody would go with the rate of a private seller over the ATM rate, unless they undercut the ATMs market-markup.

I was mostly pointing out that the be-your-own-bank scenario is doable with far less risk than money-under-a-mattress, which was one of the original complaints. Realistically a safe or deposit box with one or multiple SD cards isn't much different than keeping other valuables that way. One big difference is that you have other copies to that same store of value that you can access elsewhere in the world. Nobody said the keys around the private key had to be complex or difficult to remember. Perhaps the keys in your safe has no password, for convenience, but the ones off-site do.
Other options: multiple signatures. My lawyer has one (or part of one), which can only be disclosed/accesses if I die or have brain injury; those who I trust also have parts of a key. Only when combined can the wallet be spent without me. At any point I personally have 2-key access to spend those wallets, but those act as a failsafe.
But I do agree that banks can fill a role still. Nothing says a bank balance can't be backed by bitcoin vs euros or dollars. To each their own in the bitcoin economy.
Re: scams, this can happen with many things. Selling items on craigslist, swapping USD for Pounds, etc. Escrow on the BTC can easily bypass the risk of double spend, and actually also the need to use a hot wallet on either end. As for the mugging, be smart, meet somewhere where you're unlikely to get mugged -- not a dark alley. A busy mall with an deposit ATM in it seems like a really safe choice. Have a friend there. Know your local currency's security features. Etc. Just like anything else.

Low volume = less liquidity? Complexity in moving fiat in and out? Sometimes also fee differences alone lead to fairly predictable price differences between markets. Once you calculate for those, you see that two markets may be closer in net price than they appear off the order books.

There are options. An escrow service, or a multi-party signature scheme, where the 3rd party (escrow service) could arbitrate in the event of an issue.
- I land in the airport and walk in to car rental agency.
- Using some user-friendly* mechanism, a new wallet/address is generated which requires 2 of 3 to spend: a key I control from my phone, a key the agency controls in their sfotware and a key which the 3rd party service provides.
- I send money (the preauth) from my wallet to this new address and shortly after signing off on everything else, drive away.
- Upon returning the car here or to another franchise, they review the car, and we both "sign" a transaction to return the deposit back to me. Or, perhaps there's a 24 hour buffer, but I can still provide my signature now on a transaction primed to return the amount back to me tomorrow, once the rental agency to signs too.
- If they discover a dispute before that time, they don't sign and either we resolve it or it gets arbitrated.
Say if 70mBTC of the 300mBTC needs to go to cleaning the burgers I've left in the glovebox (which is noticed before they've signed, but after I left) they might sign a competing transaction with outputs of **70mBTC -&gt; them** and **230-&gt;me.** This later gets signed by me, because I am honest and feel embarrassed/proud about the burgers, or the arbitrators after 10/15/30 days if I've failed to respond to the complaint.
Other schemes which are out there, such as those which involve "time locked" transactions, might also play a role in a preauth-like scenario.
Another possibility is the car company requires the use of a "trusted" hosted wallet provider which provides a fund locking service similar to a preauth. Now, even if that isn't my day-to-day wallet of choice, I could (hopefully) still sign up easy enough and move over enough bitcoin to cover the amount needed. Note: this trusted wallet option doesn't really provide a true bitcoin-based solution. Because the company is fully in control of the keys/balances, they are just choosing to block you from spending an amount if it is in a preauth state. This mans they could also block your access for other reasons, or experience a massive service outage, be exposed to a theft, etc.

Welcome to the community! I am also in Paris but have found few ways to spend it here so far. There are only a few restaurants and bars (see the other posts linking to merchant maps.) I've personally used [pizza.fr]( a few times to order sushi and italian food for delivery.
Other than cashing them out for Euro (Kraken.com SEPA transfers go through to your bank account in 1-2 days), you could also use them on an online retailer like  or  - Note. I've never tried either of those two retailers, but they've been reviewed well enough here.
Some other services let you buy "anything" from almost any online site, such as all4btc.com. I also can't vouch for them, and they have mixed reviews.
There's also a France-specific Reddit for Bitcoin @ 
Oh, another way to cash them out would be to use localbitcoins.com or meet up with an interested buyer. bitcoinaverage.com/markets.htm is a great way to see the current market rate. If you're not a starving student, you could always hold on to them for a while if you think the value will go up over time. I think they've peaked as high as 800 Euro/bitcoin in the past.
Keep an eye open here for some other tips on keeping your bitcoin secure. Web or phone based wallets can have some risks. For example, if you lost your phone, you might lose the bitcoin unless you had a backup somewhere.
I hope this helps!
P.S. Don't be discouraged if there aren't many local options yet. Bitcoin is still quite young after all.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:23:36
I am really curious what market exchange-rate they're using. (It would be nice if  had a little more information in general.) The base rate they use could potentially add a lot of cost on top of the $5.50 card premium.
For example of another low-quality purchase option in Canada: QuickBT.com has a 6% markup on the bitstampUSD rate, once converted to CAD. As of now-ish: 0.0516 costs about CAD$50 right now on that service, which works out to CAD$968.20/bitcoin (US$886.14/bitcoin.)  This works out to about CAD$1014/bitcoin (US$928/bitcoin) when using Cointap cards.
Now that seems like a lot, and it is if I am buying 1 bitcoin. But to buy 0.05 in general, the cost of these two options would be CAD$48.40 versus CAD$50.70, which a small-volume (curious) consumer is unlikely to blink at right now. (For comparison, CAD$49.82/0.05 is the going rate at the localbitcoin rate as of time of writing.)
One thing to remember is low-volume purchases tend to "cost" this much if you were going through an exchange, assuming deposit/withdraw/trade fees on a purchase this small. Of course, the more you are planning to convert, the fix costs of getting money in or out don't really factor in and you start to save elsewhere.

Haha, I've never noticed "Release the Kraken." That is a bit weird.
In my case, after doing a lot of reading here (and some other sources) I found a very high proportion of positive reviews. So I decided I trusted the Kraken team enough to proceed. They've also jumped in since to [prove their reserves by audit]( which is nice.
In general with most services, my motto is transfer-in what you need, do the buy/sell, then get it out back in to your own control.
(You can still get stung by poor timing. I decided to try and do a quick local sale on the weekend using localbitcoins.com -- for the first time -- and then the site went down for a few days days literally an hour before I was going on to get it out after second thoughts.) Then again, I have significantly less trust in LBC than Kraken, so I guess I get what I deserve for ignoring my instincts. At least nothing was lost in the end, as the site is back up, and it really wasn't a huge amount to begin with.
Good luck on your bitcoin journey!

+1 for the ForEx firm route. I've heard good things about  and used   (Canada-specific) which is slightly higher in fees, but for large enough transfers this fee still offers a savings over the exchange rate spread offered elsewhere.
The one things not discussed in this article, which is a bigger factor that the upfront fee, is the actual exchange rate. You can easily lose $100s on a single transfer due to a bad rate (1-5% premium over the current market rates.) You net a larger amount in the end by paying the $15-20 fee on transfers over a few thousand.
(Still playing with bitcoin as an option for my global transfers but have yet to fully try the bank transfer -&gt; exchange (buy) -&gt; exchange (sell) -&gt; foreign bank withdraw flow, which I would expect to take about a week start to end.)

a) today's bitcoin exchange rate is so low -- this doesn't usually stop me from spending, but I do not have that fiat sitting in an exchange ready to recharge a big purchase. Example, ordered sushi last night with bitcoin even at the lower rates, but just recharged most of it shortly after.
