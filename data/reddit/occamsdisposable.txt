Well, I'll try to answer them.  The beauty of a truly free market, however, is that ideas and solutions are not dictated and prescribed by me, but by millions of people competing to find the best way to fill needs.
In a proper (ideal) free market....
1.   Answering your question with questions. 
Why would he:  
A. not be able to start another Bitcoin exchange? Because there are repercussions for the way you conduct business. 
B. even need a security firm? because there are repercussions for the way you conduct business.
2.   Unpopular =/= Criminal, and there are repercussions for the way you conduct business.
This is all according to the irrational system we've set up in the preceding comments, of course.  Assuming no market forces brought to bear on solving the prevention of fraud, or protection of depositors.  This is just a cut and paste from the world we know today into some imaginary cartoon where the only option is to hire yourself a strike force because people can't think outside the box.


Well, has anyone gotten their money back?  Again, I didn't claim this strawman adventure into hyperbole to be what would *actually* result from a free market.  But if this scenario involves you getting your money back and the current system does not, doesn't that make the current system inferior?

Ya that's one method.  It's a rather narrow-minded caricature, but it's an option you don't have right now.  
Let's play this hyperbolic game, though.  Let's suppose that truly *is* the only option.  First you are assuming that he is able to hire guards.  This would mean his "guards" don't ever plan to work for a proper security firm the rest of their *entire* careers.  So, that begs the question:  How exorbitant are the fees for properly trained guards he wishes to hire?  These guards need to weigh the very real risk of injury or death combined with career suicide against the salary they charge.  I find it likely that he would need to hire these guards as independent contractors, rather than through a security firm.  I imagine securing insurance -as a firm- for your personnel while being known to protect Mark Karpales would be a bit difficult.  So, assuming any guards he has are independents, and assuming they value money over many other things, how hard would it be to buy one or two of them off to wrench the works?

[New banks need very large investments at start-up.](
I don't see how this makes the barrier the same for an exchange startup.

The reporter labeled this old, eccentric man as a multimillionaire.  She posted his picture online and said "this guy is sitting on a 400 million dollar fortune in a currency that isn't exactly impossible to steal/extort from him, and oh by the way, here's what he looks like, and here's his home address."  She has said in follow up interviews that she writes about wealthy, investor types and their addresses are made public.  The difference is, they live within security that their wealth affords them (gated communities; possibly security guards.)  **IF** Dorian **IS** Satoshi (which I don't believe) the extent of the security he was living under was his anonymity.  What I find more likely, is that this old dude is NOT Satoshi, but now there will be idiots who think he is, and we now have a situation comparable to [**Spike Lee and his Zimmerman bullshit.**](  If that doesn't seem wrong to you, then there is no way to convince you.

Flipside of that problem: every unit of currency the indebted earns is more valuable as well.  The equation cancels.  In a sense, with steady deflation,  you could offer loans with no interest.

You can pay to have anyone murdered right now.  The original statement was conjecture on *Mark's* frame of mind.  No one said you get to murder him.  You would have a plethora of avenues to pursue to get your money back as opposed to waiting for a court to decide which "investors" or "shareholders" get to keep it.  Mark would not have the legal protection of being "incorporated" and his personal assets would possibly be forfeit.

I think the problem here is the method of advertising used.  It's easier for a "content creator" to bemoan their lack of revenue, than to find an advertising solution that works better.  Nothing stops a blogger from soliciting advertisers on their own.  I wish to all hell I could remember the name of this blog, but there is a guy that blogs about Apple products and tech.  He runs one ad a week (or maybe one a month..can't remember.)  He types the advertisement out in blog form and it stays there with the other plain text.    
Edit:  [Found it]( apparently he has gone with an ad company called The Deck, but I don't remember him using an ad service at all a couple years ago.

Name it the "Dorian Nakamoto Legal Fund."  It will send the proper message.

You mean how would small, solvency/audit-transparent Bitcoin exchanges compete with MtGox?

Why does your username solely refer to men?  Are you a misandrist?
 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:16:50
So does this mean you have changed your mind? [or were you just trolling before?](
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:37:23
I believe it's the non-*aggression* principal.  I think it's fair to interpret fraud as aggression through coercion.

Good question.  How do we know they don't?
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:43:13
good point.  I don't know. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:36:41
2:50 "He acknowledged the question, **he acknowledged he understood we were talking about Bitcoin.**"  This would be one of the facts people are looking for.  The initially reported quote fro Dorian *does not* support this assertion.  Nor would the acknowledgement support the conclusion that Dorian was admitting to being "the Satoshi", the sole "founder" of Bitcoin.  Given his career history, it's not at all a stretch to consider he may have been unsure whether a project he had worked on in the past had somehow grown into Bitcoin.

That's cool too, but only 15% voted against.

What about the variable of Karpeles statement being truthful?  He's already lied about a "bug" in Bitcoin protocol causing this.  I say the simplest solution to the equation is to not introduce variables from a liar.    
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:39:51


Apparently not.

The beauty of Libertarianism is that NO ONE can force you to conform to those beliefs.   Every time I've seen Ron Paul address these issues he makes it abundantly clear what his *personal* beliefs are and then makes it clear that it should not be within government's authority anyway.

Why does legality matter?  They still could have screwed themselves.  [Does no one remember this?](
