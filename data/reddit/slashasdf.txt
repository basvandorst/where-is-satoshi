Several wallets will not let you send btc to a bech32 address at this time since they do not recognize it as a valid btc address.
Until more software actually recognizes bech32 addresses as valid it is not a good idea to use it as the default address format in core.

The current mainnet is pretty small, but it should be able to handle a few 1000/tx per second once it grows to a few hundred nodes.
In theory it could scale to millions/tx per second, but we will probably need some optimizations before we get there.

If 1 satoshi = 1 dollar then the market cap of Bitcoin @ 21 million coins would be: 2,100,000,000,000,000 or 2,1 quintillion dollars.
High estimates for the total value of all assets in the world are currently around 1,2 quadrillion dollars which would mean bitcoin is worth *at least* around 1750 times as much as everything else combined in the entire world.
So I wouldn't really worry about it any decade soon.

There is no restriction on which coin can use LN, all that is required is to build an implementation that is compatible with the LN protocol.
Currently Litecoin and Vertcoin are most advanced in development and will probably launch LN clients soon after Bitcoin. This would also open the door to atomic swap between BTC and these chains btw.
Monero also seems to be working on LN, but I cannot find too much information about it.
Altcoins don't even know what is about to hit them lol.

Maybe, but you can't move the coins from the old SHA-256 private keys if those private keys are lost... so only new private keys would use this new encryption.
This means that if in the future SHA-256 can be cracked then those coins can be recovered, regardless of which new encryption we are using.

You actually do pay capital gains tax in the Netherlands, but it is not really comparable to the US.
- The government doesn't tax *actual* gains you make, instead it assumes a so called "fictional yield" on your investments at rates of 2,87% to 5,39% yield annually (depending on total value).
- You pay 30% tax over this fictional yield which means an effective tax of 0,861% to 1.617% annually (over the total value).
- The reason for using fictional gains vs. actual gains is (according to the government) that it is much easier to report and verify.
- The fictional yield is calculated over the value of the applicable assets on the 1st of January for the tax year (1 Jan 2017 for 2017 taxes).
- If you bought the asset after the 1st of January it will not be taxed for that year (since in general you have already paid taxes over this value when it was in your savings account or in stocks).
- You have a tax free bracket of € 25.000 for 2017. This means you only pay capital gains tax on the value of your assets that exceeds this amount: i.e. if you have € 30.000 only € 5.000 is taxed.
- This capital gains tax applies to savings, stocks and crypto and basically all other valuable assets (except real estate in most cases).
- There is no tax for buying/selling. Only the total value itself is taxed.
Above values apply to 2017.
The upside is that if you make insane gains with crypto you are basically paying the same amount of tax as a person who has the same value in a savings account at 0,10% annual interest (who is basically getting fucked by paying at least 8 times their actual gains in taxes, as you can tell people generally do not like this system).
The downside is that you are continually taxed every single year.

Situation B: You invest € 50k in a company and it goes bankrupt, your stock is now worth € 0 in total, BUT you own 5% or more of the company: no capital gains tax + ~~€ 50k~~ € 12.5k (25%) deductible on your income tax.

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:38:41
Well technically there is no such thing as a "LTC LN" or "BTC LN".
The LN is a protocol that is compatible with LTC, BTC and Vertcoin (probably others too, I think XBY maybe?) and is explicitly set up to allow inter chain operability such as atomic swaps and sharing resources/capacity (BTC to BTC tx can use an LTC node).
Eventually I suppose the ideal will be where we will have a giant Lightning Network spanning dozens of coins.

No its not, he is an EU citizen in the UK currently.
He could for example move to the Netherlands before end of year and transfer his funds to a Dutch bankaccount. Since cryptocurrencies are seen as a form of a savings account there it does not matter if he transfers them to fiat or keeps it as cryptocurrency, he will simply have to pay a tax over its value on the 31st of december of the tax year. For 4 million cash or crypto it would be around € 61k in taxes only.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:32:45

It is possible, but it highly depends on where you currently live and pay your taxes.
I would really recommend contacting an international tax attorney or advisory company in your country to help with figuring this out.
I can really only give you facts on how the taxes will work once you manage to transfer your assets to the Netherlands and are obliged to pay your taxes there.
About the €61k:
In the Netherlands you are not taxed for converting between crypto/cash, but you are taxed for holding them.
This is because instead of paying capital gains tax on actual returns you pay capital gains over a "fictive annual yield".
Basically the government assumes you will get a certain % return based on the total value of your liquid assets (crypto, stocks, cash, gold etc).
To establish this value you basically add up the market value of all your liquid assets on 1-1 of the tax year.
*(this is assuming a value of € 4 million on 1-1-2018):*
For a value of € 4 million the fictive return is around 5,1% annually. This means you must pay 30% tax over 5,1%, which is an effective 1,54% of the total: around € 61k taxes in 2018.

@_date: 2017-08-27 19:21:12
There is no time requirement afaik, but the steps needed will probably not be fast:
1. Move to the the Netherlands and register as a resident (this is important), this will give you a BSN (personal number) which is needed to open a bank account and complete step 3.
2. Make sure you are not also registered anymore as a resident of the UK (this could cause problems when doing taxes).
3. Get a permanent residency permit, this will allow you to live in the Netherlands for as long as you'd like and will qualify you for taxation in the Netherlands as a resident (basically the same as a citizen). As a EU citizen you will automatically qualify for the permit (maybe brexit will cause some trouble in the future however).
4. Open a Dutch bank account and transfer the funds there.
5. Now your funds will be subject to the same tax rules as Dutch citizens.
Possible issues:
- You need to find a way to get the funds to the Netherlands without being also taxed in the UK. Possibly transferring the funds as crypto is an option.
- You are transferring a lot of money, so make sure the bank you are transferring to knows about it before hand and make sure it is OK.
Some notes:
- There is no capital gains tax for converting crypto to euro's. It is all seen as a form of liquid assets. Stocks and gold assets also fall in to this category.
- You pay capital gains tax on a "fictional return" over the full value of your liquid assets. For 2017 that fictional return would result in a tax % of 1,54% over the total sum of all your crypto and cash. This is an annual tax.
- The value that is used to determine the tax is the value on the 1st of January for that tax year.
- EDIT: Due to the way the crypto assets are classified, you are also required to state the value of your cryptocurrencies (on 1-1) when doing taxes. If you don't and later declare a lot of money that can cause issues.
If you are doing something like this you should consult the tax treaties between the Netherlands and the UK (1980 and 2008 versions).
If it is a lot of money it might make things a lot easier to simply get an international tax attorney.
EDIT: clarification on capital gains.

Google does actually automatically disable ads where the domainname and tld do not match the landing domainname and tld. However this check does not seem to be instant and can take a few hours.
Not sure why the check is not done before actually displaying the ad... but then again Adwords has become increasingly slower with processing data this past year (sometimes clicks take like 48h to register in the statistics).
Not excusing Google, just explaining a possible cause.

Yeah this is why I don't think Satoshi will ever touch the BTC in those early addresses.
He apparently wanted to remain anonymous at all costs (or at least not be linked to his Satoshi persona).
I think that Satoshi is still holding and using BTC, but just in addresses that are not linked to these early coins.

That is the whole point.
If you don't want blocks bigger than 1MB your client can ignore the segwit data and the block will not be bigger than 1MB, but if you do the block can be bigger when containing segwit data.

Yeah it doesn't really mean anything.
The domain was actually registered in 2001 according to domaintools.com's whois history.
The reason it shows 2008-10-25 as the creation date is because the registration had expired before and this is the date it was re-registered.

But segwit is not enforced, non-segwit blocks are allowed.
If you deny these blocks your node's blockchain will break really fast. After it breaks you will not process any new segwit blocks, because the chain is broken.

All coins before the split will be on both chains.

The war on decimals has gone too far...
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:50:24
It is very simple:
- The miners who follow the majority of users will benefit, the rest will most likely die off.
- If the drop in miners is big enough the nodes will start to mine themselves when it becomes cost effective after a significant difficulty drop.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:18:02
That is not how this works.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:43:25
The miners are only relevant if they continue to mine.
If the majority of large pools will stop to mine it will simply enable most of the nodes to mine for themselves again.
The miners think they have so much power, but they hold only power when they agree with the majority of holders of bitcoin.

The malware is not that sophisticated in the first place. The people behind it just got lucky due to the leaks of the exploit and managed to implement it in their malware.
I really doubt they would have expected anywhere near a spread of their malware like this.
So, I too sincerely doubt they will actually provide any keys to unlock the data. Not as much because they are so evil, but more because it would be a serious risk due to half the world trying to find out who they are.

@_date: 2017-05-18 18:21:29
You do realize that the chances that 100% of the miners will produce segwit blocks immediately is pretty much 0?
So your node's blockchain will break at the first non-segwit block and will no longer be part of the network.
What would be the point of that?

No, I did not mean that. Of course a user should be able to sell their data if they so please and that is perfectly legal (provided it is communicated to the user and consent is given).
The point of the law is to enable users to request deletion of their data in cases where you close your account and stop using the service (like deleting a Facebook account) or when consent was never given.

I've read a while ago that a SEPA transfer from France to Germany can sometimes take like 5 workdays... not sure why though.
Since the 15th of June it has been 6 workdays so far, so I would not be too worried yet. However it is still really long for a SEPA transfer in general (across Europe 1-3 workdays is normal).
