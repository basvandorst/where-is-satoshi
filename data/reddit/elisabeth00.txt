you don't know shit!!!

**That is Bullshit!**
Is just 1 or max 3 people trying to laundry money, nothing else. look at the speed of the transactions and the small orders on any exchange and you see that is way too shallow and slow.  
If is not people laundry money is just some exchange cooking the order book.
**Don't buy this story!!**

We could easily ask that guy bought BTC this year , and ask him what he thinks about after loose 40% 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:22:23
Truly deserve my BTCs
@_date: 2014-09-29 04:11:49
It actually easy to understand.
Why a normal user would use Bitcoin? If he can buy anything faster, simpler, with creditcard?
OK, we know how good is bitcoin over credit card. But all this good thing about bitcoins over credicard does it really matter for a normal user? We assume  that it does matter , but actually isn't.
The Bitcoin as a form of payment (not a coin), it is in fact a great form of payment comparing to credit cart. Cheap, easy to implement, no forms, and plus anyone in the world can use without restrictions or banks.
But while in one hand , the business, have a reason and incentive to implement bitcoin, the other part, the user, don't have any incentive. If I may add, to get bitcoin is: Complicated, difficult to get, difficult to use, risk to have. And a above the price is very unpredictable even though the price seems to stable at some period of time.
Change peoples habits and principle change people habits with money takes lots of time. 
It is worth check how many people own money credit card in US and UK. And then u gonna have an idea why people don't use bitcoins

@_date: 2014-09-27 00:32:07
deflationary currency in theory. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 17:32:08

@_date: 2014-03-21 02:43:59
It so kool to see the community helping someone. That is one of the greatest thing bitcoins can do. No barriers m no borders, no bureaucracy.

**There is no controversy thanks to blockchain!!**
He forgot to say that that the scammer leandro Marciano was his partner for almost a year. And he never bother to help the users to resolve this problem. Even thou the Fraude happens in the same place where the is proud to say that he is the Mercado Bitcoin CEO.
* Mercado Bitcoin isn't the biggest exchange in Brasil ANY MORE
* Mercado Bitcoin isn't support by the Brazilian community . He is the most dislikable Bitcoin member in our community 
* Rodrigo Batista is the worse person to talk about bitcoin He stutter and he isn't sure about the subject he claims to be a expert 
What sort of person that had been involved with the brazilian Pirateat40 for nearly a year after the fraude was done. And never bother to help the community get this thief to justice. 
mercado Bitcoin hold all the logs of the scam fraude and he always refused to helo the people that lost their money.
**DONT USE MERCADO BITCOIN. BECAUSE SOONER OR LATTER THE FRAUDE WILL BE UNDER THE EYES OF THE JUSTICE. AND ALL YOU ASSETS WILL BE FROZEN TILL THIS PROBLEM IS RESOLVED**
@_date: 2015-05-12 03:48:49
well we have seen him for a long time. But we know that he has been log on to Bitcointalk.

Lets called Bitcoin inequality
@_date: 2015-08-07 15:23:26
10 k during a period of a month is nothing!!! There is nothing to celebrate.
 Volume is only come from a hand full of people . 
The Brazilian market is still very small and far from any big markets like China or US

@_date: 2015-08-07 15:33:39
you have to look at this numbers better.
Have lots of exchanges isn't necessary because there is only 1 that actual;y works all others are tiny players like kids open exchanges.
10k members does not mean nothing 
in Aracaju they only have a bumper stickers

**Stop smoking pot Kiddo** 
**I give some Lenmon song for dream a bit** 
*Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one*
