In their Support website they're saying when you connect your wallet and go to the recovery page you should click on the "recovery button" before entering seeds but there's no such button

Removing someone's post over and over is dictatorship/censorship! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:21:12
Since when one person determine something is crap or not?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:02:51
lol glad I could help:)
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:43:09
If high trans fees hinder any growth of economic activities through btc  and on the other hand Wall st. start gambling big on it the. Yes!
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:13:25
Who's doing this? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:29:01
Btw do you work for bitfinix? Wonder how many of you are here!
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:12:44
It's the network not the exchange issue!
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:33:24
Then you probably didn't read other people's comments...you can't post something without mentioning "crp" or "shit" which shows you're brainwashed
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:32:26
Thought Ver is a good guy (at least from the documentary)!
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:27:40
Well, if you pretend you're stupid then good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:34:28
That's why you remove other people's posts ?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:37:41
Removing people's post because they just express their opinion is an outright red flag! Even if btc goes to 1MM
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:23:24
I'm not trying to  defend him but are you saying there's no way Bitcoin is a bubble? We don't know, he's just saying don't put all your eggs in one basket...
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:10:15
Why do I have to address moderation when you can't  tolerate different opinions? You're the same if not worse than current system. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:21:05
That's what I thought but after wiping out it didn't show up!!
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:49:15
Hey moon!

How many credit card offers do you guys get every week? I get a bunch every time! 
Let say someone unwisely use these credit cards to buy Bitcoin and since they usually have 15 months of 0 APR they carry the balance until very end. At the end if he receives another CC offer w 0 APR and balance transfer he applies for the 2nd CC and transfer his balance from his first CC to the 2nd CC so he can extend his 0 APR for another 15 month.
Now if they increase the interest rate, consequently banks who issue these cards also tighten their CC offers or shorten the 0 APR period, and as a result the guy above doesn't receive his 2nd CC and therefore he has to pay the balance on his first CC. If he has a job and had planned to pay the balance regularly he may be fine. But if not he is forced to sell his asset (cryptos) to pay for CC. If number of these people are large enough, holistically it crashes the market if rate rises.
Am I getting it right?

Not everything against your opinion is spam! 
You're in the wrong business here, dictator!
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:31:46
Why do you think a week?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:51:57
Describe to me how it goes to the moon if high transaction fees prevent the growth of economic activities? Then what would be the difference between stocks that you can't move them around and Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:29:49
You're 100% correct...we will definitely have a 30% correction.
I really don't like people here who promote all time high...I feel disgusted when people talking about "to the moon"
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:03:07
It's not investing it's defrauding everyone else for your own benefits! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:48:09
In the future please refrain from removing my post in the first place! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:07:09
I hope it's temporary &amp; doesn't get centralized like everything else!
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:44:28
It's your problem that you can't think critically...you only learned one thing: moon!
And yes I own Bitcoin (prob more than you)
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:39:34
There are 1000 other cryptos out there why does it have to have Bitcoin name attach to it? We can just use btc as store of value or digital gold 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:46:15
What about those who bought Bitcoin on margin and now they want to cash out?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:35:54
Good luck with your shady forum!
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:38:22
How about start with small dreams and work your way up!
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:32:50
Yup I meant 2010 adopters! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:50:06
This seems like a planned operation...I've seen other exchanges to create a Bcash wallet few days after fork and depositing people's money!
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:23:57
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:05:36
Not sure what you mean "create that situation"!
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:17:25
Even though he's a gold silver dealer I think he was very unbiased...saying Bitcoin reaches 50000 and accompanying it by saying that it could be a bubble it's not a FUD. Everybody needs to think for themselves and make a right decision 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:13:34
When it happens how much can you buy with $1Mn?!
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:16:54
But I can't still send 1 bit cause the fees exceed the amount I want to transfer!
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:00:51
PIVX ?
