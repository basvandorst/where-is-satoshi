Coinbase has been double charging people the last couple days by mistake. I assume this has something to do with it. 
 Banks have also been pulling this shit recently. Santander and Wells Fargo to name a couple. Facebook ban of crypto ads might also point to potential widespread drop in sentiment toward crypto by some very powerful forces. Banks and corps like to be in the know and base a lot of decisions on the general atmosphere of business globally both within their subset of specialties and well beyond them. An example of this would be Amazon over the last two decades or Paypal in the early days of Ebay during the infancy period of public internet.

Absolutely not. There is not a court on earth that would allow questioning to be limited to yes or no answers. There is not a police department on earth that would interrogate you demanding yes or no answers. There has never been a political debate wherein any of the speakers were *ever* required to rebuttle with yes or no.

Maybe. They probably have a huge mountain of dust they are consolidating and selling off into the books to secure the bag. If they run a fractional reserve and the USD reserve is low or depleted now is the time to be scooping up customer USD with dust while tx fees are so low. Even if their crappy system overpays for fees getting rid of massive numbers of dust wallets is probably extremely important.

Bitfinex might be fractional reserve at this point who knows. If they are though this would be a huge opportunity. Coinbase must be delighted as well. 
 Cold storage will swallow the market up and the institutions will have to slowly accumulate OTC to pull this off again. Coinbase has too many people waiting to verify and buy than there are coins available for sale pretty much anywhere you look right now. Speedy on ramps are non existent especially for those looking to buy large amounts (seven figure USD values or more).

That's shitty but they are too busy with tens or hundreds of thousands of other tickets right now.. You might be under the impression that what you beleive to be a large sum should take precedence over smaller claims but that isn't how a ticket system works. The DMV and tax office don't care who you are or how much you are paying or what kind of car you drive. This is no different.   
 
 They very likely have insane numbers of easy to fix tickets or non issues like "where is my bitcoin?" that are taking a long time to get through because the number of noobs entering the market is staggering. The problem is your ticket has probably not even been reviewed by a human being yet. 
 Contrary to popular beleif a larger sum might take even longer to review and solve because it cannot typically be handled by the front line individuals doing initial reviews of claims. The large claims need to be escalated to people with higher authority and handled carefully.

The outsiders trading are few and far between. They're basically gamblers blindly buying whichever coins look like they are primed to pump. A minority of them are aware they are gambling and playing with fire but the majority of these outside bagholders are of the trollbox frequenting variety. Sometimes they even organize into IRC groups to attempt leveraging their combined worth to force a coin up... But the coin creators of most if these shitcoins have exponentially more of said shitcoin and can literally set any price. They keep it realistic though. When they pump they try to make it look organic and attract as many victims as possible before dumping and abandoning the coin.

There were posts earlier today about Coinbase double charging bank accounts for purchases. If I had to guess I'd say they needed to reset their backend accounting system because it was making serious mistakes. If so that's likely what caused them to cancel orders and bank wires.

It doesn't necessarily have to be a lot of tx, especially if they are batching. Since fees are satoshi per byte it could be fewer but larger transactions. Even using legacy methods and overpaying horribly the time to do this would be now.

AFAIK there has been no clarification on the rules of what many consider to be like-kind transactions (trades) between cryptos in the US. Any conversion to goods or services or fiat money is considered taxable but (again, AFAIK) the trading of one crypto for another is still a grey area from what I have read.

Buying enough to manipulate exchanges will become literally impossible one day. As distribution widens and btc leaves exchanges never to return the lowly bits left over will command obscene prices.  
 The coins whales *do* still hold at that point will not be gambled away attempting to gain just a little more. Eventually if the system is successful enough being able to find a place to buy whole btc without pushing the ticker up in a major way will prove difficult if not impossible.

You clearly haven't ever used a customer support ticket system. Have you ever even been inside a gov office or DMV? 
 
 Let me explain it in simpler terms since judging by your writing and syntax you are obviously a lay person, ESL, or slow or a maybe a child. It has to be one of the four..
 
 Nobody gets served until their ticket number comes up. That's why so many people show up posting on r/ bitcoin to attempt getting their problem solved faster. That's why people complain  on twitter.  
OP got lucky and created a significant enough amount of noise with this post and his emails and ticket(s) that they bumped him to the front of the line which is actually counterproductive because now everyone else had to wait through one more ticket when he was not at the front of the line to begin with. He basically cut the line which is unfair and goes against the ideology of a ticket based support system. Good for him though.

That's to track down large scale criminal activity and you know, ensure billions of dollars of drug money or illegal proceeds do not end up being routed through the exchange(s).  
 Seldom do people ever recover stolen funds with fraud or theft. What happens is you are reimbursed by the bank because they have federal and private insurance. They replace your money but the insurance company who payed for it is at a loss. It's an industry standard. 
 With crypto no such resolution exists. If the funds are declared proceeds of crime or stolen a process *may* be opened by the company or federal agency who holds the coins to attempt to allow the victim(s) recovery but they are under no obligation legally nor contractually to honor anything. If the people who the coins were stolen from want to waste their time and money trying to recover them they only have the option to sue. Most all lawsuits against crypto exchanges would likely fail.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:04:06
That's a simple bluff though, OP could have lost his account and had assets frozen if he had 'lied' to open an account. How does this work if he had no idea of the bank's policy to begin with though? Someone that tells him he should have lied isn't thinking clearly..

You also don't see the thousands of other ideas that would or could have replaced those technologies materialize the way shitcoins do though. It's like having alpha max, beta max, delta max and zeta max tape players. Only the beta max existed - and it was a piece if crap. The rest never saw the light of day for good reason. With altcoins the opposite is reality. Any goober with a coding team and $10,000 can come out with one and dozens of new coins come out every day.  
 Bitcoin is more like a format. It's 35mm film. It's the universal standard. While modern digital technology aims to replace it in as many ways and places as possible it's still the most important piece of the puzzle and necessary at the base level. Good luck with trading pairs and exchanges - central and decentral, without bitcoin. Nothing else will ever have the trust, security and true dominance bitcoin has. Nothing else could produce the real world volume bitcoin can. Nothing else has the development team(s) nor the community to support the scale bitcoin has already grown to outside traditional corporate channels operating on centralized fiat money.

You just answered your own question. Low fees mean the millions of wallets full of dust can now consolidate and be spent. I bet it wasn't happening much last year because up until around the third quarter prices were still sub $5k and spam attacks were ongoing. 
 I imagine Coinbase has a mountain of these low value wallets but you add them up and they definitely make more than just dust. 
 
 Just a theory of mine and I am sure others have thought of it but this is the first I am posting about it and I have yet to see anyone else echo the sentiment.

There won't be a premiere blockchain above bitcoin and use cases will continue to change and proliferate as further implementations improve the network. 
 When banks offer services and governments accept crypto to pay tax (maybe even at a discount to the taxpayer) you will see people embrace it in places where banking and digital commerce barely exist if at all. 
 The majority of the world is currently un banked. Similarly the 1% are hiding tens of trillions of dollars off books and ledgers in stagnant hedges like gold and offshore havens.  
 Once bitcoin becomes the defacto digital settlement currency of the world it will plateau and finally begin to lose momentum.  
 You can claim it already has but when looking at year over year historic charts the trend is still explosively upward. The floor discovery seen currently is part of a larger pattern that has repeated several times and seems to have accellerated at the end of 2016.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:00:26
One problem with all that. Tether is obviously based on USD. The Chinese exchanges cannot legally accept wire transfers denominated in USD. Tether was created to replace USD in these exchanges ergo your claim that USD somehow enters a bank account owned by Bitfinex or Tether is false. No USD is wired to the exchange at all. Tether is created out of thin air using colored coins (btc). If there is backing denominated in USD it has to be coming from somewhere.

 Gox turned into a fractional reserve before going bust. Only ~800k bitcoins actually went missing wherein the books showed well over a million bitcoin. We already know why..

They need bitcoin to survive at this point because nobody will inject new money at any meaningful rate if they succeed in killing it or flipping it or w.e they are trying to do. They control bcash to maintain a domain of influence no matter how small because they can no longer influence and control bitcoin.  
 Therefore I beleive the bcash / Roger / miner cartel are over extended and resorting to spam attacks (now over), subversion and shady practices like selling old used antminers that will barely make profit above ROI. They may or may not be pumping bitcoin as well even while simultaneously attacking it. That would explain why fees have dropped yet price is flat and contracting. 
 Another theory I have for the price drop is low fees + high prices = dust consolidation and selling on a massive scale. Maybe miners were spamming to keep this from happening and either ran out of funds to spam with or decided it's potentially easier to allow the dust to settle so to speak before the price actually rebounds on (dust) coins being handed to newer and / or stronger hands.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:45:42

Most of the shit coins have no actual volume and get propped up because literally nobody trades them except their little groups of day 1s. There are coins that only have value because the people who created them pass them back and forth at their target price. The market cap of these coins is false. Let's say I have a few rocks I claim are unique. My friend who is a billionaire buys one rock for $2,000,000. The market cap is now $6,000,000 because there are 3 rocks and he produced the last trade. If nobody ever buys a rock from me after that and my friend hodls his rock it looks like my rocks are / were worth $2,000,000 each. They aren't worth shit though. 
  
 Same principle applies to all the no volume scam coins.

Yeah it was an agreement between miners and exchanges to fork bitcoin onto a separate chain and act as if that was the real bitcoin. Bcash beat them to it though and eventually they called it iff because it would have fucked everything up royally. Now most of the actors involved are either aligned with bcash and Roger Ver or neutral. It was called the New York agreement aka segwit2x and orchestrated in large part by Barry Silbert.

Where will they buy it from? There are only a few thousand coins for sale at most exchanges and the books would force the price up ridiculously if you buy the market out. You also run the risk of the exchange not being solvent so when you go to withdraw it blows up like Gox did.  
 
 If 90% of all BTC is locked up in the hands of people or businesses who do not even use exchanges or trade at all - just hold (like a bank that offers 'bitcoin investments' backed by custodial btc) how will rich people even buy it?  
 It's going to be so scarce that finding large amounts of it to buy at once will prove extremely difficult.

Actually now that I think of it the price was around $8k when I last felt comfortable with it. I had lost some BTC trying to trade alts around Nov 20 and the continued rise made up for the loss in fiat value. When it hit $9k and made front page with the Vegeta meme that's when I think things got out of hand. It hit $10k too fast then mainstream media broke the news and everything went apeshit. I beleive $8k-$9k is the natural price point for that period and $10k should hopefully hold as a floor for right now.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:38:41
I don't doubt they will continue to manipulate and control what's left but the exchanges might end up losing the majority if the actual coins to say - banks who hold customer crypto or individuals themselves who do not trade and seldom check the price. Real hodlers. The exchanges would need to operate a fractional reserve and hope there is never a run on their btc. Probably what is going on with some exchanges even now. 
 Being able to actually acquire whole btc though will one day be virtually impossible if it proliferates to public global reserve status. That is, held by banks, governments and individual investors.

It's hard to predict obviously but I think it will revert to the prices observed post cancellation of the NYA. I don't want to be specific but I don't think it will drop to $5k. Tone Vays said his guesstimate was that it could go as low as $7500 though. 
Who knows, it dropped to $3k levels during the China ban rumors around Sept but that was when the NYA was still a major concern.

It would take a lot of people doing it but if a single large exchange like Coinbase consolidates their dust and sells into the books to gain control of more USD it would hurt the price significantly. If they are fractional reserve on any level there is a case to be made in consolidation and selling *if* the USD reserve is low or depleted.

So they just want your banking info? This will end up as a database of largely useless info for sale. The people responsible are dumb as fuck. Chargebacks and federal insurance protection mean the rats who buy and attempt to use the info are wasting their time and money. Wire fraud is getting near impossible to actually profit from, even if you manage to steal funds you need to withdraw or use them before the person you are stealing from / their bank puts a stop to it. Usually the fraudulent online orders are cancelled before they are even processed and sent out. That's why the human rats who use / buy info databases resort to using mass numbers of agents (people) and have each individual make multiple large orders from fast food joints for delivery. In part to test the card and account numbers but also because even if the fraud detection of the bank recognizes and halts the fraud quickly, fast food is usually made and delivered before the system freezes the account. They have ways of offloading the fast food too beleive it or not.  
 If you ever end up being offered a medium pepperoni from pizza hut by a stranger for $3 it's fraud pizza.

Whether or not core wallets are optimized full and well takes a backseat to the fact that the mempool has been under constant attack by low data high fee spam transactions to drive up miner reward and continue the big block narrative. Now that these attacks have ended (for now) and larger players are beginning to use segwit and transaction batching, the mempool has returned to normal. Fees are low so this has become a non-issue again.  
 1mb should continue to suffice for the time being through mid term. Long term we have thing like sidechains and drivechains, more smart contract protocols (already have RSK) and further second layer and even eventual third layer upgrades. The storm has passed. Keeping fees high will cost insurmountable capital if the method of attack does not evolve to something more advanced than passing a lot of high fee transactions back and forth on miner collusion.

The defenition of average Joe would have to include macroeconomic variables like geographic location and the economic climate of said location over a set period. There are plenty of places seeing a boom unheard of in any asset historically the way bitcoin is rising. Take Venezuela or Zimbabwe for example. When *participation* globally reaches the mania levels seen in those places we might end up reaching a 'top'. Currently the only thing truly mainstream about bitcoin is awareness. The breach into use for the majority still has not materialized. I speak to countless people on a daily basis as I work in the service industry currently and I have never even *met* another person who has owned or used bitcoin. Not one.

Sat bitcoin-less for 3 whole days until I couldn't take it anymore and had to buy back in as a stop loss. It bottoms out then rebounds and runs up on good news. Back then it was the CME news. And we seem to be bottoming out right now just as ICE is announcing they have filed a bitcoin ETF. This could launch us over $20k before Jan 1st.

Second layers and sidechains. This can't be said enough. If bitcoin is becoming too expensive for you to use, don't use it anymore.

If the system gets used to it's full potential the fee for on chain transactions will always be high. Even with huge blocks, if Moore's law allows them to exist without impacting the cost of nodes. There will always be someone else willing to pay a little more than the last highest fee just to get their transaction through faster. That's not always a bad thing as long as the low fee tx can make it through in reasonable time.

By that logic anybody who owns a cellphone, television or computer technically 'owns gold'. They don't actually hold it as an investment..

Satoshi actually referenced the potential *need* for a fee market and knew there would be fee competition. He wrote that in the whitepaper.. Allowing variable fees is part of the damn system.  You are rewarding a miner for mining your transaction in the next block which is guaranteed to be full. On chain transactions were never promised to be cheap forever.

It's the same wallet you are just using it in a different spot.

That depends. There are businesses that offer discounts if you pay with crypto as well as individuals and small non business based merchants who will offer a discount if you pay with bitcoin. And of course anyone using illicit dark net black markets to buy drugs or whatever. There is commerce. I think moreover people are buying as you said to earn profit, but many spend their profit without even cashing it back into fiat.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:24:26
Everything you have said thus far is deflection, why would I humor you by answering your biased question? You clearly don't understand the language in the whitepaper wherein Satoshi himself explicitly warns us that on chain transaction fees will rise to insurmountable levels if and when the system reaches mainstream proliferation. He even speaks of the eventual need for second layers. This is bitcoin 101.. Very basic and easy to understand. 
 
 Let me make an analogy for you since you don't seem to be able to grasp anything outside laymans terms: I am not going to hire a brinks truck to carry $500 of pennies through the streets to a store to buy something. But if I need to deliver a million cash I am definitely paying to have an armored car service deliver it. We are in the wild west of crypto and we don't have any way to deliver BTC without using a stage coach (on chain). Eventually we will be able to wire value around cutting most of the work and cost out of delivering money (second layers and sidechains). If you can't afford to hire a coach or you don't have enough money to justify using one you shouldn't even be considering it.   
 All I am hearing is "fees should be low" when the whitepaper clearly says they *will not*.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:10:01
You're literally re-positing what I said and acting as if you said it first. What do you think "If you can't afford to use bitcoin anymore don't use it." means? It's not some cryptic message or a declaration that anyone should stop using money or crypto in general or whatever the hell it is you are implying it means.  
 
 The message is simple. And in fact many people *can't* use it right now anyway. If you only have $20 worth you literally cannot afford to transact right now. Are you saying they should try anyway?

On chain transactions will always be expensive. In due time second layers and sidechains will make atomic swaps and low to no fee instant transactions the norm. Right now we are in the old west of cryptocurrency and using a stage coach to transport the funds. We still use stage coaches today believe it or not but they say BRINKS on the side. Second layers and sidechains will be our metaphorical credit card companies and online banks. The stage coach is a metaphor for on chain transacting. Expensive and cumbersome but only used when absolutely necessary.

None of that ETH vitriol is relevant when I said clearly litecoin is a better stand-in when bitcoin is too costly to send. Nor the smart contract basis whence RSK is primed to make ETH contracts obsolete and second tier. There have been errors in ETH contracts costing users considerable sums of value.  
 IOTA will not come close to delivering on it's premise. The internet of things is not just 'connected devices'... It's the seamless integration of thousands of different algorithms and protocols each doing separate individual tasks and jobs across all industries speaking to eachother with a standardized language or subsets of code. It's not even close to materializing in any meaningful way and IOTA is not going to be the basis of anything the internet of things will need or use. It's basically just a token at this point and would have done better to ICO but the devs and creators wouldn't be able to trade and manipulate it sufficiently if they had gone that route. 
 XRP has little to no actual value. It's a typical alt propped by it's masters and has been from day one. I wouldn't even consider it a real crypto although it is a blockchain asset. Decentral is literally the name of the game with bitcoin, there's no point to a controlled and minted crypto other than providing fake liquidity to exchanges or closed systems who have none.

I'm referring to alt traders who believe whether incorrectly or not that they are currently not on the hook for like-kind swaps between alts and/or btc and alts.

Average user will not need their own payment channel if larger trusted channels remain open to serve individual needs. Eventually if wallet services and exchanges use lightning with integrated side chains the bitcoin network itself will be secondary and wait times largely inconsequential for anyone who does not need very large sums transacted. The immutable / impossible to censor, availability to any individual or group and the security aspects of bitcoin are what make on chain transactions extremely valuable. No matter what happens even with an empty mempool and free transactions confirmation will always be a wait until the next block scenario. The purpose of LN is to make microtransactions viable in general. It nearly works now but would benefit greatly from side chains.

Where do you get the BTC from though? You can't just materialize it out of thin air, you need to either own it already or borrow it. I get everything you are saying but actually having enough BTC to do it would mean you either buy it at market price which would force the price up and negate your dumping or have accumulated it prior. If it's the latter I am not sure the measly ~$2.5k value of the short end of a contract (CME figure) would be worth the inherent massive risk involved.

If a lot of people end up having to sift through mountains of trade data to report their net ACB I think most people won't report it anyway. The chances of being audited are extremely low unless someone starts throwing red flags. Unfortunately I think even reporting cap gains on crypto trades of any sort will grab their (IRS) attention. More so for people who report larger gains obviously. Someone who earned less than $2k profit doesn't really have to worry. Bigger players should be concerned.

Aside from Monero and litecoin when BTC is too expensive there are literally no use cases for 99.99% of alts. They talk about how IOTA and SALT can integrate into the internet of things but none of this shit will materialize for at least a decade so it's all useless outside of speculation right now. The internet of things is as much a mirage for today as the claim autonomous cars would be completely integrated by 2020. ETH had smart contracts but bitcoin has RSK so nobody really even needs ETH now. In due time it will become glaringly obvious and most of these useless chains will lose all inherent value outside the manipulation they all share in common.

It doesn't matter why they raided his home or who owned the ammunition. It was in his domicile therefore in his posession. This is why if one individual in a vehicle is caught sitting in the seat a firearm is found under they are considered reponsible for the weapon and face any consequences for it depending on state and their legal status (convicted felon).

I am the miner. You send me coins and I send them back to you. That creates volume but it's just us passing 2 coins back and forth all day. Since I am the miner I get all your fees which I also send back to you. I keep the mining rewards for all the blocks I win and since I am bitmain nobody else can muscle us out. We trick a lot of rubes into thinking either our coin IS bitcoin or it will take bitcoin's place as top crypto. They send us USD and BTC and since we control and manipulate most of our scam coin (whales) we can basically make it rise to any price or fall to any price within reason. 
 We do this until we can't anymore.

That's what second layers and side chains are for. They would make it cheap and instant. Obviously we want this now but the solution of creating larger blocks without exhausting the more technical scaling solutions first would create larger problems. The decentral nature of the network suffers because the barriers of entry to running a node climb higher than the average user can afford. Less nodes means more vulnerability and even some small businesses end up being priced out of self validating their transactions. Eventually this might happen anyway but the goal is to make it take as long as possible before the cost of operating a node is allowed to rise.  We might have data dumping if the fee is too low and blocks are large. Meaning companies will come drop a lot of information onto the chain which creates bloat. Imagine if the blockchain was so big it took 4 years to download. I exaggerate but you get the just of it. No matter what happens though, if enough people use the chain there will be fee competition. Rich people will always be willing to pay more to get their spot in line. If 10% of the world is using bitcoin then fees might rise to hundreds or thousands of dollars even if blocks are 32mb+

A lot of them would. The problem is even when your rat ass coin does jump 200% over night and you hype the shit out of it the number of people who will show up to an exchange to buy it won't be incredible. The people with a lot of USD or bitcoin are too smart to buy a PnD alt when most of them are manipulated to hell. The people with almost no bitcoin or fiat are not really investing and if they are it's micro transactions. The people who hodl BTC aren't interested in rat ass coin. Even if it jumps 200% in an hour.. Look at the volume when attacks are not active and pumping is not happening. Flat. Nobody uses alts for anything other than speculation. 
 Most of the volume is market making by the exchange and fake vol by whales of nearly every one of these alts. I am not saying you can't make any money if you get lucky catching a swing but most of these coins don't have actual volume. Go look at the bottom of the page at hitBTC and click on 'market makers'. Really makes you think.

That's an obscenely risky thing to do considering the amount of money going long. Covering a settlement if the market fails to drop means paying the contract with either cash or if stipulated, bitcoin. Imagine dumping to meet your contract quota but instead you lose all the BTC and have to re buy at 40% higher value. I think the firms who attempt it are insane if there are any. I realize they will limit risk via the size of the movements but it's literally adding risk to what is already THE most volatile asset on the planet. If they want to attempt a shitshow they had better be ready.

Not relevant. Charges can be added to a docket very easily and new trials can even occur as a result if the charges are redirected. If you arrest someone on a felony drug warrant and find the corpse of a person they murdered during your investigation and arrest, that person has murder added to their trial charges. It's not like the case is dropped or the murder charge can't be added to the docket... And anyone charged with a federal crime is arrested and held in federal custody. It really does not matter whether they are charged with something else or facing a separate trial for a separate offense..

How do we pay cap gains for purchases using crypto without converting at least some into fiat? If your govt doesn't accept crypto to pay taxes you have to cash some out which in itself will incur further cap gains tax.

The majority of traders both traditional and crypto will be less active and wire transfers / account verification on all the major exchanges has slowed to a crawl. Support tickets are piling up everywhere. The entire industry built around bitcoin exchanging is under staffed and over worked on all fronts. This is just reality catching up to the market. Plus the majority of would-be buyers are distracted by the holidays too and spending most of their disposable income on anything *except* crypto. There are also fears that new laws may be introduced affecting alt traders which would state bitcoin and altcoin trades without using fiat are not like-kind and therefore traders would owe much more tax if they sell in 2018. Even if these laws are passed next Dec they could affect all of the 2018 calendar year.

Gold and bitcoin are both commodities but gold has little use outside being used as a store of value or in trace amounts in electronics or as jewelry. Bitcoin in and of itself is inherently so many more things. The fundamentals that make it valuable as a decentralized money are the basis but only the beginning. Layers built on top of bitcoin will provide the ability to scale to support and integrate into the 'internet of things'. It (bitcoin) shares unique properties of many standalone commodities and holds unique properties of it's own which don't exist outside cryptocurrency. It can be accessed by literally anyone whereas derivatives markets themselves have many barriers to entry. It can and will create an entirely new class of assets based on bitcoin alone. Gold's market cap is infinitesimally small compared to the potential bitcoin possesses.

The number of people who 'have' gold could be 99% depending on demographic. Gold fillings and plated contacts in electronics are not investments in gold but a lot of people in the west have them. Just like if someone ends up using bitcoin somehow via a service built on top of bitcoin or RSK or w.e inadvertantly, they still don't technically 'have' bitcoin. It's like saying someone who has shares of GBTC or owns shares of an exchange "has bitcoin". They don't actually have it.

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:43:29
Right? It's going to catch stupid greedy fools off guard though. If anyone loses BTC it's basically going to be people who don't care about the technology or decentralization and want a quick flip. I say good riddance to them. If someone is dumb enough to beleive it would be any sort of good for the system to give away Satoshi's coins they don't understand or don't care about what makes bitcoin truly valuable. The most basic principle of mathatically based cryptographically secured currency is nobody can take it from you or re-allocate your funds *for any reason* if you know what you are doing. Anyone who places any sort of trust or value on a coin which breaks this principle in any way should not be in crypto. If they are they deserve whatever comes to them.

Guess what though? Any chain that has actual real world use and volume will end up being backlogged at some point. You could have 200mb blocks and the mempool will still get clogged up if enough users are transacting. The market itself has outgrown the ability to scale and even that stupid other coin would be slow and expensive if it had the (real) volume bitcoin is handling. Also take into consideration the ongoing spam attacks being financed by Bitmain and whale friends. They pass BTC back and forth to each other, subsidized by the fact that they will get their fees back every time Bitmain mines a block.
No matter what happens a chain that is being used to it's full potential will have a fee market - rich people will always be willing to pay for the right to be first in line. If the chain is active, fees *will* rise.
 This is the reason additional layers and sidechains are so important. Without them we are doomed to continue repeating history.

That's literally denial of causality and the absolute random nature of this universe.  
I saw a technology that I felt was incredibly undervalued and purchased it. I made and am still making exponential gains. Seems like nothing but good decisions to me in hindsight.

The fact that they are so insanely backlogged and can't handle support tickets even though their own staff continues to grow in number exponentially tells me there's plenty of room to grow. The people they are onboarding still need to get verified and send funds. I think this is the beginning of the singularity event that makes bitcoin a mainstream household name. In the sense that everyone will own it or participate indirectly. If your govt and federal bank buy it as an investment your entire country is vested indirectly. The returns impact the entire populous one way or another. The only problem is the points of access (like coinbase) are all extremely lacking in their ability to provide fast liquidity of bitcoin to large investors. I mean that's when the exchange is even working. Most of the high vol ones crash when real volume starts happening outside their bot algo generated fake volume.

If people are willing to pay more (wealthy people) and the mempool is full (will always be even with second layers and sidechains *if* worldwide use grows to VISA or similar levels.) then yes, fees can continue to rise to unbeleivable levels for on chain transactions. When all 21 million coins are mined the system reverts to fee only for miner rewards. What do you think will happen then? The fee market is bound to continue rising. It might subside a little when second layers and sidechains are fully active but *if* the system sees widespread mainstream use, fees will continue to rise to match proliferation.

No. If you import a seed from blockchain it's an already existing wallet being imported. Any wallet that has been broadcast over the network decrypted or not using the internet can never technically act as a cold storage wallet.
 To avoid high fee but preserve security, import your blockchain wallet to ledger using the seed. When the network stops being spammed make a cold storage wallet (new address and key pairs) offline. You can even use a paper / brain wallet. Send coins to new offline cold wallet and import seed of cold wallet into ledger.

Under a fractional BTC model with USDT serving as stand in for actual US dollars, this is extremely dangerous for the exchange. It's only working so far because there has not been a massive run on their BTC (withdrawal) and tether keeps printing. It's 90% custodial BTC 'belonging' to customers who are swapping it around on the IOU of the exchange. No wonder everyone is so suspicuous of tether. It's a Gox scenario waiting to unfold but worse because they don't have any actual USD on hand without depleting their coffer and resorting to *selling* custodial BTC to cover (including cashing out customers in BTC to off exchange BTC wallets). I want to say ponzi or pyramid but without a proper audit nobody really knows. It's a house of cards imo. The last people holding BTC or USDT on one of these unicorn exchanges will be totally fucked if the illusion unravels.

Japan actually disagrees with you on that. If there is temporary closure at your bank or withdrawls are unavailable for a period do you then turn around and say your debit card is now unusable? The semantics would suggest it is but in reality the system itself still works and exists as it always has outside the event horizon which made it (temporarily) 'unusable'.  
  
   Bitcoin is perfectly usable if you pay the correct fee size. Anyone transferring large sums will observe immediate benefits over traditional transfers, especially internationally. Second layers and side chains are literally materializing and functioning as I type this so the high fee slow confirmation issue is going to be solved in due time. It speaks for itself to people who actually understand the value of zero counterparty trust.

It depends on the inflow of new users. If a lot of people enter the market rapidly and see huge problems in bitcoin they might flee to alts. The fluctuation in onboarding of users will be the deciding factor *IF* we don't fix the backlogging and put an end to these high fee spam attacks somehow.

The new tax laws have little to no effect on crypto trading nor are they going to offset any potential gains an alt trader may accumulate over the next year. Like-kind means they (believe) they don't incur a tax implication on a trade between say BTC and LTC. The govt is trying to make it clear this is not the case and will solidify their position by introducing legislation next year that states every single trade between BTC and alts is a taxable event. Net gain or loss must be calculated by the trader using ACB on thousands or tens of thousands of trades if they made as many.
Right now no such legislation exists. If it passes in mid 2018 and you sold Jan 2018 it will mean you are retroactively on the hook to pay these new taxes. If you sell today they have no impact on you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:09:21
Of course. I was alluding that timing's a bitch and you need balls of steel to attempt to catch a swing. In this case the move would have been wise but if he waits too long and it rises back up to $20k before he buys back in he would have fucked up the bottom line - lost BTC and ends up with less $ overall than if he just held. But still got to enjoy the money today instead of having to wait.

Localbitcoins is OTC and you will never find a seller willing to transact $100k there unless it's between parties that share full and total trust with eachother. Even then, usually they will arrange a private trade to remove the middleman that is LBC.

Guy, BCH has no devs and only holds value because manipulatory whales like Ver and Wu hold almost all of it. The only reason it even exists is to be pumped and dumped. I think Jihan might owe the Chinese govt a staggering amount of money for electricity he has already used and needs to participate in this bcash scam to pay his bill. It sounds crazy that the most powerful miner could be losing money even as they win most of the block rewards but the cost of developing and producing miners on top of electricity and rent (warehouses) he might actually be under water right now. It may be that the price of BTC is even being manipulated simultaneously (up) to eventually reach a point where Wu can profit from the sale of BTC to the extent he can meet ROI.

First, relax. Stress can actually change the chemical balance of your body and physically harm you. It might be a lot to you but it's just money.
 Now, if quadriga rejects the balance it will bounce back to your bank. Since banks are closed until tomorrow you will need to wait at least ~12ish hours until they open. Nothing you can do right now except relax. Eat dinner and go to bed. The money might even re-enter your bank account tomorrow morning. Unfortunately it might also take up to a week as your bank might put the funds on hold to clear them depending on how the transaction was bounced or cancelled (by quadriga). You are dealing with a major exchange both bonded and insured. They will not screw you over. Tomorrow if the money is not in your bank account call the bank's 1800 number and explain your situation. Also send a ticket to quadriga support. No matter what you will get your money back. The only variable is how long it will take.

More deflection. As far as the whitepaper goes this is supposed to be happening and second layers with sidechains have become the only viable route. Until then people who want cheap and fast transactions should look elsewhere. It's just unfortunate the reason this has happened before those second layers and sidechains are ready to go live is spam attacks by malicious parties. The network can easily handle all real volume with low fees right now but only when it isn't under high fee transaction spam attacks.

The manipulating (shorting) prices on Gemini is what I think is impossible or near impossible though.

I don't understand.
 Does the transaction have any confirms? If so how is it possible that the QR code came out incorrectly and somehow supplied you with an actively used address out of all the possible and potential addresses? 
 If it was sent to an active address being used by someone and it has confirms I would say you have been hacked or have malware / virus. I don't think the scanner could supply you with an address being used by someone else even by mistake. That sounds way too suspicious.

You have two options then. Change PoW of bitcoin and hope you get support for it (won't really be considered bitcoin by *a lot* of people) or you leave bitcoin entirely because the chain you believe to be the 'true' bitcoin is going to get attacked by those miners you dislike so much. A stalled *and then* 51% attacked chain is a dead one at least as long as it's under attack. It simply isn't safe to use in such a scenario.

This is different... Bitcoin cash was a bunch of guerrilla big blockers (+Ver) who subverted the Bitmain UAHF threat to fork off and start an alt that not even the NY agreement backers supported. It was a weak attempt from the start and most of us knew that. It *still* managed to create enough FUD to negatively impact price..
 This 2x fork is for all the beans. This is literally a lot of economic nodes and most of the miners VS the developers who have been maintaining consensus rules from the very beginning (core).
 This fork will cause massive problems because there is no replay protection for 2x like there was for bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:06:22
You might take an incredible loss on that but you might also be self rescuing yourself from an implosion so I'd say it's at least a prudent choice.

@_date: 2017-08-19 20:07:36
The bitcoin cash chain will never implement segwit. They claim second layers and LN will activate on their alt chain but I fail to see why it would be a smooth transition to LN or other second layers when the entire reasoning behind implementing segwit itself is to make it much easier and much more seamless to implement second layers.
 The segwit2x camp want 2mb blocks, not 8mb. They also agreed to implement segwit. While there are a couple powerful players supporting both bitcoin cash *and* segwit2x, the majority of the segwit2x camp does not want to participate in bitcoin cash. So I'm afraid your point is moot.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:49:33
Who's capital are you basing this on? The people who sit around never transacting over the network or the multiple exchanges and services who have signed the agreement and have the capital in both fiat and bitcoin to ensure their chain remains profitable?

Cash is basically anonymous because you can launder it any number of ways... There are cartels still passing around out of circulation $1000 USD notes. In that case they can't even spend it outside the cartel circle and it comes at a discount to actual circulating cash but it happens. Assuming a bitcoin transaction can be truly anonymous is taking a great risk if you are a drug cartel because you don't want any sort of trail at all much less an immutable blockchain for agencies to scrutinize. Tumbling will not suffice as a reliable fix as we have observed. 
 There are other cryptocurrencies that offer more anonymity but alts are not driving the price of bitcoin, it's vice versa.

@_date: 2017-08-05 23:04:50
The scaling debate is basically over for the next 3 months. Segwit is about to lock-in and the community is more or less unified albeit the whole 2x part of segwit2x may or may not happen based on what the majority of economic nodes decide when the time comes to implement the block size increase. I'd say the increase itself is somewhat unwarranted right now because the network is not full. BUT the possibility of large scale growth over a short period means the network *COULD* potentially become clogged the way it was when the spam attacks were occurring. Therefore the 2x part makes some sense in the long run and certainly in the short run IF transaction volume rises to the level they were at during the spam attacks.
 The threat of a fork is now over because Bitcoin Cash is not gaining traction. The original worries of Bitmain trying to fork bitcoin with massive mining power are gone. 
 These two factors had been suppressing price growth for the last month or two.
 Mix in the fact that Sheba Jafari of Goldman Sachs has been accurately predicting the price movements and made an upper prediction just over $3600 for the short term and you get a clear picture of why buy pressure is so incredibly strong right now.

Open a new wallet and transfer your bitcoins to that one. Keep the seed from the original wallet.
 When all your BTC is safely confirmed into it's new wallet, download electron cash and use the seed from the original Blockchain.info wallet (now empty of btc) and generate the bitcoin cash wallet using bip39 option (with the seed from your old, empty Blockchain.info wallet).
 Send the bitcoin cash from electron cash wallet to your exchange of choice.

@_date: 2017-08-05 21:33:00
This will hamstring the price because every merchant you sent BTC to in exchange for goods or services just turns around and sells the BTC immediately to local fiat. Sometimes it's even done automatically by the service handling bitcoin transactions for the merchant. And don't assume there is a new buyer for every seller. Services handling bitcoin and exchanging it to fiat for a merchant don't really care what the price of bitcoin is so long as they can get a fee out of handling the exchange. It's usually a matter of having reserves in both currency and balancing a sheet, but they get a fee every time they make a change to fiat for a merchant so their business is not based on the price of BTC so long as they do have those reserves. 
 TL / DR; A lot of purchases using bitcoin will drop the price because merchants usually don't hold bitcoin, they sell it to fiat. If they use a service for this the service doesn't care what the price is because they have reserves of fiat and BTC and can profit at any price through fees.

The caveat is if big banks and credit processors (VISA is hiring blockchain experts, who woulda thought?) end up adopting bitcoin on any level for *any* reason, the proliferation of said services could mean your average jack and jill jerkoff will be involved in the bitcoin economy in one way or another, whether they like it or not.
 It's not like 'forced' use or adoption though. It's like "your bank is so deep in this shit you are by extension in it too". They won't own any or even gain anything from their bank using bitcoin but their fiat deposits will be constantly used to prop the price or open new positions in cryptocurrency (if it's not bitcoin).

I was too scared to wait although I actually got the stuff into exchange on the 2nd and tried my hand at trading (trading again that is.. 2013-2014 were a hell of a drug). Initially I sold somewhere around .065 and was going to leave but caught the trading bug and decided to make some profit. Actually made some (~40% more than I had on first trade!) but ended up losing it and then some. Then I gained about half of that back then lost it again and *then* some... Then finally traded back up to just about 10% over where I was originally going to cash the BTC out on the first trade. 
 tl / dr; Basically don't try to trade your way up unless you know wtf you're doing lol. I barely made a profit trading but caught some wicked swings (I *AM* ROLLERCOASTER GUY!) and lost a lot of sleep and didn't eat much.

Close to nothing? We have literal securities based on it (GBTC). Merchant adoption is up allover the world.

I just quoted the whitepaper explaining that this is only necessary in the future when user adoption has grown to the point that second layers and side chains can no longer handle the volume without a major block size upgrade. Satoshi himself made it very clear. The reasoning behind node pruning is that it will only become *necessary* when the network can no longer handle transaction volume without a large block size increase and this would make it unfeasible for the average user to afford to run a full node. You do know the difference between a full node and a client node right? Pruning allows the non-full 'simple' node to transact with trusted network nodes, the server farms he mentioned, without having to take on full blocks. That's the "reading the block header only" part... Full blocks would only be necessarily downloaded by the client nodes if there was a serious (51%) attack happening on the network..
 That future is *so* far off, and it's not relevant to the environment today. 8mb is absolutely not necessary right now. Ideologically the miners disagree with it because profit or no profit they are not mining bitcoin cash in any major way.

I think that might be worse than an increase to 2mb though, I know Luke has been a proponent of PoW change but I've said it before that it will change bitcoin DNA in a manner I find worse than a simple block size increase. I'm not sure Satoshi Nakamoto would agree with a PoW change but he did speak about the eventuality (not necessary now, I know) of full network nodes eventually being server farms and out of reach of the average person. As long as those nodes are honest the system would still work. I'm not sure I would trust Chinese mining / business nodes entirely but that is the ecosystem we are in right now. They basically make up a large chunk of the industry. 
 
 I wish core could find a solution other than PoW change.. We have bitcoin with different PoW and those are alts.

The second point makes no sense whatsoever because regulation is absolutely required to allow bitcoin to proliferate without encountering serious problems in unregulated environments. I don't know how any intelligent person could postulate such trite idiocy. The third point is moot because Bitfinex is still operating, and allowing customers to withdraw funds. They have re payed their customers affected by the exchange hack which is more than anyone could *ever* say about Mt Gox today.

This meme is somewhat misguided though..
 There are people who would rather cash out to a slowly inflating and much more stable currency than to risk it all hoping the price will hold or continue to increase. For instance, I am a hodler but if I see that my coins are worth $2m USD I would be VERY hard pressed not to sell half of them and buy a condo, a nice car and maybe hold a little bit of money to buy new furniture and keep the bills payed for a while. If bitcoin crashes for some reason or the price drops by 50% at least I still managed to buy $1m worth of actual goods and services. 
 I understand a lot of people think inflation and banks and governments are the scourge of their world but... If the situation gets bad enough that hyperinflation sets in and banks collapse.. You are looking at civil war anyway and if that happens you still have the other half of your bitcoins if you did sell 50% for nice things in a stable and civil environment.
 TL / DR; Unless the world is actually collapsing around you and banks are disintegrating along with all forms of government and security.. You might want to consider selling up to half of your cryptocurrency if you have literally *millions* of dollars worth one day. Nobody can predict a peak nor stability in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:55:17
Uhh, no. If you spend bitcoin you have had for 3 years and payed $600 for you owe taxes on the fiat value increase to current market price. Unless you want to say fuck taxes and risk going to prison for tax evasion you have to calculate how much profit you made and declare it and pay taxes. 
 If you buy one coin today and spend it today the only implications are whatever the price difference was between when you bought and spent the coin. If it turns out to be under $1000 USD then you don't legally have to declare it. So you might see a few % gain with no legal onus on the person buying and spending the same coin that day.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:00:03
I will never support bitcoin cash! 
 Thanks for the reassurance. I'd rather the NY agreement signers take a minute to allow segwit and LN time to proliferate and grow, but those guys don't seem to want to listen to anyone except each other..
 Is there any merit to creating an emergency 'bitcoin' chain that is frozen somehow at the fork if the fork does occur? Like a backup bitcoin chain that neither the 1mb nor 2mb side is using, just frozen in time as a last ditch resort if both chains somehow end up being less than what was expected? I only ask because I'm scared of what a 51% attack might do *if* those miners who aren't exactly 'good' people (not speaking for the entire 93% though) decide to go ahead and maliciously fork the 1mb chain.
 I'm guessing the safety / emergency chain wouldn't do much to stop them nor convince them but if their chain breaks down somehow or loses confidence and the 1mb chain is stalled or 'forked up' so to speak, a safety chain *might* make sense? Only if nobody uses it though until absolutely 100% necessary and agreed upon. 
 Just an idea. Maybe I'm being naive because I'm not a coder.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:30:18
The network has never lost 93% of all miner support either. If that happens blocks don't move at all because the difficulty is way too high. If the answer is changing bitcoin PoW that means it's not really bitcoin anymore, as opposed to a small block size upgrade it really doesn't make a lot of sense.
 
 If the stalled 1mb core supported chain gets 51% attacked that might be a deal breaker for a lot of people. Whether the majority of those people decide to say "bitcoin is dead" or switch over to using the 2x chain is anyone's guess. Without replay protection this will be really bad for those who stuck with the losing chain.

With segwit. also not a huge problem since segwit should stem the size of the actual blocks if / when the fork becomes active. If they are full it only means the network ceiling is being reached by organic volume barring any spam. But I don't think they would spam their own fork since they were using the spam attack to 'prove' the fork was actually necessary. Whether it is or not is irrelevant though because if it was not necessary blocks won't be full and this whole big(ger) blocks equate to centralization argument basically drowns out at that point. The network should operate at the capacity it is being used, not some artificial ceiling in place to hold out on any absurd notion that centralization is becoming a problem. At least not at a 2mb size.. You and I both know this is at the very *least* a 50/50 ideological / political battle.
 If the blocks are full sans spam with 2x then the network is being held back by this 1mb ceiling and it desperately needs to be corrected.

Also a 'decent' web wallet if there is such a thing. You control the seed and they have no way to access your coins so the 'custodial' point of failure is virtually eliminated in that case. You also need E-mail authentication to access the wallet so it's basic 2FA (you would have to have your e-mail *and* blockchain.info passwords compromised for the thief to gain access). Then you can implement the whole second password feature found in many wallets which requires a secondary password when you want to spend coins, access the seed or change the main login password etc. The prompt for this secondary password is a pop up keypad so it takes more than a keylogger to access the password if you're smart enough to *use* the keypad. Then there's actual 2FA via phone / app. So it's like 3 layer password protection on top of phone based 2FA. It's like 4FA in a way..
 Plus as I mentioned you can control your seed, but make absolutely sure you only access the seed on a clean and safe device.

It's definitely insider trading but whether or not he can be prosecuted for it relies on whether or not bitcoin cash is regarded as a security, currency or some type of asset or equity. Right now the federal government has guidelines and basically wants people to pay their taxes on crypto, but I'm not sure if manipulating an altcoin is something they can prosecute him for yet. If they can prove he commit wire fraud though, or manipulated an exchange to defraud investors, I'm sure the US authorities would want to at the very least speak to him about it. I draw parallels between Martin Shkreli and Ver. Hopefully he will face a court trial over all this one day.

Economic nodes = most of the value in the space right now. People holding a few coins or less screaming about how 2x will cause centralization have almost no investment to begin with. Even combined, they are a mere fraction of the ecosystem as a whole.
 The only people opposing 2x who also own a lot of bitcoins are probably core engineers and early investors who support core. And possibly a few of the economic node businesses whom are either undecided or against 2x.
 The majority of capital will follow the coin being called bitcoin. Things will continue along from there, for better or worse..

This is exactly why I am scared the legacy chain will get nuked after the 2x fork.. You can't base a $70B industry on the backs of people with such shitty attitudes who contribute nothing and can't put two sentences together without being disparaging. I probably have 100x the liquidity invested over you, early adoption will do that. In the event that real business and individual investors (with actual liquidity, producing volume that *moves*) sway to the 2x side of a potential fork should this happen, my money is on those businesses and like minded individuals. Their (businesses) customers and those individual investors for the most part don't even know what a node is let alone consensus. They won't care what they are getting as long as everyone else around them (you aren't in that group) is calling it bitcoin. Ideologically and sentimentally I think for the most part the agreement holders have the legacy chain supporters beat, if not only by measure of capital alone.
 It's going to come down to what the average Joe and the news media around him considers is 'bitcoin'.

If 93% of current miners leave and then some of them decide to attack the network and achieve a 51% attack, not only will the 1mb chain have been stalled by the exodus but forked maliciously and therefore unsafe to use..

Core has done a great job supporting bitcoin for many years. This refusal to agree to an industry wide upgrade is going to cause massive problems for the entire community come time of the fork. I appreciate core for what they have done but I cannot support the sentiment that such a minor size increase is a problem. If segwit and LN / other second layers and side chains cause a massive influx of new users and volume 1mb *will not suffice* even with the throughput segwit and LN would allow. Corporations considering bitcoin support would have their confidence shaken and potentially broken, if not permanently then for some time to come.
 There is absolutely no reason not to get on board and support this upgrade at this point.

You think a large number of economic nodes ($5.1B+ tx volume / mth)  *and* 90%+ of all the miners doesn't equate to what essentially constitutes the bitcoin industry at this point? What do you define as industry in that case?
 And you're just going to run over the fact that this was a compromise dedicated to literally bypassing core's ability to block or prolong this process any further than they already have? They're the ones who *refused* compromise for literal years. The whole reason a compromise was even needed in the first place.

Bitcoin accepting merchants might work but I see what you're saying. It doesn't roll off the tongue.

Okay but an FX trader on vacation does not report that $2000 USD worth of foreign currency he is buying to use on vacation, nor does he have to report spending it when he uses it to buy cocktails at the resort he is staying at. The same rules apply to bitcoin investments. Long term investments in crypto have to be declared as profit or loss and tax implications apply. Short term purchases (buying bitcoin) using separate wallets for the purposes of spending (the bitcoin you bought that day, on products or services) *will not* incur tax implications *unless* bitcoin rises dramatically in the very short time (less than a day) it took you to purchase the coins you are going to use for the sole purpose of spending them, and the action of actually spending those coins.
 Everything is recorded on the blockchain. Therefore you have immutable proof of the difference between your investment wallets and your spending wallets. As long as you don't move any of your long term holdings over to your short term 'hot' wallet and the hot wallet only holds funds you bought THAT DAY, you are fine.

If you rely on core and their hardline supporters for consensus, you will end up with 1mb for the rest of bitcoin's existence. The beautiful thing about this being an open source project is if the current status quo client and it's developers are hindering the market, a new client can be made and it's up to the individual users, *and the industry that supports the network*, to decide which one to use. You're essentially trying to speak for the entirety of the community whom are currently using core. That goes against the most basic principle of consensus. Until the activation of the fork you have no real metric to compare.

Took me over a month to spot this because I was replying to people who know what they were talking about whom I actually cared to respond to. Your comment got buried and left behind. But I have to point out how stupid your statement is. 
 You don't send anyone private keys when you send bitcoin. The private key is part of your wallet, you need that signature to sign any transactions you are going to spend from the wallet. If I want to spend .01 and my wallet has 5.00000000 in it, do you think the recipient is getting my private key and access to the entire wallet? You definitely need to go research more about how private / public keys work in general.

I understand fully what OP said, and it would not work because A) miners don't support 8mb blocks (only a tiny rogue guerrilla group of them does) and B) They did not sign an agreement to support any such fork even if it did exist. That's the whole point of *all* of this. Political ensnarement. The miners have wanted 2mb (not 8mb) for a very long time. Core doesn't think it's a good idea because it will lead to potential node centralization if 2mb blocks are full. Plus, segwit and LN can increase transaction throughput over the network without resorting to a 2mb upgrade right now.
 Simply put: miners would never follow a bitcoin cash fork in any purposeful manner. If *any* of them followed it, you would see less than the 8% that are seemingly not signalling 2x.

If you made a lot of profit you owe taxes on any bitcoin you spend. Capital gains or w.e applies in your country.
 MUCH smarter idea is simply buy new bitcoin today, and use that to spend. That way you help the bitcoin economy, you don't incur tax implications and you create buy pressure prior to the sell pressure any merchant you buy something using BTC will create when they sell that BTC you just gave them. Most merchants will sell it for fiat or use a service that does this directly without them even handling any bitcoin ever. They only want revenue from increased sales, they are not in it to hodl (Overstock is an *exception*).
 TL / DR: Don't spend your investment bitcoin unless you want to pay taxes on the profit. Capital gains apply. You can buy fresh new bitcoin today right now to spend on purchases if you want to spend bitcoin to help the bitcoin economy.

The services (economic nodes) supporting segwit2x have pretty clearly signed the agreement. Their allegiances are also very obviously with the miners exhibiting the majority of hash..

While you're right about margin positions I think it's actually the exchange(s) - Finex being prime culprit, who are actually creating a range to attract more speculative traders. Nothing attracts them like a nice volatile range to ride around in.
 I have a suspicion Bitmain and Bitfinex have non-public agreements about how and when to move prices. Miners have incentive to do this because if they can't pay the electricity bill or continue pouring money into R&amp;D they quickly drop toward the bottom rung of the totem.
 Finex moves the price around and gives the miners a go ahead signal to sell into the buy orders when there is enough support. Or possibly Bitmain just hands the coins over and lets Bitfinex do whatever they need to, and Bitmain gets payed fiat directly to cover their electricity and R&amp;D costs for new ASIC tech.

Yes there were some problems but if you followed the instructions and produced the wallet with a seed from a now empty bitcoin wallet (we were told to transfer funds out of the bitcoin wallet prior to generating the seed in Electron Cash) there were no really serious issues regarding the potential to lose bitcoins in using Electron Cash, apart from the potential to lose the profit that selling Bitcoin Cash would provide should you somehow have lost it to thieves or Electron Cash itself. The majority of us who used the legitimate Electron Cash wallet have done so without problems.
 I was skeptical at first but when I saw other people leaving testimonial here about how smooth and easy the process was I had to investigate. I am not leaving 'free' money on the table if it's as simple as transferring some coins around to different wallets and exchanging it for bitcoin.
 I am glad I did.

In that case just buy them and spend them immediately, the only difference is you create buy pressure prior to 'selling' your coins for whatever you are using them to purchase. The merchant may or may not sell the bitcoin you bought your purchase with but no matter what happens, *you* don't have to go buy more at a (possibly) higher price. AND, as I already mentioned, you are negating the sell pressure caused by the merchant selling the bitcoin you just sent them because you created equal buy pressure BEFORE you hand (bitcoin) to a merchant who sells it for fiat.

You must have me confused with a dev or a miner but I'm just a hodler. But I don't think you're going to be able to sell your coins to the average people looking to buy today when an exchange like Finex or Coinbase is selling 2x and calling it bitcoin. Your ability to trade it relies on the businesses tasked with handling the sale. The people looking to 'invest' haven't the slightest clue about decentralization or scaling. They see a price and hear 'bitcoin' and the remaining core nodes refusing to participate end up becoming the minority. Do you think OTC sales are enough to keep the core chain profitable?

26 comments so far and not a single person has mentioned that tulip mania was actually due to the invention of futures contracts - which the tulips were based on, that caused the 'mania' and insane prices part. They had never seen such an exotic instrument before and went a little nuts with the concept. As for the tulips themselves, some actually were sold at insane prices to naive individuals who didn't really understand what was going on or why the contracts based upon them commanded such a high price. Those people are akin to someone who would buy a physical bitcoin with no coins on it without understanding the metal coin itself is essentially worthless (depending on metal used obviously).
It just strikes me as odd because the same thing that caused tulip mania happened here. But I am not referring to bitcoin. I am referring to the fact that none of the 26 people who commented here were any more aware of why tulip mania happened than someone paying thirty times the salary of an average skilled tradesman for a tulip back then.

Bitcoin cash didn't have 93% miner support though. If you think this fork will be the same you don't understand what's going on. This could kill bitcoin as we know it, if the 2x chain breaks down or fails somehow and the 1mb chain is stalled (that's what happens when 93% of all miners leave) then public confidence in bitcoin will fizzle out.. Nobody can trust the 1mb chain if it stalls then gets 51% attacked, and a lot of people refuse to believe in a 2mb NY agreement chain based on principle.
 This is going to seriously fracture the entire community.

It's actually true and somewhat scary if you think about it because once the anti bitcoin cash side runs out of bitcoin cash to dump on him, he only has to overcome the small number of people actively trading it by colluding with exchanges, and voila; the man will literally be able to set whatever price he wants for the stuff. He's actually doing it *right now*. But he knows he can't prop it up past $1000 without a massive downpour of sells right now so he's biding his time hoping miners will switch over. I think his first goal is to overcome ETH then move on to attempt stealing the crown from bitcoin if not only artificially by propping price thereby raising market cap and profitability.

I'm not sure but I would assume it works like FX and you pay tax on anything considered to have appreciated in your investment account(s). But an FX trader doesn't have to report or pay tax on 'new' currency he acquired to say go on vacation and pay for goods and services he is purchasing in a foreign destination, even if he owns a large investment in the local fiat currency of the country he is visiting.
 I would play it safe and always pay tax on any BTC I spend if it has appreciated in value a considerable amount since I bought (that bitcoin). That's why I suggest keeping investment and spending wallets separate, always recording all spending with as much detail as possible and even buying *new* bitcoin outside of your investment, and spending that new bitcoin right away as fast as you can (if you want to spend BTC to help the bitcoin economy). That way you do not incur any huge taxes and you create buy pressure before any sell pressure is created by the merchant you are buying the goods and / or services with your BTC from, since most of the merchants sell BTC back to fiat immediately or even use a service to do it for them automatically.

Miners don't see it your way. They have tens or hundreds of millions of USD invested in their equipment and connections (between each other, exchanges, individual investors, etc..). They feel core could potentially be removed from the picture and bitcoin will still work, if not as fully intended (decentralized) then at least in principle. Their block will be the one moving and making transactions, the 1mb block will stall and likely get attacked by nefarious miners (not speaking for the entire 93%) shattering user confidence. If these miners and their business partners can convince the rest of the world at large that their version of bitcoin is the surviving chain, the majority of the world being non technologically inclined will probably just assume they (miners) are correct and continue using bitcoin 2x as *just* bitcoin.
 You might disagree, and I wish I was wrong about this. But the number of people who understand (at least marginally) bitcoin vs the number of people who don't is under huge disparity. 
 Most people just accept that if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck and tastes like a duck, it's a duck. With one caveat. Everyone else around them has to agree it's a duck. And I'm not so sure the world is ready to give up ducks entirely based on the political battle happening between proponents of just who and / or what *is* a duck, which is secondary to the masses who will be expecting a duck of some sort regardless.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:18:28
The agreement was the compromise though. It includes 2x..
 You sound like you want to run your own chain on a single node when you talk like this. I would prefer to see core and the backers of the NY agreement find a suitable solution together, instead of fracturing the entire system with he said she said malarkey.

I already commented to you about this and I know you probably haven't read that one yet but.. PSA: Buy the coins you plan on spending prior to spending any coins. By the same mechanism I guess you could say in doing so you are also basically just making sure you can re buy those coins at the current market price. You don't want to make a purchase and find out in the couple hours it took you to re buy your coins BTC price surged 10%. I think you and I both know it can and does happen sometimes. 
 The opposite can be true as well. I bought during the bitcoin 'fork' in 2013 when prices dropped from $80 to around $60 without even realizing I was getting a discount. I didn't even know what a fork was let alone that I was buying during one. Just a lucky coincidence like Bob Ross always said.
 But I digress. Always buy (or re buy, however you see it) before you spend. It mitigates the affect of price movements between the time you spend the bitcoin and the time you re buy, by eliminating the re buy phase entirely.
 TL / DR; Always buy the coins you plan on spending immediately before spending them. That way you don't *have* to re buy anything, and if the price takes off quickly you won't be at a loss.

@_date: 2017-08-20 16:57:20
That's a bit out of context. I am saying if the 1mb core chain *and* the 2x chain both end up failing, 1mb because it will stall and potentially be 51% attacked, the 2mb chain because potentially shitty code or incompetence (lack of testing), then nobody wins.
 There are other possibilities. The 2x chain somehow fails and the 1mb chain attracts miners back to it because of this. The lack of replay protection makes this a catch 22 scenario though. Or the 2x chain forks and receives no support from the outset, 1mb chain stays active and doesn't get stalled or 51% attacked, business as usual for most people. In that scenario I think even the 2x proponents would be crawling back to the 1mb chain for what it's worth. 
 You can't just take one sentence and per mutate the entire statement based on it.

I suppose since I only vested what I could afford to lose I am in a position to do so. Even though my current holdings far outstrip my initial investment in exponential fashion.. I could stomach seeing value erode to literal zero. I've had / have this kind of money outside bitcoin already anyway so it's not like I'm tossing away my future or anything. 
 Normally I would be doing as you plan to though unless I thought for certain one or the other chain was going to be dominant immediately after activation of the fork.

I was going to invest in Nvidia around 2011 when they kicked the price of the GTX 500 series up by $200 just because they saw those cards were on par with AMD cards performing at the same level in the higher price range.

Bitcoin cash is heavily manipulated because nor many real bitcoin users want it or to have anything to do with it. The ones who dumped did so long enough ago that the number of coins in the hands of non-supporters is extremely low. That was the game plan all along. Ver has enough BTC and bitcoin cash to prop up the market now because nobody whom had large amounts of bitcoin cash to dump currently holds any (bitcoin cash) anymore. It's easy to pump a market you control.

What sort of chain will it be when you have to change PoW just to get any blocks moving? You realize 90% of miner support leaving the chain at this difficulty means there will be no way to find blocks or even come close to a retarget? And if you accept the PoW change over a block size increase to 2mb based on principle you are insane.. Massively hypocritical to want any of that when simultaneously claiming a block size increase is unsuitable because the code to implement it is being somehow rushed in comparison..

Segwit and LN are going to make the (any) backlog a non issue. Further, 8mb while simultaneously rejecting segwit and second layers means all transactions happen on-chain, another ridiculous and very stupid caveat.

Overall scarcity, while demand remains the same the underlying asset is still more valuable than if those coins had not been lost. While the potential to be sold does not mean that they would have been, the same correlation can be made between whether or not they would be held and lay dormant. Never the less if you understand anything about the principles of inflation and deflation you understand that in general terms any increase in supply is inflationary. While this is not a positive increase in supply it's a technical increase because any coins that *are* lost now would potentially be active in the circumstance they were not lost and therefore create pressure in either direction should they enter the market. Their absence doesn't mean they would have been active in absolute terms if they were not lost but the void they leave is massive because bitcoin is so limited and scarce. If we only have 10 million out of 16 million currently mined coins (not actually estimating, just an example) then there are only a possible 15m coins for trade total and that would most definitely mean prices would reflect this. The odds of all of those (lost) coins on hodl or being locked up for whatever reasons - business purposes or otherwise, if they still existed, are infinitesimally small.

I understand the political aspect of your sentiment but I don't see the end result, miners spamming the network constantly to continue their push for bigger blocks, as an intelligent move on their part nor would there be huge incentive after this initial increase *unless* the network explodes in volume without the aforementioned spam. But in that case they wouldn't need to spam because their point would be made by organic volume. 
 I know the network is not at the point where it needs 8mb without segwit. That's a given. But I do see a potential *need* in the current landscape to upgrade to 2mb to give the network room to grow and adjust should segwit and LN bring the masses toward bitcoin. I think core and the community has done a great job standing their ground and showing the industry at large their voice will be heard, but at this point I think it might actually be reckless to continue holding a staunch position against the increase. At the very least I think core should prepare an emergency software upgrade to implement replay protection ASAP before the fork occurs. I realize the reasoning for refusing to do so lies in the same political aggregate as refusing an increase to 2mb but we are in dangerous water right now and on top of all this bad actors (bitcoin cash whales / Ver) are moving to destroy confidence in bitcoin as it stands. The outcome should core not decide to do so will have massive implications for all of us.
 I know people will try to say the NY agreement backers should implement replay protection but since they have refused it would be incredibly prudent for core to at least have something in the offing to protect their supporters and exchanges that don't want to implement 2x..

If what you just gestured were true the cartels allover the world would have pushed dark markets to multi billion dollar entities. They have not. I am not discounting that people use crypto to purchase drugs and other contraband from darknet market sellers but the volume created in no way constitutes even a fraction of the current market. The last time such was true would have been right before the breakout to ~$100+ between Jan and May of 2013. The liquidity in these markets is absolutely minuscule compared to overall volume traded over the bitcoin network. We are talking $1bn volume for Alpha bay *since inception* in 2014. That is in comparison to current volume exceeding $2bn *daily* for bitcoin in general.
 You have no idea how big this has become, you might have been correct mid 2012 up to around Jan 2013 but the illicit use of bitcoin driving the market price is subsequently so far behind use that you literally could not be more wrong about it.

I'm not so sure. Litecoin can exist without the huge dev support bitcoin has. If they (NY agreement signers) get enough businesses and individual investors to follow their chain, and it becomes the status quo to whatever the current mainstream bitcoin user constitutes right now... I could see them keeping it alive as well as Ver has kept bitcoin cash alive thus far.

I'm not unsympathetic to the idea of keeping nodes accessible at all though, nor the idea that core is being forced into a position between ideology and politics.. But to degrade to petty name calling so quickly, even more so considering mod status is bizarre to say the least. I've seen worse around here, just not by a mod. I don't see why 2mb is such a deal breaker other than the fact that a large portion of core devs see it as an impeachment of sort. If core fractures over a 2x fork and serious money follows the moving chain, whether it 'replaces' the 1mb chain or not will grind down to whichever side can actively convince the public, or at least the population investing and buying bitcoin right now, that their chain is the dominant one. If they both fail to cement themselves the result could be society at large casting bitcoin aside entirely for something else.

I think it goes without saying it's more prudent to expect and plan for the potential that bitcoin *could* see mass adoption at any time and it would be far better to allow it that room to grow rather than to let it hit a bottleneck. The reason the agreement was formed in the first place is because of powerful people with dissenting opinion who could not come to a compromise.

I keep the spending money I acquired prior to my vacation separate from that because in a legal sense it carries no ties to my investment and I have proof of that. Simple compliance.

No but if a large portion of the industry decides to say it *is* bitcoin and convinces the majority public of this, who's to say it doesn't become bitcoin?
 ETH and ETC are a prime example of this actually happening.
 You could say that is illegal but with no recourse (do you think the world's governments would touch this?) I'm not sure how that would play out ultimately.

Complaints about poor code and centralization aside, there is no real reason not to upgrade to 2mb. If the network doesn't produce full blocks with 2mb then all this BS about centralization of nodes is moot. If it *does* produce full blocks then the upgrade was necessary (barring spam) and the people complaining about it and refusing to run it (core included) are hampering the growth of the network and should be 'removed' as such anyway. If they want to run a stagnant chain with a different PoW (changes bitcoin DNA entirely) then all the best to them.

You repurchasing the same amount of coin after a purchase doesn't negate the sell pressure created when the service handling the coins dumps them onto an exchange.. Especially if you purchase said bitcoin *after* you make the purchase from a merchant with bitcoin. 
 In fact if you want to use it as such there is no difference between buying the bitcoin you are going to use to make a purchase with immediately before the purchase and what you have suggested, other than the fact that you are purchasing the bitcoin first and creating buy pressure prior to the sell pressure you will create by handing it off to a merchant who converts to fiat, whether using a service or directly.

After watching bitcoin cash get pumped back up to .2+ on low volume I'm not so sure. I am not staunchly supporting 2x (fully) but as an investor with a not insignificant sum sitting in bitcoin I am as nervous as anyone else about all this. Core has supported and protected the network from day one obviously, but I'm worried about the devs becoming fractured between supporting the 2x fork *if* it becomes status quo versus those who would stay on the 1mb chain out of principle.
 We need a miracle here. I hope segwit and LN can convince these miners and businesses to hold off for at least a few more months somehow but I doubt it since their incentive lies primarily in huge fees right now. I don't think they are really trying to 'steal the network' though. Just flex their apparent muscle at the displeasure of being told no to an increase for so long, no matter how veiled the action is.
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:34:27

The actual tweet is stupid af too.
 Right now the network is not full. The mempool getting spammed proves that if the network does end up seeing enough real world volume, 1mb block size will not be enough. Proliferation can *only* happen if the network scales up to meet that demand and while it has not been necessary thus far I cringe at the idea of someone being able to influence and ultimately stall the size upgrade when it does become necessary.

The reason people refuse to spend it is because they *know* it's deflationary. The average person has enough fiat money to buy whatever they potentially need and even some of the things they don't need but simply want. The NY times article suggesting bitcoin could become the millenial generations equivalent of pension plans hit the nail right on the head. At least in my opinion. 
 You don't see old people trading in their pension for groceries. Well I mean you do but it's when the pension starts paying out later. But, if they *could* sell their pension for groceries at age 40 I don't think *any* of them would be doing it unless they absolutely HAD to for survival.

@_date: 2017-08-19 02:05:40
That was covered by the whitepaper and involves pruning..  Also an end game scenario wherein mass user adoption has taken place and the network has grown to the point it is *literally* impossible for the average person to run a node.. Nowhere near necessary..
From the whitepaper ; 
 "It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for
himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,
and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it."
 "As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more
vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to
confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification."

That actually helps support my argument. If you spend coins you bought 2-3 years ago and have earned over 100% profit on you incur taxes.

You can refute statistics but it's actually impossible to beat bots and market makers in day trading consistently. You either get extremely lucky or you go bust. Mid level trading in itself (taking a 5% or 10% gain and exiting for long periods if not permanently) is not the same as day trading and plenty of people can turn the odd profit doing an in and out flip. Those are not even traders by most standards.

The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.

The metaphor holds. An engine can last over a million miles with proper care and maintenance so long as it is not abused. Similarly your DRAM chips and GPU will operate for many years without failure barring the odd man out or a factory error. The strain of having to operate at full or near-full capacity will most definitely reduce the lifespan of either type of machine. In closing I will simply postulate that a metaphor is not to be taken literally or at face value because that completely defeats the purpose of a metaphor to begin with. It's akin to missing the point of a joke and berating the person telling it because you don't get it. Ignorance at best.

How so? The only reason it had majority hash was the insane number of blocks coming out so quickly. The DAA will put a halt to all this by ensuring BCH blocks are mined every 10 mins as per bitcoin itself. This means there is no incentive to mine BCH for the majority of miners, meaning the switching between BTC and BCH mining comes to an end for the majority. If 20% of miners stick around to mine BCH after the DAA is enabled that doesn't really matter. The only reason the attack worked in the first place was the speed of blocks in BCH being up to 100x or more than bitcoin itself.
 This is going to end poorly for anyone holding BCH once the billionaires and miners step away from it.

The only reason BCH exists is to feed it's masters BTC. They control so much BCH and BTC they can pump the price to whatever they want. They control 90% of the volume and shake out anybody who buys it. They need to do it slowly though because after each pump the noobs become wise to it and you can't take BTC from the leftover BCH bag holders who have no BTC left. They wait a few months between pumps to allow the pool of noob traders to reaccumulate with fresh blood. It's what sharks do.

Most of them have almost no volume so they 'survive' by not having anyone around hodling them to sell. Cant dump a coin you never bought in the first place. Also the whole idea behind most of these ICOs. The company holds most of the ICO coins and buys the ones they sell back from the ppl who do buy them during the trade period(s). That way you collect cash from the pre sale and the launch then shake out investors who panic sell. You get cash and freedom from the obligations to investors if you do it right. Most of the companies these ICO are backing are either fraudulent scams or non materializing bodies you are purchasing intellectual or property rights over.

If 250 BTC was all it took to manipulate the price we would be done for already. Do you know what a market maker is? Go to hitBTC and scroll down to the very bottom of the page and click on 'market makers'. This is collusion. It takes time to shake out weaker traders and their bots but it can happen at *any price point* if you control a majority share of the market and work in collusion with exchanges.

Everyone is hysterical over a drop, like yo it literally JUST jumped over 10k *TODAY*.. it gained over 10% in a matter of hours. This is alt coin territory. I am surprised it broke 10 and held so strong. Do you not remember 5k? It crossed over and happily meandered for a while then dropped like a damn stone way below because people had waiting sells and psychology kicked in on the slide. Panic and profit taking go hand in hand.

I basically halted the bch rally at .22 last Thurs when I executed a large buy order right into the sell book at hitBTC. The bots smashed the price back down to compensate and lock me out of profit. I held into the weekend and sold on Sun at a 15% loss. It was an experiment and a learning experience. No tether involved though, just good old fashioned BTC. I have the data I needed and I am pretty happy with the result so lose-win I suppose.

I can concede that bitcoin in its current state cannot provide the liquid sanctuary we need to completely alleviate the potential of a worldwide economic crisis but if that crisis does come along in due time right now the only solution even close to viable is bitcoin. You can't rely on things like gold or food stores to provide liquid value if the whole system breaks down and dollars become useless. That's the reason we have money to begin with, because barter trading sucks. It used to be "beans, bullets and bandages" but now it's "beans, bullets, bandages and bitcoin".

In it's heyday, mcxNOW and it's creator(s) actually floated and implemented the idea for tether on the exchange. The person(s) behind the Realsolid identity spoke of a unit pegged to USD and only traded at mcxNOW. This materialized into mcx bux. I know that exchange was long known to be somewhat of a scam exchange and the cryptos available there were solely made for the purposes of pumping and dumping - mincoin and the now lost solidcoin bearing the handle of the individual(s) responsible. Realsolid even claimed for years he had plans to implement his (their) 'microcash' ('cash', coincidence? I doubt it.) crypto which was supposedly far superior to bitcoin. They (Realsolid) were even talking about starting their own country possibly in NZ somehow or maybe in international waters. Sounds an awful lot like what Ver has been spouting off about lately, starting his own country..
 Anyway, I know there was ample warning from the community about Realsolid, mcxNOW and Ver already when the exchange was active and even prior to it so I am not saying it came as a surprise when the exchange shuttered and most of the cryptos traded there either crashed or literally dissolved (solidcoin / microcash) and the community at large had been warning people about him (them) for a long time before the exchange even opened...
 But I would love to see or hear one day about the criminals responsible for that exchange being arrested and charged with some form of fraud.  One way or the other I have strong feelings this is all connected. I think Realsolid might have been a conglomerate personality between Craig Wright (Realsolid claimed to be living in Australia), Roger Ver and whomever they payed to be their code master(s),. The end result is that I still have technical ownership of 200 solidcoins (wanted an anchor to be able to make potential claims or inquiries against mcxNOW and the owner operator(s) should they be liable and currently likely very wealthy) and an itch to find these people.
 I'm not certain of any of this 100% obviously but it all lines up in typical fashion. I think if anyone were looking for the people responsible for USDT they should start with Realsolid, mcxNOW and the unusually similar ideas put forth there. In fact they even had their own little pump and dump group called altclub, the twitter is even still semi active  ...

Not impossible. You can send them to the wrong address and if that address is not in use but does still exist your coins are lost forever, or until someone manages to generate the private key to that wallet. If you send to the correct address though and with no fee or too small a fee, it will be dropped from the mem pool eventually and returned to your original wallet which you sent from.

Market cap is not accurate outside of stock trading. The global m1 is also a poor way to compare value in a given system because value is not derived by total 'dollars in the system'.. It's the velocity of inflow vs outflow and the accepted price as decided by the majority of people who agree to and execute purchase orders of the most recent trade. No amount of sell pressure can stop it from rising if the status quo is buying at any price.

Relax, they are not actually capable of a flippening and they know that. They are trying to force real volume into BCH any way they can. They control so much of it and since bitmain ASICboost works on BCH they have reason to make it valuable and keep it that way. Their claims of a flippening and the manipulation of BCH prices are only to attract traders into the volatility. It's FUD. They created the ultimate PnD alt coin so of course they are going to do everything they can to keep it alive and thriving. They *need* BTC to survive. The goal is to continuously leech BTC using BCH markets so they can continue to control and manipulate BTC markets even when institutional level investors begin moving in.

There will be a massive scramble by governments and banks to capture as much of it as possible. Private institutions are already chasing it. The failsafe gaurding against the possibility of not being able to stop or destroy it is just to buy it all cheap while you still can. The question is how far do you go? It's a catch 22 because you might tip the scale far enough that it actually does start to cause mass hysteria and do damage to fiat and all govs and banks not holding it. Then it's a domino effect as literally everyone is stepping over their own mother to get it. Soylent green if you will. We will devour ourselves like drug addicts and society might actually collapse. Rebalancing global wealth is a fucked up thought if everything goes apeshit out of control. War and poverty on a scale not witnessed since WW1 could occur. You either get organized elitism or total chaotic anarchy. Look at Libya without Gaddafi.

 I think Roger and co. saw the writing on the wall, CME will come and steal his ability to manipulate and PnD bitcoin and he needs to put on one last show to make sure he has a second bitcoin (bch) to control when the shit hits the fan.

We've tested 8k twice now. The fact that it dipped to 5500 should have been your warning sign that this was about to happen.

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:04:06
lol wtf sort of formula is price x difficulty? You're straight up talking out your ass now. Verbal diarrhea. The number of blocks being produced is 100% dependent on the difficulty, difficulty algorithm and the hashrate. It has nothing to do with price at all. If you can mine a dozen blocks in 10 mins and the price is higher than 10% of bitcoin price, you turn profit over what you would have if you had mined bitcoin and won the single block. The fact that the diff was oscillating on BCH meant the biggest miners were able to turn a profit over bitcoin mining. If BCH is only producing blocks every 10 mins then there is literally no reason for the largest miners to continue mining at a price lower than 1:1 vs bitcoin. One block every 10 mins is one block every 10 mins, the only difference is the price.
 The true reason for the DAA is to make mining BCH attractive to smaller miners whilst simultaneously solving the difficulty oscillations causing large disparity and fluctuation between block times.
 It's in coordination with the massive dump happening *right now* as the billionaires and miners who pumped BCH over the weekend make their final exit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:28:38
The EDA was not a good solution because you had blocks coming very fast then they might take 12 hours each after EDA kicks in to raise difficulty. They are solving that with DAA. They knew the fast blocks would make a pump possible so they coordinated an attack on BTC to do one last big pump on BCH.

Growth like this was eclipsed in the run up to 1.2k during the Gox manipulation days. Guess what: people were still buying at those prices. It took the collapse of the exchange and the loss of all the coins held there to tank the price, rightly so.

This fr though. They are not Gox and are not being run by corrupt idiots subversively stealing funds. The funds that *were* lost / stolen were repaid to customers and the exchange was running fine up until Wells Fargo decided to put a stop on their accounts.
The price is unusually high at Bitfinex for now because people are removing their funds via bitcoin purchase then tx out of exchange, obviously.
 This will all end if / when they sort their USD accounts with Wells Fargo and things should return to normal. IE all exchanges will return to their usual price points within relation to Bitfinex.

Literally the opposite of Gox albeit the situations that led to the 'hack' in the former were insiders and overall poor business practice by amateurs (looking at you Karpeles).

In case anyone is wondering, the French and German flags are at war because of Battlefield 1 and it's community. Specifically because the 'They Shall Not Pass' DLC has released within the last week which features battles in and around Verdun.
If anyone is considering buying Battlefield 1 or already has the game and is considering buying the DLC; I highly recommend purchasing it.

Fiat is printed and controlled by governments and institutions. Bitcoin is minted by private investors who own mining equipment, insofar is also secured by said miners due to the inherent rising difficulty of the cryptography and hash power required to mine it. It's a sovereign currency / digital asset that is *not* controlled by anyone or anything aside from the people who hold it, those who mine it and the free market which decides what it's current value is. You can use it to purchase *anything*, not just trade it for dollars. It's value is intrinsic *AND* inherent. 
 If you can't see the difference between a government issued inflationary currency and a sovereign deflationary currency asset class then you seriously need to sit down, study and attempt to understand monetary policy, economics and finance. Otherwise nobody can help you and you shouldn't really be here posting. I mean you can if you want but you'll sound like an idiot as you clearly have already.

You are forgetting that ASIC efficiency continues to increase whereas the bottom line of miners and the actual number of miners is limited. I doubt bitcoin mining will ever have the capacity to consume enough electricity to be a major draw vs something like a world class city. We have to look at a city like New York for comparison which draws roughly 60 billion kilowatt-hours per year. And that is only one city. I do not think the limited scope of businesses in mining given the industrial scale and nature of current mines will grow beyond niche.
 If bitcoin does gain real traction and ends up being used as a global payment solution, a trusted smart contract generator, and a way for un-banked individuals worldwide to take control of their assets digitally... Then I think the price will forever outstrip the miners ability to even produce enough equipment to make consumption a major problem into the future. Moore's law would reinforce this sentiment.

Rofl you have to be absolutely *stupid* to think they will stay intrinsically bound and price linked. After a certain point value will outrun the mere ability of miners to even produce enough equipment or equipment powerful enough to use the electricity they could potentially pay for. It has already happened in the past, but due to obvious evolution in ASIC equipment and the exponential growth of the Chinese (mining) industry the disparity has shifted back toward consumption meeting value (price) to counter ROI.

Now imagine you could send that apple to anyone on earth at any time in the blink of an eye (apple network permitting).
Imagine oranges employing multiple layers of networks that create orange juice flows and smart contracts governing them (and a lot of other things in time).
 Imagine you could layer as much transparency or anonymity onto these oranges as you like with orange apps, side oranges and even alt oranges that look, smell and taste exactly like real oranges. In some ways these abundant side and alt oranges are even better than real oranges.
Now imagine the oranges are a sovereign currency that governments and banks have no issuing authority over. Like if you own an orange you truly *own* that damn orange.

That calculation is ridiculous for a number of reasons but most notably because the price per Kwh is not fixed nor regulated *anywhere*. Free power is attainable for some, subsidies for others, while many have to do with the fact that they live in a place where the price of electricity is a major limiting factor to their entrance into the market.
 The bitcoin industry and those willing to invest in mining at any point rivals that of actual rise in value according to use cases and real world adoption and will continue to see parity for some time to come. If and when a singularity occurs within the space and worldwide adoption spikes to institutional levels (govts, banks and multinational exchanges) the speed and velocity of rise in price will be impossible to assume. But I can promise you there are not enough producers of mining equipment *nor will there be* due to the monopolization of said industry. The R&amp;D costs on designing and building an ASIC in relative volume and the risks it carry are things no traditional sector nor counterparts are at all willing to take. The time it takes to design and build them itself would keep (the mining industry) from catching up to market prices in terms of overhead expenditure. As in you will literally not be able to develop, produce and operate enough ASIC miners (industry wide) to even allow parity of power consumption vs market price point. 
 And so in that, you are correct. The miners who control majority hashpower at the time will be vastly wealthy and will not be *physically capable* of spending it all on more miners nor electricity to power them. The industry producing these devices will not be substantial enough no matter how profitable mining *or* producing miners becomes. There are physical limits to these things. There is also an extreme lack of individuals and businesses interested in entrance to the mining industry and exponential rises in the price of bitcoin will not convince the FinTech industry to dabble in mining and the private sector has already been capitalized. Anybody who comes along now, corp or otherwise, will just be taking the reigns from those in power today. There will be no paradigm shift though and as the industry grows the price relative to the cost of power consumption therefore will not continue to correlate as it does now.

@_date: 2017-04-13 20:49:11
You most accurately described what I am trying to convey with the point about production itself becoming a bottleneck. But further than that I don't see a realistic number of entrants to the mining industry in general to create a serious problem for those already controlling the monopoly on hardware (Bitmain). Insofar I also don't believe they have come close to or will ever exhaust their own capital in the production of chips nor the R&amp;D of new chips. 
 If someone else does come along and stifle their control of the mining industry though (aside from pools which do not inherently produce equipment) I see the same outcome for that entity. The price of electricity can rise or drop but *if* bitcoin becomes what it is / was destined to, I think the actual value per coin will make it impossible for a miner to spend all their profit on more equipment or R&amp;D due to the sheer amount of time it takes to advance the technology and actually produce said equipment. It's definitely good for any miner and producer of mining equipment should they sit within the upper echelon of the industry (today and in the future). It's basically akin to being the FED but you have no control over total production of assets nor the issuance of those assets other than finding and receiving block rewards. 
 In a perfect system where everyone had the same outlook and entrance (to the mining industry) in which the landscape was fair and transparent I think you'd be absolutely correct. But as bitcoin is so volatile and untested and as there are so many detractors to the actual attempting to create and field mining equipment I just don't see any major players entering the space to mine within the context of what you're suggesting. I don't think it will ever reach consuming 10% of the worlds total electricity production either. Maybe regionally, especially in China, but that would be a push at best. As it is there are regions in the country I live engaging in actively selling electricity to our neighbor down south because we just have way too much of it.

Bitfinex short positions far outnumber longs right now for whatever reason. Sometimes when you invest in a security or commodity you open short positions as a hedge in case your investment falls. This way even if bitcoin does not moon you are at least recovering some of your investment if not profiting.

There's incentive on the merchant side because credit handlers usually charge a 1%-2% fee to do business over their network *with every transaction*. If a merchant decides to offer a similarly sized discount if the customer uses cryptocurrency for their purchase the incentive is passed on to the customer. The merchant could even split the cost savings 50/50 with the customer for a win - win situation. If you are buying a candy bar that isn't a big deal but larger purchases would definitely be viable.

I've been through 90% losses on this one too, if I didn't cut and run then.. Well. Does it need to be said really? 
 
 I am not a trader, I'm an investor. You could try to say I'm a bad one but does a bad investor bail on something they beleive in? And I mean beleive in as an aside to the price itself. I'm fully aware the price can and will get hammered periodically. I mean I actually enjoy having a piece of the network's tokens to myself. But despite that entirely does a bad investor make investments that net 1000% (paper or realized) profit?  
 I think it's worth something. 
 
 P.S. Just before things went completely apeshit the overall atmosphere in the community was that Bitcoin had just overcome some serious hurdles which were hindering growth and subsequently price as a side effect. Bcash had lost it's second major attack against Bitcoin and the price of bitcoin rose above $8k for the first time. Subsequently the anticipation of the Vegeta meme took over and it materialized into reality. The unintended consequence of the meme was massive hype causing bitcoin to begin going viral once again, this time the likes of which we had never seen. The momentum caused the price to breach $10k rapidly. The media caught wind of this and quickly published news articles across multiple major venues. The price exploded. Tether is being accused of acting as devil's advocate but I am beginning to suspect this was all based on major hype and the crash to current levels is an obvious correction perhaps but not confirmed to be largely orchestrated by massive hedge funds and potentially institutional level investment banks.  
 The price was quiet and comfortable around $8k. It might cut below that floor for a period but I don't think it could go much lower. Maybe $7k? Tone Vays estimated $7500 so there's that but... Who really *actually* knows for sure? Not you or I, friendo.

Soon it won't be. Don't you notice cars and trucks are using far less fuel and creating far fewer emissions than before? Standards in first world nations mean fuel efficiency will continue to rise until potential energy released is near 100% and all of said energy is used with near 100% efficiency. That would mean a gallon of fuel could power your car for thousands of miles. Even heavy equipment would require exponentially less fuel to operate. 
 That isn't even taking into consideration the fact that electric vehicles are beginning to proliferate and electric will likely be the powertrain of choice for most all consumer vehicles and equipment going forward. You can assume third world countries will take a lot longer to conform but the revolution will force their hand. They will not be able to find oil or gas cheap enough to make it economically viable to choose over an electric vehicle or piece of equipment or machinery.

Try 150 satoshi / byte or $2.65 USD for a 'median transaction'  if you're in a rush and need to guarantee confirmation in the next 10 minutes. If you aren't in a rush to confirm then transactions under 5 satoshi / byte have been clearing frequently in the last few days. That basically makes the day to day single output transactions of the average Joe practically free.  
  
  Thanks for guessing though.

Not sure why dude deleted his comment but I wrote a detailed explanation so I will leave it here. I hope you were replying to the comment about gold / bitcoin price comparison.  
 Gold is a heavy element that doesn't have a global transactional network backing it. I mean the infrastructure for gold trade obviously exists but try to do anything with it other than sell it or make jewelry or contacts for electronics / computer chips. It's useful for certain very specific applications. The diamond market is actually an even better example. The applications for diamond are essentially just jewelry and as a coating for tools or in rare circumstances as an abrasive in powder form. A simple google search will reveal plenty of info as to why diamonds cost what they do - regulation through monopoly by one specific entity who controls basically all diamond mining and trade in one form or another. 
 Bitcoin has immaterial uses that drive far, far beyond the limits of simple elements.

Either both drop off the mempool because neither ever gets picked up by a miner or one of them does get picked up and the other one is nullified. The rules make it impossible for both to confirm. The negative balance is just accounting for the double spend and waiting for one of the transactions to confirm or for both to drop off.

Many people do try to use TA as a prediction model but I agree that it's not effective in crypto. Moon math is constantly changing.. But some of us look at the growth potential instead of using traditional TA to predict. In that I am not even trying to predict really but instead looking at what could be possible with little to no expectation. I see adoption levels at plateau for this period and into the mid term but the lack of an ETF, formal regulation and major institutions onboarding themselves and their clientele screams that this is far from over. It's more like a pause for now under the pressure of consolidation.

52% cumulative inflation compounded over 20 years.. $4bn in 1998 was worth 52% more then than it is today. Not a massive difference considering if Nvidia had put $4bn into a 3% annual return GIC or savings vehicle they would have made up the difference and then some. Which is to say it's not a huge amount of inflation all things considered. Still higher than the reported national average year over year inflation though. I believe the US govt claims around 2% a year.. They *did* have a recession mid way through the 20 year period though which might help to explain it. 
 Regardless, it took Nvidia 20 years. It's impressive that Bitmain can do it at such a fledgling time in the crypto industry.

Russia didn't really win so much as Hitler lost.. He decided it was intelligent to ignore most of his generals and allowed the allies access to the fatherland by attempting to fight across two fronts. He also left the Afrika Korps to be stranded and defeated. The Japanese too share major blame in the ultimate demise of the axis by attracting the full attention of America's war effort. The entire attack on Pearl Harbor itself was only marginally successful as fourteen of the seventeen vessels damaged or sunk actually returned to service. The Japanese invasion of the Phillipines was far more atrocious in my opinion.

They are almost all manipulated pre mined pump and dump coins and it is VERY easy to fake volume with participation of exchanges. All you need is your own shitty alt chain and an exchange to list it. If you have 5 BTC you can do it and fake 1000s of BTC volume per day by passing coins back and forth to yourself. Some exchanges even give you a discount on fees if you cut them in on your scam coin so you can fake volume for free. Go to hitBTC and scroll down to the bottom of the page then click on the market makers link to see for yourself.

Are you kidding? The only places that would happen are third world countries.. Growth in first world nations can be easily sustainable without oil. The progression to renewable sources and green energy along with new synthetics formed of rubber or vegetable glycerins means crude oil is all but dead.  
 The Saudis have seen the writing on the wall, that's why they said fuck OPEC and smashed prices down so low nobody else could profit. Now their supply is dwindling and within 10 years their economy will fold. They are scrambling to secure weapons contracts with whatever liquid assets they hold because that's basically their only way to retain power and order after the money runs out. They are going to become a second hand Afghanistan with a nominally more (internally) powerful government. They had better hope they can continue to weaponize religion as a form of control over the people.

Well keep up the good work and be careful cause it can take off over night literally. When it ran past $9k for the first time it had been stagnating and dropping for weeks prior due to a bcash attack and miners abandoning the chain. I think the rise was organised largely by futures contract holders on an institutional level. They bought short contracts after slowly accumulating BTC to hedge the shorts. The runup to $20k and the bloodletting after were execution of a long timed plan months in the making. And guess what? Now they are piling into long contracts lol. Might be why the price is flat and declining even as the mempool has cleared along with most of the FUD being debunked and a lot of positive news coming in. They are accumulating again.
 
 There's also a lot of money flowing into GBTC and potentially ETF's coming, those funds will be holding massive amounts of BTC if they are asset backed and they will likely never sell those coins - just issue IOUs for cash value of the coins to individual investors of the ETF.

Why does Lil Uzi Vert feel the need to lambast people older than him just *because* they are older than he is? I mean I guess it's somewhat adolescent but it's the dream car on posters in bedrooms. It represents everything responsibility and sensibility do not. Asking how or why the dream should materialize in congruence to similar dreams observed by many bitcoin investors in relation to the dream of bitcoin going to the moon - is like asking why bitcoin should have value when it is essentially backed by nothing. Hopes and dreams built on the back of this wonderful, world changing technology were trump cards in Satoshi's arsenal. He built deflation into the system to seed the future with at least marginal hope that some of the people investing in bitcoin would be in it for the long haul even if that meant accepting certain levels of stalwart greed. Like HODL, Lambo has become an integral part of the current (mainstream?) crypto culture. It's a dream built on a dream through the visionary thoughts of a forward thinking genius.

Volume of outputs is up actually. More transactions are being batched after the most recent PSA about spam and inefficient  transactions.   
 Merchants actually *do* pay up to 2% in fees for handling credit card network transactions a la carte. The cost of doing business with creditors is high enough to make cryptocurrency a viable alternative as it is. The merchants can then pass savings on to customers to help attract more patronage or enjoy the 'free' income they otherwise would not. The variable fee you pay miners to handle your bitcoin transaction is tantamount to the ideological freedom of being able to control your own money. It's use cases speak for themselves. 
 The average person can embrace it or not but the true value of a widely accepted and supported *decentral* cryptocurrency is the capability it puts in users hands to circumvent traditional closed channels and systems. Banking for those in places where it barely exists. Freedom for merchants to be able to sell goods and services over the internet without being gouged by banks or credit handlers. Freedom for those who seek it to hide or obscure wealth for *whatever reason* - cryptocurrency does not discriminate. It can be used for good or nefarious purposes. It's these users whom benefit the most that will acknowledge and welcome it.  
By the masses there are obviously those of us (many) seeking to invest in cryptocurrency as a speculative instrument. By and far, the potential crypto holds is infinitely greater than the sum of a few hundred billion dollars. That's as easy to see as the words you're reading right now.

 The price has little to do with what bitcoin can do for the unbanked anyway. They would benefit at any price because bitcoin is highly divisible. Even if a coin costs ten million dollars a single satoshi will only cost ten cents.

Blockchain.info has stated they will split the coins and allow users control of their coins on both blockchains. The only stipulation is the naming of the coins which relies on the blockchain with most proof of work. Either way as long as the user understands which chain is which they should have the ability to safely transact on both chains. Whether or not they (blockchain.info) are competent enough to pull off the split without mistakes is another caveat. I know there are ways to split the coins even without replay protection, but I personally will be waiting until I am certain the split is done effectively and safely before transacting anything on the 2x chain. I want to see testimonial here and elsewhere from users that have successfully moved 2x before I even consider moving any.

That's why I said ETH and Monero have use cases. People have used ETH as a cheaper alternative to BTC for shuttling crypto between exchanges when BTC was plagued by inefficiencies in the batching of transactions largely caused by the exchanges mentioned. Albeit manipulation of fees and the clogging of the mempool by nefarious actors cannot be ruled out it was also inconlusive - at least as far as hard provable evidence goes. And obviously Monero for anonymous transactions. 
 Every other coin is useless or not an actual decentralized cryptocurrency. Between the three, all possible active use cases that *would be used* on large scale by the masses have been satisfied. Inventing some shitcoin that has an arbitrary use for a small group that may or may not actually be using it happens every day, that's why I said 99.9% are in fact useless scams, whether it be the intent of their creators or not.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:14:09
In a literal sea of garbage coins there are maybe 5 currently that are actually useful for anything outside bitcoin. Monero for anonymity, ETH for smart contracts and vertcoin for an honest mining community. I see some possible potential in the claims of a few other coins like IoTA but for the time being they are just that - *claims*. The internet of things could more or less do without a coin claiming it's somehow useful or relevant but only in name. It's foolish to think integration into any sort of automated closed system is a granted. Out of what, thin air?  
 There are thousands of coins out there not including ICOs (those are not crypto, they are just digital securities wrapped in a tokenization system). I challenge you to name at least 5 that will actually be useful or even used at all in 3 years, not including the 3 I already mentioned. I don't think you can. You will probably just post 3 shitcoins / scam coins or not respond with any at all because there basically are none.

It should be fairly quick after the fork but they did also stipulate that they would be waiting to observe 'stability' on both chains before they implement their process of splitting and allowing the users to move on both chains. I think this is a fair approach because nobody really knows what will happen in the hours, days and weeks after the fork occurs. Blockchain.info is just protecting their users by holding off until one of the chains is confirmed as dominant.

The funniest part is they failed to win the short contracts, the price held strong above $9k until after they were called *then* dipped in the following days. So those fuckers crashed the price and won their BTC hedge profit but lost on the contracts. Now they're opening long contracts and trying to suppress prices so they can reaccumulate. I'm getting sick of it but if they pump it to $100k you won't hear me complaining. I assume all the detractors will go silent too.

Syntax and semantics aside the actual 'story' is far too basic and fails to convince. The idea that bitcoin was originally intended as a workaround to supplant gamblers the ability to circumvent traditional wire channels and credit handlers is the swansong. Therein lies the doubt. The existence of p2p cash would have no impact on a gambler who wagers using credit and would not sway in the (gambling) establishments favor the actions of those customers who do / did wish to use credit cards to wager. Those people would not jump through hoops to continue participating in their gambling as such and if they would at the time it would have made far more sense to just wire the cash they would spend on bitcoin at an establishment that accepts wire transfers instead. In that case using bitcoin just becomes an unnecessary step making the entire process more cumbersome.

He's right, I said most but by your description you are implying I said they are *all* useless. And I never made a point to highlight or warn anyone about investing in alts so I'm not sure why you felt the need to imply I did or that I should have? I straight up said most of them are useless which is true. Considering the context I was speaking to (second layers and sidechains making alts largely irrelevant and even *more* useless going forward into the future) I'd say you're grasping at straws. Even things like total anonymity and instant cross chain swaps will soon be possible with bitcoin itself.

Most altcoins have no actual uses though, replacing them in this case is impossible. We can try to steal whatever manipulated market share they supposedly hold but that's about it. And since they are almost all manipulated pump and dump schemes they will continue to exist and operate albeit the return will likely dry up. It does not mean they will simply disappear though.

Credit cards are a quick and easy way to pay for something for the customer, merchants often have to pay a fee to do business with a credit handler. So while this would be a boon for merchants I don't see it bringing the average person any closer to deciding on using bitcoin instead of credit. As long as you pay off the minimum balance every month credit cards oft have no fee to use and offer rewards in some cases. 
 This will be useful for merchants who want to increase their own patronage by offering a discount of equal value to whatever the savings would be (for the merchant) over cost of having to do the transaction using a credit handler. If I could save 2% on a big ticket purchase just by using cryptocurrency that would be reason enough for me to consider it.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:16:43
That depends on what you consider a rollback. It would take a completely stopped blockchain to warrant a rollback and you'd have to convince everyone participating with / on that blockchain that the rollback was the only option to resuscitate the chain. Even then overall confidence would be shaken. The majority of participants would likely cash out whatever value they could and avoid that blockchain, wherein if we are talking about bitcoin that would mean the breakdown and metaphorical (true) death of the system. It would be the most damaging event that could possibly happen. It's literal suicide as-is if you roll the chain back.
 That's not to say it would be completely disused. It would still have value of some sort but this whole global payments system / digital store of wealth / visa competitor potential goes out the window entirely. It would basically revert to the levels of speculation and usage seen in late 2012 - early 2013. That's my opinion.
 Could it recover from there? Maybe. In fact it's likely it would in some form or fashion, but it would take a long time and possibly / probably a whole bunch of forks and new chains to land on and decide which one is trustworthy,. I mean the entire act of rolling back a chain is just basically taking a checkpoint and trying to sell everyone using the blockchain to use that checkpoint / chain as the new defacto 'true' chain. It's much worse than a contentious hard fork.

This math is confusing me though. I have nearly half of the total bitcoin you have but I payed significantly more (260%) than you payed for each coin.

In terms of market capitalization it's completely relevant. It doesn't really matter what you are comparing the value to when you have no base to make an assumption from. You can definitely short bitcoin if you can find someone willing to lend you enough of it to keep the market price consistently depressed for long enough. The problem is nobody has enough coins. 
 That's got nothing to do with how large a bitcoin based derivatives market could get. It's a single asset.

I think the only thing holding banks and a lot more common individual citizens of all nationalities back from becoming actively vested is regulation and ease of access. Institutions are hard pressed to pass up an asset class that has seen 100% returns as consistently as bitcoin. The technology is just too young and too hard to get into for most people and banks have boards and directors and policies to follow. They can't just up and buy it out of nowhere.
 If there was a bridge somewhere between banks and individuals willing to invest, and institutional investors speculating as they usually do with things like ETF and derivatives... I don't see why these exponential growth patterns won't continue at least for the time being as it grows.

I don't think too many banks are actively suppressing bitcoin but there are likely either really powerful bitcoin whales trying to capture more of the market crashing it or miners battling each other to capture as much profit as possible with disregard to the price.

 Your definition of ownership aside, bitcoin is controlled by anyone who has *access* to the private keys of any given wallet. Therefore it doesn't matter who 'owns' it, if people have your keys (as in custodial manner) they can do whatever they want with your bitcoins.

I disagree about the housing market in Canada but agree about the currency devaluation bit at the end. The Canadian dollar is taking a hammering right now and with Trump declaring war on soft lumber and dairy imported from Canada I see reason to believe things will only get worse for the loonie from here. But that has a lot to do with the oil industry taking a shit because of the damn Saudis and their "we will be the only ones" attitude in crashing the fuck out of the oil market. Those cunts made it impossible to turn profit on oil ventures and in doing so basically commit suicide because Saudi oil money only goes so far (5-10 years?) they don't have trillions in cash and their oil production itself will eventually become too expensive to be viable. Mix that with green energy and electric vehicle proliferation and oil producing countries will be out of luck. Oil will only be used for things like making plastics and rubbers, and used in poor countries that have lax regulation and populations who cannot afford modern technology. 
 The Canadian dollar was largely resource backed and resources continue to take a beating all around.. Therefore I think everyone in Canada needs to start considering foreign investment or at least safe havens like gold and guaranteed investments with one of their 'big five' banks. 
 They should also consider putting a little bit of their portfolio in bitcoin.

The whole point of having a sovereign currency backed by *public trust* is you *don't* need to run your own node to have access to the system. As long as there is a large number of nodes running segwit2x along with 90% of the miners and (varying) economic node support, there is no reason to think it will cause a problem. People are just creating an echo chamber and regurgitating opinions formed by their perspective alignment.
 The non segwit2x chain will stall and freeze, as in blocks won't be found or mined because the difficulty is so high that 10%-20% of current mining hashrate will not be enough to crank out blocks every 10 mins. And since a lot of the coins being mined and sold to the big exchanges in China will come from pro segwit2x mines, I'm fairly certain Bitfinex and the smaller Chinese exchanges will begin trading segwit2x coins exclusively if they don't include trading pairs for both segwit2x and non segwit2x bitcoin.

If bitcoin ends up going mainstream one day and tx are at VISA network levels, theoretically the block size would need to scale to about 32mb even with LN enabled.
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:50:23
You think exchanges are going to continue calling a dead chain bitcoin? Or do you think they will just choose to use the halted, frozen chain and refuse the segwit2x chain altogether?
 What makes you think the businesses who's livelihood depend on transaction volume will choose the chain who can't find blocks, and / or changes PoW which turns bitcoin into an alt?

First of all, with LN you still have to tx over the main network. That will *never* change. It allows more volume for now but it won't be viable without a main network blocksize increase if the user base grows exponentially.
Second, the whole point of this debate is whether to increase the size of blocks on the main network. You can't 'implement' 2x in any other way because by definition it's a Bitcoin blocksize increase plain and simple.
 Side chains don't even use blocks within their infrastructure.. That's why it's called lightning. It's instant like VISA..

I'm guessing the cost of renting or using the retail space is much higher in say a mall or a movie theater than some shitty gas station or convenience store. The people in charge of regulating what happens and where inside a mall will also be harder to convince (to allow installation of the bitcoin ATM) than someone who owns an off brand gas station or no-name convenience store.

I think this scaling FUD is mixing with the ICOs spawned by Ether, and they are likely cashing out ETH to BTC or USD directly (probably both since there were so many damn ICOs...)
 But there is no massive breach of trust (at least not on a fraud level) nor huge numbers of coins being stolen / locked up in legal dispute.
 Plus user base within both individual users and businesses is exponentially higher than in late '13

There's only $20m USD on the buy book @ Bitfinex.. How much of an impact do you think they really have on market price? Even if people panic and sell across all platforms I don't see the smart money running off in a hurry. 
When it was clear Gox was in trouble people started rushing the exits in grand fashion. It was a madhouse and we saw 100% swings in some instances. I personally witnessed them @ btc-e and it was pretty hilarious because the trollbox was going wild. More so than usual which says a lot, anybody who knows the trollbox well will tell you. I rate it as the funniest experience of my life. 
 But there are way more people involved and there is way more money bound up in the market right now for it to crash the way it did when Gox came down. And even if it does crash because of Bitfinex, the crash will not be nearly as spectacular or long lasting. That's almost certain.

The whole point is he is trying to claim you can implement 2x on a sidechain which by definition is impossible. Segwit2x is for the main network, if you want to create a sidechain with huge blocks that's completely different and has nothing to do with segwit2x... In that segwit itself and lighting must transact over the main chain it makes no sense to say A) implement 2x via a side chain, nor B) that LN can work with a side chain when you clearly need to use the bitcoin network to open and close channels..

@_date: 2017-07-05 18:43:29
What constitutes a user? Everyone has different reasons for buying and 'using' bitcoin but the majority of people buying to *hodl* don't care about 'using' it. They care about the price and not much else. The segwit2x chain will take with it most of the current hashpower and also the majority of economic nodes. Those are the nodes that actually matter, the businesses that have a lot of bitcoin moving through them on a daily basis. The average 'user' that doesn't transact more than 1 bitcoin daily means literally nothing to the actual economic majority. Those claiming the people who don't transact much are the important end of 'consensus' are going to be left behind when the chain splits to segwit2x code. 
 The lack of hashpower will mean the non segwit2x chain will not even be able to mine blocks let alone reach a retarget to alleviate the insane difficulty. It would require a PoW change to fix that which not only would divide the community *much* worse than the scaling debate *ever* would, it is also a direct change to the DNA of bitcoin which would make it an alt both at heart and in general.
 Good luck to anyone who sells their segwit2x coins if there is a split. Refusing to run the code is one thing, you can always change your mind. But idiots who sell their coins confidently are asking for a terrible loss. I say good riddance to those people.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:06:28
Do you not understand the Byzantine generals problem?
 The point is to allow users to transact over the network *without* having their own node, because enough people with real economic incentive *invested in ___ blockchain* will be running nodes to keep the system from becoming centralized. If you don't trust the exchanges and services who make up the majority of volume then why would you trust tens or hundreds of thousands of people just because there are more of them and you (or others) consider them 'the user base'. It's a bit ridiculous.
 I'm an active bitcoin / blockchain advocate and I've been invested in both bitcoin and bitcoin services since Jan 2013. I have *never* owned or operated a node, full or otherwise. I have never had a problem. The average person never will so long as economic market participants are keeping miners in line. And those economic nodes and miners are basically what makes bitcoin. If you want to abandon them or fork off their proposed solution that's you and the rest of the people who make that choice, but make no mistake. You *will* be returning to the days when college kids threw thousands of them around for no reason, because without services accepting your fork coin or miners actually mining blocks, your chain and coin are dead in the water.
 Do you understand how hard it will be to mine blocks once the hash drops so significantly? Do you realize the difficulty is so high that it will stall the network if not halt it outright? And are you unaware that reaching a retarget of said difficulty could prove impossible without the support of the miners who abandon your chain *OR* alternatively, a PoW change which would dramatically alter the DNA of your bitcoin fork, ultimately making it an alt coin?
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:12:10

I just finished clearly explaining that *economic nodes* have chosen segwit2x. There is no bitcoin outside miners and economic nodes. People who buy and hold for no reason other than to profit are not influencing this in any way and have no impact on daily volume. 
 The non segwit2x chain will not even mine blocks, it won't have the hashpower. Nobody is going to buy or use a coin that can't even transfer on the blockchain. Your tx won't go through *at all* because you will get zero confirmations because miners can't find fucking blocks.

While nothing is certain, the last rise and crash was a direct result of manipulation and the ensuing hype that caused Gox to rise to it's famed high and then crash the entire market appropriately when trading froze multiple times as their shoddy servers crashed.
 The fraud and thievery came to light after that and were further strains on an already weakened price.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:55:03
You think people are going to invest in a blockchain that grinds to a halt? 
 The chain transacting is the one that ends up being status quo. If bitcoin ATM and exchanges are trading segwit2x just because non segwit2x chain is frozen or stumbling then speculative buyers end up owning segwit2x coins... 
 And I addressed the PoW change already so I'm not sure why you're bringing that up. It changes the algorithm and DNA of bitcoin entirely. We already have alts, you should go buy litecoin or novacoin (lol) if you want a PoW change.
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:51:08
Most people who buy to hodl or make profit are going to continue to buy whichever bitcoin ends up being dominant. Segwit2x looks like it's going to be.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:28:35
What the fuck are you talking about? The size limit will cause a bottleneck even with LN enabled if enough users are clogging the network. There was discussion about the need to raise the block size to 32mb (with LN enabled) to accommodate volume if bitcoin sees transaction numbers at the same levels that VISA network does.
 The 2x part cannot be 'implemented as a side chain'... 
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:52:13
If he said "the holder of the private keys" instead of "the owner" then you would be correct.
 The way he wrote it makes it seem like the person who originally transferred the bitcoin into the darkweb market wallet still 'owns' the bitcoin by which would be legal definition of law depending on your country and it's laws regarding cryptocurrency.
 It's as simple as changing the word owner to holder or controller or person who controls.

That $20,000 nonsense is FUD.. A number someone pulled from their ass and everyone supporting them ran with.
 Economic nodes matter, not 'users' who have nearly zero to actually zero activity moving through their node. 
 The reason blockchain solves the Byzantine generals problem is *because* you don't need your own node. You rely on those who have actual economic incentive and investment in the blockchain you are using. The key caveat is that centralization is made difficult if not impossible by natural evolution of the market. The more economic nodes there are, the better. In terms of consensus they are the backbone of any blockchain. 
 Anyone *can* run a node without spending more. They just have to accept they will be running a version of bitcoin outside the status quo, which would end up being considered an alt or secondary implementation like the ETH split caused. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:40:34
The average user does not need their own node. The point of public trust in non trusted environments is to allow most people to transact without a node without having to worry about trusting a central organisation. While some might call the big block miners a central group, the market itself has failed to produce a competitor of equal size and depth to Bitmain. Thus, with or without a scaling solution (2x) we are trusting these miners either way. The political reasons behind objecting to an increase are an aside to the fact that in your everyday operations using bitcoin the average user must trust these miners regardless of their alignment.
 The entire debate and the outspoken attack on the solution(s) presented are a direct result of too many voices with too many opinions contradicting each other. At the end of the day we must scale anyway, with or without segwit and the side chains it would enable. The only scrutiny is how much do we scale and when. Right now at the very least I think 2mb should be the minimum because spam or not the network was rammed full and we all suffered for it.
 A bunch of random non economic nodes only hampers the evolution of (any) blockchain. Consensus should not mean people with raspberry pi full nodes can vote down those with actual economic incentive and investment in (a blockchain and it's tokens).
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:56:52
Says who? You can't see into the future and you can't speak for the majority unless you have decisive proof from at least 50% of all economic nodes (the ones that count). Therein you're just touting your own opinion.

You're a moron then. The market cap itself has no impact on the price. It's the other way around. With inflationary bullshit fiat you can easily see a quadrillion dollar market cap as in notional value on derivatives... People pay what they are willing to pay. If the asset becomes insanely scarce it doesn't mean there are not people willing to pay insane prices for it... A penthouse in Manhattan can cost over $100m, does that mean all houses cost $100m and the market cap of houses is quadrillions of dollars? Absolutely not.

Does that mean adjusting the retarget period itself or changing the algorithm somehow to generate blocks faster? As I understand it, the retarget would still force difficulty to change so a block is generated every 10 minutes under current rules. So even if we adjust difficulty, the retarget would occur and change the difficulty back to the 10 minute paradigm,. I assume it would take more than adjusting the retarget period to actually generate blocks in under 10 minutes consistently for a prolonged period of time.
 But that definitely would require a hard fork and it would divide the community way more than a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:41:05
You could have saved yourself the time of posting most of that because the only relevant part was the last thing you said. And that's exactly the point, nobody gives a fuck what the market cap of bitcoin is because nobody is thinking about that when they buy bitcoins, bits or satoshis... They only think in terms of the price. If the price keeps steadily increasing and people are willing to keep paying more for less, eventually the smallest units end up being the nominal value of exchange. 21 million is infinitesimally small for the number of people who could potentially end up using bitcoin one way or another. That's the whole point of 100 million satoshi per bitcoin. There's even musings within Nakamoto's original whitepaper that states the limit may need to be raised in the future due to ultimate scarcity limiting the viability of bitcoin to be used by the unbanked and poorer masses at large...
People can and will decide what they are going to pay for their own piece of this sovereign digital p2p freedom. It's unreasonable to think supply and demand combined with obscene scarcity cannot produce prices upward of 1 cent US per satoshi. 
 The market cap is as useless a calculation as the nominal value of all derivatives which equal over 1.2 quadrillion US dollars.

Economic nodes are showing overwhelming support for this. Those are the nodes that actually matter.
 If a few hundred or even a few thousand individual users who have full nodes but have no real economic traffic moving through them decide not to run the 2mb blocksize increase HF it means they will have consensus on a blockchain not being used for much.

Wait for segwit and lightning network. You will be able to use and transact with bitcoin the way you can with traditional credit products like VISA.

I wouldn't sell either coins if I were you because that is a lot of risk. Might as well hodl both if you're on a see what happens course of action. Seriously, I don't hate either side I am just trying to be real. I don't see a way to avoid miners hard forking to 2mb because they clearly see it's time for the network to grow. If it creates a de-facto group of core supporters who are trying to keep the non segwit2x chain alive that's cool because cryptocurrency is all about freedom to choose and follow consensus. 
 However you have to understand, the most secure chain is the chain with the most hash. It would take a PoW change to keep the non segwit2x chain safe from a 51% attack and the PoW change itself divides the community further in a major way. The non 2x chain will be plagued with issues like not being able to find blocks let alone reach a retarget to lower difficulty. It happened to terracoin even with 30 block retarget intervals and took an update to fix.
 After all that I seriously doubt a non 2x chain (core) can survive with the negative press and fractured community it would create.

That's not the point. It's a stable store of value for day to day transactions. If I need to buy a loaf of bread today using USD I know it won't cost more tomorrow or next week because USD is inflating at a relatively stable rate. The loaf of bread will change prices according to fluctuations in things like the price of wheat and the cost of gasoline to transport the wheat to a mill to make flour then from the flour mill to a factory bakery where workers pump out the bread then finally to a grocery store... But no matter what happens the price won't rise or drop dramatically due to the value of the dollar. 
 That's the *whole* point of inflation. The only other reason to embrace it is if you have long term debts or loans with low interest attached to them you can 'outrun' your debt by waiting it out. As inflation slowly makes the dollar worth less, as does it your debt whether it's a student loan or a car loan or a mortgage or whatever...
 The point being inflation is necessary and actually extremely useful in creating a stable store of value for a central bank backed by a federal authority.

 The cap itself has no relevance to what someone is willing to pay. It's a reflection of how much money it would take to purchase every single unit at market price... Which is a terrible indicator of *anything* related to market conditions. 
 The estimated notional value of all derivatives is between 1.2 and 1.4 quadrillion dollars. The global m3 is under 65 trillion USD. If the market decides a satoshi is worth 1 cent, then it means a bitcoin is worth $1m. The fact is market cap has no impact on price at all. It's the other way around.

I've been saying for a while now that market cap is a very poor indicator of current, past or future market performance when it comes to bitcoin. It's literally just a number, because bitcoin is not a stock and only a currency in name. It's a hybrid system that's never been seen before and since you can divide each coin 100 million ways and since I already basically think 1 satoshi is inherently more valuable than 1 US penny even if prices don't echo that sentiment, market cap is as useless a metric as the notional value on derivatives (which is estimated between 1.2-1.4 *quadrillion* dollars.) ...

If miners split the chain because of these idiots refusing to run the segwit2x code, the non segwit2x chain will not even have enough hash to make it to their next retarget after the split. It happened to terracoin about four years ago. Miners abandoned the chain in a huge way and they took weeks to get to a retarget. It had a lot to do with the way trc was structured and how it would retarget but it's basically a case study on what's about to happen to the non segwit2x nodes if they do decide to ultimately refuse to run the (segwit2x) code.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:21:56
Basically yes, but you should be aware Bitmain produces the majority of mining equipment today, and his 'friends' in China control 80% of all hash *right now*...

Realistically the way cryptocurrency is designed there will always be figures who will control and dominate the largest crypto(s) if there becomes a monopoly within the mining or majority economic communities. Right now we obviously have a problem with that. In that the biggest ASIC manufacturer, miners, exchanges and a large swath of the actual active trading / transacting community is in China right now. That will hopefully and likely change over time but right now there really is a bit of a central group of people controlling the direction, obviously.
 But to think this can't happen to any system, crypto or otherwise is foolish. This is a problem that converges on too much money and influence. It's not something you can avoid even in a 'free' decentralized p2p environment if the store of exchange is tokenized and for sale (at any level).

Two things:
 First of all, second layers will allow scaling to the size of the VISA network or larger based on *maximum* 32mb blocks. We are not talking just lightning here. That is *one* of *many* second layer solutions that will materialize over time.
 Second, is that Moore's law suggests 32mb blocksize will not be a problem for *anyone* going into the future because (just in case you forgot or are ignoring the fact that) the capacity of memory modules increases, whereas cost of that memory and bandwidth will subsequently decrease over time. 
 This means that while there will potentially be a temporary restriction on the ability of the average person to run a node due to financial concerns, this factor will alleviate in the (near) future and won't be a problem at all eventually.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:09:43

You clearly don't understand anything about how modern finance works... Currency issued by a federal bank backed by a large powerful government who controls a large military and equally large influence over the rest of the world will *always* retain value. That's why USD does not hyperinflate. The entire world is built to transact on reserve currency and debt. You think 200+ trillion dollars of debt is something that will just disappear or vanish? Do you think the global m3 at roughly 60 trillion will cover it? The two reasons inflation exists are to create a *stable store of value* to transact with and to alleviate the monstrous burden of debt by diluting it slowly over time. In fact all debt could be outrun by inflation alone if interest were capped and everyone actively payed their minimum payments.
 Do you even understand what a stable store of value is? Without a stable currency to transact with nobody knows what the fuck anything is worth and everything degrades into barter trading...

That's basically what the segwit2x camp wants though. Segwit first then hard fork to 2mb.
 The only reason people are openly complaining is they think it's some sort of move toward centralization, both with the 2mb size being cost prohibitive for the average user to run a node because of the cost of storage and bandwidth (which  is NONSENSE) and furthermore due to the perceived political nature of allowing miners and large bitcoin businesses + their friends to 'control' the direction of bitcoin scaling.
 In essence I think it's mostly posturing at this point. If we get segwit before Aug 1st and a moderate mining community I think it's a win. Only the idiots screaming "China coin" will have a serious problem with it once it becomes a reality.

As I understand it, an economic lightning node would transact with multiple parties to collect fees. This way there could be services which offer tx over lightning without the need to open a channel because the service handling your tx would have it's own channel. You could apply this to say a wallet provider. I don't think it would be something you could do with a personal wallet without it being attached to a channel provider of some sort.

 The non segwit2x chain will have hash, yes. But it will not be enough to even *find a block* with the difficulty where it is now. The retarget will either be forced through a PoW change which changes the DNA of bitcoin itself (which people will fight) or the chain will just flat out stall.

Of course scaling on chain is necessary but the point of the second layer solutions is to limit the actual size increase necessary and shift all the bloat and enable small transactions currently viewed as spam to happen across the network without causing it (bitcoin network) to become full. Thus fees will be low and you won't need to buy some insanely large and expensive storage device to run a node, nor will the cost of bandwidth limit the ability to run said node.
 We *are* both saying the same thing but I think the most important thing right now is to enable segwit and the second layers. The blocksize should increase to 2mb and many agree on that but many don't (devs and economic nodes included) and it's more of a political struggle right now. They see the 2mb size as a limiting factor in the decentralization of the network via making it more expensive and prohibitive to run a full node and furthermore that the decision to increase the size should not be in the hands of a handful of large miners (Bitmain / Antpool) and services (blockstream). The political face of this debate is really why the community is so divided. A lot of people hate the idea that major changes to bitcoin can be 'controlled' by a central group of people.
 Unfortunately I think it might be a necessary evil at this point. The community is too divided and there *must* be a solution put in place *now*. Only time will tell how well the solution works.

Are you serious, I watched the Gox crash as it happened and not only did I profit from the swing trading at multiple exchanges as a result of the crash, I didn't even have an account at Gox. That was the only true 'bubble' we have ever seen and it was due to manipulation. 
 If you don't understand what *exponential* growth in actual user base means, which is exactly what OTC markets are reflective of, you need to go look up supply and demand. The scarcity and difficulty of obtaining bitcoin for the average person who is interested means the price will continue to rise as long as said interest and adoption also increases. So I will ask you again. Do you think the doubling of volume in OTC markets like localbitcoins over the last 6 months is not real? It's either that or you don't understand how increased volume means higher prices via the laws of supply and demand and scarcity..

OKcoin = leveraged exchange. People can put up 5% real btc then borrow 20x more to make up the other 95% from OKcoin. Often these people need to place a stop loss in case the price tanks. If it goes below their investment purchase point (price) they lose $20 for every $1 it goes down further than that. 
 A lot of stop losses were triggered by one (or a group working together) malicious prick who wanted to see those stop losses triggered. Maybe it was miners selling what they mined all weekend, maybe it was a whale, maybe it was Tim Draper escaping Bancor and Ether by selling the Ether he collected from that massive ICO...

@_date: 2017-06-16 21:14:20


 That's inaccurate, the network would only need to scale to 32mb *MAX* capacity with lightning to serve the entire world as VISA does. And that's the entire point of lightning. You scale off the chain to reduce bloat and keep the important (expensive) transactions on-chain where they belong, while smaller payments and dust tx will be relegated to the second layer. This will reduce cost for on chain tx by significantly reducing the load on the network which means lower fees and faster confirmations. For the average user bitcoin becomes a viable store of value *and* a currency they can use to send value with microtransactions. The larger users (exchanges, economic nodes) benefit from lower fees and less bloat. Win win on both sides.
 Scaling is a problem because the entire community has basically already agreed, we cannot just raise the block size every time the network becomes full. If you can't understand *why* that's your problem. The consensus has already been reached by the broader community at large that second layers are the way forward. The only people complaining are those who don't understand how a blocksize increase will affect the community as a whole and individually, or people like Jihan Wu who see economic opportunity in keeping the status quo so they can reap the benefits of on chain scaling wherein fees remain high and in the hands of the mining monopoly. He also wants to continue to keep the advantage of ASICboost by keeping segwit stalled and / or having it permanently changed so ASICboost will continue to be effective.

Are you talking about actual retirement or just "I don't have to work for the next decade."&gt;? There is a massive difference.
 The cost of going to college will not be anywhere near what you need to comfortably retire even at 65 years of age.
 Typically speaking the average person needs roughly $5m of disposable cash at current value (USD) to live comfortably until 85 if you want to retire at 35. That isn't considering inflation and would mean using the entire sum to pay for property, goods and services. The context being this does not take into account any debt one might have nor the investment opportunities available to someone with $5m cash.
 So do you have roughly $5m worth of bitcoin or are you talking sub $100k and just saying "I could retire if I choose to."?

Kraken probably got sick and tired of having a shitload of emails complaining about tx not confirming while the network was at 200k unconfirmed tx and fees were insane.
 I bet their decision to change the fee was a direct result of that and probably took a week or two before it was actually implemented. I personally don't see a huge problem in $5 worth of fees to withdraw from a site you are trading crypto on... I mean if you can't afford that why are you even using Kraken?
 But I digress. Kraken is a piece of shit that fucks people around like a regular bank. They ask for all sorts of credentials and force you to prove you are 'earning' your money legally before they allow you to withdraw USD... And to make matters worse they do not consider money earned by trading crypto as 'earned' income...

Since BIP148 = mandatory activation of segwit by Aug 1st and since miners have actually agreed to activate segwit before Aug 1st if possible, the UASF will still happen but will have no effect. At least not on the majority of users.
 The problems start to arise when the hard fork to 2mb happens because a large number of people are saying they will actively refuse to run the HF... Which might split the chain...
 For now though as long as segwit is activated before Aug 1st, the UASF becomes nothing more than a symbolic gesture.

USD does not have a 'defined' market capitalization. Market cap is the system used to evaluate stocks and stock indexes. Bitcoin is using the model as a reference... You could assume the value of a fiat currency by its GDP, which for the U.S. was about 15 trillion USD.
 The Chinese own Tbills that the US govt has to pay back exceeding 16 trillion. At some point it will be near impossible to even pay the interest rate annually on such a sum. That is what everyone means when they say the market might default. THAT , in todays economy, would cause a depression. Not a recession. A full on depression.

I think it's because most trading platforms and even OTC sellers are using a price index like preev or the coindesk BPI or even just asking google what the bitcoin price is (it aggregates the price by finding the average between a handful of exchanges) and subsequently a lot of different alt coins follow the price of bitcoin closely. Since alts are traded mainly for bitcoin, exchanges and market makers have to scrutinize the price of bitcoin relentlessly and might even be using bots (almost certainly are) to track bitcoin prices across multiple vectors. Thus these altcoins will shift in price when bitcoin does because they are somewhat pegged to bitcoin price if you get what I mean. Some of them can *only* be traded for bitcoin or in the case of a lot of ICOs can only be traded for ethereum.
 Either way I think it's just low volume because weekend plus shaky noob hands and probably a lot of people finally taking profit in all this uncertainty within the scaling debate. Even as inroads are made and segwit activation seems all but imminent I think the market has finally had enough of this stall in momentum.
 I'll wait until September or October to pass judgement on that but I won't be selling either way so it doesn't really matter to me what the price does right now.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:52:35
You're acting like this is going to change bitcoin entirely.. It's a fucking blocksize increase. Segwit and LN will activate and for LN to be successful the block size needs to increase anyway. It's not like bitcoin code *relies* on core devs and it's not like there is a lot of coding to do to implement either segwit , LN or the HF to 2mb. Once they are active and economic nodes are handling segwit2x transactions, literally *everyone* else left wallowing in the core split chain will abandon it.

I suppose it could be 0 but the white paper only describes fees and negative fees which can help free up the channel for the most profitable path.

Where do you think the average person is going to put their money when they go to buy 'bitcoin' if a 2mb HF happens and segwit2x becomes the status quo?
This is going the same way ETH did during the chain split... Economic nodes and miners = the chain most people will follow and invest in.
You will have consensus among the nodes on a chain that isn't being used much..

The use cases are an aside to the fact that this is decentral value being stored on a public ledger, the first of it's kind, in a peer to peer network. Dumb fucks like you spreading misinformation and FUD are a cancer on bitcoin in general. 
 Segwit and second layer settlement systems address the fee issue so all three of your points are moot.

What a non response.
 If there are reasons to implement a BIP and core refuses to based on the views and ideas of core's lead devs then yeah that is *absolutely* centralization. If it isn't, then you can't say miners and economic nodes acting together to implement segwit2x are centralization.
 If you don't believe me or don't get it, you have a *very* poor grasp on what constitutes centralization to begin with.

The majority of people in here are just idiots echoing a shout box argument and most of them are ignorant fools who don't have any real money in bitcoin.
 Sure, there are a handful of devs and large businesses touting BIP148 and screaming that this agreement is centralization and goes against the principles of bitcoin blah blah blah. Those people will continue using bitcoin despite what they say about it and since segwit is likely to be activated before Aug 1st all that's left for these UASF fanboys is to wallow in self pity and conceit. They will try to claim they 'won' by forcing the miners to agree to segwit 2x somehow, just to save face. And a small group of them will indeed leave the bitcoin ecosystem for good feeling validated in their foolish claims that this is going to hurt bitcoin. Which in my opinion is good. It's like spraying weed killer on a lawn. You get rid of those foul vile weeds that you don't want in your garden, and all the grass and flowers continue to grow unmolested.

counter productive to the thought of coin. You get to CHOOSE your fee. In fact you don't even need to add a fee. With electrum you can choose to pay 0.00000 but your transaction will take 24h to get confirmed x10+
 proportionate fees would destroy the large stakeholders desire to continue trading. While the hit would be small, the psychological factor in thinkin you've lost $400 on a 400k transaction might push SOME of the heavy holders out, for good., Whether that would be a good or bad thing, I don't really know.

That's the best I could come up with, I haven't been active on the forums in a long time. One of the main features of terracoin was that the difficulty readjustment period was *insanely* short at 30 blocks. In that, it should have been relatively easy to reach the retarget even if there was a massive exodus of miners from the chain, the short period would allow the difficulty to fluctuate to accommodate similar fluctuations in hashrate. Unfortunately the sheer number of miners who jumped in and subsequently out in short order meant the difficulty got stuck so high even a 30 block retarget was too long. They couldn't find blocks. The chain stalled and it exacerbated the problem because the worse it got, the more miners jumped ship. Eventually they had to code an update to deal with the issue.
 Now imagine that but on the bitcoin blockchain. I don't think this non segwit2x chain will get very far if people do decide to split.

The idea is to make this a currency, and legitimize it. Obviously money laundering is going on and its a problem for the community itself striving for legitimacy. Money laundering is a huge problem in this country and of course they will be trying to stem any system of inevtable abuse against which someone could clean dirty money in huge quantity at any time. We as a community don't want the market flooded with large orders, it hurts value., At the same time , you can be sure that since Silk Road is a cornerstone of bitcoin, it WILL attract people laundering and major players will find it easy to clean HUGE amounts of cash, easily. They are taking necessary steps ahead of time to not only ensure govt coffers stay full of 'dirty' money, ( the drugdealers getting away with tax fraud, who can be extorted by govts who can be bought like in mexico ) whilst keeping a more tolerable image overall to the community, they being the very govt we are trying to technically decentralize ourselves from.
You have to accept it for what it is. There could be equal parts lobby for a crackdown based on anti laundering policy, and equal parts dirty corrupt fuckers trying to dip their hand into the cookie jar. At any rate , who knows. Just strap in and hold tight for the ride for now, friend.

You're not taking into account that if all miners abandon the non segwit2x chain and economic nodes follow, the non segwit2x chain will not be able to mine blocks. It won't even reach a retarget because the difficulty is so high 10% of hash means your blockchain is going to stall if not stop dead. It will require a PoW change which means changing the DNA of bitcoin moreso than a blocksize increase. At that point there will be nobody left to support the non segwit2x chain. Nobody will buy a broken alt being called 'bitcoin' by despots when the status quo is still using bitcoin with segwit2x.

One thing that might happen is they may require either 'proof of income' like some sort of record of where the $$$ came from , and proof that you mined the coins. If that cannot be provided ( sometimes it can't ) then they will likely ask you to have the tax authority get in touch with them or they will ask that you pay the taxes on it and possibly release enough funds so you can pay those taxes. Once tax compliance is met they should be given the go ahead to release the remaining sum of money.

I think you misunderstood. The potential of infinite energy lies within the fact that the market itself can grow indefinitely. It can go up or down , but the potential for their use is never ending. One could assume that the only way to limit this potential is regulation and over saturation , which is impossible with coin. ( regulation is possible only if the community members being regulated accept it, not accepting it is at their own risk, albeit. ).

I guess but with the anonymity and decentralization of coin built into it you (obviously) would need a major overhaul. Not sure if hashing votes is a good idea either..

I would not be surprised if it were cyberbunker given the open dislike for all curreny INCLUDING crypto for some reason. He should be with us but apparently he seems to be against us. He thinks we should all go back to gold coins or something.. seriously , he has stated it openly on his Facebook...

Weekend dip plus its easter and if you look @ bitcoinity, ppl are flooding gox with lower ask because everyone who made a large enuff investment @ $20-30 is now scared poop-less that their margin is fading. If you look back the actual drop STARTED at 19:30 with a 5k moving of coins thru gox, which dropped the price hard. Everything else is a result of that initial 5k transaction and the panic from the drop it caused. Also, banks are closed easter weekend. PPl might be doing as much moving of assets as possible ahead of any 'curve' they feel might be coming. My advice: Wait for a bottom and then BUY SOME BITCOINS!!!
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:18:38
Plus the fact that they are divisible up to 21 quadrillion sub units and nobody can tell you accurately what those sub units might be valued at, at ANY given time in the future.

Another non comment. It's been said before, core is not necessary nor does it dictate what direction bitcoin should and will go in the future. Just because core was the most viable and least dissonant in the past does not mean it will continue to be. In fact your statement itself just reaffirms my ideologue that core equates to a centralized sub group within bitcoin that has in the past had more say on matters regarding scaling than they ever should have. In actively denying implements regarding blocksize increase core has stifled the progress of bitcoin and it has been going on for *years*.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:39:48
If the entire project is shifted by economic nodes and miners to segwit2x, it doesn't matter how many devs refuse to code the segwit2x chain. It's open source. In fact I'd say if you think core devs are the heart and soul of bitcoin it means core devs are a centralized weak point in the system. Core does not make or break bitcoin.

Open an account with a major bank. Warn them of what is about to happen and ask to speak to the manager. They may put a hold on the funds but if you do it legit they will have you and the gov sort it out together then release the $. Basically all you need to do is pay your taxes, capital gains. Tell them the exact $ amount you spent on BTC at the start. Then they will deduct the capital gains from your cash out value. It is up to you to pay taxes and keep bitcoin lookin' quite legit. I very much respect what you did this morning , bitcoinbillionaire. 
 I also truly respect the humble exit from bitcoin you are planning. This is taking a toll on alot of us. Rest assured , you're not alone.
 Be safe and take care. Thank you for investing @ the upstart.

I really hope this works out well for you, I think the more people that move back into fiat and do it legally and legit are the most positive influence we can have and promote within the bitcoin community. I truly hope others will follow in your footsteps.

? no, it's not.
 If you know *anything* about segwit, lightning or second layer solutions you would understand that's the only way forward at this point.
 You cannot scale on chain without consequences to the decentral nature of bitcoin nor massive bloat and insane rise in the cost of fees. It's simply not possible without a time machine to travel into the future where memory and bandwidth are cheaper. Even then, a mining cartel and a packed to the gills network mean the fee will prohibit most people from using bitcoin. You think 400-600 satoshi / b is bad? With nothing but on-chain scaling that would be paltry. You could expect 100x-1000x that.

A thought occurred. While I'm sure at this point you're already aware, you should make sure if you do earn a large sum of cash that you pay tax if necessary just to keep the feds off your back.

Napkins contribute to operating costs and they count that into the overhead calculation which eventually plays a role in how they factor in prices for menu items (food). It's the same as paying utilities like hydro and water. There are bean counters in their corporate office who literally spend their entire careers doing this kind of math.
 Fees on LN tx no matter how small, are still satoshis. It's like saying Burger King doesn't count the change in all their registers because it's less than $1 and doesn't matter. ... It's a dumb thing to say.

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:51:43
not trying specifically to panic people. Just speculating the possible cause of action and the reason we have SO MANY people online, everywhere. You very well may be right ( I pray to go you are ) and this could be regular volume around the sub by now. I have not been active over the last 2 - 3 weeks so I cannot say, but this looks very suspicious to me. 
 You are right to say the market is fixed. This paper , while completely fake and illegitimate, speaks volumes about what SOME people know about this game that they are trying to tell others. Through propaganda or otherwise. I am only here to try to speculate concerns and I can promise you gox itself and BTCe are currently under attack , as is coinotron. Perhaps ASIC contributes to this as we now have alot of people with alot of extra BTC who don't really need it nor feel it necessary to keep , considering ASIC. 
 Botnets are dying and there are new forms of even scarier DDoS surfacing. I am sorry to have been a dick about it but harsh criticism breeds itself. I am currently trying to query the source of the attack against BTCe. Goxx is likely being hit with a different , more powerful source... The smaller the source the easier it is to trace.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:13:51
Just as prude as the rest of the hoarding fools!
 Trading between alt coins is the only reason your crypto is shooting up. 
 I bet you can't even read into the fact that the (real ) devs and project heads are actually in on alt coins and their creation. .. 
 Don't bother with a response I'm not interested in reading it, good luck hoarding and paying USD @ these prices for single coins. Have fun with your stagnating market.
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:04:00
I don't disagree with you, I'm just saying as it is most of the people I have spoken with are confused about just the idea of bitcoin, let alone wanting to go and open their own wallet and start buying coin .. You'd be surprised how obscure this still is, even with the media attention of late.
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:55:55
yeah there should be some differentiation between these micro transactions flying about all day every day and serious moving of bitcoin, I don't disagree. With a public ledger system like this though its hard to enforce any hardline or even imply one without souring the honey pot for alot of folks. They should implement your strategy as a 0.0005 % transaction fee in USD fiat as standard, weighted to coin. The reason I like the system the way it works though is your block acceptance rate and confirmation rate rely specifically on whether you DID choose to pay a fee. ( as we all know )
 This is interesting, I will forward thoughts to a couple of important developers I know are in touch with the bitcoin elite.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:03:32
Kinda skeptical about gox given its size and volume now and the fact that this is supposed to be DECENTRAL currency. Yet we have an exchange benefeiting from 80% of ALL exchange on the market?
 Wait times, verification, lacklustre service and the fact that gox itself is a major part of the volatility right now. No thanks. I'll take localbitcoins.com over gox any day. Don't get goxxed.

As long as you can trace back to the price of BTC when you purchased, and can remember the # of BTC purchased, it should be fine. :)
 They are having alot of trouble regulating this stuff so just showing up to say "HI , I'd like to pay my taxes now", will likely have them cooperating with you and trying to help you along. Just seeing BTC holders pay tax makes them very happy :)

Very good point on people who may not be tech savvy enough to keep themself protected. I overlooked the lack of technology to the average user bitcoins might benefeit, the people who would use it for daily transactions.
 I could go either way I guess on enticing people, I realise there are alot of them who would jump the boat at the first sign of a loss, but outwardly, I expect the market itself to prove them wrong. Someone who thought they lost $10-100 on coin might feel alot worse when they realise that appreciation cost them 10x, 20x, 100x, what they thought they had 'lost' as a result of early market conditions. That is, IF , bitcoin succeeds globally. But I still feel adament about bringing people in who otherwise might miss the boat entirely until it was WAY too late to buy a single bitcoin. At the least I hope if I can convince some people to buy in now, they might benefeit. Those who truly cannot afford it, I am trying to pay for myself. This was the idea behind my sub but that idea is evolvng daily into a crowdsourcing / outreach vehicle,. That said, I am not trying to 'promote' it. I just find it relevant to this convo.
 The fee I think should be relevant to wealth and transfers. If someone is going to saturate the market and drop the value across the board, there should be at least SOME penalty attached to it. Otherwise one day some wealthy developer might let his greed get the better of him and sell off too much, too fast, causing panic crashing and loss of confidence in coin. But I am not an economist, or a developer, or a financial planner. I am not even post secondary educated. I'm just insanely interested in this as a postmark for the future of fair trade in the global end-market. I truly appreciate your input and I will be back to reconsider these points many times.

there are tens of thousands waiting to get into gox. millions of people looking for bitcoin , this new craze they hear will make us all rich. But they cant find them anywhere. Interest turns to obsession , obsession turns to investments and investments turn into exponential wealth growth for all involved. Ponzi scheme, pyramid scheme ETC , all crypto could be called it. 
 I would buy LTC , NMC and ESPECIALLY NVC while you have time. The markets corrected LTC to $4 and NMC to $1.20 , but the NVC corrections are ALWAYS slow. You have time to clean up if you buy now it is only $3.50 a coin for NVC projections will push corrections all the way up to $7 o more a piece. %100 gains riding on the success of LTC . NMC already saw correction but is still way low too.

I'd be skeptical to sell huge blocks of coin all at once right now but if you have enough coin your league is different than mine. If I had 10k coins or 100k coins for example I might sell 10% to upgrade my current living standard ( not that it is poor by any mean ) and keep the rest as a continued investment. 
On the bright side if you cash out now you help lower MY buy price , so , I say GO FOR IT!!!

Solid strategy. Just make sure to tell all your friends to jump on coin, which I am sure you already have. But pass on the info about goxx and the reliability issues. Also, I pray to god these DDoS attacks its facing currently aren't from a REAL source. E.G. some central bank or major market force like donald trump or warren buffet trying to stagnate our market using their capital assets. It would only take a few million bucks to build a server big enough to break goxx.

I think the winklevoss 100k coin portfolio news caused an influx of big bears who wont sell unleass its a breakout bullrun, and even then I am hearing alot of talk about a boom happening this summer. 
 I could see it happening once gox is capable of serving the volume it couldnt handle prior to the server upgrades. I also think tax time and alot of early adopters / big winners exiting has alot to do with the crazy drop. It would make sense if I wanted out and had like 1000 to 10,000 coins or more I would make a run for the exit as soon as gox hit the bricks with too much volume / got hit with the DDoS of the century ...

 If a few short term investors won or lost today, it doesn't mean much to those of us who A) use this currency for what it is, a currency and B) Hold on to it long term, holding a stable floor no matter how many people jump the boat back into fiat or otherwise 
 Love you all!

"You're just confirming what I knew."  LOOL self affirmation is the lowest form of insult. Scum.
You keep telling me they're MY superstitions. Have you ever been inside a jail? You clearly do not know how easy it is for the country you live in to rob you of everything, and put you in a prison. 
 Don't beleive me? Are prisons superstitions too? The words TAX EVASION compound into you, being removed from society, for not doing what your govt wants you to. 
 
 The world would simply do better without you. Good luck hiding your profit from the law. Better yet, I can guess right now with great accuracy that you HAVE no profit.

Yeah the theory is somewhat sound I guess, but again the problems already being seen in coin we might not want to translate to the real world and voting power just yet, as small as these problems within the system may be.
 Also I don't like the thought of a govt playing with crypto-voting. The govt is more dangerous to the systems themselves than outside forces and 'problems' within the hashing of votes itself.

Well he lives by a 'if I don't know it, I don't touch it' policy. But I guess that would go the opposite if coin began threatening his investor base. For instance, if someone cashed out a Berkshire Hathaway stock and used the cash to buy coins in January, they would have made over a million in profit so far. Imagine if even a couple of his holders did this with a fraction of their holdings. Now that's all speculative theory but it could easily happen... And if they multiplied their holding by 10 you can be sure they are on the market buying thousands of coins as we speak ;)
 Again, its all just an 'if' thought.

This is the dumbest load of crap I have ever seen. The success of this does not lay in investors or market forces @ work once infrastructure is at a certain level, which it has already reached. Every day you can do something new with bitcoin, new retailers, new startups, new stocks, new ways to gamble..  Speculators and day traders are only saturating the market right now because of the intense volatility. This won't keep up forever and once coin reaches mainstream status ( IE you can go to the local hardware and buy a hammer, or the local supermarket to buy food ) then the opinion that this is a crashing inflationary doomed market will quickly dissolve. The author of that article can suck my heavy hitter., Any time of day.

Possible source, Republic Cyberbunker.
 Apparently Sven Olaf Kamphuis, the owner operator of Cyberbunker, does not like cryptocurrency very much, beleive it or not. He has officially denounced it and ranked it along the same line as fiat currency on his own facebook page. He also openly exhibits a sympathy and liking for North Korea. Here is some info on his recent attack on Spamhaus, and cloudflare, which slowed the internet to a halt. The largest DDoS in history. Cloudflare is host to BTCe, by the way. Frowned upon by even many in the bitcoin community , BTCe gets hit for its own reasons, but also gets caught in the crossfire of cyberbunker attacks aimed at spamhaus, through cloud. If you hold BTC and have any deep web skill, now is the time to act.
 If you are just reading this and asking yourself , who is sven olaf kamphuis, and what is a cyberbunker? See this for more detail on recent attacks that slowed the internet, in its entirety all over the world. I ponder , ... I ponder...

the coins rise in value with BTC and BTC is rising thats double value. I went in with 6.3 BTC and LTC has me jumping from 12.5-15 BTC right now 
 BTCe exchanges also have a troll box to talk to ppl on :)  can goxx beat that!?
EDIT : you can also hedge your BTC investment and give yourself 5% dividends to send your offline wallets for safe keeping. Safe enough, and doesnt hurt profit too much at these volumes. Just earn some BTC, and every week sell 5% of all profit at market price and send yourself the BTC to offline wallets. EASY money FAST. And you still hold a boatload of coins flying to the moon in value! Easy money !!!!
EDIT 2 : to clear the whole 100% doubling money part if it is still unclear, LTC is rising in value against the value of BTC. LTC was worth 0.009 BTC on the weekend. Now 1 LTC will cost you 0.03-0.04 BTC and prices are rising fast!. BTC is also rising in price rapidly. If you buy LTC while it is still cheap and BTC hits $1000 + you could end up a millionaire faster than you originally thought. I hope I can help at least SOME of you make alot of $.

If you don't have solid  they will likely trace prices back to the date you tell them you purchased the coin, then barring unforseen circumstances they will likely just deduct capital gains from whatever you make in USD when you transfer out. 
 At the end of the day though they can't charge gains on whatever BTC you spent / bought things with as the guidelines themselves prospect that a cryptocurrency cannot be taxed against its users yet. They can only tax you for capital gains, and they can tax the exchanges. Miners are 100% un taxable right now :)
 If I were you, I would consider making purchases in pure BTC , from bitspend or an equivalent service ;)
EDIT: There are also services that will trade gold and silver for BTC, worth looking in to ;) also tax free. 
 That way you are legally avoiding tax on all funds currently held. :) Hope this helps

Havent tryed bitfloor yet but I've heard good things about it. Mixed reactions too obviously but since everyone is still technically a noob, even the exchanges themselves ( the entire economy is still a noob to the WORLD economy ) I can crack the skepticism to people who aren't tech savvy or familiar with exchanges.
 I would try it out but I have a few really good connections locally now and I'm always looking to help the local bit-economy
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:45:08
Every now and then , very large holders will do something known on the exchanges and IRC channels as a dump. Selling concentrated amounts of BTC @ the right moment to crash price and induce panic. Then , as the OP has explained, the rain of cheap coin is caught by the very same fuckers who just offloaded @ highs. 
 Pump and Dump is part of the game. The sooner you see that, the safer you'll be. :/

I adamently support the tipping system, I realise my idea is a little offbeat and not so enticing now but its more or less supposed to be a vehicle for spreading the word on crowdsourcing and helping a few people who cant afford or are skeptical about coin to try the process and possibly start on a path to 'coin-hood' :)
 I appreciate the tip tho and I always appreciate people in the community who are active and deserve recognition. 
P.S. I actually feel REALLY dirty about 'begging' because I am not looking to actually USE the coins for my own gain, I just want to redistribute and possibly start a startup FOR bitcoin startup ideas. Currently putting together a plan and model and speaking to local programmers and developers about it. The hardest part is convincing people that bitcoin is worthwhile to them.

Cloudforge :) They host BTCe and have held strong through Cyberbunker and its attacks against Spamhaus, of which Cloudforge is hosting .
 BTCe gets hit every time Spamhaus gets it, plus BTCe is being hit for its own reasons by angry devs of all types and people who would rather see BTCe go down in flames then let it proceed as it has been. 
 If anything I think this is good PR for cloudforge and their ability to withstand 300GB/s attacks ( largest the internet has ever seen ).

 I invested when we saw $100 but only purchased 10 coins. I am holding but if it drops below that in the next week or two I will have to take a loss. Part of the gamble of any investment I suppose..
 If I take a loss I will continue doing what I am already, buying bitcoin with cash and spending w.e I bought that day to avoid inflation / deflation ..  To me this makes more sense than sitting biting fingernails watching charts

Western Union wouldn't get business when they will charge you a commission that locals wont. Hedge funds won't touch bitcoin right now because they never invest in volatility... Regardless of which direction it is going... I know JP morgan is interested but is hesitating because of recent volatility and govt regulatoy 'guidelines' not guaranteeing a hard line against the currency failing due to prohibition or criminalization. You have no clue how much money is being laundered by outside forces in ALL these markets, ESPECIALLY BTC...  There were more than 20k people waiting to get into gox @ one point in the last week and BTC still didn't even grow 50% . I have 600% and counting. Market is stalled because BTC lost its thunder. 
 Thanks, bitcoin.

 even 25% of BTC is a high conservative value. But they cost 50 cents a piece less than 2 weeks ago. They are up to $3 a piece now. Thats like 600% in 2 weeks.  And LTC is staying at the same margins even as BTC is going up only 10-30% a day. ... you are on the bottom of a pyramid that is about to stop fruiting.

that goes for investments too. If you made over a certain amount and cashed it out to fiat currency for use , usually over $1500 USD equivalent in your own currency for the year, then you have made taxable income as well.
 So if you have alot of coin either dont cash it out, ever, just use it to buy shit, and make damn sure you report w.e you cash out into fiat currency. If you are right, your govt will tell you so. Its not worth risking PRISON over.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:32:08

Anything you make in cash and use is still capital gains. No matter what you got it from. As per regulation you don't have to pay sales tax and you aren't technically a 'transmitter of currency' ( thats what the IMF calls a trader ) but if you cash out BTC for your currency and dont report it on your taxes as capital income you are still breaking the law. Unless you live in the dominican, or cyprus at this time last year. Unfortunately for most of those taking advantage of cyprus like that and even more unfortunately for cypriots themselves, that sort of tax evasion has ruined their economy and destroyed their central banks.

lol I was about to say get ready for a rapib climb, but you beat me to it! P.S. already have $2 in the donation wallet as we speak, from others who tipped my comments. You might be closer to that free $20 in bitcoin than you think, though at this point, I know you don't really need it. :)  Keep on coinin

Ben Bernanke is stopping it by pumpin 85 billion USD out of the fed so they can de value their currency enough to produce the 16 trillion in Tbills they owe china. China is pissed. News flash : they are building a huge army and preparing for WW3. ( china ) . They see it coming and they wont let the US crush the progress theyve made by capitalising off American bank stupidity. They wont let America get away with devaluing their Tbills like this.
 They told NK to chill out only because they are 20 or so years away from being able to conduct a real world war. Very soon though Iran , NK and china will be the axis of evil, leaving russia in a weird spot between NATO and their old allies... 
 Shit got real just now.

? BFL has yet to ship anything. Avalon is the only ASIC on the market shipping in quantity. What makes you think a reference chart can tell the future? Its absolutely unpredictable.

dont buy BFL, they are having problems with the hashrate / power consumption and are delaying further @ this point. It doesn't look very promising.
