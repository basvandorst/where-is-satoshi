Shitstorm coming if you ask me

i think we might crash down right before hitting 15K or after futures coming out. The money that goes into futures, isnt going to bitcoin. (that my view on it).
so im looking for a profit taking situation in the next few days. Might be risky, but this is an unhealthy growth!

Because Bill needs to have more? Lets hope it does reach that price.
