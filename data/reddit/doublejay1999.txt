well, it's a bit mischievous - in that bitcoin is a currency unlike the others and in this case (when compared to other currencies "performance")  the key thing is that bitcoin doesnt serve any sovereign economy  and so it not constrained by monetary policy.
For example, if sterling (£££) were to go on such a run (as we have seen in BTC over the last few weeks), the British government would move to curb it, because it fucks up other parts of economy.  Similarly, if sterling were to plunge - the government would step in and steady it.
obviously most of us are  here because we think it's *beautiful* that bitcoin is currently free from these constraints  - but it's very important to remember that when doing comparative performance.
**tldl** : *bitcoin is not constrained by monetary policy and comparisons with currency that are thus constrained are likely to be somewhat bent.*

i must admit this article wound me up  this morning.   i'm a crypto skeptic - even though I hold, speculatively. i think the guy is a chancer - looks like he writes all sorts nonsense as "tech journalist".

I don’t expect to find support in this insane sub.   I am a hodler, for a few years now, but it faces some massive, massive challenges.  The tech is wobbly at scale: the power consumption is problematic and the fees and settlement times severely limit its usefulness when the networks are busy.  Not insurmountable, but not solved yet.
The biggest challenge bitcoin faces is that it can be a threat to Power.  It can threaten banks and it can threaten governments and they will come at it HARD if they can’t establish some control over it.
   If they can establish some control, it will be dead anyway.

Money does what it wants. 
You buy a dozen promising young politicians.   Maybe 2 dozen.  You get them cheap, because they are fairly light weight.
You fund their campaigns.  Over the years, the duds drop away. Some become representatives, some don’t.  Maybe you’re left  with just 2 or 3 that look good for the senate. 
  Along the way they will have formed alliances with other people of power and influence, and are only happy to introduce them to a potential generous donor like yourself.   
You keep signing the checks,  you tell them how  the world needs Bank of Facebook........., and how Bank of Facebook could really use someone like them on the Exec team, with a lovely fat salary .  Eventually you get the policies you want.
Time tested system.

One of the  biggest mistakes one  can make on the internet is to speak with absolute confidence on topics you know fuck all about.  I know, I have been that guy, but I am not that guy today.
The second biggest mistake is to break out your victory dance prematurely. 
The third  biggest is not to cite your sources, because no one reading this knows where you found those  few lines of tosh that appear to support your bias that Communism is about centralisation.
Here is an  example of how citing  reliable, reputable sources strengthens an argument, especially one held in the public arena:
 Any one can easily click the think below and read the Cambridge Dictionary definition of Communism - and use it to help them decide which argument to support.
    **communism  noun [ U ]**     also Communism uk ​ /ˈkɒm.jə.nɪ.zəm/ us ​ /ˈkɑː.m.jə.nɪ.zəm/
    the belief in a society without different social classes in which the methods of production are owned and 
    controlled by all its members and everyone works as much as they can and receives what they need
Interestingly, for scholars at least,  the world *Communism comes from the the Latin *Communis* - meaning **common** or **universal**.  Some people might have seen that as a clue ? IDK.
Anyway,  the first 4 lines of the Wikipedia also explains this, with cited sources :
    "In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, "common, universal")[1][2] is the
    philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement **whose ultimate goal is the establishment of 
    the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of 
    production and the absence of social classes, money,[3][4] and the state.**[5][6]"*
You see ? You don't really need to dive very far down a research rabbit hole to equip yourself with the most very basic  facts about Communism. 
 I dont think any reasonable person would expect you to have read to through the Communist Manifesto  -  so i'll link it anyway, someone might find it useful :
    What is the aim of the Communists?
    
    To organise society in such a way that every member of it can develop and use all his capabilities and
    powers in complete freedom and without thereby infringing the basic conditions of this society. 
You see, you've marched into this argument, all guns blazing, without the requisite skills to  give a good account of yourself and now this is the result.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't  just a little bit disappointed in you.
