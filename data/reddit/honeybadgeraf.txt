This bothers me. 
2000% is &gt;! 30%
2000% of 100 is not good if your effected by 30% dip at 20000

As someone who has done this before.
Spoiler alert: Your clients have no idea about / Don't trust bitcoin. (Well at least a year back when I was freelancing). 
Hope you can convince them to pay in Bitcoin 
Always quote in USD (fiat). We haven't reached a stable state where we can negotiate in terms of Bitcoin. 
Always decide on the date of payments well ahead (Advance and final payment). So you don't have issues with your client, as he might pay you when the market is down. 
Good luck :)

I was a true believer in bitcoin but I still sold last year. That's because I don't believe in people. People are dumb. No matter how great the tech is, the "medium of exchange" (USD or Bitcoin) depend on "trust". 
And I had more money than I could afford to lose so I pulled out.
I got back again this year when it was around 5k and I'm holding. :D

Like many have quoted "blockchain is a solution looking for a problem" and I completely agree with woz here. I remember Steve Jobs telling, we must first design the product and its experience and then work backwards to see what technology is best to solve this problem not the other way around. That is exactly what Bitcoin did, the need for a decentralised p2p e-money and then Sathoshi worked backwards to discover and successfully implement Blockchain.

He clearly said it was a “centralised” currency. So bitcoin FTW
