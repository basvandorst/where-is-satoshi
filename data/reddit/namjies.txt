Thanks man, it's great to have some money now and then. (not that I think Bitcoin isn't money, just not many (useful) ways to spend it around here)
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:45:16
If you bought BTC for $1 and it goes to $1000 and you spend it, you owe capital gains taxes on that $999 appreciated value on top of sales tax. Tax laws are like this in almost every countries. Doesn't matter if you traded it directly, if it went up in value before you spent it, you owe capital gains on the price difference.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:18:39
Maybe. There's some interesting ones like Ethereum and Monero, but it mostly feel like alts are pumped to hell right now. A long time ago would have been great right now.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:56:58
I had a bit on MtGox (yeah I've been around that long.) Doesn't look like they'll give more than 50058 JPY per BTC tho, no matter how much BTC is left. That's it for what I have left in "Bitcoin."
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:16:05
That's why I think it's best to sell a bit every big milestone (eg: 20k) and buy back if it dips and test lower milestones (eg: 10k) You'd slowly lose your BTC on the way up, but also could gain some btc along the way on dips at certain milestones. Would probably still have some BTC if I applied this.

Definitely claim offline if your credentials/password reset don't work. I'm not sure what would happen if balance is not accurate as per the Trustee's data, but not submitting anything is definitely not going to help. At least if something is submitted, it might be easier to correct afterward than to try and claim past the timeframe allowed.
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:53:08
There is none. At this point, there's no steps for arranging the distribution, so no BTC addresses to be provided. We're only submitting claims and people getting approved/rejected.
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:30:52
From what I understand, yes.
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:35:13
No. Seems to be standard procedure. All the data is public. Nevermind that MtGox's database got leaked before the bankruptcy. All data has long been public.  
I guess it makes sense that creditors would have the right to know who else is making a claim in this legal process, for the sake of transparency.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:02:43
Most of the Bitcoins were already claimed during bankruptcy and will likely still be claimed now. More than 90% were claimed. Some little extra claims won't make much of a difference with the big claims all claimed. Small claim holders probably need the money the most. I'll make sure as many people as possible can claim.  
But also old claims may not be aware they now need to claim again. Some people are not following the proceedings. They need to be warned.
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:21:21
There was nothing already returned.
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:42:12
Did you have a claim under bankruptcy?


The notice seems to say that password reset only works for people who had a bankruptcy claim, or who haven't gone through rehabilitation claim setup, cannot use the password reset.  
You would need to submit an offline claim then if it's your first time claiming.
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:33:00
I do not know what happen if the correct amount isn't claimed.   
Note the balance checker uses the old, original password from before MtGox went down.  
The claim login uses the new password after it was changed during bankruptcy claim process. If the password you have saved is the new one from bankruptcy, try logging in to claim system with that password and EMAIL, not username. The form will auto-populate with the claim so you don't really need to check balance checker. Make sure you try logging to claim system with both email or username. For me username didn't work for some reason, despite working on balance checker.  
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll have to get in touch and figure things out to fill your offline claim.  
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:45:07
Scammer manages to retrieve credit card/bank details of someone.  
"Hmm, what should I do, make a payment to my bank account?"  
No, they go somewhere, make a payment to receive X, get X and let the true account holder make a claim they didn't authorize payment. The bank would get suspicious if a client kept making chargebacks. It's usually stolen accounts. X being something sent by post, crypto, western union, whatever isn't possible to claim back. They can't directly use stolen accounts.  
It's especially common with services like Paypal which takes credit card. The bank will always side with their client. Why would they side with Paypal/Merchant and piss off their own client? If client says charge is not authorized, they reverse the transaction. Paypal can't really do anything about it.
@_date: 2018-08-25 07:27:53
People watched MtGox incoming and outgoing BTC a lot. There's a lot of tracking that was done and it doesn't seem like Mark took anything.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:16:24
I don't think it's possible unless you sue and can prove they were hacked because of MtGox's poor code. It's a different issue than the bankruptcy. I'm not sure if it's still possible.
@_date: 2018-08-26 23:39:34
Hard, but not impossible. We've seen plenty of additions to Bitcoin. Forks happen, BCH isn't the first one. Bitcoin keeps going and improving. There's hardly anything in the space that makes for a better cryptocurrency or that prevents any business. Bitcoin works for its purpose and is far more adopted and stable.
BCH exists as cash grab and because a miner wanted to keep an edge with mining which it would lose with Segwit. So much for a wrench in someone's "business model."
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:23:44
No. Maybe try tomorrow and if it doesn't work, try calling the number it shows to call if failed logins is the issue.
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:04:35
It's not certain the trustee would purchase BTC to distribute. He could distribute both BTC and fiat to BTC claims.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:38:10
Since codes are time sensitive, you might want to go in settings in the auth and use the "Sync now" button under "Time correction for codes". That might solve the issue.
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:10:17
Nah, not possible. The trustee isn't in the business of trading crypto back and forth to make a profit. He'd open himself to some serious lawsuit, probably, if he made any losses. His only mandate while it was still in bankruptcy was selling assets and distributing money.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:49:57
It will be distributed. It doesn't matter what form the assets are if the claims' value cannot be fully paid. As long as claims are not paid in full, all assets are used to repay.
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:13:49
Yes, hopefully the fact it's part fiat, part BTC will avoid price crashing during distribution.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:03:14
You'd get 1.7 BTC + 1.7 BCH + 8k USD + forks, likely, since about a third was sold for fiat between top of bubble and 6k, at an average of around 10k I believe.
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:30:56
Aye, depending on the amount, might not even be worth pursuing because getting the info would be costly and even with info, it might have already been sent to your account not long before being shut down. Which probably means MtGox would no longer be involved. But really only a lawyer could answer that and they're expensive.
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:39:49
How so?
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:23:58
A third has been sold at around 10k USD. Looks like anyone with a claim over 1250+ BTC would get 1 million+
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:58:52
Try as best as you can. I didn't get everything right but I was still logged in and once logged in all the info is there and accurate, pre-filled. Although pre-filling might just be for people who already had submitted a claim under bankruptcy.  
If it doesn't work, you might need to get in touch and send your claim offline, which probably involves sending documents and verification through mail.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:35:08
Yes, it's the big grey boxes. It's even written "Please click here to..." on them.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:10:15
That's a terrible idea and a waste of money.
@_date: 2018-08-25 06:07:50
Absolutely not. If you have fiat, you have a claim to fiat, if you have BTC, you have a claim to BTC. You cannot arbitrarily get some BTC at 2013 prices. You'd need someone willing to sell you claim to BTC at those prices and no one would. You have what you had at the time of MtGox's start of bankruptcy.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:48:12
Yes, and it should be paid in full.
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:05:15


Or it gets added to Bitcoin and people stay on Bitcoin because it's more used, stable and secure. It's not about if better stuff can come around. It's that nothing prevents Bitcoin from adding the improvements.
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:21:30
He's stopped selling for a while now. It appears he sold enough Bitcoin to cover all cash claims, BTC claims at bankruptcy valuation, open lawsuits and potential expenses. He stopped selling not long before Civil Rehabilitation. I'm not sure why, but I guess securing the money made things easier. Remaining BTC might be distributed as BTC without being sold, as long as it's feasible.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:32:20
Fiat is paid in full, so you get 100% of that.
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:54:21
MtGox directly. Kraken is no longer involved. You need to submit again.
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:38:17
Those 200k BTC were from after Mark showed proof of fund from moving 424242 BTC. It had remained unmoved since that time in 2011. It's more like he remembered them after someone likely pointed out those were not spent yet. He likely knew, but it's easier to say all is gone, figure out what's remaining, and come back with as good an amount as you can. Makes him look better. (or worse he couldn't remember where he put the key to that old wallet...) There's no question as to how it was found. People knew about them if you dig a bit into it.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:26:34
If it's Liberty Reserve, then it was cash, which would mean you had already sold the BTC on the exchange. So a few hundred bucks would still be the same few hundred bucks.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:44:11
Use email for claims login, not username. Password may be different too if you filled during bankruptcy, as you set a new password then.
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:56:08
Get in touch with the trustee then and file offline if you cannot do it through the website. You will probably need to provide a lot more documents. The deadline to submit a claim is October 22nd 2018 so do not wait to start the process.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:35:49
We're talking about the trustee, appointed by Japanese court. Doing anything outside of court approval would be suicide.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:01:30
I had to submit once, it was greyed out afterward and there was a button to update details, or confirm and submit, at the bottom. If the button and not the form inputs that is greyed out, maybe you missed an mandatory field?
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:41:01
It's also on the website. There's the first big button for claims, and the second mentions wallet balances.
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:28:28
I'm pretty sure some purchases were made over $100, although some people surely bought under.  
1 BTC claim would now be 0.17 BTC + 0.17 BCH + 800 USD + forks. At current prices that's over 2000+ USD per 1 BTC. That's more than 9%.
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:34:51
About 17% of BTC, plus 17% BCH, plus about 8% in BTC and BCH already sold for fiat, but at higher price. Plus other forks if sold or distributed.
  
You should expect about 25% or more of your original BTC, in total value.
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:08:47
Isn't it normally illegal for businesses to demand IDs, not the individual to provide it? That's usually the case where I'm from. There's no penalties for individuals. So if Japan requires it, it's legal for them to require, and if there's no penalties for individuals in your country, it should be fine to send.
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:29:07
Spamming crap on a thread for people who lost coins? That's pretty low.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:25:37
That seems unlikely considering it is relatively easy to track Bitcoin movements:
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:36:58
Maybe he has some unknown BTC stored away, but investigation has shown that all the BTC was stolen over time and sent directly to admin accounts of BTC-e, with Alexander Vinnik as the likely culprit of all the thefts, or at least direct recipient of stolen funds for laundering.
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:18:27
Remember that hotline is Japan time. It might be very busy too considering there's thousands of creditors and claim process started not long ago.  
Perhaps something is wrong in the form. You'd best triple check everything since it's pretty big. There's a painful lack of error messages on those forms, it's poorly made, which sucks to figure out anything. Editing the info before submitting allowed me to submit without any problem.  
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:31:09
It's combined value of about 25% of original claim in BTC. There's just a portion in fiat, so if prices drop, you could buy more than 25% of your original BTC and if price increases, you could end up being able to buy less.
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:37:41
It's in the hands of Japanese courts and it's a pretty big case with a lot of international attention. Thinking claims won't be paid is ridiculous. There could be problems getting a workable civil rehabilitation plan but that's unlikely.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:00:04
You can't recover password online, so you'd need to file offline if you can't remember password, I'd guess. From the password reset page:  
"Note: Users who have not filed a proof of bankruptcy claim online under the bankruptcy proceedings and who have not completed the set-up of the two-step authentication with the Online Rehabilitation Claim Filing System cannot use this password reset function. Please file a proof of rehabilitation claim with the offline method."
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:38:52
Would likely need an exchange or other entity to handle distribution, so require to find that. If it's the trustee himself, I'm not sure he can send BTC directly, as the normal process is to sell assets and send wire transfer. It needs to be done fairly, so everyone would have to receive BTC at the same time. It might be possible to send BTC directly under civil rehabilitation but nothing is certain.
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:04:22
Kraken is no longer involved. Everyone needs to claim again. Our claims will not be locked to the  50058.12  JPY valuation under civil rehabilitation so we will receive more and Mark will receive nothing.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:23:31
They've followed the lost coins tho and pretty much all went to BTC-e admin accounts. Karpeles did fudge things and misuse bank accounts but it pales in comparison to big theft. It doesn't look like he has anything left. The missing amounts correspond almost exactly to the money that went to BTC-e.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:28:03
Password reset is for those that went through logging and auth forms, after changing to new password. If you don't remember your old password, you need to submit offline according to the website.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:46:41
Try going into the authenticator's settings and syncing time with Google's servers since those codes are time sensitive. That might fix the problem.
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:55:37
That means you have your original password and login, which will work for balance checker.
Try switching email/username for your claim login. The password might be different also if you changed it during bankruptcy procedure.
@_date: 2018-08-26 10:07:19
I've checked a couple posts with potential theft and they all lead to apparent BTC-e addresses with funds moving the day after BTC-e closed. I understand some of the stolen Bitcoin flowed back into MtGox. I've never checked database. Are stolen BTC going back on MtGox ever withdrawn?  If so, where do they go if not BTC-e?  
For example the 150k BTC from 1MTfpmBEPpZtUFy1QQySr5oCaatJfeTD3g I think go on to BTC-e addresses. Many big outputs end up after about 10-20 transactions to transactions that move on 2017-07-28, the day after BTC-e closed. I'm fairly confident that's part of BTC-e's wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:10:10
What would be the point of doing all that in a single day? It would just spike the price and make MtGox users pay too high a price for the current market. They already lost enough.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:07:45
There originally was around 25% of the BTC left. But part of it was sold for fiat.  
You'd get around:
* 17% of BTC amount in BTC
* 17% of BTC amount in BCH
* 8% of BTC amount x 10k USD
* Pro-rata share of other forks proceeds
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:33:00
No, which is the reason two different groups of creditors fought to go from Bankruptcy to Civil Rehabilitation, so the claims were not locked at 50058.12 JPY per BTC with any surplus going to Mark. People can claim BTC for their full value. There won't be a surplus left for Mark.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:55:31
Yeah, bankruptcies are already slow, so a bankruptcy with thousands of creditors from all around the globe is a pain.
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:16:09
Cash claims should be paid in full.
@_date: 2018-08-26 10:13:14
If you read the password reset form, it says it is not to reset your old password, but only for the new password once you've successfully logged and updated, or people who already had a bankruptcy claim.


@_date: 2018-08-27 18:56:23
It's two different password. Balance checker is original password for MtGox. Claim system is the new password you set during bankruptcy claim.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:43:05
I assume the data the trustee got from MtGox's databases when Bankruptcy started.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:45:19
There's about 1/3rd of the coins that were sold by the Trustee for fiat at an average of about 10k. So you should get about 10 BTC + 10 BCH + 50k + other forks. We'll know exactly after all claims are processed and we know the exact amounts of claims.
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:08:36
If it arrived into MtGox's bank accounts, then it should be part of money trustee has for distribution. If there's no record of it in the system however, it would need to be settled with trustee along confirming transfer did reach and wasn't credited. I'm not sure if it's still a possibility after so many years, it might exceed a time limit to make such claim. Or perhaps the money never arrived to MtGox's banks. Who knows.
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:21:35
But the new procedure also means Mark Karpeles won't receive most of the remaining assets. So it is good development. A lot of creditors fought for this. The process is inconvenient however.
@_date: 2018-08-27 23:26:44
Try to submit form, then instead of confirming, click second button to correct info. Then save changes. Then confirm.
@_date: 2018-08-26 23:40:41
Good thing they were out before the collapse then.
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:01:54
From the reset form "Note: Users who have not filed a proof of bankruptcy claim online under the bankruptcy proceedings and who have not completed the set-up of the two-step authentication with the Online Rehabilitation Claim Filing System cannot use this password reset function. Please file a proof of rehabilitation claim with the offline method. "  
You'll have to send a claim offline. But I'm not sure how without being able to check balances since you need to enter the amounts claimed in the offline form.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:06:03
I also had that issue. I switched from using username after that step to using the email and login worked with the email and new password.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:16:00
You need to file again through MtGox website. Kraken is no longer involved and you will not receive a claim if you don't claim now under civil rehabilitation.
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:39:39
They have all the clients info and balances, you need to know your login to submit online, or send documents offline.
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:20:44
I've not managed either. It's only been up for a few hours. Perhaps there is a problem with it.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:43:23
I've not had to try it, but if you still have password but login doesn't work, try using email instead of username to login.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:41:37
Username doesn't change. But you should try the email address for claims login, despite it saying "username/e-mail"
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:08:37
I would not know as I've never heard of that website.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:24:05
Only with the balance checker, but it requires you know your original password. Considering the potential value, you should probably find a way to verify balance and get a claim in.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:20:24
A bubble doesn't always end up in a crash to zero like certain bubbles. Many financial assets grow in bubbles/consolidation periods alternating.
Also, why should it matter if gox goes under? Why wouldn't price stay the same? Plenty of other exchanges and business to do in BTC. Big reaction to the news?
Because it's a bubble. Any bad news makes prices plunge easily when something is overpriced. That's what happen with over-speculation and speculators massive selling on bad news.
Doesn't mean BTC won't keep gaining values over the years.
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:02:50
You need to claim again.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:17:46
If people don't claim, then other claimants will simply get more. There's not enough assets left to repay everyone 100% of their original amount, so people not claiming just means there's more left for other claimants.
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:07:45
Yes, you are required to fill a rehabilitation claim to get distribution. It is a different process than bankruptcy. MtGox moved from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:33:28
It might be hard to get any extra approved as that was the balance you had when MtGox went down. Proving anything would be hard at this point.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:04:25
I think you will need to claim offline then, although I don't know how you could check the balance for amount you need to put in the claim.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:03:05
Hey, that's my desktop wallpaper! Don't steal my inspiration.

"The bitcoin exchange's creditors would have the option of receiving a prorated payment from the 200,000 recovered bitcoins, an estimated 20 percent recovery value on their claims, or receiving the equivalent amount in equity in the new exchange, the paper said."
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:47:39
Bitcoin is a digital currency operating on a decentralized ledger. It allows any user to transfer to anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world their digital currency.
Two sentences. 
It basically does the same as Paypal does, but with less restrictions. The way it works to transfer amounts and account balances properly is completely different however. Explaining either would take a while.
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:19:00
Use an offline wallet. You can still do transaction and stop caring about the online computer.
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:27:51
Yeah, but the problem is that Tether is not just a shitcoin. Bitcoin purchasing power is mostly priced in USD/fiat and a large portion of the USD that currently creates demand for Bitcoin is Tether.
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:54:13
want != demand
If they don't have money to buy, that they want Bitcoin still is irrelevant. They need to have money for demand to still be there. If they cashed out profits to Tether planning to buy back in, most of their money to buy back in is gone. They only have what wasn't in Tether left to buy and demand is reduced.
Tether collapsing would remove a big chunk of fiat available to purchase, thus reduce demand.
@_date: 2018-10-16 01:00:08
Considering the volume on tether based exchanges, yes tether was used to buy Bitcoin. People are rebuying/selling constantly.
And they might have learned not to trust stablecoins, but if they had $1000 and 1000 USDT waiting to rebuy, they can now only rebuy for $1000. That reduces demand.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:16:33
Not directly, but the news, drama and etc could drop the confidence in cryptos by association. Also Tether was huge and accepted as having as much value as real USD. If it imploded, we lose a huge amount of the fiat pressure buying Bitcoin. There's still as much Bitcoins in circulation/people selling Bitcoins, but a huge chunk of crypto users/fans who would also contribute to the opposite buy pressure just lost all their "fiat" to buy with. Tether collapsing would axe 2.5 billion USD of potential demand without reducing Bitcoin offer.  
Tether imploding would not be good.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:01:39
Fill your claim offline, using the form on the website. Complete it, print it, send it by mail. Your claim is worth a few thousands, definitely worth the trouble of filling and mailing the claim.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:30:20
I have no idea as I've never attempted this and I don't know anyone who had that issue. Although I'd assume if you have got the confirmation for the first claim and it was successfully submitted, even if you lose access to claim system for initial claim, it would remain submitted, you just would have problems logging in one of the two claims.  
If I remember right tho, once you're logged in with username, you can enter a different email in your personal info, which might replace original email for logging in.  
I already submitted my claim so I can't really check back on the forms but you should try to go through with second username and see if you can input a different email on the claim form.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:23:43
I think someone did give the documents by hand at the Trustee's office. Tried to find the mail address where to send claims first, but failed to find it, hence going directly to Trustee's firm offices. Although that surprise visit wasn't really appreciated as they have an address receiving the case's mail, it's not supposed to be given to the Trustee's firm but to the Trustee directly through his mail box from what I understand.  
You should get a confirmation a while after they receive the claim. I'd send it by regular mail personal, not snail mail or any express service.

You're assuming price is being manipulated down, when for all we know it could be manipulated upward so people with a large stack can keep selling at this price. (There's a lot of people and swing traders and short/long hunting, so manipulation likely goes both way.)  
I don't think spending less than 100 m would do anything, especially in one go, where people would expect it to be over and a one time thing. It would need to be more and be spread out.

I'm pretty positive about Bitcoin, but clearly most people still are. Doesn't look like we've reached depression.
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:41:39
I mean, it already doesn't behave like a regulated market. Swings are much bigger, faster and overall I guess the value retained even after a crash is pretty good too. I wouldn't chance selling near 6k level, but I still expect price to break 6k support and go down a bit more eventually.

Get a lawyer to help. You can still claim. If you don't have your password you should still be able to claim with your ID. You should actually get close to 25&amp; of value based on how much BTC were claimed so far. That's over $200'000. You don't need to be part of a lawsuit or anything. Just to prove your claim. (there is some lawsuits against them, but that's not what's getting funds. Anyone who had money on Gox has right to claim through Bankruptcy (and now Civil Rehabilition) process.
MtGox has moved from bankruptcy to Civil Rehabilitation. There will be the opportunity to claim in the near future under Civil Rehabilitation.

Yes but that just proves my point. Maybe they are more likely to be **the finder of next block** with less miners, but **it takes more time** between blocks. From the perspective of the miner, he's still getting the same reward per time spent running the machines. He's not earning more for his effort. He still has to compute the same amount of hashes per block found on average and thus spends the same time per block.
That the miner receives a higher proportion of block rewards doesn't make mining instantly easier or more profitable when blocks are found less frequently, which offsets the higher proportion of block rewards found. What you're saying would only be true if average time between blocks stayed at 10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:42:03
And I don't think it's going anywhere near that price either, it doesn't have to retrace 100&amp; But the original chart is disingenuous in its starting point. 
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:37:19
Yes, although it seems it would be easier to start with the knowledge it is not possible to know upfront what the result of the hashing algorithm will be and it is technically possible to get the same hash with different input (although the pool of possibilities is so large, that is nearly impossible.) Therefore, it is purely random and like throwing a dice, which is the most important aspect. If the possibilities pool was smaller and it was impossible to find the same hash twice, then yes, miners dropping out and not finding blocks would indeed make you instantly more profitable in a significant manner by not making you lose progress on already found hashes.
So you can then simplify it to throwing a D100 and if target is to roll under 23 to win a block, and you're able to roll once every 2 seconds, you can immediately see the amount of other people rolling has no bearing on the time and work you spend per reward earned.

Market cycle is a long term cycle, over months or years. There's no good fit for the start of rally other than the low after MtGox's collapse. On the other hand, the problem with unfixed chart is obvious, it starts nowhere near disbelief/hope.
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:33:11
I wouldn't call it "spinning" when the market cycle is supposed to start at bottom of previous rally. The bottom of chart from original post starts almost at the top of the rally. That's far, far past Hope "A recovery is possible" stage.  
Who cares if next rally is now or 2019 or even later. Bitcoin is coming along nicely and tools are being built. That's what matters the most.
@_date: 2019-10-01 01:20:40
If the hashrate drops and price doesn't change, finding a block is just as hard and the reward is the same value as before. It doesn't become easier or more profitable for other miners until retargeting. What determines time between blocks is difficulty vs total hashing power of miners. Until difficulty is adjusted in the retarget, mining remains just as hard.
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:47:08
Nah, I don't think it will actually go anywhere near that. I doubt it will even go under 2k. I'm as big a proponent of Bitcoin as any and been around for a long time, but I think charts and posts have been pretty disingenuous, especially lately. I feel anxiety or denial fits the current market more, with the "this dip is taking longer than expected" attitude or "Bitcoin is still great" posts. Not much talk going on about Bitcoin outside of community. I'm just bracing for a much longer bear period.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:33:40
yeah, but puzzle tends to just get people to ask more about it and be doubtful of how it can secure the bitcoin ledger (who decides the puzzle for each block?, how is the valid chain determined?, etc.) You need the difficulty/hash and hardest chain explanation for that part.
Although yes, I suppose you can try explaining that part away with puzzle at first.

That's... that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works at all. Market caps take into accounts a ton of coins that are no longer in circulation (lost)
Also, a company with 1000 shares at $1 ($1000 market cap)
Sale offers:
10 @ $1
15 @ $1.2
5 @ $1.5
10 @ $2
It would cost you $55.5 to move market cap from $1000 to $2000
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:14:45
Well certainly. I hope anyone putting in money right now put an amount they can afford to lose, such that they can hold out if there's a downturn.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:04:53
Bitcoin is more akin to a company, as it has a valuation and isn't the only player. The underlying technology (blockchain/Internet) isn't tied to Bitcoin/companies. Bitcoin or internet companies have speculators. Internet/Blockchains don't, they're just a new technology.
I'd bet Bitcoin is going to be the winning crypto here, but Bitcoin isn't comparable to the Internet. The whole of crypto/blockchain technology is.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:16:11
Well yeah, but he said it as if 600m was 0.5% of Bitcoin's liquidity/market cap, it's likely much higher. It's not as insignificant as 0.5% of the money being put into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:27:38
Internet companies are worth more now than they were in the dotcom bubble, but there was still a bubble. Nothing says there can't be a couple bubbles along the way. 
I'm fully bullish long term and recommend anyone who bought to hold.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:42:14
If I had to guess, I'd say somewhere between now and 20k. But pinning the right highs and lows is almost impossible. Even the best experts do a poor job of it. Timing the market is a hard thing to do. Investing is better than playing the market pretty much 100pc of the time.

There needs to be something everyone agrees is the one true ledger of transactions since no one can decide which transactions are the definite ones (otherwise people could just sign a message they send coins to person A and also sign another message that they send them to person B. Both A and B claim they are the recipient. Who is right?)
So that's where mining comes in. Miners include transactions in blocks. A block has some info about previous block, a set of new transactions, and a nonce (random number of miner's choice)
All this data is hashed into a string (SHA-256 algorithm.) You basically can't tell what the string will be before doing it. To ensure miners produce 1 block about every 10 minute, there is also difficulty, based on how much mining is already going on. Difficulty is just having your random string require a certain amount of 0 in front of it (eg. 000000001ac6...). If you don't have a string with a low enough value, change nonce and hash again, and hope you get a string that match difficulty or lower. Once you get a hash with low enough value, congratulations, you've mined a new block for these new transactions.
The valid Bitcoin ledger is the chain with the highest difficulty to produce all the block hashes. To produce a different ledger, (and produce one where past transactions are no longer included, for example) you'd have to beat all the other miners combined at producing blocks of high difficulty. This is how mining prevents the ledger to be tempered with, you follow the rules and ignore whatever ledger copies doesn't follow those rules as fakes.
The 2 main rules, to explain them simply, are: 
* The true ledger is the longest, hardest to produce chain of blocks (not just longest as that's trivial to add blocks if no difficulty is accounted for) 
* The blocks of the true ledger must contain transactions with valid digital signatures. (That prevents miners, even if they'd come together, from creating blocks with arbitrary transactions spending other people's funds. Miners don't have the private keys to others' addresses to create valid signatures)
There's not really any way to explain it more simply, at least not without also explaining why mining is done that way. But that's basically how everyone can agree on a decentralized ledger and that it's not being tempered with.

Develop some service/product, there's a lot of users out there and not too many places accepting Bitcoin yet. Anything not yet readily available for Bitcoins will be far easier to get sales going than outside this niche market.

But SatoshiDice is slower and the 1 satoshi transactions are annoying a lot of people it seems.
Plus the 0.0005 fee on small bet kind of kill small bets. You could make thousands of bets with a 0.01 BTC deposit on Coinroll.
It's not that different. You send your betting money once. Play at will, instantly. Finally, you withdraw. It just skips a lot in fees and you don't have to wait between bets (SD now waits 1 confirmation). Seems like a better way to play to me. Although I prefer to avoid gambling games (except poker).

If you're in the UK, those 2 BTC won't last you long enough to make much of a difference at all I think. You'd end up having to survive on charity anyway for your whole 2nd year, wouldn't you? I don't see how you can pull through without a job anyway.

Eh, I guess that makes sense to avoid double-spend attempts.

I think price will be going down for a while... not so sure about that higher price.
@_date: 2013-05-12 04:06:18
Because it raised too much, too fast, during a hype period. I'd expect price to slowly go back to a price somewhere a bit above where it was before prices went ballistic.

Try entering your login multiple time. Sometimes even with the right login info (no "password wrong" error message), it just refreshes on input. 
Also, Ukto is away for a few days (BitFunder). He works closely with WeExchange but I'm not sure he owns it. I can login/withdraw from WeExchange fine.

Every Bitcoin destroyed is a donation to all other holders, so I kind of disagree. Since they got the device for free to review it, makes sense that they'd donate the proceeds to the community by locking what they earn, instead of just keeping the profit.
I'd be more pissed if they got a unit:
- Free
- Before people with a paid order
- AND kept all the proceeds to top it
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:08:25
Well then, situation ain't bad at all it seems if you get grants, other than the immediate situation. I suppose the BTC + some help would do the trick. 
But I'd buy some BTC back once your situation gets better if they're still at this price or lower.
