I bought in on October, how can I claim my Gold and Diamond on coinbase?

9k support is the only thing I am not worry about. We have Vegeta guarding that threshold

I thought it is correct advertisement for all redditors in general?

You recommend Kraken over coinbase/gdax?

I own mostly BTC in my portfolio, enjoying my profit but I think we should promote Litecoin for these small purchase such as Steam. Together they are a good pair.

How about reducing fee first before chasing smart contract?

I am sorry but are you saying we should be proud of the fact that Tx free are more than block reward?

Problem is who will buy the long future of btc
? There is nothing to short against
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:29
If someone is bullish with BTC future why he didnt buy BTC instead? Also even if he is bullish on BTC then the short and long of Future balance each other out. Future cap should not be a fraction of BTC cap anyway

Its called Ripple and it's surging

Those are bots doing price discovery. Without them the exchange wont move as it is
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:34:33
And what is that? You mean paying tax?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:50:41
I don't understand. As I understand if they want to have a short position, someone else have to be in a long position. I agree that they can easily short btc but whp would buy the long position inthis case? People who want btc to go up who actually do not own any btc?
My prediction is this future will become crap nobody cares about
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:06:33
Are u stupid? You mean selling it fir BTC means someone else is buying it with BTC right? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:45:37
Bitconnect is also up today for some reasons while everything else crumbles. Bitconnect best crypto technology ever?

Although your portfolio is great and profitin lot so far. I would own a little bit more Ethereum. Its not profiting much but quite stable, and different use case enough from Bitcoin.

Guys, each exchange' own transaction should be through their database, not on the chain itself. When you move coins to your wallet or to ther exchange then they actually come on chain

I dont care how much he believes in his project. This is consumer scam, phishing out right and need to be reported

Huffingtonpist keeps stuffing all the lies to fit their political agenda 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:37:34

@_date: 2017-11-13 16:12:30
I panciked and sold at 6070,but I bought back at 5700. Does it count as panick still?

Can someone ping Ver to pump and dump again? I bought the dip but it wasn't enough. I want more

I dont understand why we have to be a threat to the economy to be successful. Was gold a threat to the economy. I dont understand this destructive thinking some of us having

Hi . Buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:16:12
I am using gdax and everything is fine so far. This segwit2x drama is not related to them right? Even they are in same umbrella 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:55:42
Americans are losing money because we are hesitant to invest in BTC because of tax rate. While other countries keep accumulate more and more
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:13:16
I think they still own shitton of BTC, pretending they believe in their scam coin

Do Koreans pay tax on bitcoin gain?
