I didn't say Bitcoin needs to evolve, I meant the seed, not the tree and the seed is evolving.

He probably meant to say blockchain.

Totally! Great post! It's a good thing for an overall quality of the market.

You're judging the whole market based on Bitcoin price only? The total market cap has been increasing actually, while Bitcoin losing its market share to other coins. If you look at the total market cap, it's a hell of a bull market.

Fiat has value, value is created by demand, even a piece of rock can have value if there is demand for it. Rai stones is a prime example of that.

I doubt he knows what Haskell means, since he said it was an Erc20 token xD

Bitcoin gave the world the main gift, it's the seed. The seed that needs to evolve, people assume Bitcoin should be the one to start and to execute in the end. But that's not how internet revolution has turned out for example, it evolved into the current form and will continue to evolve.

Yep that's Charles

He doesn't need to do that. He was in the space before anybody even knew Bitcoin. He was on Keiser report before Ethereum came out, explaining and promoting Ethereum which he helped build. He doesn't need to suck up to anybody.

Why should Bitcoin be dominant in the market at all? All it has is a first mover advantage. Its tech is far outdated compared to some altcoins and their potential. Google was unknown tech at some point, while everybody knew AOL. Things changed very quickly and look at Google and AOL now.

Maybe understand where the industry is headed, do your research. Don't just buy because it's growing, there are people who take out loans to buy Bitcoin because it grew so much, a lot of people don't even know the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum, to sleep at night you gotta be able to understand what you invested in and why, are you just speculating or are you invested long term in something you see potential in.

There's Ethereum for that as well, which has lower fees and much faster to transfer. Some exchanges like Binance for example provide their own coin for trading pairs and give great deals on trading fees if you use their coin.

I don't know man, I'm using Binance and happy with it. Can't even imagine using something as slow and unresponsive as Coinbase, I look at my first exchange (kraken) as a true dinosaur lol.

There are far superior technology in many altcoins, that are far more promising than first generation blockchain like BTC, BCH and LTC, even second generation blockchain like Ethereum is far behind. I kid you not it's like two separate worlds out there. Many altcoin investors look at BTC like it's already extinct, even though they pair with BTC and ETH. 
You should look into many of them, like Cardano, Dash, IOTA, Monero etc.

There you go! The power of people to teach them a lesson and maybe even set an example for others!
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:13:27
Why BCH? There really are far superior alternatives than that if one decides to switch to altcoins. There are plenty of great projects out there.

Bitcoin would have been unstoppable if it was usable. Just like Mosaic was eventually replaced by Chrome and others. It's evolution, there's no reason to blame anybody, Bitcoin is losing market share to new generation, there's plenty of opportunities in this space. The brilliance of Satoshi that he gave the world the seed, does not mean the seed should not grow and evolve.

You should research Cardano, to me personally it's the only project that has true world wide potential. There's a reason they worked 2 years behind the scenes on this. Check this out:
