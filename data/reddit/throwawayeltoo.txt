They do the same psychological tricks as our vendors. Some things are 6,999 yen, not 7000. But when writing/talking, I (and others) usually round up/down. I'd probably say "about 48k" instead of 47654 Satoshi, and I think most other people would, too.
I have to admit I never really paid too close attention when I was in Japan. They do like their 'man' (10k), 'sen' (1k) and so on, though, so their language seems to make it even easier than ours to keep it short.

Fraudulent channel closes might still be punishable through additional measurements, cdecker mentioned that in the recent thread about eltoo (No details yet, though). The system does not automatically include it as part of how it functions, though, as it isn't a necessary part of the update mechanism/eltoo.
Another advantage you didn't name is that LN channels between multiple parties are now much easier to setup because not as many states need to be stored/not as many penalty transactions need to be created and signed. This probably allows for even better/easier channel factories which could use a similar system as eltoo for LN.

Sounds reasonable, thanks for the writeup. As it is, I don't grasp how to add the harsher penalties on top of eltoo, but I figure we will learn soon enough.

I'd rather deal with somewhat huge numbers for a while because we are using Satoshi, than getting the smaller numbers I'm used to at the cost of also needing an additional denominator for what we know as cents for $. Especially because we don't really know how fast the price will rise if Bitcoin is actually used by everybody, and because changing monetary denominators is not without effort. Some people still don't think in Euro, but in Lira or Deutsche Mark or Crona.
At $100k per Bitcoin, a latte would be about 4000 satoshi, at $1Mio it'd be about 400. That's very similar to the Yen, and Bitcoin is popular in Japan. It's also not a big problem to say "321 million satoshi" for a car right now, or "40k" for a latte. At least compared to "3 point 21 bits" or whatever you'd say in the case that Bitcoin's price reaches levels that would save some crypto icon's member.

I do that, too. Even without a currency word between 3 and 21. As long as it is clear from the context. 
There's a problem with poorer countries, though. If we say 3 - 21 for a coffee, stuff in a poor country might be consistently priced below a whole bit, making it awkward to talk about it, especially if there's another zero and if we don't have a name for less than a bit like with dollar and cent.
Using "Satoshi" from the start doesn't really have this problem as long as Bitcoin doesn't exceed even our wildest expectations. And even if it does that, it will give us some time to adapt, I hope.
