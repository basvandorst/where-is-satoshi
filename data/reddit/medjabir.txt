Media and mainstream, I was on BTC's train when the fees were low, but got out months ago and switched to other coins.
Newbies at Coinbase don't have a clue about BTC problems, they are in it just for the profit, a store of value.
This might be rewarding in the short run, but in the long term, I don't see it going anywhere, unless they found a solution to scale it.
If anyone here be thinking about long term goals of any coin, first you should look at the use case, and Bitcoin right now doesn't have any.

If Bitcoin worth a lot more in the future? Don't you think you won't need fiat to buy stuff ? by then, BTC will be accepted everywhere. It will dominate, and I don't mind getting rich while it happens.
If you're big on freedom, consider Monero, I don't think Bitcoin will ensure freedom for you.
P.S: The post was meant to discuss the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin. Nothing more...

Haha It's alright made.. I believe that too .. It will dominate sooner or later, and we won't need fiat anymore.

We don't know for sure. But I kinda feel the same thing..

I know, I just want to turn the salty bear market and spread hope ... Because let's be frank, if it's not lucrative and tempting then it won't live.
