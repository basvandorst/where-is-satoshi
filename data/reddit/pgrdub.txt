They should just pay someone to live tweet price quotes with corresponding emojis... or even better, just repost all the memes

Cracks me up.  Every article rants about some price range and it’s like “old news! That was an hour ago!” lol

You sure did make a lot of assumptions about complete strangers, mrbiggles.   I personally disagree with several of your points, particularly the idea that bitcoin can be (or is being) regulated.  
I have followed bitcoin for years and in May ‘17, I finally pulled the trigger and made a sensible investment.  I invested ~$5k USD, which was about 1.5% of my total investment exposure (401k, personal stock/savings accounts, not counting my home or my wife’s 401k).  The $5k I invested was already being used for speculative , high risk investing (it was in Fannie Mae stock, which I sold to get into crypto) 
I’m happy to report that my crypto portfolio, consisting of BTC, XRP, ETH, LTC, and BCH (from the fork), is now sitting at over $41k USD.  
The ONLY risk I face at this point if cryptos crash and burn is the feeling of wishing I’d have sold at the top.
So, while I appreciate your opinion, maybe you should take it over to a thread about some loud mouthed kid who has opened and maxed out credit cards to jump into crypto investing.  
While on this thread, maybe chill the f out and laugh at a light-hearted and funny take on how the mainstream media reports on crypto coins.  
Cheers and hope you’re having a great holiday season!
Also, for anyone interested, here’s an interesting set of opinions on BTC:
