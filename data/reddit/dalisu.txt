I love the idea of comparing in BTC, but my day-to-day purchases and earnings are in USD so of course I’m much more familiar with it and can instantly grasp its current value. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:33:56
You just saved me hours of reading. Thank you.

Have you seen Money As Debt on YouTube?

Where's the daily discussion? Anyway, Happy New Year! Glad to see these numbers going up again.

I bought the dip...at 15,000. Don't have any spare fiat left. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:14:23
Beanie Babies for the win!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:15:36
Yep. We’re all buying back in at zero.

What are Tethers?
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:04:52
How do you do this?  I’m using modular face but I don’t know how to add BTC.

Can Bob set up a payment channel with thousands of merchants and become the Bitcoin Bank of Bob, and charge Alice a fee to connect with him? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:04:54
And we’ll never know how many suicides were prevented by bitcoin to balance it out.

What's this about 2040?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:40:16
I like this idea. Once people own just a little bit, they start paying attention and realize how much they want more.  
It's like offering a free sample of crack. Just enough to get 'em started.

How do I transfer my BCC (BCH) to BTC in Bittrex?
I have some Bcash I'd like to trade in for Bitcoin. How do I go about it? Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:50:21
What is a whale?  I keep seeing that. Is it just someone who has a lot of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:31:33
It’d be great it the card issuer would keep track of it and keep a running tally of capita gains and losses for the year. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:44:40
I just check every hour, on the hour, and every minute in between. I hodl, but the curiosity kills me. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:05:16
Please tell us about that time. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:07:59
The night Coinbase got in bed with Bcash my wife wanted to know why I so desperately wanted to be at the computer—eventually I had to tell her. 
She asks, “Is it real money.”
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:00:37
What do we think that will mean for us? What do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:52
It's hard when everything leftover goes to crypto.

A reluctant upvote for your sage wisdom.

Supply went to zero, not price.

$15,700 feels so low after yesterday--even though we're still up $4,700 for the week. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:35
Me too. Trying to buy, won't let me. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:05:52
Did you see this clip yet? Really highlights the feeling of the day.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:59:05
It's a gif of of two lines with someone waiting in one line, but sees the other line getting shorter so he switches, again, and again, and again, getting further behind every time he makes the switch until eventually he's too late to be served.

My Uncle Sam is such a dick. He hates bitcoin but still demands a cut of the profits if I ever cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:54
Yeah. While I'm at my desk instead of out with the family would have nice. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:06:53

u/silky_malone, can you go pee again?

Shhh..You're gonna crash the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:08:45
Did you do it yet? Go for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:26
Thank you.

I tried sending money to my mother in law to buy a new fridge.  They asked all kinds of questions—how long I’d been married, had I ever met my MIL, why does she need a new fridge. When I told them I don’t want to answer any more questions they hung up and canceled my transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:13:44
And this is way more entertaining than the movies. I've been glued to my screen all week!
(Although the rise was certainly more thrilling than the fall.)

Can someone explain what CBOE means. What is happening Sunday?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:32:08
Who do you recommend listening to on YouTube? Are there any bitcoin leaders in that space?  Thank you.

But a bird in hand is not with a million in a bush. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:37:57
I had zero interest in litecoin but my friend talked me into putting just $30 in a few months ago. I made it all back and then a lot more. I still  don't have confidence in it long term, but I can skim the top of it off to fund my bitcoin addiction. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:45:10
Do you have it displayed on the home screen? If so, how do you do this?I have Apple Watch and would love to get that going. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:39:37
Because it’s going to the moon!

This rite of passage is keeping new people from joining and keeping its value lower than it could be. 
It’s time for someone to make it simple.

Would you mind explaining how you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:32
Yep. I was trying to buy at 17,000 couldn't get any by the time I could get back in had risen to 19,000 and dropped to almost 15,000. Crazy day!

I have multiple "moons." I pull out 10% at a time to put in a more traditional investment.

In case the comment disappears. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:29:52
If I cash out less than I put in do I still owe tax for this year? For example, I buy $500 usd of Bitcoin, it rises in value, and I withdraw $100 Usd, leaving the rest of the bitcoin alone is that $100 still taxable?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:43:58
I also bought a bunch at 19,000--we were headed for the moon!
Anyway, I bought again tonight. But I'm gonna have to sit out the next sale. I'm out of spare cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:45
Would you please explain this. It seems important but I don't know what it means. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:36:55
Because it doesn't cost anything to believe it.
I can click the upvote button and move on with my life. If it turns out he was lying, I'm still ok.

I love the he had to put the cash in twice, representing just how hard it was to figure out bitcoin in the first place--then it spits out the chump change. Hilarious!
